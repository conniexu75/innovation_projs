https://openalex.org/W2149871164,"The first cleavage of C. elegans is asymmetric, generating daughter cells with different sizes, cytoplasmic components, and fates. Mutations in the par-1 gene disrupt this asymmetry. We report here that par-1 encodes a putative Ser/Thr kinase with similarity to kinases from yeasts and mammals. Two strong alleles have mutations in the kinase domain, suggesting that kinase activity is essential for par-1 function. PAR-1 protein is localized to the posterior periphery of the zygote and is distributed in a polar fashion preceding the asymmetric divisions of the germline lineage. Because PAR-1 distribution in the germline correlates with the distribution of germline-specific P granules, it is possible that PAR-1 functions in germline development as well as in establishing embryonic polarity."
https://openalex.org/W1550364580,"Recent in situ hybridization studies had demonstrated a strong increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in the hyperproliferative epithelium during wound healing. To determine potential mediators of VEGF induction during this process, we analyzed the regulation of VEGF expression in cultured human keratinocytes. We found a large induction of VEGF expression upon treatment of quiescent cells with serum, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-β1, keratinocyte growth factor, or the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, respectively. Since all these factors are present at the wound site during the early phase of wound healing, they might also be responsible for VEGF induction after cutaneous injury. To determine the importance of increased VEGF production for wound repair, we compared the time course of VEGF mRNA expression during wound healing of healthy control mice with the kinetics of VEGF expression during skin repair of genetically diabetic db/db mice which are characterized by impaired wound healing. In normal mice we found elevated VEGF mRNA levels during the period when granulation tissue formation occurs. In contrast, VEGF mRNA levels even declined during this period in db/db mice, suggesting that a defect in VEGF regulation might be associated with wound healing disorders.

During cutaneous wound repair, new tissue formation starts with re-epithelialization and is followed by granulation tissue formation. The latter process encompasses macrophage accumulation, fibroblast ingrowth, matrix deposition, and angiogenesis (1Clark R.A.F. Goldsmith L.A. Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of the Skin. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 576-601Google Scholar). These events are stimulated in part by a number of mitogens and chemotactic factors. The soluble factors that stimulate angiogenesis in wound repair have not been identified, however, several growth factors which are present in a wound have been shown to be mitogenic for endothelial cells in vitro and to be angiogenic in several in vivo assays. These include different members of the fibroblast growth factor family (for review, see Refs. 2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M.

Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been shown to be angiogenic in vivo, although they inhibit endothelial cell growth in vitro(7Frater-Schröder M.

Nature. 1987; 329: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The most recently discovered endothelial cell growth factor is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein with structural homology to platelet-derived growth factor. Four different human isoforms, VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206, have been isolated from various sources and arise by alternative splicing of mRNA (12Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). VEGF is a highly specific mitogen for endothelial cells in vitro, and it has angiogenic properties in vivo(13Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V Ferrara N.

Since angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability are characteristic features of wound healing (17Brown L.F. Van de Water L. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 130: 455-461PubMed Google Scholar), VEGF may play an important role in tissue repair. Recently, Brown et al.(18Brown L.F. Yeo K.-T. Berse B. Yeo T.-K. Senger D.R. Dvorak H.F. Van de Water L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) demonstrated expression of VEGF mRNA in proliferating keratinocytes of the newly formed epithelium during wound healing. In contrast, expression of one of the receptors for VEGF (flt-1) (19deVries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar) was found to be up-regulated in the sprouting blood vessels at the wound edge and in endothelial cells of the granulation tissue (20Peters K.G. deVries C. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that keratinocyte-derived VEGF stimulates angiogenesis during wound healing in a paracrine manner. In this study we have identified potential mediators of VEGF mRNA induction after injury. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a defect in VEGF regulation during wound healing in genetically diabetic db/db mice which are characterized by a severe delay in skin repair (21Coleman D.L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aberrant expression pattern of VEGF mRNA during skin repair in db/db mice suggests that a defect in VEGF regulation might be associated with the wound healing abnormalities seen in these animals. epidermal growth factor transforming growth factor-β tumor necrosis factor-α vascular endothelial growth factor base pair(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum keratinocyte growth factor interleukin. Balb/c mice were obtained from the animal care facility of the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried. C57BL/KsJ-db/m mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice were chosen because they exhibit characteristics similar to those of human adult onset diabetes as a result of a single autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 4. Only the homozygous animals develop diabetes (21Coleman D.L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The animals were 8-12 weeks of age at the start of the experiments. The animal care facility was maintained by professionals who followed federal guidelines, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Utilization Committee or by the Local Government of Bavaria (permission number 211-2531-16/93). Two independent wound healing experiments were performed with control mice and diabetic mice, respectively. For every experiment 23 animals were anesthetized under methoxyflurane (Metofane R, Priman-Moore, Inc). The animals' backs were shaved and wiped with 30% isopropyl alcohol, and six full-thickness wounds (6 mm diameter, 3-4 mm apart) were made on 20 mice/experiment by excising the skin and panniculus carnosus. The wounds were allowed to dry in order to form a scab. Animals were sacrificed with pentobarbital overdose, and wounds from four animals were harvested at 1, 3, 5, 7, or 13 days after wounding. An area of 7 mm in diameter which includes the complete epithelial margins was excised at each time point. A similar amount of skin from the backs of three non-wounded animals was used as a control. Wound tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C until used for RNA isolation. Isolation of total cellular RNA and RNase protection analysis were performed as recently described (22Werner S. Peters K.G. Longaker M.T. Fuller-Pace F. Banda M. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The increase in VEGF mRNA levels was quantitated by laser scanning densitometry of the autoradiograms. All experiments were repeated with a different set of RNAs from an independent experiment. A 316-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 139-455 of the murine VEGF120 cDNA (23Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a 159-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 339-498 of human VEGF121 cDNA (24Weindel K. Marme D. Weich H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were used as templates. The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (25Boukamp P. Petrusevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar) was used for all tissue culture experiments. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For VEGF induction experiments, they were grown to confluence without changing the medium and rendered quiescent by a 16-h incubation in serum-free DMEM. Cells were then incubated for varying periods in fresh DMEM containing serum, purified growth factors, or cytokines. Aliquots of cells were harvested before and at different time points after treatment with these reagents and used for RNA isolation. FCS and DMEM were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., growth factors and cytokines were from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, and cycloheximide was from Sigma. 5 ml of DMEM/10-cm Petri dish were conditioned by quiescent HaCaT cells in the presence or absence of 10% FCS. After 8 h the conditioned medium from six Petri dishes was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 revolutions/min to remove cell debris. Heparin-binding proteins were precipitated from the supernatant with 120 μl of heparin-Sepharose (1:1 slurry) overnight at 4°C. Heparin-Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 M NaCl. Heparin-Sepharose-bound proteins were extracted by a 5-min incubation in Laemmli sample buffer at 95°C and separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, VEGF proteins were detected using a polyclonal antiserum directed against VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an alkaline phosphatase detection system (Promega). Non-conditioned medium containing 10% FCS was used as a control. To analyze the presence of VEGF proteins in the cell lysate, serum-treated and control cultures from six 10-cm Petri dishes were scraped into 0.1 M NaPO4, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 2 M NaCl, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was precipitated, and extracts were diluted to a final concentration of 0.3 M NaCl. VEGF proteins were bound to heparin-Sepharose (120 μl) overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed with 0.5 M NaPO4, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl. Sepharose-bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described above. For immunoprecipitation of VEGF proteins, conditioned medium and control medium was prepared as described above. VEGF-specific proteins were precipitated with a polyclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of VEGF (Genzyme) and protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times with TNTG buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein A-Sepharose-bound proteins were eluted by a 5-min incubation at 95°C in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with the same VEGF antibody. Recently Brown et al.(18Brown L.F. Yeo K.-T. Berse B. Yeo T.-K. Senger D.R. Dvorak H.F. Van de Water L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) demonstrated expression of VEGF mRNA in proliferating keratinocytes during wound healing by in situ hybridization. To identify potential mediators of VEGF induction in keratinocytes during wound healing, we have studied the regulation of VEGF induction in vitro in cultured human keratinocytes. Since local hemorrhage is one of the initial events after skin injury, we have first tested the potency of serum to stimulate VEGF expression. As shown in Fig. 1A, low levels of VEGF mRNA were detected in quiescent keratinocytes. Upon addition of 10% FCS, a large induction of VEGF mRNA expression was observed. Within 90 min after serum stimulation, VEGF mRNA levels were 20-fold higher compared to the basal level. The effect of serum on VEGF mRNA expression was long lasting, and elevated VEGF mRNA levels were still observed 8 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 1A). 24 h after serum addition VEGF mRNA levels finally returned to the basal level (data not shown). Four different VEGF proteins have recently been identified in vitro which arise from differential splicing in the 3′-end of VEGF mRNA (12Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The hybridization probe which we used for our protection assay experiments corresponds to the 3′-end of the shortest form of VEGF (VEGF121), and thus enabled us to distinguish between this form of VEGF mRNA and longer forms (Fig. 1B). A protected fragment corresponding to the complete coding sequence of the hybridization probe is generated by mRNA encoding VEGF121 (upper band in Fig. 1A), whereas two shorter protected fragments are generated by mRNAs encoding longer variants of VEGF (lower bands in Fig. 1A). mRNAs encoding VEGF121 and other splice variants were induced to a similar extent (Fig. 1A). To analyze whether induction of VEGF mRNA expression correlates with the induction of immunoreactive VEGF protein, conditioned medium was prepared from serum-treated and non-treated keratinocytes and analyzed for the presence of VEGF proteins. Because of the kinetics of VEGF induction at the mRNA level, the conditioned medium was harvested after 8 h. Heparin-binding proteins were enriched by their capacity to bind to heparin-Sepharose and subsequently analyzed for the presence of VEGF protein by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 1C, two major forms of VEGF with estimated molecular masses of 22 and 24 kDa were detected in conditioned medium from serum-stimulated cells. The size of these proteins correlates with the known molecular sizes of the VEGF gene products. VEGF variants of identical size were also detected by immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting with a different VEGF antibody (data not shown). In contrast, the 34-kDa protein (Fig. 1C) was not detected after immunoprecipitation, suggesting that it is not a VEGF-specific protein. To exclude the possibility that the VEGF-specific proteins in conditioned medium from serum-stimulated cells result from serum-derived VEGF, non-conditioned medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was used as a control. VEGF-specific proteins of 22 and 24 kDa were also detected in the lysate of serum-treated cells but not in control cells (data not shown), suggesting that these proteins are partially retained in the cytoplasm. Taken together these data demonstrate that induction of VEGF mRNA by serum also correlates with induction of VEGF protein. To identify the serum components which are responsible for the stimulatory effect on VEGF expression, we analyzed the effect of purified serum growth factors on VEGF expression. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, epidermal growth factor was a potent inducer of VEGF mRNA expression and increased VEGF mRNA levels 20-fold within 90 min, 50-fold within 5 h, and 60-fold within 8 h. EGF-induced VEGF expression was long lasting, and high levels of VEGF mRNA were still observed 24 h after addition of EGF. In contrast, the major mitogen in platelets, platelet-derived growth factor BB, had no effect on VEGF mRNA levels (data not shown), although other genes are regulated in these cells by platelet-derived growth factor,2( 2G. Hübner, unpublished data.) demonstrating their general responsiveness to platelet-derived growth factor. In addition to the keratinocyte mitogen EGF, TGF-β1, which is a potent inhibitor of keratinocyte proliferation (26Shipley G.D. Pittelkow M.R. Wille J.J. Scott R.E. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2068-2071PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kopan R. Traska G. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 28Coffey R.J.J. Bascom C.C. Sipes N.J. Graves-Deal R. Weissman B.E. Moses H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) also increased VEGF mRNA levels 16-fold within 2 h (Fig. 2, A and C). The kinetics of TGF-β1-induced VEGF expression was different from the kinetics observed with EGF. Whereas EGF-induced VEGF expression was long lasting, TGFβ increased VEGF mRNA levels only transiently, and 5 h after addition of the growth factor, VEGF expression levels had significantly declined. Recently, we demonstrated a large induction of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) expression in the dermis during wound healing (22Werner S. Peters K.G. Longaker M.T. Fuller-Pace F. Banda M. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Since KGF is a potent mitogen for keratinocytes (29Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), this finding suggested that dermally derived KGF stimulates wound reepithelialization in a paracrine manner. To assess whether KGF-induced keratinocyte proliferation is accompanied by induction of VEGF mRNA in keratinocytes, we analyzed the effect of purified KGF on VEGF expression. VEGF mRNA expression was rapidly induced by KGF and slightly elevated VEGF mRNA levels were detected as early as 15 min after addition of KGF (data not shown). Within 30 min after KGF stimulation, VEGF mRNA levels were already 5-fold higher compared to the basal level and a 8-10-fold induction of VEGF mRNA expression was found within 2 h after exposure to KGF (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar to EGF-induced VEGF expression, high levels of VEGF mRNA were observed for at least 8 h after addition of KGF (Fig. 4). Induction of VEGF expression by KGF occurred in a dose-dependent manner. A maximal response was obtained with 10 ng/ml KGF, but even at a very low concentration of KGF (0.4 ng/ml) induction of VEGF could be detected (Fig. 3, A and C).Figure 4:VEGF induction by KGF is independent of de novo protein synthesis. Serum-starved keratinocytes were stimulated for different time periods with 10 ng/ml KGF in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide as indicated. Since cycloheximide was dissolved in 5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), medium containing 5 μl of the solvent was used as a control. 30 μg of total cellular RNA from these cells were analyzed by RNase protection analysis for the expression of VEGF mRNA. VEGF expression in cells treated with 20% FCS is shown for comparison. 50 μg of tRNA were used as a negative control. 1000 counts/min of the hybridization probe were used as a size marker (A). The degree of VEGF mRNA induction after 8 h as assessed by laser scanning densitometry of the autoradiogram is shown schematically in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rapid induction of VEGF expression by KGF suggested that VEGF induction could occur in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. To address this question, the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the addition of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide resulted in a significant superinduction of VEGF mRNA expression. In contrast, serum-induced expression of VEGF protein was completely abolished, demonstrating that protein synthesis was indeed inhibited (data not shown). The induction of VEGF gene expression in the presence of cycloheximide shows that VEGF gene activation is independent of de novo protein synthesis. Therefore, the gene encoding VEGF is a member of the growing family of primary response genes. Since the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes followed by macrophages is another early event in wound repair, we tested the ability of cytokines produced by these cells to induce VEGF mRNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5, TNF-α, which inhibits keratinocyte growth in vitro(30Symington F.W. I. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 798-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is a very potent activator of VEGF expression and a 50-fold stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression was observed within 2 h after addition of 300 units/ml TNF-α to keratinocytes. In contrast, IL-1β, which is mitogenic for keratinocytes (31Sauder D.N. Prager-Stanulis B.M. Gilchrest B.A. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1988; 80: 71-76Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was much less efficient and increased VEGF mRNA levels less than 5-fold. Similar to TGF-β1-induced VEGF expression, VEGF mRNA induction by these cytokines was only transient, and 5 h after cytokine stimulation, VEGF expression levels had significantly declined. Interleukin-6, which like IL-1 is also mitogenic for keratinocytes (32Grossman R.M. Krueger J. Yourish D. Granelli-Piperno A. Murphy D.P. May L.T. Kupper T.S. Sehgal P.B. Gottlieb A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6367-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), had no effect on VEGF expression in these cells (data not shown). To further determine the role of VEGF induction for normal wound repair, we compared the time course of VEGF expression during wound healing of db/db mice and healthy control mice. For this purpose we isolated RNA from excisional full thickness wounds at different intervals after wounding and performed RNase protection assays. 24 wounds from the backs of four mice were excised for each time point and used for RNA isolation. Non-wounded back skin from the same area was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 6A, two different protected fragments were obtained with RNA from normal and wounded skin, corresponding to differerent forms of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 6C). The longer protected fragment which corresponds to the complete coding sequence of the probe is generated by mRNA encoding the shortest form of murine VEGF (VEGF120), whereas the shorter protected fragment is generated by mRNA encoding longer forms of VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6A, a strong induction of VEGF mRNA expression was observed within 24 h after injury and highest VEGF mRNA levels were found between day 3 and 7 after injury. Since this is the period of granulation tissue formation, our data suggest that induction of VEGF might play a role in wound angiogenesis. In non-wounded skin of db/db mice, VEGF mRNA levels were significantly higher compared to skin of control mice (Fig. 6B) However, after an initial increase in VEGF mRNA levels within 24 h after injury, expression levels dramatically declined during the time when granulation tissue formation normally occurs and at day 5 after injury, VEGF mRNA expression was hardly detectable (Fig. 6B). This finding demonstrates that the wound healing defect seen in these animals is associated with reduced VEGF expression during the time when wound angiogenesis normally occurs. Recent in situ hybridization experiments had demonstrated expression of VEGF and one of its receptors, flt-1(19deVries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar), during wound healing. Highest levels of VEGF mRNA were detected in keratinocytes at the wound edge and in keratinocytes that migrated to cover the wound surface (18Brown L.F. Yeo K.-T. Berse B. Yeo T.-K. Senger D.R. Dvorak H.F. Van de Water L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Besides a few mononuclear cells, VEGF expression was not found in other cell types of the wound. This finding suggested an important role of keratinocytes in wound angiogenesis. Since VEGF is highly specific for endothelial cells it is likely to act in a paracrine manner on the sprouting capillaries of the wound edge and the granulation tissue. The exclusive detection of flt-1 in these cells (20Peters K.G. deVries C. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. Since keratinocytes are the major source of VEGF in the wound, the identification of the factors which regulate VEGF expression in these cells seems to be of particular importance. We have therefore studied the regulation of VEGF expression in vitro in cultured keratinocytes. Similar to the in vivo situation, quiescent keratinocytes in culture expressed only low levels of VEGF mRNA. Due to the rapid induction of VEGF expression in vivo(18Brown L.F. Yeo K.-T. Berse B. Yeo T.-K. Senger D.R. Dvorak H.F. Van de Water L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), we speculated that serum growth factors which are released upon hemorrhage might be able to stimulate VEGF gene expression. Our data demonstrate that VEGF mRNA and also protein expression are indeed rapidly induced by serum in vitro. The most potent activator of VEGF expression was EGF which is a major mitogen for keratinocytes (33Rheinwald J.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 21A: 229-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Barrandon Y. Green H. Cell. 1987; 50: 1131-1137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGF induces angiogenesis in vivo(5Schreiber A.B. Winkler M.E. Derynck R. Science. 1986; 232: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding suggests that the angiogenic effect of this growth factor might be a combination of a direct effect on endothelial cells and an indirect effect which is based on the induction of VEGF expression in keratinocytes. A similar mechanism has also been postulated for the role of EGF-induced tumor angiogenesis in gliomas (35Goldman C.K. Kim J. Wong W.-L. King V. Brock T. Gillespie G.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In addition to EGF, TGF-β1 was also able to induce VEGF gene expression, although this factor has been shown to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation. Thus, induction of VEGF gene expression in keratinocytes is not necessarily associated with stimulation of mitogenesis. Since large amounts of TGF-β1 are released from platelets upon injury, this factor might significantly contribute to the early induction of VEGF expression after wounding. Our hypothesis that serum-derived factors, which are released upon local wound hemorrhage, could be responsible for the induction of VEGF gene expression during wound healing does explain the early onset of this process upon injury, but it does not provide an explanation for the sustained expression of high levels of VEGF mRNA during wound healing. Therefore, other sources of VEGF-inducing factors could be present in the wound tissue. KGF is one of the factors which might be responsible for the prolonged induction of VEGF expression after injury. However, transgenic mice which express a dominant-negative KGF receptor in basal keratinocytes of the epidermis and therefore do not respond to KGF (36Werner S. Smola H. Liao X. Longaker M.T. Krieg T. Hofschneider P.H. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) have normal levels of VEGF mRNA in nonwounded and wounded skin (data not shown). Thus, although KGF might normally contribute to the induction of VEGF expression during wound healing, a lack of KGF expression or responsiveness does not reduce VEGF expression, suggesting that other factors can compensate. Another possible source of VEGF-inducing factors are mononuclear cells. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes represent a first line of defense against bacteria and parasites and are the predominant cell type of the early inflammatory response during repair. Apart from phagocytosing particles and releasing toxic metabolites and enzymes, they have also been shown to produce a series of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (37Lord P.C.W.

Activated macrophages subsequently initiate granulation tissue formation and remain present in the wound tissue even beyond the initial inflammatory phase (1Clark R.A.F. Goldsmith L.A. Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of the Skin. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 576-601Google Scholar, 45Wong H.L. Wahl S.M. Zembala M. Asherson G.L. Human Monocytes. Academic Press, New York1989: 383-394Google Scholar). The activation of the VEGF gene in keratinocytes by IL-1β and particularly by TNF-α suggests that these cytokines, together with macrophage-derived growth factors, might significantly contribute to the long lasting high expression levels of VEGF during skin repair. The large induction of VEGF mRNA expression by TNF-α is of major biological importance since it could provide an explanation for the potent angiogenic effect of this cytokine in vivo(11Leibovich S.J. Polverini P.J. Shepard H.M. Wiseman D.M. Shively V. Nuseir M. Nature. 1987; 329: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), a phenomenon which has not been completely understood so far. Thus, it seems possible that TNF-α-stimulated induction of VEGF in other surrounding cell types might indirectly stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. In summary, we have identified several positive regulators of VEGF gene expression in keratinocytes, whereby EGF, TGF-β1, KGF, and TNF-α were the most potent inducers. Since these growth factors and cytokines are present in the wound during the early phase of skin repair, a combination of these factors might also be responsible for VEGF induction in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that the initial stimulation is caused by serum growth factors which are released upon wound hemorrhage. The expression of some of these factors and also of TNF-α by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and wound macrophages, as well as high levels of KGF present in the wound, might further enhance and sustain the high expression levels of VEGF. The up-regulation of VEGF and its receptor during wound repair suggests an important role of this growth factor in wound angiogenesis. To analyze the importance of a correct regulation of VEGF expression for wound healing, we compared the time course of VEGF expression during wound healing of healthy control mice and genetically diabetic db/db mice. The latter are characterized by a severe delay in wound healing and have been widely used as a model for wound healing disorders (21Coleman D.L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the wound healing defect in these animals is still not completely understood. It has been speculated that a reduced and delayed infiltration of macrophages might contribute to the wound healing abnormalities (46Greenhalgh D.G. Sprugel K.H. Murray M.J. Ross R. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Since macrophages are an important source of growth factors and cytokines, expression of other mitogens in the wound which are positively regulated by macrophage-derived cytokines might be reduced. This has already been demonstrated for KGF expression which is highly induced in cultured fibroblasts by macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines (47Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Brauchle M. Angermeyer K. Hübner G. Werner S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3199-3204PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, induction of KGF expression after injury has been shown to be significantly reduced and delayed in db/db mice (49Werner S. Breeden M. Hübner G. Greenhalgh D. Longaker M.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 469-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and we now demonstrate a similar effect for VEGF. In healthy control mice, a significant induction of VEGF expression was observed within 24 h after injury. Expression levels were high during the period when granulation tissue formation normally occurs and only returned to the basal level after completion of skin repair. In contrast, VEGF mRNA levels declined in db/db mice within 3 days after injury, and only low levels of VEGF transcripts were present during the period when wound angiogenesis normally occurs. This finding demonstrates that the wound healing defect in these animals is associated with reduced levels of VEGF during skin repair, suggesting that up-regulation of VEGF expression is essential for normal wound healing. Furthermore, our results suggest that application of exogenous VEGF might have a beneficial effect on wound healing in db/db mice, especially in combination with other growth factors which stimulate different cell types in the wound.

https://openalex.org/W2003928686,"Heterodimerization is a common paradigm among eukaryotic transcription factors. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) serves as a common heterodimerization partner for several nuclear receptors, including the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR). This raises the question as to whether these complexes possess dual hormonal responsiveness. We devised a strategy to examine the transcriptional properties of each receptor individually or when tethered to a heterodimeric partner. We find that the intrinsic binding properties of RXR are masked in T3R-RXR and RAR-RXR heterodimers. In contrast, RXR is active as a non-DNA-binding cofactor with the NGFI-B/Nurr1 orphan receptors. Heterodimerization of RXR with constitutively active NGFI-B/Nurr1 creates a novel hormone-dependent complex. These findings suggest that allosteric interactions among heterodimers create complexes with unique properties. We suggest that allostery is a critical feature underlying the generation of diversity in hormone response networks."

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All of the ERK kinases are activated by phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr residues within a TXY phosphorylation motif, where “X” can be Glu, Pro, or Gly (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). There are also a growing number of MEKs (15Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J.

MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2 in a mitogenesis or differentiation response; MEK3 and p38 show coordinate activation in the cytokine response, as do MEK4 (i.e. SEK1, the murine homolog of MEK4) and the JNKs in the stress response.

We have identified a new MEK, which we will refer to as MEK5. When MEK5 was employed in the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a new member of the ERK family of protein kinases, which we have named ERK5. MEK5 and ERK5 interacted specifically with one another and did not interact with kinases in the MEK1/ERK1 signaling pathway, suggesting that the MEK5/ERK5 protein cascade represents a novel signaling pathway in higher eukaryotes. MEK5 contains unique amino acid sequences in its N terminus, which suggest that this molecule may interact with GTPases such as CDC42. In addition, the C terminus of ERK5 also contains sequences which may target this kinase to the cytoskeletal elements within the cell. Two degenerate PCR primers were synthesized based on the conserved amino acid sequences present in MEKs from mammals and yeast (6Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sense primer was 5′-CTTGGATCCTA(C/T)ATA(C/T)GTNGGNTT(C/T)TA-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-CTTGGATCC(G/T)TCNGGN(C/G)(A/T)CAT(A/G)TA-3′, which corresponds to amino acid sequences YIVGFY and YMSPER, respectively. The underlined BamHI sites were used for cloning the PCR product. Plasmid DNA from a λZAP human fetal brain cDNA library was used as template. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min. The resultant 0.35-kb PCR products were resolved by 3% Nusieve-agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into a M13 vector and sequenced. A human fetal brain cDNA library was screened (Stratagene), using the cloned MEK5 PCR fragment labeled with a multiprimer DNA labeling kit. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C in 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's solution is 0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide. Both strands of the DNA corresponding to the clone designated pBluescriptSK− MEK5 were sequenced. The yeast strain Y190 (MAT a, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52 trp1-901 his3-Δ200 ade2-101 gal4 Δgal 80Δ URA 3 GAL-lacZ LYS GAL-HIS3 cyhr) was a generous gift of Stephen Elledge, Departments of Biochemistry and Human and Molecular Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine. The NcoI fragment encoding amino acid 12 through the stop codon of MEK5 were subcloned into pAS1-CYH2 vector. Y190 was transformed with the pAS1-CYH2-MEK5, pAS1-CYH2 S311A/T315A MEK5 mutant, or pAS1-CYH2 K195M MEK5 mutant using the lithium acetate procedure (17Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Plasmid DNA from a HeLa cell Match Maker cDNA library was then transformed into the yeast strain containing each “bait” plasmid. Transformants were selected on SC yeast medium without Leu, Trp, His, and with 35 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole at 30°C for 7-10 days (17Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 13.7.1-13.7.5Google Scholar). The transformants were lifted onto nitrocellulose membrane and assayed for β-galactosidase (17Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 13.7.1-13.7.5Google Scholar). Plasmids were recovered from β-galactosidase positive clones and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5αF′ by electroporation. The clone containing the longest ERK5 open reading frame was named A1. A full-length cDNA encoding the ERK5 protein sequence was constructed from two partial cDNAs into pBluescriptSK− (pBluescriptSK− ERK5). This plasmid was used as template for in vitro transcription/translation employing T3 polymerase and a TNT kit (Promega). The in vitro synthesized ERK5 was labeled with [35S]Met, and incubated with glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST, GST-MEK1, or GST-MEK5 at 4°C for 1-2 h in PBST (4 mM NaH2PO4, 16 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), 0.05%β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following SDS-PAGE, the gel was treated with Amplify (Amersham Corp.) and autoradiographed. GST-MEK5 was constructed by ligating a 2-kb NcoI fragment encoding amino acid 12 through the stop codon of MEK5 into pGEX-KG (18Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). GST-ERK5 was constructed by ligating the NcoI-BstEII fragment of the cDNA clone 3-1 and the BstEII-XhoI fragment of clone A1 (the XhoI site is in the vector) into pGEX-KG digested with NcoI and SalI. GST-ERK5 (residues 1-431) was constructed by subcloning a 1.1-kb NcoI fragment from pBluescriptSK− ERK5 (encoding ERK5 amino acids 1-431) into pGEX-KG. GST-fusion proteins were affinity-purified as described (18Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The kinase assays were performed at 30°C for 10-40 min in a buffer containing 18 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 50 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [λ-32P]ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described previously (6Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized PCR to identify additional proteins with sequence similarity to MEK. Oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification were based on the conserved sequences from the yeast STE7 and byr1 genes and the partial amino acid sequence of the human MEK1 (6Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A population of 0.35-kb fragments were produced by PCR using human fetal brain cDNA as a template. The PCR products were subcloned into an M13 vector. MEK1 cDNA was used subsequently as a hybridization probe to eliminate MEK1 and MEK2 from the PCR clones. The non-hybridizing clones were sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed clones encoding MEK3 and MEK4 (16Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) as well as a novel MEK homolog. We shall refer to the novel sequence as MEK5. The PCR fragment of MEK5 was used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. Twenty-four positive clones were analyzed by restriction mapping. The longest insert (2.5 kb) was sequenced and yielded a predicted protein sequence of 444 amino acids (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, all 11 kinase subdomains are conserved for MEK5 (16Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identity of MEK5 with known MEKs is approximately 40%. The Raf-1 phosphorylation and activation motif of MEK1, S218XXXS222(19Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 20Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), was also conserved as S311XXXT315 in MEK5, suggesting a similar regulatory mechanism. Like MEK3 and MEK4 (15Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), there was an amino acid sequence gap between domains IX and X, resulting in deletion of the proline-rich region seen in MEK1 and MEK2. This region contains phosphorylation sites and negative regulatory sequences (5Wu J. Harrison J.K. Vincent L.A. Haystead C. Harstead T.A.J. Michel H. Hunt D.F. Lynch K.R. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1594-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The most divergent region among the MEKs is upstream of kinase subdomain I. MEK5 is distinct from other MEKs in that it contains a long N-terminal sequence. A data bank search with the first 150 residues of MEK5 revealed sequence identity with two proteins that have important roles in cell division, mating and morphogenesis, namely the yeast cell division protein 24 (encoded by Saccharomyces cerevisia CDC24 gene (22Miyamoto S. Ohya Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 54: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the homologous protein encoded by the scd1 gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe(23Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of MEK5 with the encoded proteins of the scd1 gene and CDC24 gene is shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2:Sequence alignment of MEK5 with the scd1 gene and CDC24 gene encoded proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the CDC24 encoded protein has GDP release activity. When the CDC24 encoded protein binds to the GTPase encoded by CDC42, it enhances the GTP/GDP exchange (24Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, the scd1 encoded protein enhances the nucleotide exchange of the corresponding S. pombe encoded protein (cdc42sp). The binding domain of scd1 that recognizes cdc42sp is located C-terminal to amino acid 671 of scd1 (23Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It is this region of scd1 that shows sequence identity to MEK5 as well as CDC24. Although the function of this sequence is unknown, it is possible that the N terminus of MEK5 interacts with the mammalian equivalent of CDC42. The mammalian equivalent of yeast CDC42 is Rac (25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences in question may provide a mechanism for coupling GTPases (i.e. CDC42 and Rac) to downstream protein kinase signaling cascades. Mutations in activating phosphorylation sites and the conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding site of MEK1 result in dominant negative mutants that interfere with the kinase function (26Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 27Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G.

Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). We anticipated that similar modifications in MEK5 might enhance its interaction with upstream and/or downstream signaling molecules. To enhance the enzyme-substrate interaction, mutations that led to the dominant negative phenotype of MEK1 were made in MEK5, i.e. S311A/T315A and K195M (20Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, three “bait” plasmids containing sequences encoding wild-type MEK5, MEK5 S311A/T315A, or MEK5 K195M were used to screen a HeLa cell library. From a pool of 4.2 × 106 transformants (2 × 106 from MEK5, 2 × 106 from S311A/T315A mutant, and 0.2 × 106 from K195M mutant), 6 clones were identified that encoded a novel ERK, which we shall refer to as ERK5. Five clones in this pool were obtained with the S311A/T315A mutant of MEK5 and one with the K195M mutant. All clones contained the TEY activation motif. The product encoded by the longest ERK5 clone, A1, interacted with MEK5 in the yeast two-hybrid system, but not with MEK1 or MEK2 (Fig. 3, A-C). In addition, MEK5 does not interact with p38 or Raf A, B, or C in the yeast two-hybrid system. This result supports the highly specific nature of the interactions between MEK5 and ERK5. It should be noted that wild-type MEK5 also interacted with ERK5, although we did not isolate any ERK5 clones from the initial yeast two-hybrid screen. We anticipate that dominant negative MEKs may be useful in the identification of additional upstream as well as downstream signaling proteins in similar cascades. To obtain the full-length clone for ERK5, the 2.5-kb insert of A1 was used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. From 60 positive clones, two were used to complete sequence analysis. The 2828-base pair sequence contained an open reading frame of 2445 nucleotides encoding 815 amino acids (Fig. 4). A number of residues important for the kinase activity of ERKs are conserved, including the TEY activation motif (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). ERK5 contains a 400-amino acid C-terminal domain, which houses two proline-rich regions. The first proline-rich region, consisting of 32 amino acids, contains 16 prolines. The second proline-rich region (124 amino acids with 44 prolines) contained several small Pro-Ala repeats, (PA)3, followed by Pro-Thr repeats, (PT)3, and three repeats of PPGP. The (PA)n repeat is present in myosin light chain kinase, and this sequence has been shown to directly interact with actin, targeting the kinase to a specific location in the cell (29Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The unique ERK5 C-terminal sequence may serve as a localization domain and/or a regulatory domain. It is interesting to speculate that the (PA)n sequences which target myosin light chain kinase to actin may also target ERK5 to a similar location. Northern blot analysis of ERK5 mRNA (3.1 kb) and MEK5 mRNA (2.7 kb) demonstrated they are expressed in many human tissues and that the RNAs are most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle (data not shown). To further document the specific interaction between MEK5 and ERK5, in vitro binding assays were conducted (Fig. 3D). In this experiment, full-length ERK5 was synthesized in an in vitro transcription/translation system. As shown in Fig. 3D, ERK5 binds to GST-MEK5 and the GST-MEK5 mutant K195M, but not to GST alone or to GST-MEK1. Thus, MEK5 specifically interacted with ERK5 in both our in vitro system and in the yeast two-hybrid system. GST fusion protein containing full-length MEK5 could not be overexpressed in E. coli. However, elimination of the N-terminal 11 residues produced a MEK5 fusion protein which could be overexpressed and affinity-purified. The purified protein showed no protein kinase activity toward ERK1, JNK1, or GST-ERK5. However, a weak autophosphorylation activity could be detected with the wild-type enzyme but not with the MEK5 K195M mutant (data not shown). These experiments suggested that additional modifications are required for full kinase activity. Two GST fusion proteins of ERK5 were created for expression in E. coli, a full-length GST-ERK5 and a truncated GST-ERK5 with the C-terminal 384 residues removed. This truncated ERK5 corresponds to the kinase domain of the protein, i.e. GST-ERK5(1-431). Both fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose affinity columns. The full-length GST-ERK5 protein had no detectable protein kinase activity (Fig. 5A and data not shown). The purified GST-ERK5(1-431) showed basal autophosphorylation activity, as was evident from the radioactive band of the predicted molecular weight following SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 5A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the radioactive protein revealed phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the kinase domain of the full-length ERK5 is rendered inactive by the presence of the C-terminal 384 residues. Removal of the C-terminal domain results in the ability of the functional ERK5 kinase domain to display its kinase activity. The fact that ERK5, like ERK1, has a TEY motif and that phospho-Ser/Thr and Tyr are observed in the analysis of labeled ERK5, suggests that the catalytic properties of the two kinases may be similar. In summary, we have identified two novel kinases that interact selectively with one another in what appears to represent a new mammalian signal transduction pathway. Our results suggest that there are no interactions between the proteins in the MEK1/ERK1 pathway and the MEK5/ERK5 pathway, suggesting that the two signaling pathways have either different or complementary functions. Our results also suggest that the two different signaling pathways most likely do not have overlapping functions in the cell. We are currently attempting to identify both upstream activators of MEK5 as well as downstream substrates of ERK5. The unusual length of the C-domain of ERK5 suggests that the sequences located here may undergo additional post-translational modifications as well as play roles in regulating or targeting of ERK5.

https://openalex.org/W2073231646,"Extending axons are guided in part by diffusible chemoattractants that lure them to their targets and by diffusible chemorepellents that keep them away from nontarget regions. Floor plate cells at the ventral midline of the neural tube express a diffusible chemoattractant, netrin-1, that attracts a group of ventrally directed axons. Here we report that floor plate cells also have a long-range repulsive effect on a set of axons, trochlear motor axons, that grow dorsally away from the floor plate in vivo. COS cells secreting recombinant netrin-1 mimic this effect, suggesting that netrin-1 is a bifunctional guidance cue that simultaneously attracts some axons to the floor plate while steering others away. This bifunctionality of netrin-1 in vertebrates mirrors the dual actions of UNC-6, a C. elegans homolog of netrin-1, which is involved in guiding both dorsal and ventral migrations in the nematode."
https://openalex.org/W2085617522,"We show that repeating units from all reported disease genes are capable of forming hairpins of common structure and threshold stability. The threshold stability is roughly -50 kcal per hairpin and is influenced by the flanking sequence of the gene. Hairpin stability has two components, sequence and length; only DNA of select sequences and the correct length can form hairpins of threshold energy. There is a correlation among the ability to form hairpins of threshold stability, the sequence selectivity of expansion, and the length dependence of expansion. Additionally, hairpin formation provides a potential structural basis for the constancy of the CCG region of the Huntington's disease gene in individuals and explains the stabilizing effects of AGG interruptions in FMR1 alleles."

The receptor has high affinity (KD, 174 pM) for human IFN alpha and, unlike other type I IFN receptors, has broad species specificity, binding to human, rabbit, bovine, rat, and mouse type I IFNs. This may have aided VV replication in multiple host species during evolution. A VV B18R deletion mutant is attenuated in a murine intranasal model.

We previously proposed the existence of an activity, P-TEF (positive transcription elongation factor) that functions in a DRB-sensitive manner to allow RNA polymerase II elongation complexes to efficiently synthesize long transcripts (Marshall, N. F. and Price, D. H.(1992) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol.</i> 12, 2078-2090). We have fractionated nuclear extracts of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> K<sup>c</sup> cells and identified three activities, P-TEFa, factor 2, and P-TEFb, that are directly involved in reconstructing DRB-sensitive transcription. P-TEFb is essential for the production of DRB-sensitive long transcripts <i>in vitro</i>, while P-TEFa and factor 2 are stimulatory. P-TEFb activity is associated with a protein comprising two polypeptide subunits with apparent molecular masses of 124 and 43 kDa. Using a P-TEFb-dependent transcription system, we show that P-TEFb acts after initiation and is the limiting factor in the production of long runoff transcripts."

This Sec complex includes a heterotrimeric Sec61p complex, homologous to that in mammals, as well as all other membrane proteins found in genetic screens for translocation components. Efficient posttranslational translocation also requires the addition of lumenal Kar2p (BiP) and ATP. The trimeric Sec61p complex also exists as a separate entity that, in contrast with the large Sec complex, is associated with membrane-bound ribosomes. We therefore hypothesize that distinct membrane protein complexes function in co- and posttranslational translocation pathways."

In this report, we demonstrate that angiotensin II converges with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptor signaling cascades, independent of PDGF. Stimulation of smooth muscle cells with angiotensin II resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc proteins and subsequent complex formation between Shc and growth factor receptor binding protein-2 (GRB2). A 180-kDa protein co-precipitating with Shc⋅GRB2 complexes also demonstrated increased phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II. Immunoblot analyses and proteolytic digests failed to distinguish this 180-kDa protein from authentic PDGF β-receptors. Corresponding with Shc and PDGF receptor phosphorylation induced by angiotensin II was the recruitment and phosphorylation of c-Src. Autocrine release of platelet-derived growth factor failed to account for Shc complex formation at the PDGF receptor following angiotensin II treatment, and a specific angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, losartan, abolished the response. These results support a novel model for cross-talk between the G-protein-linked angiotensin II receptor and the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Since the angiotensin II type I receptor is G-protein linked, the mechanism by which it activates processes characteristic of growth factor signaling is unclear.

In an effort to understand smooth muscle cell responses to vascular growth factors, we examined signaling proteins upstream of p21ras in cultures of isolated, rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) exposed to angiotensin II. In this report, we demonstrate that angiotensin II induces phosphorylation on Shc and recruitment of GRB2. Furthermore, Shc⋅GRB2 immune complexes contained phosphorylated PDGF β-receptors and c-Src. Assembly of this complex in response to angiotensin II was independent of autocrine PDGF release. These observations illustrate an unexpected link between angiotensin II type I receptor and PDGF β-receptor signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle cells and suggest a mechanism by which angiotensin II elicits signaling events characteristic of mitogenic stimuli. Recombinant human BB-PDGF and antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine, Shc, GRB2, PDGF β-receptors and PDGF were from Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Transduction Laboratories or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A radioimmunoassay for human PDGF was obtained fom Amersham Corp. Assays were performed on media as directed and values were corrected for rat PDGF cross-reactivity. Cell culture reagents and Protein G-agarose were from Life Technologies, Inc. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). ECL reagents were from Amersham. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated as described (26Owens G.K. Thompson L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 105: 343-352Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 15% fetal calf serum. Cells were split at confluence and fed every third day. Cultures were used between passages 5 and 10. A10 smooth muscle cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured identically to the RASMC. Cells were grown to confluence and serum starved in DMEM lacking fetal calf serum for 18 h. Following stimulation, cell medium was removed, and cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+, Mg2+-free). Cells were scraped into lysis buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (27Wahl M.I.

Supernatants containing approximately 350 μg of protein were transferred to new tubes containing 2 μg of indicated antibody and incubated at 4°C for 2.5 h with mixing. Protein G-agarose was added and lysates incubated for an additional 30 min. Precipitates were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer A and resuspended finally in SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204462) Google Scholar) sample buffer. Complexes were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and processed for immunoblot analysis. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 20°C. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes four times in PBS-T. The blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies in PBS-T containing 5% milk diluent (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h. Membranes were washed as before and processed for ECL. In certain experiments the filters were reprobed after stripping in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2% SDS, and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 52°C. Filters were rinsed briefly in PBS-T and processed as above with a different primary antibody. Serum-starved RASMC cultures were labeled with 5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM. Cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS to remove unincorporated label, then stimulated with PDGF at 30 ng/ml or angiotensin II at 1 μM for 15 min. Shc or PDGF receptors were precipitated as described above and complexes resolved by SDS-PAGE. Following exposure to film, gel fragments containing the labeled 180-kDa protein were excised and transferred to a fresh gel. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2 μg of purified V8 protease was added to indicated lanes and samples electrophoresed into a 4% stacking gel (29Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was stopped for 1 h to allow digestion of the proteins. Protein fragments were resolved through a 10% gel and exposed to film for autoradiography. To examine PDGF activity, media from RASMC exposed to angiotensin II at various concentrations was transferred onto serum-starved A10 cells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Cells were lysed and 200 μg of protein analyzed for phosphotyrosine incorporation by immunoblotting. In certain experiments, media from RASMC treated with angiotensin II was saturated with an antibody capable of neutralizing PDGF for 15 min at 37°C. Neutralized media was transferred onto fresh RASMC and incubated for 10 min prior to analysis for Shc and receptor phosphorylation. To examine autocrine release of factors other than PDGF, media from RASMC treated with 10 nM angiotensin II was saturated with 10 μM losartan and transferred onto fresh RASMC that had been preincubated with 10 μM losartan. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37°C and Shc protein complexes analyzed as above. We first measured tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc and subsequent recruitment of GRB2 in response to angiotensin II. Shc was immunoprecipitated from quiescent cultures of RASMC exposed to various concentrations of angiotensin II for 10 min. Analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Shc immunoprecipitates revealed phosphorylation of 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa Shc isoforms (Fig. 1A). Further analysis illustrated the recruitment of GRB2 to Shc immune complexes in parallel with Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). GRB2 association with Shc correlated quantitatively with angiotensin II. Complex formation was detectable at 1 nM angiotensin II and maximal by 100 nM. In similar experiments, complex formation was detected within 5 min and plateaued by 10 min following angiotensin II exposure. The complex was still prominent at 120 min (data not shown). A similar pattern of Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 1A) and GRB2 association (Fig. 1B) was observed following treatment with PDGF. Analysis of the blots with an antibody directed against Shc confirmed the identity of these phosphorylated bands and assured equivalent precipitation efficiency (Fig. 1C). Additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins appeared in Shc immune complexes in response to angiotensin II with a profile strikingly similar to that observed from cells treated with PDGF (Fig. 1A). Two such proteins at 60 and 180 kDa are similar in size to the protein tyrosine kinase, Src, and the PDGF β-receptor, respectively. Tyrosine phosphorylation on these proteins correlated with Shc⋅GRB2 complex formation both temporally and with respect to angiotensin II concentration. This warranted additional investigation because Src and PDGF β-receptors are putative activators of Shc (20Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Pawson T. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol.

Analysis of the 180 kDa region with an antibody specific for the PDGF β-receptor demonstrated cross-reactivity with this protein and suggested that the receptor, Shc, and GRB2 occur in a single complex in response to angiotensin II (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the presence of the PDGF receptor, a c-Src antibody recognized the phosphorylated 60-kDa protein that co-precipitated with Shc in angiotensin II- and PDGF-stimulated cells. This demonstrated recruitment of c-Src to the complex in response to angiotensin II or PDGF (Fig. 2B). To explore the possibility that PDGF β-receptors contribute to angiotensin II signaling, we next examined receptor phosphorylation in immune complexes precipitated by two additional antibodies. Fig. 3A (upper exposure) illustrates that antibodies directed against Shc, GRB2, or phosphotyrosine co-precipitated the 180-kDa protein and confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was enhanced by angiotensin II or PDGF. Again, identity of the 180-kDa protein as the PDGF β-receptor was suggested by cross-reactivity with a PDGF β-receptor-specific antibody (Fig. 3A, lower exposure). Phosphorylation of the 180-kDa protein was further demonstrated by incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate. PDGF β-receptors and Shc were immunoprecipitated from angiotensin II- or PDGF-stimulated RASMC that had been labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Label incorporation into precipitated PDGF β-receptors and the 180-kDa protein increased approximately 2-fold in PDGF and angiotensin II-stimulated cells and confirmed agonist-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Successful incorporation of radiolabel into the 180-kDa protein following angiotensin II stimulation allowed comparison of proteolytic maps of the candidate band to authentic PDGF β-receptor digestions. Radiolabeled protein co-migrating with authentic PDGF β-receptor (Fig. 4A) was excised, transferred to a new gel and digested with V8 protease. Fig. 4B typifies the digestion patterns of authentic PDGF β-receptors and the 180-kDa protein. Numerous protease-dependent fragments characterized authentic PDGF β-receptor digests and mirrored the pattern liberated by digestion of the 180-kDa protein. Proteolytic maps in conjunction with antibody cross-reactivity confirmed the 180-kDa protein present in Shc immune precipitations as the PDGF β-receptor. We next examined whether the link between angiotensin II type I receptor stimulation and assembly of Shc signaling complexes at the PDGF receptor was induced by autocrine release of PDGF. We have observed previously that the rat A10 smooth muscle cell line is non-responsive to angiotensin II with respect to eliciting tyrosine phosphorylation, but fully responsive to PDGF in this regard. This cell line, therefore, provided a sensitive system for detection of PDGF release by RASMC responding to angiotensin II. Stimulation of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity in A10 cell cultures is evident by immunoblotting following exposure to as little as 100 pg of PDGF/ml. When media from RASMC conditioned with angiotensin II was transferred onto A10 cell cultures, however, tyrosine phosphorylation on PDGF receptors was undetectable (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B provides additional evidence for the lack of PDGF activity in media from RASMC conditioned with angiotensin II. In this approach, media from RASMC treated with angiotensin II was saturated with an antibody that neutralizes PDGF and then transferred onto fresh cultures. Control experiments demonstrated that the antibody could neutralize at least 10 ng of PDGF/ml. Consistent with the A10 cell assay, activity in the media from angiotensin II-stimulated cells was fully effective in eliciting Shc and receptor phosphorylation. Finally, media from cells exposed to angiotensin II contained undetectable levels of PDGF as determined by a sensitive radioimmunoassay (data not shown). Although PDGF release failed to account for activation of the signaling pathway in response to angiotensin II, this did not rule out autocrine release of a factor different from PDGF. To examine this possibility, we tested whether media transferred from RASMC stimulated with 10 nM angiotensin II could activate the signaling cascade in the presence of losartan. Fig. 6A illustrates that losartan pretreatment of the cells abolished complex formation following direct addition of 10 nM angiotensin II. In contrast, angiotensin II-conditioned media contained an activity that was not fully blocked by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (Fig. 6B), suggesting liberation of a factor other than PDGF. Angiotensin II elicits signaling responses that resemble PDGF signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our work substantiates these observations by demonstrating that angiotensin II stimulates the association of Shc and GRB2 in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle. In addition to this phenomenon, we present a novel link between the angiotensin II G-protein-coupled receptor and PDGF receptor signaling. In this model, the PDGF receptor serves as a docking site for known upstream activators of p21-ras in smooth muscle cells responding to angiotensin II. Evidence supporting this hypothesis include: (i) Shc immune complexes from angiotensin II and PDGF-treated cells contained a 180-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein that co-migrates with the PDGF β-receptor; (ii) an antibody specific for the PDGF β-receptor cross-reacted with the 180-kDa protein that co-precipitates with Shc in response to angiotensin II; (iii) proteolytic maps of the 180-kDa protein are indistinguishable from authentic PDGF receptors; and (iv) autocrine release of PDGF failed to account for Shc complex formation in response to angiotensin II. Tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc and subsequent complex formation with GRB2 appear central to upstream signaling strategies elicited by a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines. Shc⋅GRB2 complex formation is critical to activation of p21ras in cells responding to insulin (24Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar) , EGF (23Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) , and in the transformation of cells by over expression of Shc (24Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar) . Our observation that Shc and GRB2 associate in response to angiotensin II implicates Shc and GRB2 as important mediators in the angiotensin II signaling response. This is in agreement with work by Schorb et al.(22Schorb W. Peeler T.C. Madigan N.N. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19626-19632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating the phosphorylation of Shc in cardiac fibroblasts following exposure to angiotensin II. Although they did not evaluate GRB2 recruitment to Shc, it is likely that both cardiac fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells utilize this pathway to transduce angiotensin II signals. Since Shc⋅GRB2 complex formation contributes to PDGF signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle cells, activation of these molecules may provide a mechanism through which angiotensin II activates mitogen-activated protein kinases. Our results suggest that the similarity between the upstream signaling events elicited by angiotensin II and PDGF extend beyond Shc⋅GRB2 complex formation. To this end, we have detected PDGF receptors and c-Src in Shc immune complexes isolated from angiotensin II-treated vascular smooth muscle cells (21Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30911-30916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these proteins co-precipitate with Shc from cells responding to PDGF. The appearance of PDGF receptors in Shc immune complexes is consistent with recent results demonstrating the association of Shc and PDGF receptors in unstimulated vascular smooth muscle cells. Support for this hypothesis is provided by Fig. 2. Identification of the 180-kDa protein as the PDGF receptor by antibody cross-reactivity also shows little change in the amount of receptor co-precipitated following angiotensin II stimulation. The recruitment of GRB2 and c-Src to the complex, however, is clearly increased and agonist dependent. Fig. 3A adds further support to this hypothesis. Precipitations performed with antibodies specific for GRB2 and phosphotyrosine contain increased amounts of PDGF receptor in response to angiotensin II and PDGF that correspond with phosphorylation on the receptor. In contrast, precipitation with antibodies to Shc showed constant receptor levels even though phosphorylation on the receptor increased. Since Shc can associate with the receptor in unstimulated cells and angiotensin II causes tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc, one might expect the complex to assemble in response to angiotensin II by using the PDGF receptor as a docking site. Whether the receptor is activated in this complex, as might by suggested by enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, requires further investigation. The appearance of c-Src in Shc immune complexes isolated from angiotensin II-stimulated cells is notable in that Src is a putative activator of Shc. This was established by work demonstrating that v-Src transformed rat-1 cells contain constitutively phosphorylated Shc (30McGlade J. Cheng A. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8869-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Further c-Src can associate directly with activated PDGF receptors via its SH2 domain (29Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and c-Src has been detected in Shc immune complexes isolated from PDGF-treated A10 smooth muscle cells (21Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30911-30916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Src by angiotensin II may represent the key convergence point between the angiotensin II and PDGF signaling pathways. Catalytically active Src, in close association with Shc and the receptor, may account for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation observed on Shc and the PDGF receptor in response to angiotensin II. It is interesting that a pivotal role for Src family tyrosine kinases has been suggested in smooth muscle contractile responses elicited by angiotensin II and growth factors (31Hollenberg M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 108-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II increases PDGF A chain, transforming growth factor-β1 and basic fibroblast growth factor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (32Itoh H. Mukoyama M. Pratt R.E. Gibbons G.H. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In view of this, we evaluated whether autocrine release of PDGF accounted for PDGF receptor involvement in angiotensin II signal transduction. Since maximal stimulation of Shc⋅GRB2 complex formation in response to angiotensin II corresponded with PDGF at 10 ng/ml, we anticipated that release of PDGF in response to angiotensin II would approach a similar value. Several assays capable of detecting PDGF at concentrations much lower that 10 ng/ml ruled out secretion of PDGF as the mechanism for activation of the signaling pathway by angiotensin II. First, media from cells exposed to angiotensin II contained undetectable levels of PDGF as determined by a sensitive radioimmunoassay (data not shown). This agrees with previous reports that adult rat aortic smooth muscle cells synthesize and release little PDGF (33Sjolund M. Heldin U. Sejersen T. Heldin C.-H. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Second, media from cultures of RASMC exposed to various concentrations of angiotensin II contained no activity capable of inducing PDGF receptor phosphorylation in the angiotensin II-insensitive rat A10 vascular smooth muscle cell line. PDGF concentrations as low as 100 pg/ml stimulated detectable phosphorylation on PDGF receptors in A10 cell cultures and verified this system as a sensitive bioassay for PDGF. Lack of activity in the angiotensin II-conditioned media, therefore, indicated a PDGF concentration below 100 pg/ml. Finally, a PDGF neutralizing antibody failed to block activation of the signaling pathway when added to angiotensin II-conditioned media. Taken together, these data eliminate PDGF release as the mechanism for PDGF β-receptor phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II. Media transfer experiments did, however, suggest liberation of a factor distinct from PDGF. The angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, losartan, fully blocked activation of the pathway when angiotensin II was added directly to cells. In contrast, losartan only partially blocked the activity present in angiotensin II-conditioned media. The identity of this factor requires further investigation, but it may fall in the lipid category given the profile of rapid production and the inability of smooth muscle cells to rapidly secrete proteins. In this regard, angiotensin II stimulates phospholipases A2, C, and D activity in vascular smooth muscle cultures with a time course similar to activation of the Shc/GRB2 pathway (34Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem J. 1994; 299: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 292: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a novel mechanism wherein angiotensin II receptor signal transduction links with PDGF β-receptor signaling cascades and results in activation of proteins upstream of p21ras. The direct involvement of the PDGF receptor in this process presents a novel paradigm for cross-talk between G-protein-linked and growth factor receptor signaling pathways. The activation of this pathway by either PDGF or angiotensin II is paradoxical in that angiotensin II does not elicit a mitogenic response typical of PDGF. This suggests that additional, PDGF-specific pathways are required for full mitogenic potential or that divergence of the pathways, downstream of Shc/GRB2, facilitates the specific biological responses characteristic of these two growth factors."

We identified a 100 kDa protein as a candidate for the licensing factor in Xenopus egg extracts. This protein was required for replication; it bound to sperm DNA before the formation of nuclei and apparently dissociated from the nuclear DNA during the progression of replication without being transported into the nuclei. An immunologically homologous protein in HeLa cells behaved similarly to the Xenopus protein during the cell cycle. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs encoding the Xenopus and human proteins revealed that they are homologs of yeast Mcm3, a putative yeast DNA replication licensing factor."

In MDCK cells, transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the basolateral plasma membrane is inhibited by anti-NSF antibodies and stimulated by alpha-SNAP. In contrast, transport from the TGN to the apical cell surface is not affected by anti-NSF antibodies or alpha-SNAP. Furthermore, apical transport is insensitive to Rab-GDI and tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins, which inhibit basolateral transport. These results provide evidence that the Rab-NSF-SNAP-SNARE mechanism operates in basolateral transport, while other molecules constitute the machinery for vesicular delivery in the apical pathway."

It is also effective in the treatment of several rodent models of arthritis and autoimmune disease. In vitro studies indicate that leflunomide is capable of inhibiting anti-CD3- and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated T cell proliferation. However, the biochemical mechanism for the inhibitory activity of leflunomide has not been elucidated. In this study, we characterized the inhibitory effects of leflunomide on Src family (p56lck and p59fyn)-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Leflunomide was able to inhibit p59fyn and p56lck activity in in vitro tyrosine kinase assays. The IC50 values for p59fyn (immunoprecipitated from either Jurkat or CTLL-4 cell lysate) autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate, histone 2B, were 125-175 and 22-40 μM respectively, while the IC50 values for p56lck (immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cell lysates) autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of histone 2B were 160 and 65 μM respectively. We also demonstrated the ability of leflunomide to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in Jurkat cells. The IC50 values for total intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation ranged from 5 to 45 μM, with the IC50 values for the ζ chain and phospholipase C isoform γ1 being 35 and 44 μM respectively. Leflunomide also inhibited Ca2+ mobilization in Jurkat cells stimulated by anti-CD3 antibody but not in those stimulated by ionomycin. Distal events of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody stimulation, namely, IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression on human T lymphocytes, were also inhibited by leflunomide. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation in CTLL-4 cells stimulated by IL-2 was also inhibited by leflunomide. These data collectively demonstrate the ability of leflunomide to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity in vitro, and suggest that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation events may be the mechanism by which leflunomide functions as an immunosuppressive agent.

Protein-tyrosine kinases are thought to play essential roles in signal transduction by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)1( 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell antigen receptorPLC-γ1phospholipase C isozyme γ1IL-2interleukin-2IL-2RIL-2 receptorPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatemAbmonoclonal antibodyMAPmicrotubule-associated protein.) complex and cytokine receptors. The TCR complex comprises multiple components, including heterodimer α/β or γ/δ, which is linked to CD3 subunits (δ, ∊, γ), and the ζ-ζ homodimer or ζ-η heterodimer (1Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Secrist J.P. Leibson P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 434-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The occupancy of TCR by specific antigen/major histocompatibility complex or antibodies immediately activates Src-related tyrosine kinases, p59fyn and/or p56lck, which then induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates (2June C.H. Fletcher M.C. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Siegel J.N. Phillips A.F. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7722-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 3Hsi E.D.

Immunol. 1992; 29: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of one identified intracellular substrate, the ζ chain, occurs very rapidly (≦10 s) upon TCR·CD3 ligation, presumably by constitutively associated p59fyn. The phosphorylated ζ chain is then able to bind and activate a non-Src family tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (6Straus D.B. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Another substrate, phospholipase C isozyme γ1 (PLC-γ1), is either directly or indirectly phosphorylated by p59fyn and/or p56lck tyrosine kinase (8Weiss A. Koretzky G. Schatzman R.C. Kadlecek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation activates PLC-γ1, which then hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes intracellular Ca2+, while diacylglycerol in combination with Ca2+ then activates protein kinase C (9Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 357-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to calmodulin leads to activation of calcineurin, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the transcription factor NF-AT. Dephosphorylated NF-AT then translocates to nucleus where it stimulates the transcription of IL-2 gene (9Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol.

Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been useful in defining the role of these enzymes in signal transduction events. Herbimycin A, a benzoquinonoid ansamycin antibiotic, increases the turnover of p56lck and p59fyn, which in turn decreases tyrosine kinase activity in human T lymphocytes, and thus impairs signal transduction by the TCR complex. Tyrosine phosphorylation, PLC-γ1 activity, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, and [Ca2+]i mobilization, as well as the expression of distal markers of T cell activation, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), are all inhibited by herbimycin A (2June C.H.

Genistein, a natural isoflavone, also inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and other substrates, although it is less effective than herbimycin A and has only marginal effects on the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ mobilization (10Graber M.

Immunol. 1990; 145: 3223-3230PubMed Google Scholar). However, genistein still efficiently blocks IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression (12Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Isakov N. Altman A. Science. 1990; 247: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Both herbimycin A and genistein are capable of blocking proliferation of T cells stimulated by phytohemagglutinin or by anti-TCR antibody, but neither has yet been tested in any in vivo animal models for immunosuppression. Leflunomide is an immunosuppressant that may act by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation. This isoxazol derivative, which shares no apparent chemical relationship to the other known immunosuppressive drugs, is able to prevent autoimmune diseases and rejection of transplant allografts and xenografts (13Bartlett R.R.

In vitro cell culture experiments revealed that the active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726, inhibited proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction. In addition, leflunomide inhibited T cell proliferation stimulated by anti-CD3 antibody plus PMA, anti-CD28 antibody plus PMA, as well as by IL-2 (16Chong A.S.-F. Finnegan A. Jiang X.L. Gebel H.

Earlier studies showed that leflunomide inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth receptor (17Mattar T. Kohhar K. Bartlett R. Bremer E.G. Finnegan A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have extended these studies and here report that leflunomide inhibits the activity of p59fyn and p56lck, two Src family protein-tyrosine kinases implicated in signal transduction of T cells. We also examined the effects of leflunomide on the TCR signal transduction cascade and have observed that leflunomide blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of the PLC-γ1 and ζ chain, and consequently inhibits Ca2+ mobilization, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2R expression. In addition, leflunomide is also able to inhibit IL-2-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in CTLL-4 cells. These data collectively suggest that immunosuppression mediated by leflunomide is due to its ability to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins required for T cell activation and clonal expansion.

Cell lystates were prepared, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined by Western blotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, 4G10, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Corp.) following manufacturer's instruction. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain was similarly examined and identity of ζ chain was confirmed by striping nitrocellulose membrane and reprobing with anti-ζ chain mAb. To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, PLC-γ1 was first immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cell lysates with pooled anti-PLC-γ1 mAbs and then probed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) and detected with ECL. After stripping the membrane, PLC-γ1 protein was reprobed with anti-PLC-γ1 mAbs as described previously (18Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2668-2674PubMed Google Scholar). 5 × 106 Jurkat cells were preincubated with various concentrations of leflunomide in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 37°C for 10 min. Cells were then loaded with fura-2/AM as described previously (19Casattella M. Anegon I. Cristina M. Griskey P. Tinchieri G. Perussia R. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 549-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Leflunomide was present throughout the entire process. Cells were stimulated with 4 μM anti-CD3 mAb or 2 μg of ionomycin. Fura-2/AM fluorescence was measured in a SLM Aminco SPF-500C spectrophotometer. The concentration of intracellular [Ca2+]i was calculated using an equation derived by Grynkiewicz et al.(20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells/ml of enriched human T cells were preincubated with various concentrations of leflunomide in serum-free medium at 37°C for 10 min and then stimulated with plastic-immobilized anti-CD3 mAb. Cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml of anti-human CD25 mAb to prevent IL-2 autocrine consumption. The supernatants were then harvested and centrifuged, and the IL-2 in the supernatant was measured in a bioassay using the murine IL-2-dependent cell line, CTLL-4, as described previously (11Trevillyan J.M. Lu Y. Atluru D. Phillips C.A. Bjorndahl J.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3223-3230PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid the influence of residual leflunomide in the supernatants on proliferation of CTLL-4 cells, leflunomide was removed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 M, pH 7.4). A control supernatant harvested from anti-CD3-stimulated T cells and spiked with 200 μM leflunomide was included to ascertain that all leflunomide was removed by the dialysis procedure. This control supernatant stimulated CTLL-4 proliferation as well as did the positive control supernatant without added leflunomide. The expression of IL-2R α chain was determined using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD25 mAb (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The percent of cells expressing CD25+ was determined from 2500 cells using an EPICS C flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). The exposed X-Omat films from the in vitro tyrosine kinase assays or the phosphotyrosine proteins detected on Western blots were scanned in a LKB densitometer (2202 Ultrascan laser densitometer). The peaks corresponding to the bands of interest were integrated to determine the relative amounts of phosphorylation. It has been well documented that Src-related tyrosine kinases are involved in signal transduction of hematopoetic cells. Mattar et al. (17Mattar T. Kohhar K. Bartlett R. Bremer E.G. Finnegan A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that leflunomide inhibited protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor. Therefore, we first tested whether leflunomide was able to inhibit p59fyn activity in immune complex tyrosine kinase assays. The enzymatic activity of protein-tyrosine kinases, p59fyn and p56lck, immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells or from IL-2-stimulated CTLL-4 cells, was inhibited by leflunomide in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The half-maximal dose (IC50) required for inhibiting p59fyn -mediated phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate histone 2B was 22-40 μM, whereas the IC50 value for inhibiting the autophosphorylation of p59fyn was 125-175 μM (Fig. 1, A and B). Leflunomide also inhibited p56lck autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 160 μM and phosphorylation of histone 2B with an IC50 of 65 μM (Fig. 1C). The ability of leflunomide to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphorylation was further investigated in Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. Consistent with previous reports (2June C.H. Fletcher M.C. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Siegel J.N. Phillips A.F. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7722-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 3Hsi E.D. Siegel J.N. Minami Y. Luong E. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10836-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aggregation of TCR·CD3 complex resulted in the appearance of a number of new phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (Fig. 2A). The molecular masses of these proteins were approximately 135, 100, 97, 80, 72, 56, and 42 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates was differentially inhibited in Jurkat cells preincubated with leflunomide for 2 h with IC50 values ranging from 5 μM to 45 μM for the various substrates. Two substrates that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in Jurkat cells following the stimulation of TCR·CD3 complex have been characterized; one is the ζ chain of the CD3 complex and the other is PLC-γ1 (8Weiss A. Koretzky G. Schatzman R.C. Kadlecek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Park D.J. Rho H.W. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5453-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of leflunomide on tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain, Jurkat cells were preincubated with various concentrations of leflunomide for 10 min and then stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. Cell lysates were resolved by a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the tyrosine phosphorylated ζ chain was detected by anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) antibody and ECL on Western blot (Fig. 2B, upper panel), and the identity of the ζ chain was confirmed by reblotting with anti-ζ chain mAb (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Densitometric analyses revealed that leflunomide inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain with an IC50 of 35 μM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated PLC-γ1 from untreated or leflunomide-treated Jurkat cells was monitored by Western blot and ECL. As shown in Fig. 2C (top panel), stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 mAb greatly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, while preincubation of Jurkat cells with the indicated doses of leflunomide for 2 h prior to stimulation significantly inhibited anti-CD3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. The IC50 was calculated as 44 μM. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-PLC-γ1 antibody to confirm that approximately equal amounts of PLC-γ1 had been immunoprecipitated from each sample (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). To test the effect of leflunomide on anti-CD3-stimulated [Ca2+]i mobilization, Jurkat cells were preincubated with leflunomide for 10 min and then loaded with fura-2/AM in the presence of leflunomide. As shown in Fig. 3A, 50 μM leflunomide partially (50%) inhibited [Ca2+]i mobilization in Jurkat cells stimulated by anti-CD3 mAb, and 100 μM of leflunomide inhibited [Ca2+]i mobilization by 80%. However, 100 μM leflunomide did not significantly inhibit [Ca2+]i mobilization in response to stimulation of ionomycin, a calcium ionophore (Fig. 3B), suggesting that leflunomide most likely reduced Ca2+ mobilization by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1. The ability of leflunomide to inhibit the early anti-CD3-stimulated signal transduction events suggests that leflunomide should also inhibit IL-2 production and IL-2R expression induced by anti-CD3 mAb. This supposition is supported in part by a previous report (25Zielinski T. Mueller H.-J. Bartlett R.R. Agents Actions. 1994; 38: 80-82Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that leflunomide inhibits anti-CD3-stimulated IL-2R expression. To further test this hypothesis, enriched human T cells were stimulated by plastic-immobilized anti-CD3 mAb alone or by plastic-immobilized anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA either in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of leflunomide. Cell culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h, and IL-2 in the supernatant was quantitated. The results in Fig. 4A show that leflunomide partially inhibited IL-2 production in human T cells following stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb alone (IC50 = 40 μM) or with anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA (IC50 = 50-100 μM). In contrast, leflunomide inhibited IL-2R expression in human T cells stimulated by CD3 alone with an IC50 of approximately 50 μM, but did not inhibit IL-2R expression when T cells were stimulated with PMA alone or anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect of leflunomide on tyrosine phosphorylation was further investigated by testing whether leflunomide was able to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphorylation in IL-2-stimulated CTLL-4 cells. The data presented in Fig. 5 show that stimulation of CTLL-4 cells with IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins with molecular masses of approximately 42, 60, 78-80, 85, 90, 110, and 130 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately 60 kDa protein, whose identity is not known, was strongly induced by IL-2, but this induction was not inhibited by leflunomide. The IC50 values of leflunomide required for inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of 42-, 78-80-, 85-, 90-, 110-, and 130-kDa proteins were calculated as 120, 48, 100, 36, 88, and 170 μM, respectively. The results described here support the hypothesis that leflunomide acts as an immunosuppressive agent by inhibiting the activity of protein-tyrosine kinases. Leflunomide inhibited p56lck and p59fyn activity in in vitro kinase assays and also intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation in anti-CD3-stimulated Jurkat cell lines and IL-2-stimulated CTLL-4. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is important for the initiation of cellular responses triggered by the TCR·CD3 complex, despite the lack of intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of either the TCR or the CD3 molecular complex. It has been suggested by Weiss and Littman (22Weiss A. Littman D. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) that specific consensus sequences, antigen recognition activation motifs, on CD3 molecules become phosphorylated by constitutively associated protein-tyrosine kinases such as p59fyn and/or p56lck (22Weiss A. Littman D. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 23Tsgankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley R.B. Penhallow R.C. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7792-7800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phosphorylated motifs then serve as substrates for additional cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, thereby allowing the recruitment of additional effector molecules to the aggregated receptors via SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain of the CD3 complex is critical for successful TCR·CD3-mediated signaling. We here report that leflunomide inhibited CD3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of total intracellular proteins (IC50 values of ~5-45 μM) and specifically of the ζ chain (IC50 of 35 μM). The cross-linking of the TCR·CD3 complex also induces PLC-γ1 activity. Biochemical and genetic data indicate that the activation of PLC-γ1 occurs by the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (21Park D.J. Rho H.W. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5453-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 occurs is not clear, but it appears to require, either directly or indirectly, p56lck kinase function (22Weiss A. Littman D. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). We report that the CD3-stimulated phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was also inhibited by leflunomide at an IC50 of 44 μM. Since the activation of PLC-γ1 is thought to contribute directly to the rapid and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, we predicted that leflunomide would also inhibit [Ca2+]i mobilization in Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. Leflunomide was indeed able to inhibit [Ca2+]i mobilization with an IC50 of approximately 50 μM in Jurkat cells stimulated by anti-CD3 mAb but not by ionomycin. These findings further corroborate the conclusion that leflunomide inhibits T cell activation by selectively inhibiting protein-tyrosine kinase activity. The inhibitory effects of leflunomide on distal events of anti-CD3-mediated activation, namely, IL-2 production and IL-2R expression, were examined in purified human T lymphocytes since the production of IL-2 in Jurkat cells stimulated by anti-CD3 mAbs is undetectable and IL-2R expression is also marginally detectable or undetectable (24Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the production of IL-2 in T lymphocytes stimulated by PMA alone is also undetectable (11Trevillyan J.M. Lu Y. Atluru D. Phillips C.A. Bjorndahl J.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3223-3230PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous observations (16Chong A.S.-F. Finnegan A. Jiang X.L. Gebel H. Sankary H.N. Foster P. Williams J.W. Transplantation. 1993; 55: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), leflunomide partially inhibited IL-2 production when T lymphocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb or co-stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody and PMA. In agreement with a previous report (25Zielinski T. Mueller H.-J. Bartlett R.R. Agents Actions. 1994; 38: 80-82Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), leflunomide was able to inhibit IL-2R expression in human T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb, but not IL-2R expression when the cells were stimulated with PMA alone or PMA plus anti-CD3 mAb. Since PMA can directly activate protein kinase C, thus bypassing the early activation of tyrosine kinase, our observations further support the notion that leflunomide inhibits early protein-tyrosine kinase activity, thereby blocking T cell activation. Differences in ability of leflunomide to inhibit IL-2 production versus IL-2R expression could reflect the differences in signals regulating IL-2 production and IL-2R expression. However, we have not excluded the possibility that leflunomide may inhibit T cell activation independent of inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinases. A number of studies have demonstrated that activation of T cells by protein kinase C stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase, microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 2-kinase (26Nel A.E. Hanekom C. Rheeder A. Williams K. Pollack S. Katz R. Landreth G.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nel A.E. Hanekom C. Hultin L. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of MAP 2-kinase requires phosphorylation on both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (28Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MAP 2-kinase is mediated by the serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase, MAP 2-kinase kinase (29Alessandrini A. Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8200-8204Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Crews C.M. Alessanderine A. Ericson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Our observation that leflunomide cannot inhibit PMA-stimulated IL-2R expression lead us to speculate that leflunomide cannot inhibit MAP 2-kinase kinase activity. Experiments demonstrating that genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could not inhibit PMA-stimulated IL-2R expression (11Trevillyan J.M. Lu Y. Atluru D. Phillips C.A. Bjorndahl J.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3223-3230PubMed Google Scholar) support this hypothesis. It has been previously reported that leflunomide is able to block proliferation of human T cells stimulated by IL-2 (16Chong A.S.-F. Finnegan A. Jiang X.L. Gebel H. Sankary H.N. Foster P. Williams J.W. Transplantation. 1993; 55: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and also CTLL-4 cell proliferation in response to IL-2 stimulation (IC50 = 40 μM).2( 2X. Xu, unpublished results.) We here demonstrate that IL-2-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in CTLL-4 cells was inhibited by leflunomide; the IC50 doses for the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of 78-80- and 90-kDa proteins were 48 and 36 μM, respectively. These doses are close to the IC50 values for CTLL-4 cell proliferation. Therefore, the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in IL-2-stimulated CTLL-4 cells may account for the inhibition of cell proliferation. The mechanism by which leflunmide inhibits protein-tyrosine kinases is not known. CTLL-4 cells stimulated with IL-2 express dramatically elevated p59fyn activity. When CTLL-4 cells were stimulated with IL-2 in the presence of leflunomide and p59fyn activity was analyzed by in vitro kinase assay, in the absence of leflunomide, p59fyn activity was comparable with that from cells not treated with leflunomide (data not shown). This result therefore suggests that leflunomide does not inhibit the activation of p59fyn but inhibits the ability p56fyn to phosphorylate. The potent immunosuppressive activity of leflunomide was revealed by in vivo studies of autoimmune disease, arthritis, and in transplantation models. In addition, preliminary clinical studies with rheumatoid arthritis patients revealed that leflunomide mediated clinical and immunogical improvements with minimal toxicity (13Bartlett R.R. Dinitrijevic M. Mattar T. Aielinski T. Germann T. Rude E. Thoenes G.H. Küchle C.C.A. Schorlemmer H.-U. Bremmer E. Finnegan A. Schleyerbach R. Agents Actions. 1991; 32: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Despite these exciting results, little is known of the mechanism of action of leflunomide. We here report that leflunomide has the ability to inhibit Src family kinase activity and speculate that this may be one mechanism by which leflunomide exerts its immunosuppressive activity. The concentrations of leflunomide (A771726) necessary for inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity in T cells (≧50 μM) are easily attainable as blood levels in humans in the absence of significant toxicity.3( 3R. R. Bartlett, personal communication.) The serum concentration of leflunomide (A771726) in Lewis rat that effectively prevents cardiac allograft rejection ranges from 10-100 μM.4( 4J. W. Williams, unpublished results.) These observations suggest that leflunomide may represent a new class of immunomodulatory agents with tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, and it may be useful as a pharmacological tool to further dissect the role of tyrosine kinases in antigen- or cytokine-driven T cell activation in vivo. We thank Dr. Christopher E. Rudd for generously providing us with anti-fyn serum, Dr. Craig Hall for providing us with anti-ζ mAb, Dr. Robert Bartlett (Hoechst AG, Wiesbald, Germany) for leflunomide (A771726), and Cetus Corp. (Emeryville, CA) for human recombinant IL-2. Addendum-After submission of this manuscript, a second activity of leflunomide, inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis, was reported (31Zielinski T. Zeiter D. Mueller S. Bartlett R.R. Inflammation Research. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nair R. Cao W. Morris R. J. Heart Lung Transpl. 1995; (Suppl.): 554Google Scholar). We have confirmed those studies and observed that the anti-proliferative activities of leflunomide can be reversed by the addition of uridine, and in some cases, cytidine. However, we also observed that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity could not be reversed by uridine. Thus it appears that leflunomide has two independent activities on T cells and that the relative contribution of both activities to the immunosuppressive effect of leflunomide in vivo requires further definition."
https://openalex.org/W2058403440,"Previous studies showed that grasshopper semaphorin I, a transmembrane semaphorin, functions in vivo to steer a pair of growth cones, prevent defasciculation, and inhibit branching; and that chick collapsin, a secreted semaphorin, can function in vitro to cause growth cone collapse. Semaphorin II, a secreted semaphorin in Drosophila, is transiently expressed by a single large muscle during motoneuron outgrowth and synapse formation. To test the in vivo function of semaphorin II, we created transgenic Drosophila that generate ectopic semaphorin II expression by muscles that normally do not express it. The results show that semaphorin II can function in vivo as a selective target-derived signal that inhibits the formation of specific synaptic terminal arbors."

This phenomenon has been best exemplified in the covalent modification of the G protein-linked catecholamine receptors.

Here we present evidence that desensitization occurs at the level of the effector enzyme itself through phosphorylation. Type V adenylyl cyclase (AC) is the major isoform expressed in the heart. Using purified enzymes, we demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA) directly phosphorylates and thereby inhibits type V AC catalytic activity. This inhibition was negated in the presence of PKA inhibitor. Analysis of enzyme kinetics revealed that this inhibition was due to a decrease in the catalytic rate, not to a decrease in the affinity for the substrate ATP.

Our results indicate that AC catalytic activity can be regulated through PKA-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting another mechanism of desensitization for receptor pathways which signal via increases in intracellular cAMP. Occupation of cell surface catecholamine receptors by norepinephrine released from the synaptic terminal evokes signaling via the stimulatory GTP regulatory protein, Gs, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase (AC).1( 1The abbreviations used are: ACadenylyl cyclasePKAprotein kinase ABARKβ adrenergic receptor kinasePKCprotein kinase CGPTγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)PKA-RSPKA-regulatory subunitPKA-CSPKA-catalytic subunitPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) AC is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP, an intracellular second messenger, activates protein kinase A (PKA), which initiates an enzymatic cascade of phosphorylation reactions within the cell. Examples are various enzymes involved in myocyte contraction in the heart and those involved in glycolysis in the liver. adenylyl cyclase protein kinase A β adrenergic receptor kinase protein kinase C guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) PKA-regulatory subunit PKA-catalytic subunit polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Besides initiating this downstream signaling cascade, PKA also phosphorylates proteins located upstream of this signaling pathway, i.e. catecholamine receptors, thereby mediating their desensitization (1Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor makes the molecule less efficient in coupling to the G protein. The receptor is also phosphorylated and uncoupled by another kinase, termed β adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK). A unique feature of BARK is that it only phosphorylates the agonist-bound form of the receptor. BARK presumably recognizes changes in the tertiary structure of the receptor caused by ligand binding, thus phosphorylating only the activated form of the receptor. Nevertheless, in both cases receptor phosphorylation occurs only when the signaling pathway is activated; it is triggered either by agonist occupation of the receptor or by cyclic AMP formation as a result of receptor activation, thus forming a closed loop of negative feedback. More recently, we have demonstrated that AC itself can also be regulated by phosphorylation (2Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs through protein kinase C (PKC) in an isoenzyme-specific manner, and actually leads to an enhancement of catalytic activity. In contrast, the exact role of AC modification in the process of desensitization remains unknown. Amino acid sequence analysis of AC reveals the presence of multiple putative PKA-sensitive motifs within this molecule (3Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the AC molecule itself and consequent changes in catalytic activity have not been clearly demonstrated; these were the goals of the present study. Plasmid construction and purification of the recombinant hexa-histidine tagged type V AC were performed as described previously (2Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, High Five insect cells (1 × 109 cells) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus and harvested 60-70 h after infection. Cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4°C. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. Membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 150,000 × g at 4°C for 40 min, followed by suspension in buffer A (20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) with protease inhibitors, and were recentrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The membranes were then resuspended in buffer A with 0.8% dodecyl maltoside. After incubation and centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was further incubated with forskolin-CH Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 16 h at 4°C. After washing, AC was eluted with 200 μM forskolin and 0.2% dodecyl maltoside in buffer A. The eluate was further incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, CA) at 4°C for 30 min. After washing, the enzyme was eluted with buffer A containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside and 100 mM imidazole. The eluate was buffer changed and concentrated using Centricon-100 (Amicon, MA) and stored at −80°C until use. Type V AC was incubated in the presence or absence of forskolin (100 μM) or GTPγS-Gsα in a buffer containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at 30°C for 10 min. Various amounts of PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-CS) (Sigma) were then added in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM ATP, 1 mM creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase in the absence or presence of PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-RS) (Sigma) at 25°C for 10 min. Cyclic AMP production, as a measurement of AC catalytic activity, was measured at 30°C for 10 min as described previously (4Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the mixture was assayed in a solution containing 1 mM creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM cAMP, 0.2 mM ATP, and [α-32P]ATP (0.2-5 mCi/assay tube) followed by the addition of 100 μl of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. [3H]cAMP was used as an internal standard to measure overall recovery. Protein concentration was determined by staining with Amido Black (5Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was monitored using a PKA assay system (Life Technologies, Inc.) with Kemptide as substrate. PKA-CS was incubated in 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM ATP, 1 mM creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, [γ-32P]ATP (12-24 mCi/assay tube) with 50 mM Kemptide as substrate at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by spotting the sample mixture onto a phosphocellulose disc and the incorporation of 32P into Kemptide from [γ-32P]ATP was measured using scintillation counting. Purified type V AC was phosphorylated either with 6 units/ml PKCα or with 200 units/ml PKA-CS in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above and previously (2Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After separation on 8% SDS-PAGE, the phosphorylated type V AC was excised and rehydrated as described (6Bredt D. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated protein was further digested at 37°C for 18 h in a buffer containing 50 mM (NH4)2CO3 and 0.3 mg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma), followed by lyophilization. The trypsin digests were resuspended in a loading buffer containing 1 M acetic acid, 0.05 M NH4OH, 6 M urea, 5% glycerol, and applied to an acidic 45% polyacrylamide gel designed for separating small peptides. The limit of resolution of this acidic gel electrophoresis is approximately 100 daltons (7West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiography was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of purified type V AC with PKA resulted in a decrease in both basal (85 ± 3% of control, mean ± S.E., p < 0.05, n = 4) and stimulated (with GTPγS-Gsα, 72 ± 3%; with forskolin, 57 ± 3%, p < 0.01, n = 4) AC catalytic activity. The two different preparations of PKA-CS, one partially purified from cardiac tissue (Sigma) and the other purified from Escherichia coli overexpressing recombinant PKA-CS (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), both produced a similar degree of inhibition. When analyzed on SDS-PAGE, the partially purified PKA showed a major band at 45 Kd, while that from E. coli showed a single band at the same molecular weight (data not shown). We also examined whether PKA affects any of the components in the cyclase assay buffer, such as creatine phosphokinase. After phosphorylating AC with PKA in the absence of the regeneration system, we started the cAMP production assay by adding the hot mixtures and regeneration system in the presence of an excess amount of PKA inhibitor. However, this did not alter the results (115 ± 9 nmol/min/mg in the absence of PKA, 66 ± 9 nmol/min/mg in the presence of PKA, n = 3, p < 0.05). This indicates that the inhibition of AC by PKA is not through affecting the regeneration system within the reaction mixture. In order to examine the specificity of this inactivation, we examined the effect of PKA-RS, a specific inhibitor of PKA-CS, on PKA-mediated inhibition of type V AC catalytic activity (Fig. 2). Addition of PKA-RS negated the inhibition by PKA in a concentration dependent manner (0-300 units/ml). We also performed a time course study on this inhibition. Type V AC was incubated in the presence or absence of PKA. The degree of phosphorylation was time-dependent and paralleled that of inhibition as assessed by the incorporation of 32P into type V AC (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Time course study on adenylyl cyclase inhibition by protein kinase A. AC catalytic activity was plotted as a function of time. Type V AC was incubated in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 0.1 mM cAMP, 0.2 mM ATP, and [α-32P]ATP and 100 μM forskolin in the presence or absence of PKA (200 units/ml) (Sigma) or PKI (10 units/ml) (New England Biolabs) for 30 min. Small aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after the initiation of the reaction, and were added to 2% SDS to terminate the reaction. The 32P-phosphorylation of AC was similarly performed except that [γ-32P]ATP was used instead of [α-32P]ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Enzyme kinetic analysis using a Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed that this inhibition was due to a decrease in the catalytic rate (Vmax = 410 ± 32 nmol/min⋅mg without PKA-mediated phosphorylation, 231 ± 30 nmol/min⋅mg with PKA-mediated phosphorylation, p < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 4). The Km for ATP was unaltered (38 ± 9 μM without PKA-mediated phosphorylation, 39 ± 3 μM with PKA-mediated phosphorylation, p = not significant, n = 3). We also compared the pattern of phosphorylation catalyzed by PKA to that of PKC. We had previously shown that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of type V AC leads to an enhancement of its catalytic activity (2Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type V AC was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP either with PKA-CS or with PKCα, followed by trypsin digestion. The digests were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The phosphopeptide mapping pattern was then determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5, the sites phosphorylated by the two kinases were different. The present study demonstrates that PKA directly phosphorylates and inactivates type V AC. Inactivation of type V AC results from a decreased catalytic rate, not from a decreased affinity for the substrate ATP. The sites of phosphorylation by PKA, as assessed by phosphopeptide mapping, were different from those phosphorylated by PKC. The degree of inhibition was more prominent when AC was stimulated with forskolin or with Gsα. However, the basal form of AC was more heat-unstable, which has made it difficult to interpret these data. We did not see, on the other hand, gross difference in the degree and sites of phosphorylation in the phosphopeptide mapping studies between basal and stimulated AC. PKA-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of AC may represent an alternative mechanism for heterologous desensitization of the G protein-coupled receptor pathways that lead to cAMP production. Catecholamine-mediated desensitization has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, particularly, uncoupling of the β-adrenergic receptor from Gs by phosphorylation (1Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Indeed, regulation of the efficiency of receptor coupling to G proteins by phosphorylation is a well accepted mechanism to explain both homologous (by BARK) and heterologous (by PKA) desensitization. Desensitization may also result from sequestration and down-regulation of receptors. Multiple approaches have been utilized to study the role of kinases involved in desensitization of the β-adrenoreceptor/cAMP signaling pathway. It was first demonstrated that in vitro phosphorylation of the purified receptor by the two kinases, PKA and BARK, diminishes receptor function as measured by GTPase activity (8Benovic J.L. Pike L.J. Cerione R.A. Staniszewski C. Yoshimasa T. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7094-7107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, utilizing a series of receptor mutants in which the phosphorylation sites had been removed, the same group demonstrated that these mutant receptors bound ligand and activated AC normally, but underwent markedly less agonist promoted desensitization upon stimulation (9Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liggett S.B. Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. O'Dowd B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 641-646PubMed Google Scholar). While the vast majority of prior studies of desensitization have focused at the level of the receptor (11Clark R.B. Friedman J. Dixon R.A.F. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sibley D.R. Peters J.R. Nambi P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9742-9749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alteration of other components within the β-adrenoreceptor/cAMP production pathway has been suggested to result in heterologous desensitization. Earlier studies had suggested PKA-dependent modulation of Gs activity as a mechanism for regulation (13Kassis S. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Premont R.T. Iyengar R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Kirchick H.J. Iyengar R. Birnbaumer L. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). More recent studies have suggested that modulation of the catalyst AC may play a role in heterologous desensitization (16Premont R.T. Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of chick hepatocytes with glucagon or 8-bromo-cAMP results in desensitization of receptor-stimulated AC activity. The addition of excess purified Gs to desensitized hepatocyte membranes, however, did not fully restore Gsα-stimulated AC activity, pointing to hormone-induced desensitization at the level of catalyst as the mechanism. The recent cloning of multiple mammalian ACs has finally allowed structure-function studies of this relatively poorly characterized component of the cAMP signaling pathway to be carried out (17Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We had identified an AC isoform from a canine cardiac cDNA library, designated as type V (18Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of this isoform is restricted to the heart and brain. Interestingly, type V AC is the major isoform in the adult heart where catecholamine-mediated desensitization has been extensively investigated over the past decade in various pathophysiological conditions (19Tobise K. Ishikawa Y. Holmer S.R. Im M.-J. Newell J.B. Yoshie H. Fujita M. Susannie E.E. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Homcy C.J. Vatner S.F. Vatner D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 137-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have more recently reported that type V AC is potently regulated through PKC-mediated phosphorylation (2Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two PKC isoenzymes, PKCα and PKCζ, directly phosphorylate type V AC at unique residues, leading to a 10-20-fold increase in catalytic activity. The degree of this activation is greater than that achieved by forskolin, the most potent AC agonist. Furthermore, the two PKC isoenzymes are additive in their capacity to activate AC. These data indicate that phosphorylation is a potent mechanism to activate type V AC, which, unlike other AC isoforms, is insensitive to other modulators, such as G protein βγ subunits or calcium/calmodulin. In contrast, the present study demonstrates that PKA-mediated phosphorylation inhibits type V AC. Thus, type V AC is subject to dual regulation by phosphorylation: activation by PKC and inhibition by PKA, mediated via phosphorylation at unique residues within the type V molecule as demonstrated by phosphopeptide mapping. A similar dual regulation by these two kinases has been shown in the case of potassium channels (21Wang W.H. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9722-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Chen Y. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7839-7842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within type V AC, there are 14 serine/threonine residues encompassed by a consensus sequence for PKA-mediated phosphorylation and 11 residues for PKC-mediated phosphorylation; however, we do not know the exact residues responsible for mediating the functional alteration in catalytic activity. PKA-mediated inactivation of AC creates a feedback system within the cAMP signaling pathway, which is analogous to PKC-mediated inhibition of the phospholipase C pathway (23Ryu S.H. Kim U.H. Wahl M.I. Brown A.B. Carpenter G. Huang K.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ozawa K. Yamada K. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2280-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catecholamine stimulation in the heart activates both the phospholipase C/PKC pathway via α-adrenoreceptors and the AC/PKA pathway via β-adrenergic receptors. Thus, dual regulation of AC by PKC and PKA may play a major role in integrating these two principal signal transduction pathways and thereby modulate neuronal and hormonal input to the heart. We do not know, however, whether other AC isoforms are similarly regulated through PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation. We thank Dr. R. Iyengar (Mount Sinai Medical School) for helpful discussion. Note Added in Proof-A similar PKA-mediate inhibition of AC was found in type VI (R. Iyengar, personal communication)."

We previously demonstrated that 2500 base pairs of the hINV gene upstream regulatory region confers differentiation appropriate regulation in transgenic mice. An analysis of the hINV gene sequence upstream of the transcription start site reveals five potential AP1 binding sites (AP1-1 to 5). Using reporter gene constructs in human keratinocytes, we show that the most distal (AP1-5) and most proximal (AP1-1) AP1 sites are essential for high level transcriptional activity. Simultaneous mutation of these sites reduces transcription by 80%. Gel supershift experiments indicate the interaction of these sites with Fra-1, junB, and junD. Involucrin mRNA levels increase 10-fold and promoter activity 5-11-fold when differentiation is induced by phorbol ester. Functional studies implicate AP1-1 and AP1-5 in mediating the phorbol ester-dependent increase in promoter activity. No involucrin promoter activity or involucrin mRNA was detected in 3T3 fibroblasts. We conclude that (i) two AP1 sites in the hINV promoter are important elements required for keratinocyte-specific expression, (ii) these AP1-1 sites mediate the phorbol ester-dependent increase in promoter activity, and (iii) Fra-1, junB, and junD may be important regulators of hINV expression in epidermis.

The human epidermis is a keratinizing squamous epithelium consisting of several distinct layers (for review, see Ref. 1Eckert R.L. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1316-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The basal layer is located adjacent to the dermis and consists of relatively undifferentiated, proliferative cells. During the process of terminal differentiation the keratinocytes, responding to unknown stimuli, withdraw from the cell cycle, migrate from the basal to the superficial layers of the epidermis, and simultaneously undergo morphological and biochemical changes. The terminal cell consists of a network of cytokeratin filaments surrounded by an insoluble envelope of heavily cross-linked protein (2Rice R.H. Green H.

Little is known about mechanisms responsible for tissue- and differentiation-specific regulation in most systems. In skin, however, evidence implicating the protein kinase C-AP1 pathways is rapidly accumulating (16Fisher C. Byers M.R. Iadarola M.J. Powers E.A.

AP1 was initially described as a DNA binding activity in HeLa cell extracts that recognized specific sites in the SV40 enhancer (19Lee W. Haslinger A. Karin M. Tijian R. Nature. 1987; 325: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Specific DNA binding sites have since been identified in a wide variety of genes (20Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R.

Several findings have lead to speculation about a possible regulatory role for AP1 proteins in the epidermal differentiation process. In most quiescent adult human tissues, levels of the AP1 component c-fos, for example, are extremely low, but are rapidly induced by mitogenic stimuli (36Muller R. Tremblay J.M. Adamson E.D. Verma I.M. Nature. 1983; 304: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, fos is constitutively expressed at high levels in the non-proliferative differentiating suprabasal epidermal layers (16Fisher C. Byers M.R. Iadarola M.J. Powers E.A.

Transgenic studies from our laboratory suggest that a 2.5-kilobase fragment of the human involucrin gene (hINV)1( 1The abbreviations used are: hINVhuman involucrinKSFMserum-free keratinocyte mediaTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.) upstream of the transcription start site contains all of the information required for tissue-specific and differentiation-appropriate targeting to the epidermis (40Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Zaim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study we (i) identify five AP1 sites within this upstream regulatory region and confirm that two of these sites are necessary for expression of the gene in keratinocytes, (ii) demonstrate that the promoter is inactive in fibroblasts, (iii) show that the AP1 transcription factors Fra-1, junB, and junD are major contributors to the protein complexes which bind at these two sites, and (iv) show that these sites are important mediators of the inductive response observed following treatment with phorbol esters. human involucrin serum-free keratinocyte media 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Serum-free keratinocyte media (KSFM), trypsin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, gentamicin, and Lipofectin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The plasmids pGL2-Basic, pGL2-Control, and pSV-β-galactosidase, the GL-2 polymerase chain reaction primer, AP1 and SP1 consensus sequence oligonucleotides, and the chemiluminescent luciferase assay systems were obtained from Promega. The T/A cloning vector, pCRII, and competent INV-αF′ bacteria were purchased from Invitrogen. The Galactolight β-galactosidase chemiluminescent assay system was obtained from Tropix. Dispase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, [γ-32P]ATP from DuPont NEN. Phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, TPA) and dimethyl sulfoxide were from the Sigma. Chemiluminescence was measured using a Berthold luminometer and oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Transcription factor binding sites in the hINV promoter were identified using the Signal Scan DNA sequence analysis program (41Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 203-206PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against transcription factors were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals and were rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides. The broad spectrum anti-c-fos antibody (pan-fos) was raised against the highly conserved c-fos amino acids 128-152, and reacts with c-fos, fosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. The broad spectrum anti-c-jun antibody (pan-jun) was raised against amino acids 247-263 of mouse c-jun, and cross-reacts with c-jun, junB, and junD. The remaining antibodies used in this study (c-fos, fosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-jun, junB, and junD) were raised against sequences specific to each protein and do not cross-react. The plasmids used in this study include pSP64λI-3 H/Hc, which contains a HindIII/HincII fragment of the hINV gene including approximately 2.5-kilobase pairs of upstream regulatory sequence, the TATA box, and the hINV intron (12Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), pUC1813 (42Kay R. McPherson J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and pGL2-Basic, a promoterless luciferase reporter vector. To construct plasmids for the deletion series, a 2.4-kilobase pair HindIII/CelII fragment of the hINV gene including positions −7 to −2473 relative to the transcription start site was released from pSP64λI-3 H/Hc. The ends of this fragment were made blunt with Klenow polymerase prior to cloning into SmaI-restricted pUC1813 to produce pUC1813λI-3 HindIII/CelII, in which the hINV segment is flanked by BamHI sites. The BamHI fragment encoding the hINV sequence was then subcloned into BglII-restricted pGL2-Basic. The resulting clones were screened for the appropriate orientation of the inserted DNA fragment by restriction mapping. The plasmid containing the hINV insert in the appropriate orientation was named pINV-2473 based on the nucleotide at the most 5′ end of the hINV segment, as determined by counting backwards from the start site of transcription of the hINV gene (12Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Maps of the hINV promoter-luciferase fusion constructs are shown in Fig. 1. The other plasmids in the series were produced by removing promoter segments using restriction enzymes, or by reconstructing gene segments using the polymerase chain reaction, and are also named according to the 5′ most nucleotide from the hINV sequence. pINV-793 was used as a template to produce three constructs, pINV-679, pINV-489, and pINV-298, by polymerase chain reaction. Involucrin sequence-specific oligonucleotides served as upstream primers and a pGL2-Basic-specific primer, GL-2 (Promega), was used as the downstream primer. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pCRII for further amplification and finally subcloned into pGL2-Basic. To create the plasmids containing mutated AP1-1 and/or AP1-5 sites (see below, and), convenient restriction sites flanking the AP1 sites were identified, and the fragments containing the wild type AP1 sites were released by restriction digestion. Oligonucleotides identical to the wild type sequences between these restriction sites, except for the mutated bases, were synthesized and ligated into the parent constructs. Conservative thymidine to cytosine mutations at position 5 of the consensus binding sequence were chosen (43Risse G. Jooss K. Neuberg M. Bruller H.J. Muller R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the junction between the hINV gene sequences and the luciferase reporter gene sequence are identical in all constructs. Primary human keratinocytes were cultured from human foreskin samples. Foreskin specimens were stored overnight at 4°C in KSFM containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin. The specimens were rinsed for several minutes in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 μg/ml gentamicin, cleaned of connective tissue, and incubated for 18 h at 4°C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mg/ml dispase to separate the epidermis from the dermis (44Longley J. Ding T.G. Cuono C. Durden F. Crooks C. Hufeisen S. Eckert R. Wood G.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 974-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sheet of epidermis was then dissociated with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.0 mM EDTA for 5 min at 37°C. The trypsin was neutralized with serum and the cells were plated in KSFM at 1-3 × 106 cells per 10-cm2 dish. The cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, split at a 1:5 ratio when 70% confluent, and used for transfection at the third passage. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cells were grown as described previously (45Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in 60-mm diameter dishes when 60% confluent. Sixteen micrograms of Lipofectin reagent, 3.5 μg of test plasmid, 0.5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase (an SV40 promoter/enhancer β-galactosidase reporter vector, as an internal standard) were mixed, added to cells in 3 ml of KSFM, and incubated for 5 h at 37°C. A parallel set of dishes was co-transfected with 3.5 μg of pGL2-Control (luciferase driven by the SV40 promoter/enhancer, Promega) and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase. At 5 h, 3 ml of KSFM was added and the incubation continued for an additional 19 h. The cells were then allowed to recover for 24 h in fresh KSFM. At this point, the cultures were washed once with KSFM and then treated for 24 h with KSFM containing 50 ng of TPA/ml (from 5 mg/ml stocks in Me2SO) to induce differentiation (46Wirth P.J. Yuspa S.H. Thorgeirsson S.S. Hennings H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2831-2838PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 250 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and harvested by scraping. Luciferase assays were performed immediately using a Berthold luminometer and the Promega luciferase assay kit. Cell extract (20 μl) and 100 μl of luciferin mixture were reacted for 5 s and light output was monitored over the next 10 s. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on duplicate aliquots using the Galactolight reagent system. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Within each experiment, differences in transfection efficiency were normalized to the β-galactosidase internal standard by dividing the involucrin luciferase signal by the pSV-β-galactosidase signal. However, use of the β-galactosidase signal was not adequate to normalize between experiments using different cell lines. For this reason, we divided the normalized luciferase activity of each involucrin construct by the normalized pGL2-Control luciferase activity and expressed the results in dimensionless, arbitrary units. Passage 3 keratinocytes were grown in KSFM until 80% confluent and were then treated with KSFM supplemented with 50 ng of TPA/ml for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared at approximately 0.5-2.0 mg of protein/ml according to the method of Dignam et al.(47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) or as described by Schreiber et al.(48Schreiber E. Matthias P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Band shifts were conducted by incubating a 20-μl reaction containing 15% glycerol, 75 mM KCl, 0.375 mM dithiothreitol, 0.375 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12.5 mM NaCl, 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 2.5 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.3 ng of radiolabeled DNA for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were immediately electrophoresed at 250 V for 1.5 h on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels using a one-fourth × TBE running buffer, dried, and autoradiographed. For competition studies, radioinert DNA competitor was added at a 20- or 200-fold molar excess. The reaction mixtures were assembled as outlined above without the 32P-labeled oligomer and incubated with antibodies specific for jun or fos family members (1 μg of antibody per 2 μg of nuclear extract) for 2 h at 4°C. The 32P-labeled DNA oligomer was then added, incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then immediately electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. In control reactions, the antibody was replaced with bovine serum albumin (1 μg of bovine serum albumin/2 μg of nuclear extract). The constructs shown in Fig. 1 were transfected into cultured human epidermal keratinocytes, and assayed for the ability to drive production of luciferase activity (Fig. 2). pINV-2473 and pINV-2216 produce high levels of luciferase activity. Elimination of 80 base pairs of pINV-2136 reduces the activity by 45% and luciferase activity fluctuates between 30 and 55% of maximum for pINV-1336, −1261, −1152, −1091, −986, −793, −679, −489, −298, −241, and −159. However, truncation to position −41, pINV-41, results in a drop in activity to 2.5% of the level observed for plasmids pINV-2473 or pINV-2216. The upstream regulatory region of the hINV promoter contains four motifs having homology to the AP1 binding site, 5′-TGANT(C/A)NN-3′, where N is any nucleotide (20Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) and one site similar to the putative AP1 motif 5′-GAGAGGAA-3′ (49Distel R.J. Ro H.S. Rosen B.S. Groves D.L. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 835-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Their positions in the hINV upstream segment are shown in Fig. 1 and their sequence in. In the deletion series, the drop in activity observed between −2216/-2136 and −159/-41 in Fig. 2 (open circles) corresponds to the loss of AP1-5 and AP1-1, respectively. Removal of AP1-2, −3, or −4 does not appear to significantly influence the promoter activity. To more specifically analyze the contribution of AP1-1 and AP1-5 to the overall activity of the hINV promoter, we generated hINV promoter constructs in which the AP1-1 and/or AP1-5 site were inactivated (i.e. rendered unable to bind AP1) by changing the T at position 5 in the consensus sequence to C (Table I) (43Risse G. Jooss K. Neuberg M. Bruller H.J. Muller R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the mutation of AP1-1 reduces the promoter activity (solid symbols) for each construct tested.Table I:Sequence of hINV AP1 sites and oligonucleotides Open table in a new tab Similarly, to evaluate the role of AP1-5, cells were transfected with construct pINV-2473 (see Fig. 1) containing an intact or mutated AP1-5 site. Activity of this construct was compared to the activity of a pINV-2473 AP1-1 site mutant and an AP1-1/AP1-5 dual mutant (Fig. 3B). In the experiment shown in Fig. 3B, elimination of AP1-1 or AP1-5 resulted in a 60 and 20% decrease in activity, respectively. Elimination of AP1 consistently resulted in a greater loss of promoter activity than elimination of AP1-5; however, the actual percentages varied among keratinocyte strains. Simultaneous mutation of AP1-1 and AP1-5 results in an 80% decline in activity, suggesting that the contribution of each site to overall activity is additive. Interaction of Nuclear Proteins with the AP1-1 and AP1-5 Sites-To characterize the interaction of nuclear proteins with the AP1-like consensus sites in the hINV regulatory region, we performed gel shift and oligonucleotide competition experiments. The sequence of AP1-1 and −5 are shown in, along with the sequence of other oligonucleotides used in the gel shift experiments. AP1c is a commercially available oligonucleotide. The AP1c consensus binding sequence is identical to the involucrin sequence, but the flanking sequences are different. AP1-1m, AP1-2m, and AP1-5m are mutants of the hINV AP1-1, AP1-2, and AP1-5 sites, respectively, in which the T at position 5 has been changed to C. The change of T to C at this position has been reported to result in a loss of AP1 binding (43Risse G. Jooss K. Neuberg M. Bruller H.J. Muller R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a gel mobility shift experiment in which keratinocyte nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-AP1-1 in the presence or absence of excess radioinert AP1-1, AP1-1m, AP1c, SP1c, AP1-2, or AP1-2m competitor. The 32P-AP1-1 oligonucleotide shifts a major band (arrow) that is competed by oligonucleotides AP1-1, AP1c, and AP1-2, but not by AP1-1m, SP1c, or AP1-2m. Additional competition experiments with 32P-AP1-1 and increasing amounts of radioinert AP1 indicate half-maximal competition at 20-50-fold molar excess (not shown). A mobility shift assay in which 32P-AP1-5 was incubated with radioinert AP1-5, AP1-1, AP1-1m, AP1-2, AP1-2m, SP1c, and AP2c is shown in Fig. 5. The results show specific binding of a major band (arrow) that is competed by AP1 site-encoding oligonucleotides (i.e. AP1-5, AP1-1, AP1-2, and AP1c), but not by non-AP1-encoding sequences (i.e. SP1 and AP2c). Some competition was observed when AP1-1m was present at a 200-fold molar excess, but a 200-fold molar excess of AP1-2m did not compete. Identity of Nuclear Proteins Which Bind to AP1-1 and AP1-5-To identify the factors that interact with the AP1-1 site, nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-AP1-1 in the presence or absence of antibodies specific for various jun and fos family members (Fig. 6A). Lane N shows the migration of free 32P-AP1-1 (arrowhead near gel front) in the absence of extract and the minus lane indicates the shifted protein-DNA complex observed in the absence of antibody (long arrow). The broadly reactive jun and fos antibodies (pan), as well as antibodies specific for fos family member Fra-1 (F1) and jun family members junB (B) and junD (D), produced supershifted bands (short arrows). No shift was observed in samples treated with antibodies specific for c-fos (c), fosB (B), Fra-2 (F2), or c-jun (c). An identical pattern of supershifts is observed when AP1-5 is used as the radioactive probe (Fig. 6B), suggesting that Fra-1, junB, and junD are factors that bind to both AP1-1 and AP1-5.Figure 6:Identity of nuclear factors that interact with the hINV promoter AP1-1 and AP1-5 sites. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.3 ng of 32P-AP1-1 (A) or 0.3 ng of 32P-AP1-5 (B) in the absence (-) or presence of antibodies against pan-fos (pan), c-fos (c), fosB (B), Fra-1 (F1), Fra-2 (F2), pan-jun (pan), c-jun (c), junB (B), or junD (D). The complexes were then electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. The long arrows to the left in each panel indicate the complex formed in the absence of antibody. The short arrows to the right indicate the supershifted complexes. The arrowhead near the gel front indicates free 32P-AP1 oligomer. Nuclear extract was omitted in the lane marked N.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown above, the AP1-1 and AP1-5 sites are functionally important in maintaining optimal transcription in cultures grown in the presence of the differentiating agent, TPA. Fig. 7 shows that TPA treatment (+) increases the level of AP1 activity which binds to the hINV AP1-5 site (and AP1-1, not shown) compared to nuclear extracts prepared from untreated(-) cultures. The level of AP1 binding activity increased between 25 and 200-fold depending upon the experiment. As AP1 has been implicated in mediating the effects of phorbol esters in a variety of systems (20Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar), this suggested that these sites may mediate the TPA-dependent induction of hINV mRNA expression that has been previously reported in keratinocytes (50Younus J. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore further investigated the role of AP1-1 and AP1-5 by testing the activity of full-length (pINV-2473) constructs in which one or both sites are inactivated by point mutation. As summarized in Fig. 8, mutation of the AP1-1, AP1-5, or both sites simultaneously reduces both basal and TPA-stimulated transcriptional activity. In the case of mutation of AP1-5, the overall activity is decreased, but the fold induction by TPA remains stable. Inactivation of AP1-1, in contrast, results in a decrease in the fold induction following TPA treatment. Simultaneous inactivation of AP1-1 and AP1-5 resulted in a >50% reduction in"

In vitro, actin assembly can be controlled by proteins, such as capping protein, that bind filament ends. To investigate the function of actin assembly in vivo, we altered the levels of capping protein in Dictyostelium cells and found changes in resting and chemoattractant-induced actin assembly that were consistent with the in vitro properties of capping protein in capping but not nucleation. Significantly, overexpressers moved faster and underexpressers moved slower than control cells. Mutants also exhibited changes in cytoskeleton architecture. These results provide insights into in vivo actin assembly and the role of the actin cytoskeleton in motility."

Ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid were transported and accumulated distinctly; neither competed with the other. Ascorbate was accumulated as ascorbate by sodium-dependent carrier-mediated active transport.

The analog 6-chloroascorbate had no effect on dehydroascorbic acid transport but was a competitive inhibitor of ascorbate transport. The Ki for 6-chloroascorbate (2.9-4.4 μM) was similar to the Km for ascorbate transport (9.8-12.6 μM). 6-Chloroascorbate was itself transported and accumulated in fibroblasts by a sodium-dependent transporter.

https://openalex.org/W1985162445,"Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is an immunoregulatory cytokine expressed in large granular lymphocytes and T cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IFN-γ gene transcription have not been fully defined. Here, we analyze the mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity by the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone. Cotransfection assays performed in Jurkat T cells demonstrated that the activity of the initial 108 base pairs of the IFN-γ promoter was down-regulated in the presence of dexamethasone. Furthermore, utilizing electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, we identified activator protein 1 AP-1-cAMP response element binding protein-activating transcription factor (CREB-ATF) binding elements situated in positions of the IFN-γ promoter previously identified as essential for promoter activity. Moreover, dominant negative mutants of the c-Jun proto-oncogene were able to mimic the same down-regulatory effect exerted by dexamethasone, and mutations that abolished the binding of the AP-1·CREB-ATF factors were able to block the glucocorticoid effect. These results suggest a model involving the inhibition of IFN-γ AP-1·CREB-ATF DNA binding complexes as one of the mechanisms involved in the negative regulatory action of glucocorticoids on IFN-γ gene expression and support the relevance of AP-1·CREB-ATF binding factors during the transcriptional activation of the IFN-γ promoter in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1501279037,"The mechanism for the reaction of cytochrome c with t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide was investigated. ESR spin trapping studies using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide were performed to demonstrate the presence of hydroperoxide-derived peroxyl, alkoxyl, and methyl radicals. Computer simulation of the experimental data obtained at various 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide concentrations was used to determine the relative contributions of each radical adduct to each composite ESR spectrum. From these analyses, it was concluded that the alkoxyl radical of the hydroperoxide was the initial radical produced, presumably by homolytic scission of the O-O bond by ferric cytochrome c. This was in contrast to a previous ESR study that proposed a heterolytic peroxidase-type mechanism for the reaction of cytochrome c with organic hydroperoxides. Methyl radicals were produced from the beta-scission of the alkoxyl radical. The peroxyl radicals are shown to be secondary products formed from the reaction of oxygen with the methyl radical to produce the methyl peroxyl radical. In separate experiments, visible absorption spectroscopy revealed that the heme center was destroyed during the reaction. Both the heme destruction and production of radical adducts were inhibited by cyanide, presumably due to the formation of a cyanoheme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1996743951,"Apocytochrome c follows a unique pathway into mitochondria. Import does not require the general protein translocation machinery, protease-sensitive components of the outer membrane, or a membrane potential across the inner membrane. We investigated the membrane binding and translocation steps of the import reaction using purified outer membrane vesicles (OMV) from Neurospora crassa mitochondria. OMV specifically bound, but did not import apocytochrome c. If, however, specific antibodies were enclosed inside OMV, apocytochrome c was accumulated in soluble form in the lumen. Import was reversible, since apocytochrome c became accessible to external protease after release from the antibodies. Thus, OMV are competent of translocating apocytochrome c into their lumen, but lack a binding partner which traps the apoprotein. In intact mitochondria, cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL), a peripheral protein of the inner membrane, serves such a function by stably associating with apocytochrome c in a complex which is detectable by co-immunoprecipitation. We suggest a model for the import mechanism of apocytochrome c in which the apoprotein specifically associates with and reversibly passes across the outer membrane. Translocation is rendered unidirectional by stable association with CCHL which serves as a “trans side receptor.” Finally, heme is attached by CCHL and the holoprotein folds into its native structure.

In this reaction a reduced heme group becomes covalently linked via two thioether bonds to cysteines 14 and 17 of the apoprotein (8Nicholson D.W. Köhler H. Neupert W. Eur. J.

The mode of how apocytochrome c passes across the mitochondrial outer membrane defines a unique import pathway that differs in a number of criteria from that of other mitochondrial preproteins (for reviews, see Refs. 10Kiebler M. Becker K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Hannavy K. Rospert S. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Apocytochrome c does not carry a cleavable, N-terminal targeting sequence. Instead, two internal segments of the apoprotein have been reported to be important determinants for targeting (12Jordi W. Li-Xin Pilon Z. Demel R.A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2292-2301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nye S.H. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5763-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Sprinkle J.R.

Unlike for most other mitochondrial preproteins an electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane is not needed for transport (15Zimmermann R. Hennig B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protease-sensitive outer membrane proteins, in particular components of the mitochondrial receptor complex, do not appear to be required for import (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pfaller R. Steger H.F. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2483-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the mechanism of passage across the outer membrane. Extensive studies using artificial liposomes demonstrated a unique membrane insertion activity of apocytochrome c which is dependent on the presence of negatively charged phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylserine; for review, see Ref. 17De Kruijff B. Breukink E. Demel R.A. Van't Hoff R. De Jongh H.H.J. Jordi W. Keller R.C.A. Killian J.A. De Kroon A.I.P.M. Kusters R. Pilon M. Neupert W. Lill R. Membrane Biogenesis and Protein Targeting. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 85-101Google Scholar). At least parts of the apoprotein are able to penetrate the lipid bilayer and thus become accessible to proteases added on the trans side of the membrane (18Rietveld A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6704-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results the spontaneous membrane insertion activity was suggested to be an important feature of the membrane passage of apocytochrome c. However, it remained unclear from these studies, whether in mitochondria apocytochrome c passes across the lipid phase of the outer membrane, or whether yet unknown, protease-resistant membrane proteins assist in the transport reaction. In addition to its enzymatic function during heme attachment, further involvements of CCHL in the biogenesis of apocytochrome c were suggested. For instance, it was proposed that CCHL serves as a high affinity binding site for apocytochrome c(6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant mitochondria lacking CCHL showed only weak binding (7Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nargang F.E. Drygas M.E. Kwong P.L. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9388-9394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an in vivo study accumulation of apocytochrome c in mitochondria correlated well with different levels of CCHL expression (20Dumont M.E. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, a complex between CCHL and apocytochrome c has not been demonstrated directly. Thus, the function of CCHL as a “trans side receptor” for apocytochrome c remains to be proven. A possible third role of CCHL as a component assisting in the membrane passage of apocytochrome c remained elusive from previous work. In this function, CCHL was suggested to associate with apocytochrome c, while the latter is still penetrating the outer membrane (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This might trigger the entry of the apoprotein into the intermembrane space, e.g. by induction of a conformational change and/or by enzymatic conversion to the holoprotein (21Hennig B. Köhler H. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4963-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this paper we have studied the import mechanism of apocytochrome c. For the mechanistic analysis of the membrane binding and translocation reactions, we took advantage of a protein translocation system with isolated outer membrane vesicles (OMV) from Neurospora crassa mitochondria (22Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since these OMV are devoid of CCHL, it was possible to investigate the outer membrane interaction of apocytochrome c without interference by this enzyme. We find that OMV specifically bound apocytochrome c, but did not import it, unless a high affinity binding partner was present on the trans side of the membrane. Since specific antibodies introduced into the lumen of the OMV were sufficient to support import, we conclude that CCHL is not required for outer membrane passage of apocytochrome c. Yet, the protein is needed for stable accumulation of apocytochrome c in the intermembrane space. Binding to CCHL may therefore provide the major driving force rendering the reversible translocation process unidirectional. The following published procedures were used: isolation of mitochondria from N. crassa strain 74A (24Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), purification of OMV (22Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), transcription and translation reactions using reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and [35S]methionine (ICN Radiochemicals) as radioactive label (25Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), preparation of 14C-labeled apocytochrome c by reductive methylation (26Hennig B. Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography or fluorography of the resulting gels (8Nicholson D.W. Köhler H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Blotting of proteins onto nitrocellulose and immunostaining of blotted proteins using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham) was according to the instructions of the supplier. The resulting films and those from fluorography of radioactive proteins were scanned on an Image Master densitometer (Pharmacia). Antisera were raised and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were purified as described (27Söllner T. Griffith G. Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). IgG were concentrated by ultrafiltration in Centriprep tubes (Amicon). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). OMV (80 μg/ml) were diluted 3-fold with buffer EM (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and pelleted for 30 min at 220,000 × g in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman). The OMV were resuspended in 1 ml of EM buffer and spun again for 15 min at 220,000 × g to completely remove residual sucrose. After resuspending the pellet in inclusion buffer (IB; 5 mg/ml BSA, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 6.5) at a protein concentration of 2-4 mg/ml, one volume of purified IgG in water was added (final concentration 5 mg/ml). The sample was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then put into a metal block in an ice/water bath to permit slow thawing. This usually took 15-30 min. After addition of one-fifth volume of 100 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, the sample was incubated for 5 min at 25°C and adjusted to a sucrose concentration of 45% by addition of 60% (w/v) sucrose in buffer EMK (EM plus 150 mM KCl). OMV were recovered from this mixture by flotation centrifugation (45 min, 140,000 × g) through a gradient consisting of 45%, 40% (both in EMK), 32%, and 8% (both in EM) sucrose steps (500 μl/step) in a Beckman SW60 rotor. The OMV were harvested from the 32%/8% sucrose interphase by careful aspiration with a pipette tip and diluted to the desired protein concentration with SEM buffer (250 mM sucrose in EM buffer). 35S-Labeled apocytochrome c was synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate, precipitated with ammonium sulfate (66% saturation), and redissolved in the same volume of SEM buffer. This treatment removes most of the hemoglobin which interferes with the electrophoretic analysis of the supernatants of the translocation experiments. For import 5 μl of this solution were incubated with mitochondria (100 μg/sample) or OMV (7.5 μg/sample) for 5 min at 25°C in SEM buffer in a total volume of 150 μl. Import reactions were chilled on ice, and proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Protease digestion was stopped after 15 min at 0°C by the addition of 2 mM PMSF and further incubation at 25°C for 5 min. Mitochondria or OMV were reisolated (10 min at 15,000 × g or 45 min at 125,000 × g, respectively) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography or autoradiography. In binding experiments where treatment with proteinase K after the import incubation was omitted, all tubes were coated with fatty acid-free BSA (1 mg/ml, 15 min) before use in order to reduce unspecific interaction of apocytochrome c with tube walls. Pelleted OMV were spun again (5 min, 30,000 × g) to remove residual liquid from the tube walls. Finally, the OMV were resuspended in 20 μl of SEM buffer and transferred to new tubes where they were dissolved in sample buffer. After the import reactions, digitonin was added from a 1% (w/v) stock solution in SEM buffer, and the samples were incubated for 2 min at 0°C, followed by 20-fold dilution with SEM buffer containing 100 mM KCl. OMV were reisolated by centrifugation (45 min, 125,000 × g) in a Beckman TLA45 rotor. To the supernatant 50 μg of BSA or 50 μg of mitochondrial protein was added as a carrier to quantitatively recover apocytochrome c in the subsequent trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The trichloroacetic acid precipitates and the reisolated vesicle pellets were dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For sonication experiments, OMV were reisolated after the import reactions and resuspended in 600 μl of SEM buffer containing 100 mM KCl. Samples were sonicated in a glass tube for 1 min at 0°C (Branson Sonifier 250 with a microtip, intensity 4, 30% duty cycle). Membranes and associated material were reisolated and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described for the digitonin treatment. IgG were prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads by shaking 25 μl of antiserum specific for CCHL with 10 mg of beads for 1 h in IP buffer (25 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, and 2% (w/v) octyl glucoside). The Sepharose beads were washed once with IP buffer and then used for the precipitation. The samples to be analyzed were diluted 4-fold with IP buffer, incubated for 15 min at 0°C, and spun for 15 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was added to the Sepharose beads with prebound IgG and shaken gently for 30 min at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of cold IP buffer and once with cold 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, before resuspending in sample buffer. Lipids (from Sigma) were mixed in chloroform in the following molar ratios: 33% bovine brain phosphatidylcholine (P-6638), 30% Escherichia coli phosphatidylethanolamine (P-3511), 7% bovine liver phosphatidylinositol (P-2517), 4% bovine brain phosphatidylserine (P-6641), 1% bovine heart cardiolipin (C-1649), 25% ergosterol (E-6510). The solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator, and the lipid film was overlaid with EM buffer. Liposomes were formed by adding glass beads (2 mm diameter), shaking the tube vigorously on a vortex, and by subsequent sonication (Branson sonifier 250, stage 3, 20% duty cycle). The liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min, 125,000 × g), resuspended in EM buffer at a lipid concentration of 2 mg/ml and stored at −20°C. After thawing aliquots were sonicated briefly before use to disperse aggregates formed during the freeze-thaw cycle. Purified OMV were incubated with 35S-labeled apocytochrome c. A considerable fraction of the added apoprotein (40%) was recovered with the OMV after reisolation by centrifugation, i.e. had bound to the OMV (Fig. 1A). All bound material was sensitive to externally added proteinase K and therefore had not become imported into the lumen of the OMV. The integrity of the outer membrane was assayed by the accessibility of MOM38 to added protease. This integral membrane protein is converted to a 26-kDa N-terminal fragment (MOM38∗) by proteinase K digestion from outside, but becomes further degraded, when the outer membrane is opened (22Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).2( 2M. Kiebler, unpublished results.) In isolated OMV MOM38 was quantitatively converted to MOM38∗ demonstrating the sealed nature of the OMV, even after the import reaction (Fig. 1B). Apparently, purified OMV can bind a substantial fraction of added apocytochrome c, but they do not accumulate the apoprotein in a protease-protected form. Apocytochrome c became bound to isolated mitochondria even more efficiently (Fig. 1A). Two-thirds of bound apocytochrome c were resistant to externally added proteinase K, i.e. had become imported into mitochondria, even though the experiments were performed under non-reducing conditions which do not support the formation of the holoprotein (8Nicholson D.W. Köhler H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The integrity of the outer membrane was determined by using MOM38 and CCHL as marker proteins. 70% of the mitochondria contained an intact outer membrane (Fig. 1C). Since also about two-thirds of bound apocytochrome c were protected against proteolytic attack (Fig. 1A), we conclude that practically all of the mitochondria-associated apocytochrome c was bound to a site beyond the surface of the outer membrane. In an earlier investigation comparatively small amounts of protease-resistant apocytochrome c (10-15% of input) were observed (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy most likely is that the outer membrane was opened in these experiments thus allowing added proteases access to the intermembrane space. Based on previous models, a likely binding site for apocytochrome c was CCHL, which is located at the outer face of the inner membrane (data not shown, 20). We tried to directly demonstrate the interaction of apocytochrome c and CCHL in isolated mitochondria by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Mitochondria-bound apocytochrome c was precipitated with antibodies specific for CCHL, but not by preimmune serum (Fig. 2). Precipitation was strongly decreased by including KCl in the binding reaction, a condition known to affect the binding of apocytochrome c to mitochondria (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, see below). Furthermore, much less material was co-immunoprecipitated if reduced heme was added to convert bound apocytochrome c to the holoprotein (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the release of folded and soluble holocytochrome c into the intermembrane space. We conclude that apocytochrome c becomes efficiently imported into isolated mitochondria where it is found in a complex with CCHL. In contrast, OMV which are depleted in CCHL more than 600-fold (Fig. 1D) do not accumulate the apoprotein in their lumen, even though they are able to bind a substantial fraction. We addressed the question whether CCHL plays an active role in assisting outer membrane passage of apocytochrome c, or whether the enzyme only passively provides a binding site in the intermembrane space. In the latter case, it should be possible to replace CCHL by other binding partners for apocytochrome c in the lumen of the OMV. To this end, purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) which specifically recognized apocytochrome c (data not shown) was enclosed inside the OMV by a recently developed freeze-thaw procedure (28Mayer A. Driessen A.J.M. Neupert W. Lill R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). During the slow thawing period, the membranes are transiently opened allowing equilibration of the vesicle lumen with the external solution. The antibodies were recovered with the OMV only, when added before the freeze-thaw procedure, but not when this procedure was omitted, or when IgG was added after the freeze-thaw treatment (Fig. 3A). After the freeze-thaw step, the OMV maintained a right-side-out orientation as indicated by the protease sensitivity of MOM19. In addition, most of the OMV were sealed as judged from the conversion of MOM38 to its 26-kDa fragment, MOM38∗ (Fig. 3B, cf. Fig. 1, B and C). OMV preloaded with apocytochrome c-specific IgG were incubated with apocytochrome c. 15% of the added apoprotein became resistant to proteinase K, i.e. had completely become transported across the outer membrane (Fig. 4A). No protease-resistant material was observed when the freeze-thaw step had been omitted or when IgG had been added after the freeze-thaw step. Similarly, enclosure of IgG purified from preimmune serum did not result in protease resistance of apocytochrome c. In agreement with earlier import studies using intact mitochondria (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), import into IgG-loaded OMV was unaffected, when surface components of the outer membrane were degraded by pretreatment with proteinase K (Fig. 4B). Taken together, our data show that for accumulation of significant amounts of apocytochrome c a high affinity binding site inside the lumen of the OMV is both necessary and sufficient. Apparently, neither protease-sensitive components on the surface of the outer membrane nor CCHL are essential for the transport of apocytochrome c across the outer membrane. Previous studies have shown that import of apocytochrome c into mitochondria and its interaction with CCHL is abolished at higher salt concentrations (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When tested in the OMV system, both the binding to OMV and the import into IgG-loaded OMV were salt-sensitive (Fig. 5A). The salt sensitivity of the latter reaction was identical to that reported for intact mitochondria (Fig. 5B, 6). Inhibition of import at higher salt concentrations was not a result of an inefficient interaction of apocytochrome c with the IgG enclosed inside the OMV, since apocytochrome c could be immunoprecipitated with the same efficiency under all conditions tested. Thus, in addition to the salt-sensitive interaction of apocytochrome c with CCHL (see above) binding to and transfer across the outer membrane appear to be affected at higher ionic strength. This makes it likely that apocytochrome c itself is the target of the salt sensitivity. The apoprotein may be rendered incompetent for both membrane insertion and CCHL interaction by undergoing a conformational change. We tested whether apocytochrome c translocated into IgG-loaded OMV was soluble in the lumen or was still associated with the outer membrane. After import the vesicles were opened by treatment with increasing amounts of digitonin (29Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Membranes were reisolated by centrifugation, and pellets and supernatants were analyzed for the content of apocytochrome c and IgG. Both proteins were released efficiently into the supernatant at digitonin concentrations which are known to selectively disrupt the outer membrane (Fig. 6A, cf. 22). Membrane proteins were not solubilized at these concentrations of digitonin, since the amount of porin in the pellet fractions remained unchanged. The soluble character of imported apocytochrome c was confirmed in sonication experiments. The import samples were briefly sonified and membranes were reisolated by centrifugation. The majority of imported apocytochrome c and of IgG was recovered in the supernatant, whereas porin as a control appeared in the pellet fraction (Fig. 6B). These independent approaches demonstrate that apocytochrome c became translocated into the lumen of the OMV, where it was in a soluble complex with IgG. The results presented above show that apocytochrome c is accumulated on the intermembrane space side of the outer membrane, if a high affinity binding partner is available. This suggested that apocytochrome c can traverse the outer membrane in a reversible fashion. We sought to directly demonstrate the reversal of the translocation reaction by disrupting the interaction between apocytochrome c and IgG with 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol and increasing amounts of urea. At 2 M urea, 60% of the imported apocytochrome c became accessible to added proteinase K (Fig. 7A). Release of imported apocytochrome c from the OMV was fast and occurred at 0°C. OMV remained sealed as evident from the quantitative generation of the MOM38 fragment (Fig. 7B). The protease was still active at higher urea concentrations, since upon opening of the OMV by sonication or upon the addition of digitonin, MOM38 was completely degraded. Thus, in OMV imported apocytochrome c can regain access to the cytosolic face of the outer membrane by a retrograde translocation reaction. Reversibility of apocytochrome c import has been reported for intact mitochondria (30Hakvoort T.B.M. Sprinkle J.R. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4996-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This observation seemed to be in contradiction to other reports of a stable association of apocytochrome c with mitochondria (see above, 20). It was, however, obtained with a heterologous system which may explain the labile interaction between CCHL and apocytochrome c. We therefore examined in our homologous N. crassa system whether, at least in a longer time frame, dissociation from CCHL and consequently release from intact mitochondria would occur. Apocytochrome c was incubated with isolated mitochondria and, after reisolation of the mitochondria, proteinase K was added. Incubation was continued at 0 or 25°C to test for the protease accessibility of imported apocytochrome c. In parallel, the integrity of the outer membrane was estimated by measuring the resistance against protease of endogenous CCHL. At 0°C no significant decrease of protease-protected apocytochrome c was observed, even after prolonged times of incubation (Fig. 8A). Previous studies have shown that even at this low temperature import is fast and efficient (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, at 25°C apocytochrome c became accessible to proteinase K with a half-time of 35 min (Fig. 8B). However, this decrease was paralleled by degradation of endogenous CCHL, and therefore was due to the opening of the outer membrane rather than the release of apocytochrome c from the intermembrane space. Thus, in intact mitochondria the stable interaction of apocytochrome c with CCHL precludes its dissociation from the intermembrane space and ensures the unidirectionality of the import reaction. Finally, we asked whether the interaction of apocytochrome c with the outer membrane is specific or would also occur with other biological membranes or liposomes. Compared to OMV apocytochrome c bound very inefficiently to inverted vesicles derived from the inner membrane of E. coli or to liposomes composed of synthetic lipids similar to those present in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. 9, 31Hallermayer G. Neupert W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar amounts of apocytochrome c were found in the pellet fraction of a binding assay even in the absence of any added membranes. Therefore, we conclude that apocytochrome c exhibits a high preference for binding to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This preferential binding may be important to ensure correct targeting to mitochondria and may, in addition to the association with CCHL, contribute to the overall targeting specificity. We have analyzed the membrane binding and translocation steps of apocytochrome c import into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Together with previously obtained results our data lead to a model for the biogenesis of cytochrome c (Fig. 10). The precursor, apocytochrome c, is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes without a cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N terminus. Targeting to mitochondria occurs in a post-translational fashion. Initial binding to the outer membrane surface may occur via electrostatic association with phospholipid headgroups and is followed by specific interaction with a protease-resistant component (× in Fig. 10). The apoprotein then becomes translocated across the outer membrane, a reaction which apparently can be reversed. Either during the release from the membrane or after diffusion across the intermembrane space as a soluble intermediate, apocytochrome c gains access to CCHL, a protein bound to the outer face of the inner membrane. CCHL serves as a high affinity binding partner on the trans side of the membrane thereby shifting the equilibrium of the transport reaction toward the intermembrane space. In addition to the specific binding to the outer membrane this complex formation with CCHL may be considered the major contribution to the overall targeting specificity. In a final step, heme is covalently attached to cysteines 14 and 17. This reaction is catalyzed by CCHL and requires heme in its reduced state. Folding to native holocytochrome c may then trigger the release from CCHL thus completing the process. Our investigations show that apocytochrome c can specifically bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Previous studies using intact mitochondria have failed to demonstrate this interaction, since interaction with the outer membrane is only transient, and due to its high affinity the apoprotein is further transported to CCHL (6Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present it remains elusive what the chemical nature of the component contributing specificity of binding to the outer membrane might be. Based on extensive studies with artificial liposomes (for review, see Ref. 17De Kruijff B. Breukink E. Demel R.A. Van't Hoff R. De Jongh H.H.J. Jordi W. Keller R.C.A. Killian J.A. De Kroon A.I.P.M. Kusters R. Pilon M. Neupert W. Lill R. Membrane Biogenesis and Protein Targeting. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 85-101Google Scholar) lipids may be expected to play an important role in this process. In particular, acidic phospholipids, e.g. phosphatidylserine, have been demonstrated to be required for an unusual membrane insertion activity of apocytochrome c. However, our study failed to demonstrate significant binding of apocytochrome c to artificial liposomes representing the lipid composition of the outer membrane, at least under the conditions used with OMV. Thus, if lipids alone are providing the basis for specific binding, then such a compound must be a special lipid of the outer membrane. Alternatively, an unknown proteinaceous component may be responsible for directing apocytochrome c to the mitochondrial surface. Such a component might not only assure specific binding of the apoprotein, but also function in passing it across the membrane. A recently identified component of cytochrome c biogenesis, Cyc2p, is an unlikely candidate, since the protein was reported to be localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (5Dumont M.E. Hartl F.-U. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar, 32Dumont M.E. Schlichter J.B. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Bethlendy G. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6442-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Clearly, direct proof for the existence of such a component is required. Our studies using isolated OMV pave the way for approaching this goal by making it possible to reconstitute the binding and import processes with liposomes and detergent extracts of the outer membrane. Despite being essential for in vivo and in vitro accumulation of apocytochrome c in the intermembrane space, CCHL does not appear to be required for the actual membrane translocation step. Transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane is observed if apocytochrome c-specific binding partners, like IgG, are present on the intermembrane space side. Without such a “trap” the apoprotein would leave the OMV in a retrograde translocation reaction. It seems unlikely to us that IgG functionally participates in the release of apocytochrome c from the outer membrane and thereby mimicks a possible function of CCHL in facilitating entry of the apoprotein into the intermembrane space. Thus, the outer membrane alone can accomplish full translocation of apocytochrome c, yet a binding site on the trans side of the membrane is required to shift the equilibrium of the import reaction. The question, when precisely CCHL starts to interact with translocating apocytochrome c, is difficult to answer. This might occur soon after the first appearance of segments of apocytochrome c in the intermembrane space. An early interaction of apocytochrome c with CCHL would fit well to a study in which holo conversion of membrane spanning apocytochrome c fusion proteins was observed (33Nye S.H. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5753-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the low efficiency of heme attachment in these experiments may indicate that this pathway is not the preferred one in the physiological situation. As an alternative, apocytochrome c might diffuse through the intermembrane space as a soluble intermediate before associating with CCHL. In this view, the function of CCHL is restricted to providing a binding site for apocytochrome c in the target compartment. Despite the fundamental differences between the translocation of apocytochrome c and the general import routes used by other mitochondrial preproteins there are common principles underlying both processes. A reversible membrane passage is preceded and followed by steps introducing both specificity and unidirectionality to the reaction. Correct targeting is usually verified by the specific interaction of preproteins with components on the cis side of the membrane, e.g. targeting factors or surface receptors. In the case of apocytochrome c, the accuracy of targeting to the mitochondrial intermembrane space appears to be guaranteed by two sequential steps, namely by binding to the outer membrane and to CCHL. Reversibility of membrane translocation has been reported for a number of experimental systems, e.g. the bacterial inner membrane (34Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (35Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Cell. 1992; 71: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial outer (23Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and inner membranes (36Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In comparison to these transport reactions, the system described here is remarkable in that the whole preprotein and not only segments thereof can undergo a retrograde translocation. This implies that apocytochrome c either passes through the lipid bilayer or uses a pore-like structure which can be entered and traversed from both sides. Reversible membrane transit of preproteins allows for interaction with components on the trans side of the membrane. In most cases, this can be considered as the driving force for the whole reaction. For these interactions diverse mechanisms are used in the various membrane systems. For instance, repetitive cycles of binding to members of the Hsp70 family and ATP hydrolysis result in net movement across the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial inner membranes (37Brodsky J.L. Hamamoto S. Feldheim D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Schneider H. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In case of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the N-terminal presequence, after passing across a putative translocation pore, associates with a specific binding site on the intermembrane space side of the membrane (23Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For apocytochrome c, two reactions may be considered to serve as the driving force for import into mitochondria. First, the interaction with CCHL, and second, the conversion to the holoform, a reaction also catalyzed by CCHL. Heme attachment assures dissociation of holocytochrome c from CCHL. This presumably is triggered by folding into the native structure. In summary, despite taking a unique import pathway, apocytochrome c obeys general principles elucidated for other membrane translocation systems. We thank Petra Heckmeyer and Marlies Braun for expert technical assistance and Dr. M. Müller for a gift of E. coli inner membranes. We are grateful to Dr. C. Hergersberg for his important role in starting these studies and for supplying antibodies specific for apocytochrome c. Addendum-When large unilamellar vesicles prepared by the extruder technique (LUVETs) were used for lipid binding studies, the results of apocytochrome c binding were comparable to those presented (R. Baardman and A. Mayer, unpublished results). However, at higher concentrations of liposomes substantial amounts of apocytochrome c became bound to liposomes. These data support the conclusion drawn from the result of Fig. 9, and furthermore provide an explanation for the differences to previous lipid binding studies (as summarized by De Kruijff et al., 17)."

We used two approaches to ascertain whether CDP/cut serves as a repressor of gp91-phox gene expression. First, we used transient transfection assays in 3T3 cells to demonstrate that the CDP/cut binding site from the gp91-phox promoter acts as a negative regulatory element in artificial promoter constructs. Second, we isolated a stable transformant of HL-60 myeloid cells constitutively expressing transfected CDP/cut cDNA. Stable transformants carrying expression vector alone or expressing CDP/cut mRNA were induced to differentiate along the macrophage lineage with phorbol ester or along the neutrophil lineage with dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid/dimethylformamide. Northern blot analysis was used to assess induction of mRNAs encoding gp91-phox, and the myeloid oxidase cytosolic components, p47 and p67. In the stable transformant expressing transfected CDP/cut cDNA, gp91-phox induction was selectively reduced, whereas morphologic differentiation and induction of mRNA for myeloid oxidase components p47 and p67 were unaffected.

Heterozygous LPL-deficient mice could be useful for determining if hypertriglyceridemia, independently or in combination with other discrete defects, influences atherosclerosis. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (1Austin M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 11: 2-14Crossref Google Scholar), but the biology underlying this epidemiology is obscure. Elevated triglycerides may cause vascular damage through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may be directly atherogenic (2Slyper A.H. Lancet. 1992; 340: 289-291Abstract PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a hypothesis bolstered by the recent demonstration of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in human atherosclerotic lesions (3Rapp J.H. Lespine A. Hamilton R.L. Colyvas N. Chaumeton A.H. Tweedie-Hardman J. Kotite L. Kunitake S.T. Havel R.J. Kane J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated triglycerides might affect vascular health indirectly by decreasing HDL1( 1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionapoapolipoprotein.) cholesterol levels, by rendering LDL particles more atherogenic, or by affecting clotting. high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein very low density lipoprotein kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction apolipoprotein. Defects in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can cause hypertriglyceridemia. LPL is increasingly recognized as a multifunctional protein. In addition to hydrolyzing triglycerides in VLDL and chylomicrons, the LPL protein may also function as an apolipoprotein, associating with the surface of various lipoproteins to promote binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (4Beisiegel U.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LPL protein can be functionally divided into two major domains: an NH2-terminal domain containing the catalytically active site, and a COOH-terminal domain (9Wong H. Davis R.C. Thuren T. Goers J.W. Nikazy J. Waite M. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10319-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is essential for catalytic activity (10Bruin T. Groot N.B. Jansen J. Kastelein J.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), binds lipoproteins (11Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

LPL could also impact atherogenesis independent of effects on circulating triglycerides. Macrophages from human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions express LPL (13Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Goldberg I.J. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10143-10147Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14O'Brien K.D. Gordon D. Deeb S.

Invest. 1993; 92: 1759-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and higher levels of macrophage LPL expression are found in inbred strains of mice that are susceptible to atherosclerosis (16Renier G. Skamene E. DeSanctis J.B. Radzioch D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that local expression of LPL could promote uptake of lipoproteins by vascular tissue (17Rutledge J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1152-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus genetic defects in LPL could have opposing effects on atherosclerotic risk; systemically decreased function could increase the concentration of atherogenic, triglyceride-rich particles, but decreased macrophage expression could decrease foam cell formation. Human heterozygous LPL deficiency is probably common. It has been postulated to form a subset of familial combined hyperlipidemia (18Babirak S.P. Iverius P.-H. Fujimoto W.Y. Brunzell J.D. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 326-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a very common genetic disorder associated with vascular disease. However, heterozygous LPL deficiency could have phenotypically different effects depending on genetic and physiological backgrounds. This might explain why some families with heterozygous LPL deficiency manifest familial hypertriglyceridemia (19Wilson D.E. Emi M. Iverius P.-H. Hata A. Wu L.L. Hillas E. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 735-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), while others have lipid abnormalities associated with increased atherosclerotic risk (20Miesenbock G. Holzl B. Foger B. Brandstatter E. Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Patsch J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Further complicating study of human heterozygous LPL deficiency is the fact that detection of this disorder is difficult given the large number of mutations in the LPL gene (21Lalouel J.-M. Wilson D.E. Iverius P.-H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 86-95Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). With a goal of generating an animal model of LPL deficiency within a homogeneous genetic background suitable for studying atherosclerosis, we have inactivated the LPL gene in mice by homologous recombination using a targeting vector designed to disrupt the COOH-terminal domain of the LPL protein. An 8.3-kb SacI/Sau3AI genomic fragment was isolated from a λEMBL3 library constructed using Balb/c DNA (22Hua X. Enerback S. Hudson J. Youkhana K. Gimble J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Restriction mapping, Southern blotting (with detection by oligonucleotides based on the mouse LPL cDNA sequence in Ref. 23Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8463-8466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequencing showed that this fragment contained exons 7-10 of the mouse gene with essentially the same structure described by Zechner et al.(24Zechner R. Newman T.C. Steiner E. Breslow J.L. Genomics. 1991; 11: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A 1.8-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the plasmid pKJ-1 containing the neomycin resistance cassette driven by the PGK promoter was inserted by blunt-end ligation at a HindIII site in exon 8. This manipulation was shown to abolish the HindIII site and interrupt exon 8, resulting in a predicted mouse LPL protein disrupted following the leucine residue at position 380 as numbered in Ref. 23Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8463-8466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. This modified genomic clone was then inserted at the XhoI site of a Bluescript plasmid (a gift from Fred Fiedorek, Chapel Hill, NC) containing the 3.4-kb thymidine kinase fragment from pHSV-106 to generate the targeting vector. E14 ES cell electroporation, positive (using G418) and negative (using ganciclovir) selection, and injections into the blastocysts of C57BL/6J embryos were carried out as described (25Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Chimeric (on the basis of coat color) males were mated with C57BL/6J females to generate F1 animals, and these F1 animals were crossed with each other to generate the mice characterized in this study. DNA isolated from tail (for most animals) or liver (from recently expired animals) was subjected to Southern blotting or PCR. For Southern blotting, 5-15 μg of DNA was electrophoresed followed by acid depurination, treatment with NaOH, and transfer using standard techniques. Blots were probed with a random-primed 0.8-kb BamHI/PvuII fragment of the mouse LPL gene spanning the 3′ end of intron 5 and the 5′ end of exon 6. As expected, preliminary blots showed that this probe did not hybridize with the targeting vector. For PCR genotyping of potential heterozygotes, an upstream primer corresponding to mouse exon 8 (5′-TTT ACA CGG AGG TGG ACA TCG GA) and a downstream primer corresponding to a region near the 3′ end of the neomycin resistance cassette (5′-TCG CCT TCT ATC GCC TTC TTG AC) were used in reactions containing genomic DNA and 2 mM MgCl2 subjected to the following cycling parameters: 5 min at 94°C for 1 cycle, and 1 min at 94°C/2 min at 55°C/3 min at 72°C for 30 cycles. Animal rooms were illuminated between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Mice were fed a 50/50 mixture of PicoLab rodent chow 20 and mouse chow 20 (product numbers 5053 and 5058) with a total fat content of ~6.75%. Animals were weaned at 21 days of age. For blood collection via the retro-orbital plexus, animals were lightly anesthetized with methoxyflurane. Deep anesthesia was used for those animals subjected to exsanguination via inferior vena cava venipuncture. Triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids were assayed enzymatically using commercially available kits (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). For measurements of total lipids, serum was kept at 4°C or on ice and assayed within 2 h for triglycerides and phospholipids to decrease the chances of endogenous hydrolysis (26Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Verstuyft J. Naggert J.K. Kuypers F.A. Paigen B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1413-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol determinations were generally done the following day after storing samples at −70°C. HDL cholesterol was measured after polyethylene glycol precipitation of apo B-containing lipoproteins (27Izzo C. Grillo F. Marado E. Clin. Chem. 1981; 27: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For separation of lipoproteins by gel filtration, serum samples from two animals with similar total lipids were pooled and separated by FPLC using two Superose 6 columns in series (28Cole T.G. Kitchens R.T. Daugherty A. Schonfeld G. FPLC Biocommunique. 1988; 4: 4-6Google Scholar). The 50 fractions collected per condition were analyzed the same day for triglycerides and the following day for phospholipids and cholesterol. LPL activity was assayed as the salt-inhibitable ability of triplicate samples to hydrolyze an emulsion containing radiolabeled triolein (29Seip R.L. Angelopoulos T.J. Semenkovich C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E229-E236PubMed Google Scholar). For postheparin plasma activity, animals were injected intraperitoneally with 200 units of porcine heparin; 30 min later blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. Previous studies have shown this procedure to be suitable in mice (30Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Chernick S.S. Scow R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For other assays, individual tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, weighed, and made 4% (w/v) in assay buffer (29Seip R.L. Angelopoulos T.J. Semenkovich C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E229-E236PubMed Google Scholar). For newborn pups, the heart was removed and processed, the milk-filled stomach was removed and discarded (to prevent dilution of radioactive emulsion by milk lipids), and the remaining carcass (minus heart and stomach) was frozen, weighed, and homogenized in assay buffer. For determination of LPL message, total RNA was prepared from tissues by centrifugation in cesium chloride and mRNA was detected by Northern blotting as described previously (31Semenkovich C.F. Chen S.-H. Wims M. Luo C.-C. Li W.-H. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of LPL protein, tissue extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted, and LPL protein was detected with chicken anti-bovine milk LPL as described (29Seip R.L. Angelopoulos T.J. Semenkovich C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E229-E236PubMed Google Scholar). Each gel included one lane loaded with purified bovine LPL as a positive control. Differences were assessed using unpaired, two-tailed t tests unless otherwise specified. For the data shown in Fig. 4, ANOVA was specifically not used because groups contained different numbers of animals. The strategy for inactivating the mouse LPL gene is shown in Fig. 1. The mouse LPL gene has 10 exons, 9 of which are translated. The targeting vector contains ~3 kb of mouse DNA upstream and ~5 kb downstream of the exon 8 HindIII site where the neomycin resistance cassette (NEO) was inserted. Predicted restriction fragments detected by the LPL probe spanning the intron 5/exon 6 junction are shown at the bottom of the figure for native and targeted genes. With HindIII, the native fragment is 8.4 kb but the targeted fragment is 14.4 kb since insertion of NEO abolishes the natural HindIII site in exon 8. With Tth111I, the native fragment is 10.3 kb but the targeted fragment is 7.7 kb since NEO introduces a new Tth111I I site 5′ to the natural Tth111I site. Evidence for correct targeting of the LPL gene in ES cells and mice is shown in Fig. 2. Southern blots of ES cell DNA are shown in panel A, blots of F1 × F1 mouse DNA are in panel B, and results of a PCR assay using mouse tail DNA are in panel C. For panel A, lanes 1-4 contain HindIII-digested DNA detected with the LPL probe shown in Fig. 1. Wild type (+/+) cells contain only the 8.4-kb native fragment (lane 1), but targeted clones also contain the 14.4-kb targeted allele (lanes 2-4). When this same DNA was probed with a NEO cDNA (lanes 5-8), only the 14.4-kb targeted allele was detected in targeted clones (lanes 6-8), consistent with the presence of the NEO cassette in this fragment. Tth111I-digested DNA from +/+ cells showed only the 10.3-kb native band (lane 9), but the expected 7.7-kb band is also present in targeted cells (lane 10). Five male chimeric mice were generated using these ES cells. Two independent chimeras transmitted the mutant allele through the germ line, and analyses of progeny from each of these animals were identical. The same alleles detected in ES cells were detected in the offspring of F1 × F1 crosses (panel B). For HindIII, heterozygotes (+/-) carried both the 8.4-kb native and 14.4-kb mutant alleles while homozygotes (-/-) had only the 14.4-kb allele. For Tth111I, +/- animals carried both the 10.3-kb native and 7.7-kb mutant alleles while -/- mice had only the 7.7-kb fragment. Additional confirmation of authentic targeting is shown in panel C. Tail DNA from animals shown to be +/+ or +/- by Southern blotting was subjected to PCR using an upstream primer just 5′ to the NEO insertion site in exon 8 and a downstream primer complementary to NEO. The expected ~600-bp band was amplified from heterozygotes (+/-, lanes 2 and 3) but not wild type animals (+/+, lanes 1 and 4). This assay was subsequently used for rapid genotyping. In other studies, confirmation of the homozygous state was also performed by PCR using the primers of panel C in conjunction with primers (separated by ~127 bp) flanking the NEO insertion site in exon 8. With the latter primers, wild type animals showed a 127-bp band, homozygotes had a ~1.8-kb band (due to the presence of the NEO cassette between the primers), and heterozygotes had both bands (data not shown). Homozygotes were born viable, initially appeared healthy, but uniformly died within 48 h. The 100% mortality for this genotype was significantly higher than death rates for +/- and +/+ animals (Table I). Autopsy findings from four homozygotes (data not shown) were nonspecific, although atelectasis and congestion in the lungs and hepatic congestion were seen consistently. There were no pancreatic abnormalities detected.Table I:Neonatal mortality rates and serum lipids for LPL-deficient mice Open table in a new tab Also shown in are serum lipids from mice ~12 h after birth. Homozygotes had marked elevations of triglycerides, phospholipids, and total cholesterol, but no detectable HDL cholesterol. This extreme hyperlipidemia was feeding-dependent. One homozygote was kept from nursing (verified by the absence of milk in the stomach), and in this single animal at the time of sacrifice lipids were: triglycerides, 296 mg/dl; cholesterol, 95 mg/dl; phospholipids, 178 mg/dl. Triglycerides (p = 0.0019), cholesterol (p = 0.0008), and phospholipids (p = 0.0057) were significantly higher in heterozygotes than in wild type animals at 12 h. HDL cholesterol levels were not decreased in +/- animals; in fact, HDL cholesterol was almost significantly higher in +/- compared to +/+ pups (p = 0.0730). As expected, LPL enzyme activity was decreased in +/- and essentially absent in -/- pups (Fig. 3). For these experiments, the heart was removed and assayed, then the carcass minus the heart (and milk-filled stomach, as described under “Experimental Procedures”) was assayed separately. Heterozygotes developed normally. Over 100 animals were weighed at weekly intervals for the first two months of life, and although +/- animals tended to be slightly heavier than +/+ littermates, this difference was not significant (p = 0.5513). Heterozygotes had higher triglycerides than wild type animals with fasting and with ad libitum feeding (Fig. 4 and Table II). With fasting, triglycerides were ~2-fold elevated in +/- versus +/+ animals regardless of sex. With ad libitum feeding, the genotype-specific differences in triglycerides were amplified with the highest elevations seen in heterozygous LPL-deficient females. There were no significant differences between groups for total cholesterol or phospholipids.Table II:Serum triglycerides in adult heterozygous LPL-deficient and wild type mice Open table in a new tab The fasting data of Fig. 4 were obtained after a 12-h fast (11:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m.), an intervention that may represent a considerable physiological stress in mice (32LeBoeuf R.C. Caldwell M. Kirk E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 121-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a 4-h fast (7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.) resulted in essentially the same difference in triglycerides between +/- and +/+ animals (Table II). As with neonates, HDL cholesterol levels were not lower in adult +/- animals. Ad libitum fed adults with heterozygous LPL deficiency tended to have higher HDL cholesterols than their +/+ littermates (118 ± 14 for +/- versus 100 ± 9 for +/+, p = 0.3339). Lipoprotein analysis by gel filtration chromatography showed that the increased triglycerides in heterozygous LPL-deficient animals were due to an increase in VLDL/chylomicrons (Fig. 5, top panels, fractions 1-10). Consistent with measurements of HDL cholesterol by PEG precipitation, HDL cholesterol measured by gel filtration tended to be higher in +/- animals (middle panels, fractions 30-38). In males, “shoulders” to the right of the VLDL triglyceride peak (fractions 10-15) and to the left of the HDL cholesterol peak (fractions 20-30) were consistently more prominent in heterozygotes. LPL enzyme activity was decreased in animals carrying one copy of the mutant allele (Fig. 6). Activity in plasma 30 min after the intraperitoneal injection of heparin (panel A) was 43% lower in heterozygotes (146 ± 25 μmol of FFA/ml/h for +/- versus 258 ± 19 for +/+, n = 4 animals per genotype, p = 0.0121). This decrease was also reflected in enzyme activity assayed in individual tissues (panel B). For heart, kidney, epididymal/parametrial and inguinal adipose tissue, lung, psoas muscle, and brain, LPL activity was consistently decreased in +/- versus +/+ animals. These differences were statistically significant only for heart and kidney (both p < 0.05) due to considerable animal-to-animal variation, especially for adipose tissue. Since these experiments were performed using the F2 generation representing a mixture of the the 129/Ola and C57BL/6J strains, the genetic heterogeneity of these animals is probably a major source of the observed variation in LPL enzyme activity. There were tissue-specific differences in the magnitude of the decrease in enzyme activity associated with the mutant allele. For example, in multiple assays involving six different side-by-side comparisons of age and weight-matched +/+ versus +/- animals, the decrease in heart activity was consistently less than 50% (mean decrease 28.4%) while the decrease in renal activity was consistently greater than 50% (mean decrease 62.4%). LPL message and protein were decreased in heterozygotes (Fig. 7). Both the 3.6- and 3.4-kb LPL mRNA species detected by others in mouse tissues (23Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8463-8466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were decreased in +/- (lane 2) compared to +/+ (lane 1) adipose tissue. Similar differences were seen in comparisons of adipose tissue total RNA from five different pairs of +/+ and +/- animals. A decrease in LPL mRNA for heterozygotes was also seen in heart (not shown). LPL protein mass was decreased in +/- (lane 4) compared to +/+ (lane 3) adipose tissue. Similar differences were seen in comparisons of adipose tissue protein from three different pairs of +/+ and +/- animals. We present evidence consistent with the inactivation of the LPL gene in mice. Targeting of the LPL gene with a vector designed to disrupt the COOH terminus of the LPL protein results in severe hypertriglyceridemia and essentially absent enzyme activity in homozygotes. These animals die within 2 days of birth. Heterozygotes have decreased enzyme activity and mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia with both feeding and fasting. The homozygous and heterozygous states appear to have different effects on HDL levels. Homozygous LPL deficiency in humans causes a distinctive phenotype, the chylomicronemia syndrome, that is not necessarily lethal (33Brunzell J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1165-1180Google Scholar). Naturally occurring defects in LPL activity have also been described in cats (34Peritz L.N. Brunzell J.D. Harvey-Clarke C. Pritchard P.H. Jones B.R. Hayden M.R. Clin. Invest. Med. 1990; 13: 259-263PubMed Google Scholar), mice lacking mast cells (W/Wv mice; Ref. 35Hatanaka K. Tanishita H. Ishibashi-Ueda H. Yamamoto A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and mice homozygous for combined lipase deficiency (cld/cld mice; Ref. 36Paterniti J.R. Brown W.V. Ginsberg H.N. Artzt K. Science. 1983; 221: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our homozygotes resemble cld/cld mice. Triglycerides are similar at 12 h postpartum (~10,000 mg/dl for cld/cld, ~13,000 mg/dl for LPL -/-), and animals uniformly die within 48 h of birth. cld/cld mice presumably die because of microinfarcts in critical organs caused by dense packing of chylomicrons in capillaries (37Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Wetzel M.G. Chernick S.S. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Brown W.V. Scow R.O. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 347-362PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar mechanism probably operates in LPL -/- mice. The cld mutation affects the posttranslational processing of both LPL and hepatic lipase (38Davis R.C. Ben-Zeev O. Martin D. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17960-17966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the similarities between LPL -/- and cld/cld mice suggest that LPL is the lipase most critical for neonatal survival. HDL cholesterol was absent from the serum of LPL -/- mice, an expected finding since the major sources of lipid for HDL generation are thought to be remnant cholesterol and phospholipid from chylomicron/VLDL metabolism. Whether apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein of HDL, is produced normally in LPL -/- animals is unknown. These mice could be used to determine if nascent HDL-like particles are present in the absence of LPL activity. In human populations, lower levels of LPL enzyme activity are associated with lower levels of HDL cholesterol (39Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Given this association, one might predict that the lower (but not absent) LPL activity of LPL +/- mice would also be associated with lower HDL cholesterol. This was not observed. There was no difference in HDL cholesterol between +/- and +/+ adult mice, and levels were almost significantly higher in heterozygous neonates (Table I). At least three groups have overexpressed human LPL in transgenic mice (40Shimada M. Shimano H. Gotoda T. Yamamoto K. Kawamura M. Inaba T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17924-17929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Liu M.-S. Jirik F.R. LeBoeuf R.C. Henderson H. Castellani L.W. Lusis A.J. Ma Y. Forsythe I.J. Zhang H. Kirk E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18757-18766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and all report decreases in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins without significant effects on HDL cholesterol. These results and our findings in LPL +/- mice suggest that, with the exception of the LPL -/- state, LPL activity in mice has a limited role in determining HDL cholesterol levels. That heterozygous LPL-deficient mice have increased triglycerides seems sensible, but this result was not predictable. In humans, 94% of young heterozygotes have normal triglycerides (19Wilson D.E. Emi M. Iverius P.-H. Hata A. Wu L.L. Hillas E. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 735-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as do mice heterozygous for the cld mutation (36Paterniti J.R. Brown W.V. Ginsberg H.N. Artzt K. Science. 1983; 221: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for hypertriglyceridemia in our mice, especially with fasting, is uncertain. Mutations generally cause gain of function, loss of function, or have dominant negative effects. The latter class of mutation could be relevant to our mice since active LPL is probably a dimer and one could envision an inactive but stable monomer having a prolonged dominant negative effect on triglyceride metabolism. This mechanism does not appear to be operative in our +/- mice. LPL activity (Fig. 6), message, and protein (Fig. 7) are lower in the tissues of heterozygotes, making it likely that our mutation causes loss of function through a decrease in LPL protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, COOH-terminal truncation of human LPL at residue 381, essentially the same site disrupted in mouse LPL in the current study, causes a loss of catalytic activity as well as a decrease in protein mass in transient transfection studies (43Kozaki K. Gotoda T. Kawamura M. Shimano H. Yazaki Y. Ouchi Y. Orimo H. Yamada N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1765-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phenotype of mice generated by COOH-terminal disruption of LPL may be similar to the phenotype generated by targeting regions of the LPL gene 5′ to the exon 8 site chosen in this study. Why then do LPL +/- mice have elevated triglycerides in the fasted state on a low fat diet? At least four explanations are possible. First, the disruption of the COOH terminus of the LPL molecule could somehow impair the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as suggested by cell culture studies (12Chappell D.A. Inoue I. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Bowen S.L. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18001-18006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not find evidence of a protein with altered size in +/- tissues to support this hypothesis, but Western blots were done with a single antibody, raising the possibility that an altered protein is produced but not recognized by our antibody. Second, LPL deficiency could affect triglyceride-rich particle composition and impair clearance. Third, LPL deficiency could reduce hepatic reuptake of apo B-containing particles with a net effect of lipoprotein overproduction by the liver (44Williams K.J. Petrie K.A. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our enzyme assay was not sufficiently sensitive to detect LPL activity in mouse liver, although we have been able to detect very low levels of LPL protein in this tissue by Western blotting (not shown). Fourth, LPL deficiency is likely to increase the concentration of remnant particles in these animals, a possibility suggested by the “shoulders” of particles seen to the right of the triglyceride peak and to the left of the cholesterol peak for males in Fig. 5. Remnants are noncompetitive inhibitors of LPL activity, and even low concentrations of these particles could substantially interfere with VLDL hydrolysis (45Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Vezina C. Hegele R.A. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20554-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are other mouse models of elevated triglycerides. Overexpression of apo CIII in mice results in hypertriglyceridemia (46Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This condition is corrected by overexpression of apo E (47de Silva H.V. Lauer S.J. Wang J. Simonet W.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2324-2335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that excess apo CIII displaces apo E from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, thereby hindering clearance by apo E-dependent mechanisms. Overexpression of apo CI probably operates through a similar mechanism to increase triglycerides (48Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Pitas R.E. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8651-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of apo CII, a co-factor for LPL activity, surprisingly also increases triglycerides, perhaps by interfering with the ability of VLDL to bind glycosaminoglycans (49Shachter N.S. Hayek T. Leff T. Smith J.D. Rosenberg D.W. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each of these models was generated using human transgenes in mice. Heterozygous LPL-deficient mice have the theoretical advantage of manifesting hypertriglyceridemia that is not dependent on the expression of a protein from another species. Another potential advantage of our model is the lack of an effect on HDL cholesterol levels. In species with cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, triglyceride concentrations are inversely related to HDL cholesterol levels, making it difficult to decide whether beneficial effects on vascular disease are due to decreased triglycerides or increased HDL-C. LPL +/- mice suitably backcrossed into the C57BL/6J background could be useful for determining how hypertriglyceridemia alone affects atherosclerosis. In addition, assessing atherosclerotic disease in LPL +/- mice in the setting of diabetes mellitus, ethanol intake, and hypothyroidism, or after crossing these animals with cholesteryl ester transfer protein transgenic mice, with heterozygotes for apo E deficiency, or with heterozygotes for LDL receptor deficiency, could provide insight into whether commonly observed human lipid phenotypes confer atherosclerotic risk.

In this paper, two forms of membrane-bound alkaline ceramidase, have been, for the first time, purified from guinea pig epidermis by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Superose, HCA-hyroxyapatite, isoelectric focusing, Mono Q, and TSK-3000SW column. One species (CDase-I) migrated upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa; the other (CDase-II) was only partially purified with apparent Mr of about 148,000 estimated by gel filtration. The specific activities of the two species increased by 1.130- (for CDase-I) and 400-fold (for CDase-II) over the original tissue extract. The activity of both enzymes for ceramide species decreased in the order of linoleoyl > oleoyl > palmitoylsphingosine. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was approximately 7.0-9.0 for CDase-I and 7.5-8.5 for CDase-II. Interestingly, both enzymes were inhibited by the reaction product sphingosine with a concentration for half-maximal inhibition (ID50) of 100-130 μM, compared to the apparent kinetic parameters with CDase-I (Km = 90 μM, Kmax = 0.62 unit) and CDase-II (Km = 140 μM, Kmax = 0.50 units). Some lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, are also inhibitory with IC50 values of 50-250 μM, suggesting well controlled CDase activity by sphingolipid metabolites. These studies begin to elucidate a regulatory mechanism for the balance of the ratio of ceramide/sphingosine which can serve as an intracellular effector molecule in epidermis. Ceramidase (CDase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides to yield sphingosine and fatty acid. In this paper, two forms of membrane-bound alkaline ceramidase, have been, for the first time, purified from guinea pig epidermis by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Superose, HCA-hyroxyapatite, isoelectric focusing, Mono Q, and TSK-3000SW column. One species (CDase-I) migrated upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa; the other (CDase-II) was only partially purified with apparent Mr of about 148,000 estimated by gel filtration. The specific activities of the two species increased by 1.130- (for CDase-I) and 400-fold (for CDase-II) over the original tissue extract. The activity of both enzymes for ceramide species decreased in the order of linoleoyl > oleoyl > palmitoylsphingosine. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was approximately 7.0-9.0 for CDase-I and 7.5-8.5 for CDase-II. Interestingly, both enzymes were inhibited by the reaction product sphingosine with a concentration for half-maximal inhibition (ID50) of 100-130 μM, compared to the apparent kinetic parameters with CDase-I (Km = 90 μM, Kmax = 0.62 unit) and CDase-II (Km = 140 μM, Kmax = 0.50 units).

We used the creatine analogs cyclocreatine (cCr) or β-guanidopropionate (βGPA) to test if mass action ratios (Γ) for CK in muscle could be predicted from combined equilibrium constants (Kcomb) measured in solutions mimicking the intracellular environment. Mice were fed cCr or βGPA and their muscles assayed for substrates and products of the CK reaction by 31P NMR spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. After three weeks of feeding, Γ was indistinguishable from Kcomb in cCr-treated muscles demonstrating both PCr/Cr and phospho-analog/analog must have equilibrated with a constant and uniform cellular ATP/ADP ratio. In βGPA-treated muscles, Γ was smaller than Kcomb due to a higher content of muscle βGPA. Feeding βGPA for 9-12 weeks resulted in a closer agreement between Kcomb and Γ, suggesting ATP/ADP ratios are not uniform within the muscle perhaps due to transient metabolic stress in some cells. From this analysis it follows that calculation of free ADP from the CK equilibrium for a heterogeneous population of cells with respect to total Cr and ATP content is correct only if chemical potentials of these cells are uniform.

One of the key tenets of bioenergetics is the near-equilibrium property of creatine kinase (CK) ( 1The abbreviations used are: CKcreatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2)CrcreatinePCrphosphocreatinecCrcyclocreatineβGPAβ-guanidopropionateXcreatine analogPXphosphorylated analogHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidEDLextensor digitorum longusSOLsoleus.) coupled with cytosolic substrates which are freely mixing and available to the enzyme(1Meyer R.A.

Academic Press, New York1973: 383-453Google Scholar). Three criteria have been used to demonstrate that a near-equilibrium condition exists within the cytoplasm: (a) kinetic limitations are considered minimal because concentrations of substrates are in the approximate range of their Kmvalues(5Kuby S.A. Noda L. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 65-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Noda L. Kuby S.A. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) CK activity is far in excess of maximal ATPase activity within the cell(1Meyer R.A. Sweeney H.L. Kushmerick M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C365-C377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (c) 31P NMR spin transfer methods have shown that forward and reverse fluxes for CK are equal (7Ugurbil K. J. Magn.

J. 1994; 67: 1-13Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic control of PCr/Cr by ATP/ADP through CK equilibration implies that ATP/ADP is the same in all loci within the cell(1Meyer R.A. Sweeney H.L. Kushmerick M.J. Am. J.

Physiol. 1988; 254: C548-C553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cytoplasmic fraction of ATP and ADP must be so large that other “compartments” (which may or may not be at the same chemical potential) do not influence physicochemical properties of bulk cytoplasm. For a simple system which is not diffusion limited, it has been shown that this near-equilibrium formulation can be used for calculation of ADPfree and ATP chemical potential (ΔGATP)(11Veech R.L. Lawson J.W.R. Cornell N.W. Krebs H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6538-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lawson J.W.R. Veech R.L. J. Biol.

For complex populations of cells, comprising tissues or organs, a crucial assumption for proper calculation of ADPfree and ΔGATP (which are derived values from measured parameters (PCr, Cr, ATP, Pi, and pH) on a population of cells) is that not only is ATP/ADP within each cell uniform, but it is uniform between cells as well. creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) creatine phosphocreatine cyclocreatine β-guanidopropionate creatine analog phosphorylated analog high performance liquid chromatography 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid extensor digitorum longus soleus. By a variety of criteria, heterogeneity of cell types in individual muscles have been documented(15Burke R.E. Levine D.N. Zajac F.E.I.

Physiol. 1993; 264: C411-C418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and chemical contents of these cell types have shown that their metabolite contents differ. Furthermore it has been shown that these differences are reflected in chemical potentials of predominantly fast versus slow muscles (−68 to −61 kJ/mol ATP)(20Kushmerick M.J. Moerland T.S. Wiseman R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition to heterogeneity of metabolite distribution, there is also considerable information on the existence, properties, and intracellular distribution of CK isoforms (3Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 21Yamashita K. Yoshioka T. J. Muscle Res.

Although the major isoform is MM-CK (which is thought to be in solution in the cytoplasm as well as bound to the M-line of myofibrils), there is also a substantial amount of “mitochondrial” isoforms existing in dynamic multimers in the intermembrane space of mitochondria(3Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Based on the existence of multiple isoforms of CK taken together with heterogeneity of metabolite contents(23Gellerich F.N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Saks V.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Kupriyanov V.V. Miceli M.V. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been argued that the simple concept of CK equilibration, with its substrates and products mixing in the bulk cytoplasm as if in solution, is not completely valid. In view of the large number of physiological and biochemical studies that have assumed a simple behavior of the cytosol (with respect to CK function), we investigated this issue by capitalizing upon the competitive inhibitor nature of two creatine analogs (β-guanidopropionic acid (βGPA) and cyclocreatine (cCr)) to establish a criterion for testing CK function in vivo. Application of creatine analogs to study cellular functions of CK was pioneered by Fitch et al.(25Fitch C.D. Shields R.P. Payne W.F. Dacus J.M. J. Biol.

As competitive inhibitors, these compounds can be exploited to answer questions in cellular biology concerning organization of enzymatic activity in cells, because these analogs are also utilized by cells as substrates for cellular energy metabolism(34Annesley T.M. Walker J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Woznicki D.T. Walker J.B. J.

So it is possible to test whether competitive inhibitors and endogenous substrates obey simple rules of enzyme kinetics and equilibration. Feeding synthetic analogs of creatine (which as competitive inhibitors are not expected to disturb equilibration) partially displaces PCr and Cr from the cell. By choosing duration of feeding such that there were approximately equal concentrations of total creatine and total analog with minimal adaptive changes, ( 2R. W. Wiseman, unpublished observations.) we optimized the ability to measure mass action ratios for CK and to test whether ratios in tissue equaled those predicted from combined equilibrium constants measured in solutions mimicking the intracellular ionic environment. There are a number of reasons why this equality may not hold true: (a) analogs and their phosphorylated forms may not mix and equilibrate with endogenous substrates and products of CK (as would occur in a solution); (b) mixing occurs, but metabolites may be separated in compartments with significantly different ATP/ADP or PCr/Cr ratios; or (c) ATP/ADP ratios between individual muscle cells may not be uniform. Our results show that in steady state and during long-term exposure to these analogs none of these possibilities is true, except for an instructive case of feeding βGPA for short (3 week) duration, where heterogeneity of ATP/ADP ratios must be considered. Kcomb for the CK reaction in the presence of its endogenous substrates and a competitive inhibitor with CK in a solution in vitro can be defined as the sum of two separate reactions, each with its own uniquely defined equilibrium constant but coupled by substrates common to both reactions. Our approach was to measure this Kcomb in solution and the corresponding mass action ratio in intact muscle as a test of equilibration in vivo. Kcomb can be expressed as the ratio of individual equilibrium constants for the combined reaction. This derivation has the advantage of simplifying chemical analyses, since substrates common to both reactions, ADP, ATP (and Mg2+), as well as pH, factor out of algebraic expressions; its limitations and implications are discussed in detail (see “Discussion”) and illustrated mathematically (see “Appendix”). In our experiments, combined reactions are measured in solution at the temperature of interest with a similar set of measurements then performed on muscles of animals treated with analogs. If the reaction achieved equilibration with its substrates in muscle as in solution, the value for Kcomb in solution and the mass action ratio in muscle should agree within experimental error. The following equations specify the approach taken. For the CK reaction, ADP+PCr+H+↔ATP+Cr(Eq. 1) consider the reaction for the analog (X) which is phosphorylated at equilibrium (PX), X+ATP↔PX+ADP(Eq. 2) At pH 7.0, equilibrium expression for and are written as follows. Keq,Cr=[ATP][Cr][PCr][ADP](Eq. 3) Keq,X=[PX][ADP][X][ATP](Eq. 4) With adenylates at equilibrium with both analog and creatine species, then we can define a Kcomb as follows. Kcomb=Keq,Cr/Keq,X=[PX][Cr]/[X][PCr](Eq. 5) In muscle, when the mixture of substrates and a competitive inhibitor comes to equilibrium with the same adenylate pool, the observed mass action ratio (Γ) for the combined reaction will equal Kcomb. Unlike solution experiments in which there is no net ATP utilization (ATPase flux) and ATP/ADP does not change, equilibration may not be exact. In muscle, even at rest, there is a small net ATPase activity. In this case, equilibration will only occur if forward and reverse fluxes of CK are far in excess of steady state fluxes of ATP through ATP synthesis and ATPase reactions. Kcomb for CK in the presence of creatine and either analog was measured using a combination of 31P NMR spectroscopy and HPLC methods. Solutions were constructed to model cytoplasmic conditions at 23°C and contained in mM: 100 KCl, 5.3 ATP, 15 PCr, 100 MOPS, 4 EGTA, 1 KH2PO4, 92 KC2H3O2, and 70 Tris at pH 7.0 as is standard for skinned fiber experiments(42Chase P.B. Kushmerick M.J. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 935-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 3.5 ml each were used for NMR experiments to which were added unphosphorylated forms of either βGPA or cCr prior to adjusting final volume and pH of each solution. At the start of NMR experiments and before addition of CK, a 50-μl aliquot of this mixture was assayed for ATP content using an optical spectrophotometer at 259 nm. Absorbance due to analogs was negligible at this wavelength. A control NMR spectrum was acquired under fully relaxed conditions, then the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 2 mg/ml of rabbit CK to each tube (260 units of CK activity/ml). Serial spectra were acquired during the time course to equilibration and were halted when change in peak areas for PCr and phospho-analog differed by less than 5% from previous acquisition. At equilibration, samples were removed from the magnet, kept at constant temperature, and CK-denatured by addition of 4% SDS/ml, chilled to 4°C and centrifuged to remove precipitated SDS and protein(43Chase P.B. Kushmerick M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C480-C489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method was used to avoid acid hydrolysis of PCr which could significantly alter the result. Supernatant samples were frozen at −70°C for later analysis by HPLC. β-Guanidopropionic acid was synthesized from β-alanine and cyanamide as described previously(40Meyer R.A. Brown T.R. Krilowicz B.L. Kushmerick M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C264-C274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclocreatine was synthesized from chloroacetate and ethylamine as reported by Griffiths and Walker (36Griffiths G.R. Walker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2049-2054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recrystallized twice from hot water. Product purity and verification of structure were assessed by proton NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Galbraith, Knoxville, TN). HPLC standards for PcCr and βGPAP were produced from equilibration solutions and calibrated in the following manner. Quantification of PCr was accomplished by integration of 31P NMR spectra of solutions prior to addition of CK and after equilibration with analog (PCr and PX). As the total integral of this region (PCr + PX) did not change, the amount of PX equals initial less final PCr area. Resonances were scaled to absolute chemical content by using ATP content measured spectrophotometrically at 259 nm. These calibrated solutions provided standards for HPLC quantification of PcCr and βGPAP. Rabbit creatine kinase, ATP, ADP, PCr, and Cr were obtained from Sigma. Male Swiss Webster mice were obtained at age 21 days and allowed to acclimate to the cage for a period of 1 week prior to feeding. Analogs were administered by mixing with standard rodent chow (βGPA 2% w:w, cCr 1% w:w; BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ). Animals were allowed food and water ad libitum. Feeding experiments were performed for a period of 3 weeks at which time tissues from control, βGPA, and cCr fed mice were excised from animals under surgical anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine). EDL (fast-twitch) and SOL (slow-twitch) muscles were allowed to recover in a bath of physiologic saline from surgical perturbations for 30 min, after which they were either removed from the bath, blotted, and rapidly frozen at −80°C with brass Wollenberger tongs or placed in a custom-built 31P NMR probe for analysis after which these samples were also frozen. In both cases, HPLC analysis of neutralized perchloric acid extracts were performed. Phosphorus NMR spectroscopy was performed on a 7T GN 300 (General Electric) using either a 10-mm probe (for model solutions) or a custom-built phosphorus probe for isolated mouse muscles(44Wiseman R.W. Moerland T.S. Kushmerick M.J. NMR Biomed. 1993; 6: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For solutions, data were acquired with a π/2 pulse width (18 μs at 90 watts), 15-s delay, and 4096 data points. Transformed data were the sum of 64 acquisitions which were apodized with a 3-Hz exponential filter prior to the Fourier transform. For muscle samples, data were acquired with a π/2 pulse width (6.6 μs at 50 watts), 15 s delay, and 2048 data points. Summed data were the result of either 300-400 data transients apodized with a 15-Hz exponential filter prior to the Fourier transform. The coil for this probe was a six-turn solenoid made from 30-gauge Formvar-coated copper wire, driven by a balance matched tank circuit, serially tuned to the phosphorus frequency. Muscle samples were held in place within a 1.5-mm inner diameter capillary. Magnetic field homogeneity was shimmed on the available proton signal prior to the start of the experiment to a line width of less than 0.07 ppm (for solutions) and 0.1 ppm (for muscle). Muscles were superfused with phosphate-free saline equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and contained (mM) 116 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 26.2 MOPS (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH), 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, and gentamycin (10 mg/l) at pH 7.4. Since these preparations gave reproducible 31P spectra for up to 4 h, we concluded that they were in a metabolic steady state during the 2-h duration of our experiment. Muscles were freeze-clamped after completion of spectral acquisition. Contralateral muscles were prepared similarly and frozen when its mate was put into the probe. Muscles frozen about 30-45 min after dissection rather than after 3 h in the NMR probe showed no differences in metabolite contents. Two methods of quantification were used for spectral analysis. In solutions where signal-to-noise and spectral resolution were high and base lines strictly flat, spectral peaks were integrated by summing digitized data symmetrically around each peak. Each integral value was expressed as fraction of the total phosphorus integral within the spectrum and reported in absolute chemical content based upon ATP concentration measured by optical spectroscopy as described above. In isolated hindlimb muscles, time domain fitting of free induction decay was used (45de Beer R. van Ormondt D. NMR Basic Principles and Progress. 1992; 26: 202-248Google Scholar) in a commercially available package (FITMASTERS, Philips Medical Systems). As with solution data, integrals were expressed as fractional areas and normalized to chemical content by HPLC-determined ATP content in μmoles·gww−1. ATP content by 31P NMR spectroscopy was the average of γ, α, and β ATP resonances. Chromatographic analysis was performed on stable neutralized perchloric acid extracts as described previously (46Wiseman R.W. Moerland T.S. Chase P.B. Stuppard R. Kushmerick M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Tendons were removed from frozen muscle before weighing. Total creatine content was the sum of Cr and PCr; total analog content for each compound was calculated similarly. 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to measure ATP, PCr, and PX in each solution during approach to equilibrium which reached completion within the first spectrum for cCr (less than 10 min), yet took approximately 8 h for βGPA (data not shown). Phosphorylation rates based on time to equilibration after addition of CK were substantially faster for cCr than βGPA as expected from kinetic constants for these compounds(47Rowley G.L. Greenleaf A.L. Kenyon G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows spectra of representative solutions at equilibrium. Note that phosphorylated analog species and PCr are resolved, and ADP was below limits of detection. Summed areas of PCr and phospho-analog resonances in final equilibrium solutions were the same as total PCr peak areas in initial spectra prior to addition of CK, and there was no change in ATP resonance intensities. This stoichiometry demonstrates that the increase in phospho-analog equaled the decrease in PCr. Besides verifying that equilibrium was reached, 31P NMR experiments provided HPLC standards for phospho-analogs, which were not otherwise available. At the conclusion of each NMR experiment reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC for their components of free analog necessary for proper calculation of Kcomb; HPLC analysis of phosphorylated species provided a cross-calibration of methods. Both HPLC and 31P NMR measurements permit separate calculation of a PCr/ATP ratio. Correlation between PCr/ATP ratio for NMR versus PCr/ATP by HPLC were linear with unity slope and intercepts that were not significantly different from zero at a level of p < 0.05. Regression equations were for solutions containing cCr (n = 7) and βGPA (n = 8), respectively. PCrATP(HPLC)=(0.98)PCrATPNMR+0.05(R2=0.923,cCr)(Eq. 6) PCrATP(HPLC)=(0.98)PCrATPNMR+0.05(R2=0.886,βGPA)(Eq. 7) Two such experiments (with least variance) were used to construct HPLC standards for phospho-analog in HPLC assays. These standards are essential for measuring PX concentrations in freeze-clamped muscles and for cCr treated animals where 31P NMR chemical shift differences are small. The values in all experiments for Kcomb with CK for both analogs are given in Table I. Kcomb values for both analogs with CK agree with previous reports(34Annesley T.M. Walker J.B. Biochem. Biophys.

There is an accumulation of phosphorylated synthetic analog within 21 days of feeding as indicated by the chemical shift change in the region of PCr (−2.54 ppm). Chemical shift differences (Δ = 0.44 ppm) between PCr and βGPAP (−2.98 ppm relative to phosphoric acid) were readily identifiable using 15 Hz apodization with near base-line resolution achieved using only 2 Hz filtering (see inset of panel B). In contrast, chemical shift differences (Δ = 0.16 ppm) between PcCr (−2.38 ppm relative to phosphoric acid) and PCr were much smaller with βGPA and not resolved as well in vivo due to inherently broader line widths compared with solutions. The inset of Fig. 2C contains the same region reprocessed with 2-Hz exponential filtering and shows PCr as a shoulder upfield from the PcCr resonance. Fractional peak areas of EDL and SOL muscles of control and analog-fed mice are presented in Table II.

Fig. 3 presents levels of PCr, Cr, and ATP in neutralized perchloric acid extracts determined by HPLC in control (open bars) and βGPA (closed bars)- and cCr (left-hatched bars)-treated muscles. Total Cr values for control SOL and EDL were 19.4 ± 1.04 μmol·gww−1 and 28.7 ± 1.71 μmol·gww−1 and decreased in both treatment groups after 21 days of analog feeding to 28 and 22% of control values for βGPA SOL and EDL and to 37 and 42% of control for cCr SOL and EDL, respectively. βGPA-treated mice contained only 29 and 31% of PCr in SOL and EDL, respectively. In cCr fed mice, PCr values were only 32 and 38% of control levels of PCr in SOL and EDL, respectively. The contents of free Cr decreased in both EDL and SOL with both analogs to approximately 50% of control levels. There was also a concurrent decrease in ATP concentrations for each analog treatment, however decreases were larger in βGPA group (54 and 73% of control for SOL and EDL) than in cCr group (75 and 95% of control for SOL and EDL). The contents of phosphorylated and free analog from βGPA (closed bars) and cCr (left-hatched bars) fed animals are presented in Fig. 4. Accumulation of each phospho-analog reached similar levels in both EDL and SOL during 21 days of feeding while levels of free analog were 11-12-fold lower in cCr-treated muscles than those from mice-administered βGPA. Integration of areas from 31P NMR spectra yields in vivo values for metabolite ratios which can be compared with HPLC data obtained from extracts of the same or contralateral muscle from the same animal under stable resting conditions. Therefore, we have independent validation by NMR and HPLC of relative metabolite content with respect to phosphorus containing metabolites. As with solution experiments, the test of quantitative agreement between the two techniques was performed by measuring PCr/ATP in addition to PCr/PX in NMR spectra and HPLC. Results of these comparisons are presented in Fig. 5. Note that compounds had no d"

Apolipophorin-III (apoLp-III)1( 1The abbreviations used are: apoLp-IIIapolipophorin IIIATRattenuated total reflectionDMPCdimyristoylphosphatidylcholineIRinfrared.) is an abundant hemolymph protein in the sphynx moth, Manduca sexta, that normally exists in a lipid-free state (Shapiro and Law, 1983Shapiro J.P. Law J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ApoLp-III is a single chain polypeptide of 166 amino acids (Mr = 18,300), which exists as a monomer in solution and is rich in α-helix structure (Cole et al., 1987Cole K.D. Fernando-Warnakulasuriya G.J.P. Boguski M.S. Freeman M. Gordon J.I. Clark W.A. Law J.H. Wells M.A. J. Biol.

The three-dimensional structure of lipid-free apoLp-III from Locusta migratoria has been elucidated by x-ray crystallography (Holden et al., 1988Holden H.M. Kanost M.R. Law J.H. Rayment I.

There is an approximate 50% homology between M. sexta and L. migratoria apoLp-III amino acid sequences, and these apoLp-IIIs have been found to be functionally indistinguishable (Van der Horst et al., 1988Van der Horst D.J. Ryan R.O. Van Heusden M.C. Schulz T.K.F. Van Doorn J. Law J.H. Beenakkers A.M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2027-2033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two apoLp-IIIs likely possess similar amphipathic helix folding motives (Wientzek et al., 1994Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When presented with a lipid surface, it was suggested that apoLp-III undergoes a conformational change that exposes the hydrophobic faces of the helices, thereby permitting interaction with lipid surfaces. Association of apoLp-III with DMPC vesicles results in the formation of uniform discs with an average diameter and width of 18.5 ± 2 nm and 4.8 ± 0.8 nm, respectively. Calculations based on the experimental characterization of these complexes together with the x-ray crystallographic data from L. migratoria apoLp-III allowed the presentation of a model of lipid-protein interaction (Wientzek et al., 1994Wientzek M.

To provide experimental evidence of the validity of this model, Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy was used here to gain information about the secondary structure and orientation of apoLp-III with regard to the lipid bilayer.

About the orientation, we provide the first experimental evidence of a unique orientation of the apoLp-III helical domains perpendicular to the lipid acyl chains. This topology is quite opposite to that described for the apoA1⋅DMPC (Brasseur et al., 1990Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys.

Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine was purchased from Sigma. Phospholipid (choline) enzymatic colorimetric analysis kit was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Deuterium oxide was from Janssen Chimica (Geel, Belgium). apoLp-III was isolated and purified from hemolymph of adult M. sexta with some modifications of the method by Wells et al., 1985Wells M.A. Ryan R.O. Prasad S.V. Law J.H. Insect Biochem. 1985; 15: 565-571Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar. The purity of the apoLp-III was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the pure apoLp-III was stored lyophilized at −20°C. DMPC vesicles were prepared by modification of the method of Swaney, 1980Swaney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 877-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. DMPC was dissolved in chloroform:methanol mixture (3:1), evaporated to dryness as a thin film under an inert atmosphere, and dried further for 2 h, followed by the addition of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The mixture was warmed to 50°C, vortexed, and then sonicated in a bath sonicator for about 20 min. The preparation and isolation of DMPC⋅apoLp-III complexes were performed as described by Swaney(1980) and Rifici et al., 1985Rifici V.A. Eder H.A. Swaney J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 834: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar with some modifications. ApoLp-III was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and added to the DMPC vesicles at a lipid:protein ratio of 2.5:1 (w/w) (molar ratio of about 70:1). After a brief mixing in a vortexer, the mixture was incubated at 24°C for 18 h. The density of the sample was adjusted to 1.21 g/ml with KBr in a final volume of 2.5 ml and placed in a 5-ml Quick-Seal tube, layered with 0.9% saline, and centrifuged at 65,000 rpm for 3 h at 4°C. At the end of the centrifugation, fractions of 0.5 ml were removed from the top of the tube and analyzed for protein and phospholipid content. The DMPC⋅apoLp-III complexes were localized by the coenrichment of protein and phospholipid, pooled, and dialyzed extensively against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The protein content of the final DMPC⋅apoLp-III complexes was evaluated by amino acid analysis (Beckman System 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer, System Gold Version 6/01) and the phospholipid content by colorimetric kit for choline. The complex had a lipid:protein weight ratio of 7.1:1 (molar ratio of 190:1). Control DMPC alone and apoLp-III⋅DMPC complexes were adsorbed to carbon-coated grids, stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, and viewed under a Philips FM 420 electron microscope operated at 100 kV (Wientzek et al., 1994Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to apoLp-III complexes, DMPC vesicles without added apoLp-III were employed in parallel control experiments. Spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrophotometer 1720X equipped with a Perkin-Elmer microspecular reflectance accessory and a polarizer mount assembly with a gold wire grid element. The internal reflection element was a germanium ATR plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45° yielding 25 internal reflections. 128 accumulations were performed to improve the signal/noise ratio. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air dried on a silicagel column (5 × 130 cm) at a flow rate of 7 liters/min. Spectra were recorded at a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1. At the end of the scan, they were transferred from the memory of the spectrophotometer to a computer for subsequent treatments. All the measurements were made at 20°C. Oriented multilayers were formed by slow evaporation of 100 μl of the sample on one side of the ATR plate. The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder (Perkin-Elmer 186-0354) and hydrated by flushing D2O-saturated N2 (room temperature) for 3 h. Fourier self-deconvolution was applied to increase the resolution of the spectra in the amide I' region, which is the most sensitive to the secondary structure of proteins. The self-deconvolution was carried out using a Lorentzian line shape for the deconvolution and a Gaussian line shape for the apodization. To quantify the area of the different components of amide I' revealed by the self-deconvolution, a least square iterative curve fitting was performed to fit Lorentzian line shapes to the spectrum between 1700 and 1600 cm−1. Prior to curve fitting, a straight base line passing through the ordinates at 1700 and 1600 cm−1 was subtracted. The spectrum arising from the lipid part of the system was found to be completely flat between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 and was therefore not subtracted. To avoid introducing artifacts due to the self-deconvolution procedure, the fitting was performed on the non-deconvolved spectrum. The proportion of a particular structure is computed to be the sum of the area of all the fitted Lorentzian bands having their maximum in the frequency region where that structure occurs divided by the area of all the Lorentzian bands having their maximum between 1689 and 1615 cm−1 (Goormaghtigh et al., 1990Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). For the amount of material used throughout this work, film thickness remains small when compared to the IR wavelength. This allows the “thin film” approximation to be used for the establishment of the equations describing the dichroic ratio as a function of the orientational order parameter (Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert, 1990Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar). The potential energy distribution of amide I consists in about 80%v(C=O), 10%v(C-N), and 10%δ(N-H). In an α-helix, the main transition dipole moment lies approximately parallel to the helical axis, while in an anti-parallel β-sheet, the polarization is predominantly perpendicular to the fiber axis. It is therefore possible to determine the mean orientation of the α-helix and β-sheet structures from the orientation of the peptide bond C=O group (Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert, 1990Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar). When this information was desired, additional spectra were recorded with parallel (0°) and perpendicular (90°) polarized incident light with respect to a normal to the ATR plate. Polarization was expressed as the dichroic ratio Ratr = A90°/A0°. The mean angle between the helix axes and a normal to the ATR plate surface was then calculated from Ratr. In these calculations, a 27° angle between the long axis of the α-helix and the C=O dipole moment was considered (Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert, 1990Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R.

Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The γw(CH2) transition at 1200 cm−1, whose dipole lies parallel to the all-trans hydrocarbon chains, was used to characterize the lipid acyl chain orientation (Fringeli and Günthard, 1981Fringeli U.P. Günthard H.H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded between 260 and 190 nm with a resolution of 0.5 nm on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter controlled by Jasco software. The spectropolarimeter was continuously purged with N2. The cell used was a cylindral quartz cell with a pathlength of 1 mm. The spectra were the result of four accumulations at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a response time of 0.125 s. The concentration of the samples was 0.15 mg of protein/ml. Fig. 1, A and B, and 2, A and B, show the IR spectra of a pure DMPC preparation and of the apoLp-III⋅DMPC complex (190:1 lipid:protein molar ratio), respectively. The amide I region of the spectrum (1700-1600 cm−1) (Fig. 2, A and B) reveals a symmetric peak with a maximum at 1653 cm−1 characteristic of a mainly helical structure in good agreement with the CD (Ryan et al., 1993Ryan R.O. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1525-1530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and x-ray (Breiter et al., 1991Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) data. Since the CD spectra of the apoLp-III⋅DMPC complexes provided evidence that apoLp-III becomes essentially completely helical after interaction with DMPC (Ryan et al., 1993Ryan R.O. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1525-1530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assigned the 1653 cm−1 band to the α-helix structure. After exposure of the sample to D2O-saturated N2 for 10 h, the amide I' region shifted from 1653 to 1646 cm−1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Compilation of literature data on the behavior of the α-helix amide I component (Goormaghtigh et al., 1994aGoormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) reveals that a 1646-cm−1 frequency is well within the range of frequencies characteristic of deuterated helices. To make sure that the shift of the amide I maximum from 1653 to 1646 cm−1 we observed after deuteration was not due to a change in the protein secondary structure upon incubation in the presence of D2O, we exchanged the aqueous buffer of a similar sample by either D2O or H2O by dialysis and recorded CD spectra. It turned out that this CD spectrum of the protein in D2O was exactly superimposable to the CD spectrum of the sample dialyzed against H2O (data not shown). We can therefore assign unambiguously the shift of the amide I to the deuteration of the α-helices of the apoLp-III.Figure 2:IR spectra of the apoLp-III⋅DMPC complex.

The calculated percentage of helical secondary structure (70-80%) (data not shown) is in good agreement with the Provencher-Glöckner analysis of the CD spectra, revealing a completely α-helical structure for the apoLp-III upon complex formation (Wientzek et al., 1994Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amide I region of the spectra (1700-1600 cm−1) was used to determine the orientation of the α-helices in apoLp-III relative to the DMPC hydrocarbon chains of the bilayers in the apoLp-III⋅DMPC complex. A dichroic spectrum, obtained by subtracting the spectrum recorded with 0° polarized light from the spectrum recorded with 90° polarized light, has a positive deviation when the dipole moment was oriented perpendicular to the germanium crystal plane and a negative deviation when the dipole moment was oriented parallel to the germanium plane (Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert, 1990Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar). Here, for both the undeuterated (Fig. 2C) and deuterated (Fig. 3C) samples, the amide I band is strongly 0° polarized, as shown by a negative deviation located in the helix region of the amide I band, indicating an orientation of the α-helices parallel to the germanium plate, i.e. parallel to the lipid bilayer and perpendicular to the acyl chains. This orientation of the helices is confirmed by the positive deviation in the amide II band at 1549 cm−1 corresponding to the α-helix amide II band (Goormaghtigh et al., 1994aGoormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Indeed, the amide I and amide II polarizations are perpendicular (Krimm and Bandekar, 1986Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar; Tsuboi, 1962Tsuboi M. J. Polym. Sci. 1962; 58: 139-153Crossref Google Scholar). A more quantitative estimation of the helix orientation can be obtained after iterative least square curve fitting applied to the deconvolved polarized spectra, which allows the computation of the dichroic ratio for the α-helix components in the apoLp-III⋅DMPC complex. While the isotropic dichroic ratio (i.e. the dichroic ratio measured for a dipole with an isotrope distribution) was 1.51, it was 1.21 for the amide I component, indicating that the helix axis makes a maximum tilt with the germanium surface of 20°. This value is a maximum estimate since taking into account additional sources of disorder, e.g. a mosaic spread (Rothschild and Clark, 1979Rothschild K.J. Clark N.A. Biophys. J. 1979; 5: 473-488Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar), would further reduce this tilt. The orientation of the lipid acyl chains was also assessed. In DMPC, the hydrocarbon chain in the α-position in the gel state is all-trans from the ester group to the methyl group. This conformation allows a resonance to occur between the ester group and the CH2 groups of the chain, giving rise to the so-called γw(CH2) progression between 1200 and 1350 cm−1 (peaks at 1201, 1230, 1257, 1280, 1304, and 1328 cm−1) (Fig. 1-3). The peak at 1200 cm−1 was chosen to characterize the lipid acyl chain orientation (Fringeli and Günthard, 1981Fringeli U.P. Günthard H.H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar). The strong 90° polarization of this absorption peak (Fig. 1-3) indicates that the all-trans hydrocarbon chains of DMPC are oriented nearly normal to the germanium surface. The measured dichroic ratio is 3.4-4.0. Accordingly, the maximum tilt between acyl chain and a normal to the germanium surface is equal to 20°. Additional source of disorder would reduce this tilt. These data indicate that the lipid hydrocarbon chains and the α-helices of the protein are oriented almost perpendicular to each other in the apoLp-III⋅DMPC complex. These results experimentally confirm the previously proposed model of discoidal DMPC particles containing α-helical segments of apoLp-III organized perpendicular to the phospholipid acyl chains on the periphery of the discoidal structure. It is to the best of our knowledge the first experimental evidence of a protein interacting with the lipid core and orienting normal with respect to the acyl chains. A significant shift of the amide I peak from 1653 to 1646 cm−1 was associated to the deuteration of the apoLp-III helical domains. On the opposite, such a shift has not been described after deuteration of the apoA1⋅dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine discoidal complex (Hefele Wald et al., 1990Wald J.H. Goormaghtigh E. De Meutter J. Ruysschaert J.-M. Jonas A. J. Bio. Chem. 1990; 265: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not observed for membrane and soluble α-helix-rich proteins tested so far in our laboratory. This raises the question of the helix structure (Φ, Ψ angles, hydrogen bonding). However, the frequency of the undeuterated form of the protein is in good agreement with a large set of data collected in the literature as reported by Goormaghtigh et al. (1994a). This demonstrates that the geometry and hydrogen bonding in the helices is close to this of a standard α-helix since the amide I frequency is very sensitive to these parameters. CD data confirm on the other hand the large amount of helix structure. We suggest that the peculiar distribution of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids on the two sides of the apoLp-III helices and the interaction with the lipid bilayer is responsible for the amplitude of the shift. The high extent of apoLp-III helices deuteration could be related to its interaction with the lipid bilayer. The apoLp-III helices are large and normal with respect to the acyl chains. The length of apoLp-III helices and the contours of the lipid discs could give to the helices a curved shape, which would increase the accessibility of their amide hydrogen, involved in hydrogen bonds, to the solvent and favor the hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange has been shown to be much more rapid in amphipathic helices distorted to a curved structure than in non-distorted helices (Zhou et al., 1992Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Sykes B.D.

Analysis of the pattern of methylation of specific genes reveals that different types of genes are demethylated in the ras transfectants: skeletal muscle specific genes, a gene specifically expressed in the adrenal cortex (c21), ubiquitous genes, and exogenously introduced sequences. Transient transfection and in vitro demethylation assays reveal that the ras transfectants express high levels of a general DNA demethylation activity. This demonstrates that the general DNA demethylation activity in mouse embryonal cells is controlled by an important cellular signal transducer and that DNA demethylase is a potential downstream effector of Ras.

DNA methylation patterns are a hallmark of vertebrate genomes. The cytosine moieties residing in the dinucleotide sequence CpG are generally methylated in vertebrate genomes; however, some CpGs are not methylated. The distribution of nonmethylated cytosines is tissue- and site-specific, resulting in a pattern of methylation (1Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1985: 353-378Google Scholar). It is clear that the pattern of methylation is established by a sequence of methylation and demethylation events (3Shemer R. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23676-23681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandeis M. Ariel M. Cedar H. Bioessays. 1993; 13: 709-713Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although it was originally suggested that DNA demethylation is accomplished by a passive loss of methyl groups during replication (5Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar), it is now clear that an active process of demethylation occurs in embryonal cells (6Frank D. Keshet I. Shani M. Levine A. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1991; 351: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), in differentiating cell lines (7Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H.

A. 1986; 83: 7167-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Whereas site-specific hypomethylation occurs during development, it is unclear whether the demethylation machinery per se is site-specific or whether site specificity is determined by other signals. A critical question for understanding the biological role of demethylation is whether it is an indirect result of other site-specific events, such as transcriptional activation, or whether mammalian cells bear a demethylation activity that is independently programmed with development. If demethylation is a programmed event, then the question is whether it is regulated by central cellular control points. We have recently shown that mouse embryonal teratocarcinoma P19 cells express a general demethylase activity. This activity was partially purified and was shown to demethylate DNA in the absence of exogenous dCTP, suggesting that it does not act via an excision repair mechanism.1( 1M. Szyf, J. Theberge, and V. Bozovic, unpublished data.) To address the question of whether this activity is regulated by cellular signaling pathways, we introduced exogenous v-Ha-ras into P19 cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. The involvement of signaling pathways triggered by Ras in differentiation of P19 cells has been studied before. Whereas both Src (11Boulter C.A. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 207-214PubMed Google Scholar) and Jun, a downstream effector of Ras (12deGroot A.U. Kruyt F.A. van der Saag P.T. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), can induce the differentiation of P19 cells, forced expression of oncogenic Ras does not induce or inhibit differentiation of P19 cells (13Rudnicki M.A. Reuhl K.R. McBurney M.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 67: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Ras might still induce some events that are part of the differentiation program. General genome-wide demethylation is one of the events associated with induction of differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells (14Razin A. Webb C. Szyf M. Yisraeli J. Rosenthal A. Naveh-Mani T. Sciaky-Galili N. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The fact that Ras does not induce full differentiation or cellular transformation of P19 cells will enable one to differentiate between events that are consequences of differentiation and those that are specifically triggered by Ras. The pZEMras expression vector bearing a 2.3-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding v-Ha-ras from the murine mammary tumor virus v-Ha-ras plasmid (15Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 49: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) or the pZEM control vector (16Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cointroduced into P19 cells with pUCSVneo (1 μg) as a selectable marker by DNA-mediated gene transfer using the calcium phosphate protocol (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). G418-resistant cells were cloned and propagated in selective medium and analyzed for expression of the transfected DNA by Southern and Northern blot analysis (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). DNA was extracted from three P19 PZEM control transfectants (1, 2, and 3) and three P19 lines transfected with pZEMras and subjected to a nearest neighbor analysis as described previously (8Razin A. Feldmesser E. Kafri T. Szyf M. Razin A. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry and Biology of DNA Methylation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1985: 239Google Scholar). 2 μg of DNA were incubated at 37°C for 15 min with 0.1 unit of DNase and 2.5 μl of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol from Amersham). 2 units of Kornberg DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) were then added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 25 min at 30°C. 50 μl of water were then added to the reaction mixture, and the unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spinning through a Microspin S-300 HR column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The labeled DNA (20 μl) was digested with 70 μg of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia) in the manufacturer's recommended buffer for 10 h at 37°C. Equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded on TLC phosphocellulose plates (Merck), and the 3′-mononucleotides were separated by chromatography in one dimension (isobutyric acid:H2O:NH4OH in the ratio 66:33:1). The chromatograms were exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak), and the autoradiograms were scanned by scanning laser densitometry (Scanalytics one-dimensional analysis). Spots corresponding to cytosine and 5-methylcytosine-dimensional were quantified, and the percentage of nonmethylated CpG dinucleotide sequences was calculated. To study demethylation of specific genes, genomic DNA (10 μg) was extracted from three pZEM (1, 2, and 3) and three pZEMras (6, 11, and 17) transfectants and subjected to digestion with HindIII (Boehringer Mannheim, 25 units) followed by digestion with either 25 units of MspI(M), which is insensitive to CC*GG methylation, or HpaII(H), which is sensitive to methylation, for 8 h at 37°C. At least three different DNA preparations isolated from three independent passages were assayed per transfectant to exclude variability between different DNA samples and verify the stability of DNA methylation patterns. A representative experiment is presented. pMetCAT+ plasmid was methylated in vitro by incubating 20 μg of plasmid with 10 units of SssI CpG DNA methyltransferase (27Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glazer G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (New England Biolabs Inc.) in a buffer recommended by the manufacturer. To verify that the plasmids were fully methylated, we repeated the methylation reaction (after full protection from HpaII had been observed) for two additional times. Methylated pMetCAT+ DNA (1-10 μg) (physical map in Fig. 3A, bottom panel) was introduced into P19 cells (8 × 104/well in a six-well tissue culture dish (Nunc)) by DNA-mediated gene transfer using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We used different concentrations of DNA/transfection mix to exclude differences in transfected plasmid concentration as an explanation for the observed differences in the level of DNA demethylation (1-10 μg). To avoid contamination of the transfected DNA with non-nuclear plasmid DNA, we first isolated the nuclei. Cells were dislodged by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, nuclei were isolated as described previously, and DNA was extracted (18Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled, fully methylated dCpG substrate was prepared as follows. 100 ng of a double-stranded (m5dC-dG) oligodimer (Pharmacia) were denatured by boiling, which was followed by partial annealing at room temperature. The complementary strand was extended with the Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) using m5dCTP (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]dGTP (100 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol), and the unincorporated nucleotides were removed by chromatography through a NAP-5 column (Pharmacia). Nuclear extracts were prepared from logarithmic cultures of pZEM (lines 1, 2, and 3) and pZEMras transfectants (lines 6, 11, and 17) as described previously and incubated with 1 ng of fully methylated CpG substrate for 30 min at 37°C in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mM EDTA. The reacted DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion to 3′ mononucleotides, TLC (using polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography, Brinkman), and autoradiography as described above. P19 cells were cotransfected with pUCSVneo and either pZEMras (15Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 49: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) or pZEM (16Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a control. G418-resistant colonies were isolated, and cells bearing the pZEM and pZEMras plasmids were identified by Northern and Southern blot analyses (data not shown). (Fig. 2F is a Southern blot demonstrating the presence of the pZEM and pZEMras constructs, and the Northern blot in Fig. 3 indicates the presence of the v-Ha-ras message in the selected transfectants.) Three transfectants/plasmid were randomly selected for our studies. The general level of CpG methylation in the ras transfectants and controls was determined by nearest neighbor analysis (8Razin A. Feldmesser E. Kafri T. Szyf M. Razin A. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry and Biology of DNA Methylation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1985: 239Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1 show a slight reduction in total DNA methylation in the ras transfectants. The DNA methyltransferase promoter bears AP-1 sites (19Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown by us to be inducible with Ras or Jun (20Rouleau J. MacLeod R.A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The general DNA methylation level might therefore reflect a balance of methylation and demethylation events induced by Ras.Figure 1:State of genomic methylation of P19 pZEM and P19 ras transfectants. The state of methylation of genomic DNA of P19 pZEM and P19 ras transfectants was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are presented as the averages of three independent transfectants/group ± S.D. The experiment was repeated three times. The statistical significance of the difference between the pZEM and pZEM ras groups was determined by a t test (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Ras induces demethylation or hypermethylation in P19 cells and whether these changes are general or targeted at a certain class of genes, we analyzed the state of methylation of specific genes using MspI/HpaII restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting, and hybridization with specific probes. Five classes of genes were selected: (a) a gene that is expressed in skeletal muscles (skeletal muscles are one of the prominent cell types into which P19 cells can differentiate (21Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas andEmbryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar)), the acetylcholine receptor γ chain (22Gardner P.D. Heineman S. Patrick J. Mol. Brain Res. 1987; 3: 69-76Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); (b) a gene that is specifically expressed in the adrenal cortex but is normally heavily methylated and repressed in P19 cells, steroid 21-hydroxylase (c21) (23Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); (c) a gene that is specifically expressed in P19 cells, thy-1 (24Draber P. Maly P. Hausner P. Pokorna Z. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 3: 369-378Google Scholar); (d) a gene that is ubiquitously expressed in all dividing tissues, the 5′ region of the DNA methyltransferase (19Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (e) the 3′ region of the human growth hormone gene, which was exogenously introduced into P19 cells (16Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (exogenously transfected DNA is methylated de novo in mouse embryonal cells (25Szyf M. Tanigawa G. McCarthy Jr., P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). DNA was prepared from exponentially growing cells, digested with HindIII and either MspI or HpaII, and sequentially hybridized with the different gene-specific probes indicated in Fig. 2. The pattern of methylation observed per each transfectant and the P19 controls were stable (data not shown), suggesting that, once forced expression of Ras triggers a change in DNA methylation, the new state of methylation is maintained. The c21 gene is heavily methylated in P19 cells and the pZEM transfectants, showing a high molecular band at 9 kb2( 2The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s) pair(s)HGHhuman growth hormonec21steroid 21-hydroxylase.) following HpaII digestion, whereas the MspI pattern reflects the expected fragments at 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.4, and 0.15-0.2 kb (Fig. 2A). All three ras transfectants show a diminution of the 9-kb, high molecular weight fragment following HpaII digestion and a distinct partially methylated HpaII fragment migrating as a 1.9-kb fragment (see physical map in Fig. 2A for possible origin of this fragment). In addition to the site-specific demethylation at the sites flanking the 1.9-kb partial HpaII fragment, some of the fully hypomethylated low molecular fragments are now observed at 0.8, 0.7, 0.4, and 0.15 kb. The demethylation of c21, which is not expressed in P19 cells (data not shown), suggests that this demethylation is not an effect of induction of gene expression. kilobase(s) pair(s) human growth hormone steroid 21-hydroxylase. We analyzed the state of methylation of a gene that is specifically expressed in myogenic lineages. The acetylcholine receptor γ chain 5′ region 1.3-kb HindIII fragment bears one CCGG site (physical map in Fig. 2B). The majority of the population of pZEM control transfectants is methylated at this site as indicated by the relative abundance of the 1-kb fully methylated HindIII fragment. In the ras transfectants, most of these sites are demethylated as implied by the presence of the 0.3- and 0.7-kb HpaII fragments (Fig. 2B). The myoD and myogenin genes are also heavily methylated in pZEM controls and demethylated in ras transfectants (data not shown). thy-1 is expressed in P19 cells (24Draber P. Maly P. Hausner P. Pokorna Z. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 3: 369-378Google Scholar) but not in a number of other cell types. The HpaII sites located in a CpG island upstream from the transcription initiation site of thy-1 are hypomethylated in P19 pZEM transfectants as well as P19 cells as demonstrated by the presence of the 0.6-kb HpaII fragment. One of these HpaII sites (site 2) undergoes de novo methylation in the ras 6 and 11 transfectants as indicated by the relative intensification of the 0.8-kb partially methylated HpaII fragment (Fig. 2C; see also the results of a densitometric analysis presented in Fig. 2D). These results imply that even under conditions where general genomic demethylation is taking place, some sites will remain selectively methylated or even undergo de novo methylation. The DNA methyltransferase gene is expressed in all proliferating cells and in P19 cells (19Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ region of the DNA methyltransferase bears a HpaII site, which is located in proximity to a cluster of AP-1 sites 1.7 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (physical map in Fig. 2E). Demethylation of this site will result in a 1.3-kb fragment following HpaII and HindIII digestion. The majority of P19 cells is methylated at this HpaII site as indicated by the presence of the hypermethylated 4-kb HindIII fragment in all three pZEM transfectants. A large fraction of the population of ras transfectants is hypomethylated at this site as indicated by the relative diminution of the 4-kb fragment and the increase in the relative intensity of the unmethylated fragment. We determined the state of methylation of the 3′ region of human growth hormone (HGH) cDNA included in the pZEM and pZEMras construct. Both constructs include the same promoter and 3′ sequences and should express similar transcriptional activity (both constructs are expressed in nonembryonal cells, data not shown). Whereas the transfected pZEM is heavily methylated in the control pZEM transfectants, the HGH 3′ region is markedly hypomethylated in all ras transfectants (Fig. 2F) as indicated by the presence of the expected HpaII low molecular fragments at 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 kb. Some low level of de novo methylation is observed in the ras transfectants (Fig. 2F, compare the MspI and HpaII lanes; the partially methylated fragments are indicated by asterisks). This marked difference between P19 and ras transfectants suggests that de novo methylation is inhibited by v-Ha-Ras. There are three possible explanations for the inhibition of de novo methylation in ras transfectants: Ras might inhibit de novo methylation per se; maintenance methylation might be inhibited; and de novo methylation might be intact, but demethylation activity is induced in ras transfectants. Similarly, the genome-wide demethylation observed in ras transfectants can be explained by inhibition of maintenance methylation, de novo methylation, or activation of demethylation. Alternatively, genome-wide demethylation might be caused by wide changes in chromatin structure altering the accessibility of DNA to the methylation machinery. To address the question of whether Ras induces a general demethylation activity in P19 cells, we utilized a transient demethylation assay. We have previously shown that P19 cells cannot methylate transiently introduced exogenous DNA de novo, but they possess an activity that demethylates in vitro methylated plasmid DNA.1 Therefore, a transient transfection demethylation assay can measure the level of demethylation activity in the cell without confounding de novo methylation. We utilized the previously described pMetCAT+ plasmid as a substrate (19Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid bears the 2-kb DNA methyltransferase 5′ region inserted in front of the bacterial CAT gene from pOCAT and a viral herpes tk gene (26Prost E. Moore D.D. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The HpaII site residing 5′ of the DNA methyltransferase fragment (−1931) (Fig. 3A, physical map) is methylated in P19 cells and demethylated in ras transfectants (Fig. 2E). The cat portion of the plasmid is a bacterial sequence that does not have a homologue in the P19 genome and could be used to measure nonspecific demethylation. The plasmid was methylated in vitro with SssI methylase (27Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glazer G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which methylates all CpG sites, and introduced into P19 cells, pZEM, and PZEMras transfectants by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Each experiment was repeated twice, and each transfection was done in triplicate. The autoradiogram in Fig. 3 (A and B) presents one representative experiment for each condition. DNA was prepared from nuclei purified from the different transfectants 48 h after transfection and was subjected to either HpaII or MspI digestion. Following agarose gel fractionation and Southern blot transfer, the filters were sequentially hybridized with either a CAT probe (Fig. 3A) or a methyltransferase 5′ probe (Fig. 2B). The presence of mRNA encoding v-Ha-Ras in the ras transfectants was verified by subjecting RNA made from the cytosolic fraction to Northern blot analysis and hybridization with a ras probe (Fig. 3C). To determine that loss of methylation of the transiently transfected plasmids does not result from replication in the absence of methylation, DNA prepared from the transient transfectants was subjected to digestion with DpnI. DpnI cleaves DNA only when its GATC sites are methylated on both strands. Because bacterial cells but not mammalian cells bear the methylase required for methylating GATC sites, sensitivity to DpnI implies that the plasmid did not replicate in the mammalian cell. As observed in Fig. 3D, the transiently transfected plasmid maintained its sensitivity to DpnI digestion. Especially instructive is an engineered site in the plasmid (Fig. 3D, bottom panel, for localization and description) where the DpnI cleavage site is located 3 base pairs apart from the HpaII cleavage site. Whereas >95% of the molecules are demethylated at this site in the ras transfectants as indicated by the sensitivity to HpaII cleavage (Fig. 3B, the 2.3-kb HpaII fragment), >95% of the transfected molecules are still sensitive to DpnI cleavage of this site (Fig. 3D, see bottom panel for location of the site), implying that the adenine residue is still methylated on both strands. This excludes replication and repair as a mechanism for demethylation. This does not exclude, however, very short patch excision repair (less than 3 bases) as a possible mechanism, as has been previously suggested (28Jost J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The autoradiograms were scanned, and the fraction of molecules that were fully demethylated at each point was determined (Fig. 3E). The transfection efficiency was similar in the different transfectants as determined by hybridization with a plasmid probe and normalizing to the level of nuclear DNA at each point (data not shown). As observed in Fig. 3, the levels of demethylation of both the exogenous Met 5′ region and the bacterial CAT sequences are increased severalfold (10-fold in ras 6 to 100-fold in the ras 11 transfectant) over the rate of demethylation observed in control lines. The fact that demethylation of murine, bacterial, and herpesvirus sequences is observed is consistent with the hypothesis that v-Ha-ras expression induces the expression of a general demethylation activity. To further determine whether Ras induces a demethylation activity that is independent of DNA replication, we determined whether nuclear extracts prepared from ras transfectants bear a higher demethylase activity than extracts prepared from control P19 cells. We synthesized a fully methylated 32P-labeled double-stranded poly-m5dCpG oligonucleotide in vitro using m5dCTP and [α-32P]dGTP as described in the legend to Fig. 4. 1 ng of the methylated substrate was incubated with 10 μg of 0.4 M NaCl nuclear extracts prepared from three pZEM and three pZEMras transfectants for 30 min at 37°C in the absence of exogenous dNTPs. The reacted DNA was digested to 3′ mononucleotides with micrococcal nuclease and subjected to thin layer chromatography to separate methylated and nonmethylated 3′32P-labeled dCMPs. The autoradiograms were scanned, and the relative intensity of demethylated dCMP was determined. As observed in Fig. 4, the extracts prepared from ras P19 transfectants bear a measurable level of an active demethylase, whereas this activity is barely detectable under these conditions in the control transfectants. Although it is well established that demethylation of specific sites in DNA is associated with development (1Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance.

Bioessays. 1993; 13: 709-713Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether site-specific demethylation events that have been extensively documented are side effects of readjustments of chromatin structure or whether they reflect an independent cellular process. In this report we show that genome-wide demethylation events could be programmed by an important cellular signaling pathway and that it can occur independent of the full manifestations of either differentiation or cellular transformation. The fact that ras transfectants demethylate transiently transfected exogenous DNA encoding a number of different sequences is consistent with the hypothesis that ras induces a general demethylation activity. These conclusions are further supported by the observation that nuclear extracts prepared from ras transfectants bear a measurable CpG demethylating activity. The chemical nature of the demethylation reaction is still unclear and will be determined in future experiments. Is this demethylation related to site-specific demethylation of CpG islands that occurs in embryonal cells? How can induction of a general demethylation activity lead to a specific pattern of methylation? We do not have the data to answer this question, but it has been previously hypothesized that the final demethylation pattern will reflect an interplay between a general demethylase(s) and local site-specific signals (29Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Another interesting observation is that expression of ras results in some limited de novo methylation of specific sites (Fig. 2C). The fact that both methylation and demethylation can be induced by Ras might be relevant to the question of how genome-wide hypomethylation (30Feinberg A.P. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Ehrlich M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1159-1161PubMed Google Scholar) and hyperactivation of DNA methyltransferase can coexist (31Kautiainen T.L. Jones P. J. Biol.

Sci. 1994; 15: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The fact that general demethylation could be induced by an important cellular signal transducer raises the interesting possibility that the control of the availability of a demethylase might be an important site through which the state of methylation of the genome might be regulated.

We have investigated the mechanism of this reaction by assaying PLC activity in Drosophila head membranes using exogenous phospholipid substrates. PLC activation depends on the photoconversion of rhodopsin to metarhodopsin and is reduced in norpAEE5 PLC and ninaEP332 rhodopsin mutants. NorpA PLC is stimulated by light at free Ca2+ concentrations between 10 nM and 1 μM. This finding is consistent with a Ca2+-mediated positive feedback mechanism that contributes to the rapid temporal response of invertebrate photoreceptor cells. The guanyl nucleotide dependence of light-stimulated PLC activity indicates that a G protein regulates NorpA. This was confirmed by the observation that light stimulation of PLC activity is deficient in mutants that lack the eye-specific G protein β subunit Gβe. These results indicate that Gβe functions as the β subunit of the G protein coupling rhodopsin to NorpA PLC.

Cytoskeleton. 1993; 34: 1-16Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We showed that the presence of MAP2 on microtubules restricts the gliding of MTs and MT-dependent organelle transport. It is reported in this paper that when microtubules are decorated with embryonic chicken MAP2, the presence of ATP restores the transport of MTs by kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. We attributed this ATP effect to a new serine kinase (embryonic MAP2 kinase, Mr = 100,000) which co-purifies with MAP2 from embryonic chicken brain causing release of MAP2 from MT and restoring motility. If MAP2 binding to MTs has a role similar to the troponin-tropomyosin complex in muscle in inhibiting motility, then phosphorylation may be the modulator. The cell can use this mechanism to regulate position and transport of organelles in the cytoplasm. Taxol was provided by Dr. Nancita Lomax at the National Cancer Institute.

The protein concentrations of the samples were determined by assay with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The quantitation of the molar ratio of MAP2 to microtubules was performed as shown in a previous paper (18López L.A. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil.

The microtubules were pelleted, and supernatant and pellets were incubated with sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed in an SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Bovine MAP2 purified by heat treatment was incorporated into PC-microtubules (see above), centrifuged through a 25% sucrose cushion (100,000 × g for 5 min), and resuspended with PGT buffer. A fraction of the suspension was left untreated or incubated with 1 mM ATP in the presence or absence of native chicken MAP2 (0.1 mg/ml) or the decided protein kinase.

Phosphoamino acids were identified on a thin layer chromatography plate (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The 32P-labeled embryonic MAP2 was excised from gels and incubated with 50 μg/ml trypsin in 50 mM NH4HCO3 at 37°C for 18 h. The incubation medium was dried, and the digested protein was treated with 6 N HCl at 100°C for 90 min. The hydrolysate was dried and solubilized with distilled water containing phosphoamino acid standards and xylene cyanol FF, Orange G, and acid fuschin to standardize the migration distance. The samples were spotted onto a plastic backed cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (E. M. Laboratories) and electrophoresed, 75 min at 800 V, in a Varsol-cooled TLE apparatus (Savant). The phosphoamino acid standards were visualized with ninhydrin, and autoradiography was used for detection of 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids from MAP2. After being incubated with [32P]ATP, samples were electrophoresed on 5% and 7.5% gels, stained, dried, and exposed to X-OMAT AR film. Quantification of the amount of phosphorylation was determined by cutting out the MAP2 region of the gel and solubilizing it with 10% H2O2 prior to counting with scintillant. Staining was performed according to Steuer et al.(31Steuer E.R. Schroer T.A. Wordeman L. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Microtubules were fixed in 2.0% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PGT buffer for 10 min at 20°C, centrifuged onto a coverslip, and postfixed in −20°C methanol. Samples were incubated for 30 min with 50:50 mixture of a 1:500 dilution of anti-tubulin monoclonal YOL 1/34 antibody (32Kilmartin J.V. Wright B. Milstein C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 93: 576-582Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and a 1:100 dilution of anti-MAP2 monoclonal AP 14 antibody (33Cáceres A.L. Binder L.I. Payne R. Bender P. Rebhum L. Steward G.O. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 394-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. After three rinses in phosphate-buffered saline, the samples were incubated for 30 min with a 50:50 mixture of a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and a 1:200 dilution of rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rat IgG in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were mounted in 50% (v/v) glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% N-propyl gallate and observed under a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Micrographs were taken with TMAX 400 ASA black and white print film (Kodak). In a recent paper (18López L.A. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 34: 1-16Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that microtubules decorated with bovine MAP2 are unable to be transported by kinesin or cytoplasmic dynein. Now the motility experiments were performed using microtubules decorated with embryonic chicken MAP2. In this new condition, MAP2 was obtained from a sucrose gradient (native form). Contrary to previous experiments (18López L.A. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 34: 1-16Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we observed that the native form of MAP2 had no effect on MT gliding when kinesin or dynein were used as motors and ATP was used as a source of energy, but it inhibited gliding when GTP was used in a kinesin assay (Table I). Using immunofluorescence analyses, we observed that native embryonic chicken MAP2 was released from MTs by the addition of ATP (Fig. 1). It is possible that the detachment would be due to an ATPase activity in MAP2 (34Schroer T.A. Sheetz M.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or that there exists a kinase that may phosphorylate and release MAP2. We support the second hypothesis since embryonic chicken MAP2 purified by boiling was as inhibitory as bovine MAP2 in the presence of ATP (Table I). Moreover, we incubated purified bovine MAP2⋅MTs with native embryonic chick MAP2 preparations and found that ATP released 80-90% of the bovine MAP2 from the MTs (Fig. 2A) and activated MT gliding to control levels (Fig. 2B). A factor present in the embryonic fraction, likely a kinase, releases completely bovine MAP2.Table I:Characteristics of embryonic chicken MAP2-microtubule gliding using ATP or GTP as energy source Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Incubation of microtubules with an embryonic chick fraction and movement on glass coverslip. Twenty μl of bovine MAP2-microtubule (0.3 mg/ml) (lane 5) were incubated at 20°C for 15 min, with 50 μl (lanes 1 and 2), 10 μl (lane 3), and 0 μl (lane 4), respectively, of embryonic chicken MAP2 fraction (0.1 μl/ml) with 1 mM ATP. PC-microtubules (0.3 mg/ml) were used in lane 5). (In lane 1, embryonic chicken MAP2 fraction was boiled before use.) The microtubules were analyzed for protein composition (A) and for motility (B). A, 2.5 μg of samples were run in 7.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular weight markers are indicated at the right of the figure. MAP2⋅MT are indicated at the left of the figure. B, the graphic shows the number of microtubules moving across the surfaces coated with cytoplasmic dynein (40 μg/ml).

Nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP and other nucleotides were tested, and it was found that inhibition of binding of MAP2 to MTs required ATP hydrolysis (see Table II). Half-maximal release used 0.02-0.05 mM ATP (Fig. 3). If kinase activity was assayed using [32P]ATP, MAP2 was the major species phosphorylated in our preparations and there was no phosphorylation of tubulin (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, a kinase causes MAP2 to release from MTs. Different kinase inhibitors were used to define the relevant kinase activity (9Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12721-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S. Walsh D.A. J. Biol.

Staurosporine and heparin did not inhibit the ATP effect; however, two kinase inhibitors were found to inhibit the ATP-dependent release of MAP2 to MTs (Table III), and the extent of inhibition correlated with the inhibition of MAP2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, there was no increase in release with cAMP added to ATP (Table II).Table II:Effect of nucleotides on MAP2 binding to microtubules Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Protein phosphorylation of embryo chicken MAP2 fraction. A, embryonic chick MAP2 was incubated with 0.2 mM ATP (lane 1) or [32P]ATP (0.33 mCi/pmol) (lanes 2-5) in the presence of KF (60 mM) (lane 3), glycerol 2-phosphate (125 mM) (lane 4), and heparin (30 μM) (lane 5). The samples were run on 5% SDS-PAGE (lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and exposed to a sensitive film (lanes 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′). B, a mixture of embryonic chick MAP2 and microtubules were incubated with [32P]ATP (0.33 mCi/pmol) and 0.2 mM ATP, the sample was run in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE (1Berkowitz S.A. Katagiri H. Binder H.K. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5610-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and exposed to a sensitive film (lane 1′).

A series of kinases has been shown to phosphorylate MAP2. We have tested the effect of several of these proteins in MAP2 binding to MT. β-Casein kinase (the NIMA protein) (26Lu K.P. Osmani S.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8769-8776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cdc2 kinase (37Draetta G. Brizuela L. Potashkin J. Beach D. Cell. 1987; 50: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) were able to phosphorylate MAP2 but do not change the affinity for microtubules (see Table IV). Mitogenic activated protein kinase phosphorylates MAP2 (38Hoshi M. Ohta K. Gotoh Y. Mori A. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Nishida E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found that this protein kinase is able to phosphorylate MAP2 in a way higher than embryonic MAP2 kinase, but it is unable to change the amount of MAP2 bound to microtubules (see Table IV) indicating that a specific phosphorylation is necessary to release MAP2. In addition, a native bovine MAP2 fraction presented a MAP2 kinase activity; however, it did not affect MAP2 affinity (see Table IV).Table IV:Degree of MAP2 phosphorylation and release from microtubules Open table in a new tab To determine whether the kinase activity was able to reassociate with microtubules, native embryonic MAP2 was incubated with microtubules, and the complex sedimented through a 25% sucrose cushion. We found that the kinase co-sedimented with the complex because MAP2 was released when ATP was added and the same inhibitors blocked the release (Table V). Thus, a kinase causes MAP2 to release from MTs, and that kinase binds to MAP2⋅MT complexes.Table V:Effect of ATP and kinase inhibitors on the release of MAP2 from MAP2-MTs pelleted on sucrose cushion Open table in a new tab The native embryonic MAP2 fraction was electrophoresed in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing purified bovine MAP2 as substrate in order to identify the MAP2 kinase activity (39Hutchcroft J.E. Anastario Jr., M. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A protein band with a relative motility of 100 kDa was identified (see Fig. 5). The degree of phosphorylation of this band decreased considerably when KF (60 mM) or glycerol 2-phosphate (125 mM) was added to the solution of kinase assay (data not shown). When the experiment was repeated using a gel without substrate, no band could be identified indicating that the band corresponds to a MAP2 kinase activity and not to an autophosphorylated protein. We used another assay to analyze the kinase activity of the fraction. We applied the embryonic MAP2 fraction to an ATP-agarose column. The ATP-release (filtrate) contains a prominent protein corresponding to a Mr = 100,000 band in the gel (Fig. 6A, filled arrow) and a minor band of Mr = 85,000 (Fig. 6A, empty arrow). The filtrate is able to phosphorylate MAP2 in a KF and glycerol 2-phosphate dependable way (Fig. 6B). The 100-kDa protein was separated from the 85-kDa protein in a Centricon filter, molecular size cutoffs at 100 kDa (Amicon). The 100-kDa protein (in the upper solution) shows the kinase activity; meanwhile, the 85-kDa protein (in the pass-through solution) shows no kinase activity (data not shown). The characteristics of amino acid phosphorylation of this kinase were analyzed. After phosphorylation with embryonic chick fraction, the band of phosphorylated MAP2 was separated from the gel, and the phosphoamino acids were analyzed in a TLC electrophoresis plate (see “Experimental Procedures”). It was shown that embryonic kinase phosphorylates MAP2 at serine amino acid residues (see Fig. 7). The evidence that the kinase activity of embryonic MAP2 fraction is generated by a protein of 100 kDa in both procedures, the gel renaturation kinase assay and the ATP-agarose chromatography assay, together with the fact that the kinase activity is inhibited by KF and glycerol 2-phosphate, led us to think that this protein kinase is able to phosphorylate and release MAP2 from the microtubules. We hold that it is a new protein serine kinase with a Mr = 100,000 named by us as embryonic MAP2 kinase. According to these results, it is considered that embryonic MAP2 kinase (E-MAP2k) is a new kinase with a Mr = 100,000 that interacts with microtubules, hydrolyzes ATP, phosphorylates MAP2 at serine residues, and provokes detachment from the microtubules. Several assays were used to demonstrate that this enzyme is unrelated to other kinases. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, cAMP kinase, cGMP kinase, pp60c-src, and myosin light chain kinase (36Tamoaki T.

Cell Regul. 1982; 21: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), did not inhibit either phosphorylation activity or the detachment of MAP2 from the microtubules. Two inhibitors, KF and glycerol 2-phosphate, inhibit E-MAP2k activity in the same way that they inhibit MAP2 kinase (9Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12721-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MAP2 kinase is the original name of mitotic activated protein kinase (p44mpk) (43Thomas G. Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). There are several characteristics that allow differentiation of E-MAP2k from this kinase: (i) p44mpk is not able to release MAP2 from the microtubules (38Hoshi M. Ohta K. Gotoh Y. Mori A. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Nishida E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and our result, (ii) it phosphorylates serine/threonine residues (45Erickson A.K. Payne D.M. Martino P.A. Rossomando A.J. Shabanowitz J. Weber M.J. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19728-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas E-MAP2k phosphorylates only serine residues, and (iii) it has a Mr = 42,000-44,000 (43Thomas G. Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) whereas E-MAP2k has a Mr = 100,000. Due to these differences, it seems logical to propose a new protein with kinase activity on the cytoskeleton. A surprising finding in these studies is that the release of MAP2 upon phosphorylation by E-MAP2k is nearly complete (70-90% released, see Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Previous analyses of the effect of phosphorylation of MAP2 (previously dephosphorylated in vitro) by a calf brain cAMP kinase reported only a 30% reduction in the binding to MTs under similar ionic conditions to those of the present study (8Murthy A. Flavin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or even smaller changes in the amount bound under these ionic conditions with a chicken cAMP-dependent kinase (6Burns R.G. Islam K. Chapman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 38Hoshi M. Ohta K. Gotoh Y. Mori A. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Nishida E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The present observations suggest that the binding constant is reduced by a factor of 10 or more by phosphorylation with the embryonic kinase preparation. cAMP-dependent protein kinase is bound to MAP2 in brain (4Sloboda R.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Vallee R.B. DiBartolomeis M.J. Theurkauf W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 47Rappaport L. Letterrier J.F. Virion A. Nunez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of MAP2 has been suggested to inhibit its binding to microtubules (7Jameson L. Caplow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3413-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Murthy A. Flavin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Brugg B. Matus A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but according to the above mentioned results, E-MAP2k is not a cAMP kinase (it is not inhibited by staurosporine and cAMP does not stimulate the release of MAP2). Inhibition of microtubule-dependent motility by MAP2 and activation by the presence of E-MAP2k are two events that we consider closely related in the cell. To explain this association, it is necessary to mention the special characteristics of MAP2. (i) MAP2 is a specific protein of neuronal cells with a particular localization on dendrite microtubules which has a relevant function in order to determine the shape of the cell. MAP2 expression is necessary for both neurite extension and cessation of cell division (48Dinsmore J.H. Solomon F. Cell. 1991; 64: 817-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). (ii) MAP2 has an important role in the regulation of MT-dependent organelle motility, particularly for small organelles which could direct cell polarization processes such as dendrite differentiation (18López L.A. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 34: 1-16Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). (iii) Like kinesin, MAP2 is bound to membranous organelles and can operate as a transitory binding of vesicles to microtubules (15Severin F.F. Shanina N.A. Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). According to this evidence we think, like Severin et al. (15Severin F.F. Shanina N.A. Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), that MAP2 positions vesicles in the cytoplasm and facilitates the transport by microtubule motors. But, according to our results, it is highly unlikely that this model could explain the mechanism to trigger the transport without a factor that releases MAP2 from the microtubules because of the following. (i) Microtubules decorated with MAP2 cannot transport vesicles in vitro in the presence of a high concentration of motor proteins and they cannot support formation of a normal membranous network formation either (18López L.A. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 34: 1-16Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). (ii) MAP2-microtubules restricted the transport of latex beads decorated with kinesin when the molar ratio of MAP2 to tubulin was still 1:30 (49Lopez L.A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115 (Abstr. 390a)Google Scholar). (iii) Furthermore, in any of these experiments, we can appreciate a significant loss of MAP2 from the microtubules by the action of motor protein coincident with the interpretation that a steric impediment but not a site competition between MAP2 and motor proteins is the origin of transport inhibition (18López L.A. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 34: 1-16Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All these suggest that activation of motility of the vesicles previously positioned by MAP2 should trigger the release of MAP2 from the microtubule. It was observed that E-MAP2k phosphorylates and releases MAP2 from microtubules, restoring the transport mediated by them. It is suspected that this protein-kinase could trigger the same activity in the cell. The hypothesis that a factor releases MAP2 from the MTs in the neuron is supported by two facts: (i) MAP2 is present in both axons and dendrites of cultured neurons at the early stages of development and is selectively lost from the axon during subsequent maturation (50Cáceres A. Banker G. Steward O. Binder L. Payne M. Dev. Brain Res. 1984; 13: 314-318Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 51Cáceres A. Banker G. Binder L. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 714-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kosik K.S. Finch E.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3142-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) exogenous MAP2 injected into the axon is removed faster from axonal than dendrite microtubules (53Okabe S. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4127-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Another important aspect of MAP2 and E-MAP2k is the fact that MAP2 is concentrated in the dendrites of neurons where there is a random polarity of the MTs (54Baas P.W. Deitch J.S. Black M.M. Banker G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). If MAP2 were to uncoat one population preferentially, due to phosphorylation-detachment of MAP2 by E-MAP2k, then a directional array of MTs would be adequate to support MT-dependent motility and would conduct the transport of vesicles. In the case of a totally random array of microtubules, the motors would not be able to produce directed movement over long distances because of the saltatory nature of the movement. Our model for the positioning and subsequent transport of vesicles suggests that the coating of MTs by MAP2 is analogous to the troponin-tropomyosin system in striated muscle. The regulator of motility in the MAP2 system would be the E-MAP2k described in this paper, which would remove the MAP2 from the MTs and would allow motility to occur. A cellular function of the E-MAP2k could be to up-regulate motility by phosphorylating and releasing MAP2 or perhaps another inhibitory MAPs from MTs. It will be important to determine whether the in vitro effect of the MAP2 corresponds to in vivo effects. Microtubules were polymerized with 1 mM GTP and 20 μM Taxol, except in Footnote c. Native embryonic MAP2 was incubated with PC-MTs plus 1 mM ATP in the presence or absence of inhibitors. The microtubules were centrifuged through a sucrose cushion (25%). The samples were then centrifuged, and MAP2 was quantified in the pellet by densitometry of the SDS-PAGE gels. Tubulin was polymerized with 1 mM GTP and 20 μM Taxol in the presence of MAP2, centrifuged through 25% sucrose, and resuspended in stabilizing buffer. Thirty g of MAP2-microtubules were incubated with the kinase sample in the presence of [32P]ATP and 0.5 mM ATP in a final volume of 90 μl at 20°C 30 min. The microtubles (bound) and the supernatant (free) were quantified by densitometry after SDS-PAGE. The bands containing MAP2 were excised from the gels, the gel was dissolved in H2O2, the radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter, and the moles of phosphate incorporated into 1 mol of MAP2 were estimated except in Footnote a. The data represent the average ± S. D. of two experiments. Native embryonic MAP2 was assembled with tubulin in the presence of 1 mM GTP and 20 μM Taxol. The microtubules were centrifuged through a sucrose cushion (25%) and incubated with ATP in presence or absence of inhibitors. The samples were then centrifuged, and MAP2 was qualified in the pellet by densitometry of the SDS-PAGE gels.

In the presence of L-tryptophan, TRAP binds to a segment of the nascent trp transcript and prevents formation of or disrupts an RNA secondary structure, the antiterminator, thereby promoting formation of an overlapping rho-independent terminator that causes transcription termination at a site just preceding the trp structural genes (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the absence of L-tryptophan, TRAP does not bind to the trp leader transcript (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Otridge J. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol.

Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). trp RNA-binding attenuation protein. The one unlinked trp gene, trpG, is part of the folic acid biosynthetic operon (9Slock J. Stahly D.P. Han C.-Y. Six E.W. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7211-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TrpG is a bifunctional polypeptide involved in the biosynthesis of folic acid as well as L-tryptophan (10Kane J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 419-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP binds to a segment of the trpG transcript that includes the trpG ribosome-binding site (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Slock J. Stahly D.P. Han C.-Y. Six E.W. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7211-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that TRAP binding regulates trpG translation by physically blocking ribosome access to the trpG ribosome-binding site. Results from studies characterizing the RNA-binding targets of TRAP revealed that the TRAP-binding site in trp leader RNA consists of 11 equivalently spaced (G/U)AG repeats (7 GAG and 4 UAG), whereas the trpG-binding site contains 8 such repeats (7 GAG and 1 UAG), although the spacing between adjacent repeats is more variable in the trpG transcript (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP was recently crystallized in the presence of L-tryptophan and shown to be a complex composed of 11 identical 8328-Da subunits (11Antson A.A. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies indicate that the TRAP subunits are arranged in a single toroid ring.2( 2P. Babitzke, D. G. Bear, and C. Yanofsky, manuscript in preparation.) In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that the TRAP subunit composition is identical in the presence or absence of L-tryptophan (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results demonstrated that the addition of L-tryptophan to TRAP altered the gel mobility of TRAP, suggesting that multiple L-tryptophan molecules can bind to TRAP (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the results of equilibrium dialysis studies that showed that association of L-tryptophan and TRAP was cooperative, with one molecule of L-tryptophan bound per TRAP subunit (11Antson A.A. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In previous studies using an in vitro transcription attenuation assay, we observed that L-tryptophan, 5-fluoro-DL-tryptophan, and 5-methyl-DL-tryptophan could activate TRAP, whereas D-tryptophan, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan, 7-aza-DL-tryptophan, tryptamine, and indole-3-propionic acid could not (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study we performed filter binding experiments with L-tryptophan and 26 of its analogs to determine the features of ligand required for TRAP activation. Labeled transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs Inc.). The labeling nucleotide was [5,6-3H]UTP (approximately 8 Ci/mmol). Transcripts were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by using a Sephadex G-50 Quick Spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). The template used in the transcription reaction was pPB77 that had been linearized with BamHI; the resulting transcripts contained all 11 of the (G/U)AG trinucleotide repeats present in the wild type trp leader transcript (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a single RNA species of the appropriate size was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TRAP was purified as described previously (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Filter binding assays were performed by a modification of an established procedure (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard filter binding reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained approximately 0.27 pmol (25 ng) of TRAP, 0.5 pmol of [3H]RNA, 10 units of RNasin (Promega), 1 mML-tryptophan or one of its analogs, and 1 mM dithiothreitol in TKM buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2). TRAP dilution buffer was 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, and 15% glycerol (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37°C and then filtered through BA85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were washed twice with 0.1 ml of TKM buffer, dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Control experiments were performed in the absence of L-tryptophan or its analogs. Filter binding assays were performed in RNA excess. Modifications of the filter binding assay are described in the text, figure legends, and tables. L-Tryptophan and various tryptophan analogs were obtained from Sigma, Aldrich, or other commercial sources, except for 1-methyl-L-tryptophan, which was generously provided by Robert Phillips of the University of Georgia. Previous results demonstrated that L-tryptophan is responsible for TRAP activation (3, 6). In the presence of L-tryptophan, TRAP binds to a segment of the trp leader transcript containing 11 closely spaced (G/U)AG repeats and to a segment of the trpG message containing 8 such repeats (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results have established that the TRAP multisubunit complex is composed of 11 identical subunits (11Antson A.A. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was shown that one molecule of L-tryptophan can bind per TRAP subunit and that association of ligand with TRAP is cooperative (11Antson A.A. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A filter binding assay that measures TRAP-trp leader RNA interaction (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to analyze the effect on RNA binding as a function of increasing L-tryptophan concentration. The results of this analysis (Fig. 1) demonstrated that the ability of TRAP to bind RNA approached saturation at an L-tryptophan concentration of 10 μM with half-activation at approximately 5 μM. Under our conditions 2 μML-tryptophan was the lowest concentration that allowed TRAP to bind to the test transcript (Fig. 1). The sigmoidal shape of the activation curve indicates that L-tryptophan association with TRAP is highly cooperative. When taken together with previous findings demonstrating that one molecule of L-tryptophan can bind per TRAP subunit in a cooperative manner, these results suggest that one molecule of L-tryptophan/TRAP subunit may be required for full activation. The number of bound L-tryptophan molecules required for partial activation is not known (compare the activity at 2 and 10 μML-tryptophan in Fig. 1). Cooperative activation suggests that association of the first molecule of L-tryptophan to unliganded TRAP might exert a conformational change in the TRAP complex that increases the likelihood that a second molecule of L-tryptophan will be bound. This process may be repeated until 11 L-tryptophan molecules are bound. Whatever the mechanism, however, the cooperative activation of TRAP by L-tryptophan differs from the mechanism of activation of Escherichia coli trp aporepressor (TrpR) by L-tryptophan. In the E. coli system, one molecule of L-tryptophan binds to each subunit of the TrpR repressor dimer noncooperatively (12Arvidson D.N. Bruce C. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 238-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Joachimiak A. Kelly R.L. Gunsalus R.P. Yanofsky C. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Lane A.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 157: 405-413Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Marmorstein R.Q. Joachimiak A. Sprinzl M. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4922-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an in vitro transcription attenuation assay, we previously observed that L-tryptophan, 5-fluoro-DL-tryptophan, and 5-methyl-DL-tryptophan could activate TRAP, whereas D-tryptophan, 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan, 7-aza-DL-tryptophan, tryptamine, and indole-3-propionic acid could not (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Subsequently a more sensitive filter binding assay was developed that allows us to examine TRAP activation by analogs directly (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the features of L-tryptophan that are required for TRAP activation we used the filter binding assay to compare the ability of L-tryptophan and 26 of its analogs to activate TRAP (Fig. 2). Several analogs activated TRAP at a concentration of 1 mM; however, in no case was activation as effective as with L-tryptophan (Table I). Analogs that resulted in appreciable TRAP activation at 1 mM were also tested at 50 and 5 μM. Five of the analogs were found to activate TRAP at 50 μM; however, none of these analogs activated appreciably at 5 μM (Table I). In a previous study using an in vitro transcription attenuation assay we found that D-tryptophan did not activate TRAP (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We tested D-tryptophan in the more sensitive filter binding assay to substantiate our previous result. D-Tryptophan did not activate TRAP at a concentration of 1 mM (Fig. 2 and). This result, combined with the observations that 10 μML-tryptophan almost fully activated TRAP (Fig. 1) and that 5 μML-tryptophan resulted in 50% activation (Fig. 1 and), demonstrates that TRAP activation is highly stereospecific, suggesting that positioning of the α-carboxyl and amino groups of tryptophan is crucial for TRAP activation. This finding contrasts with results obtained for the E. coli trp repressor (TrpR), for which it was observed that, once bound, D-tryptophan is a more effective corepressor than L-tryptophan (16Marmorstein R.Q. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9149-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that indole-3-propionic acid did not activate TRAP in the transcription attenuation assay (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the α-amino group might be crucial for TRAP activation (Fig. 2). To examine this possibility more thoroughly, we used the filter binding assay to test analogs of L-tryptophan in which the α-amino group of L-tryptophan was replaced by a hydrogen atom (indole-3-propionic acid) or a hydroxyl group (indole-3-lactic acid) or was methylated (N-methyl-L-tryptophan or L-abrine) (Fig. 2). Each of these changes eliminated TRAP activation (Table I). These results suggest that the hydrogen donor capabilities and/or the positive charge of the α-amino group is required for TRAP activation. Note that the simple presence of a positive charge is not sufficient for TRAP activation because both L-tryptophan and N-methyl-L-tryptophan (L-abrine) carry a positive charge (Fig. 2). These results are similar to findings with E. coli TrpR that indicated that the positive charge of the α-amino group is required for corepressor activity. However, with TrpR L-abrine was found to be a better corepressor than L-tryptophan (16Marmorstein R.Q. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9149-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously observed, using a transcription attenuation system, that tryptamine did not activate TRAP (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the α-carboxyl group of L-tryptophan was involved in the activation of TRAP (Fig. 2). To substantiate this conclusion we used the filter binding assay to examine L-tryptophan analogs in which the α-carboxyl group was replaced by a hydrogen (tryptamine) or a hydroxyl group (L-tryptophanol) or in which the negative charge was removed but the carbonyl moiety of the carboxyl group was retained (L-tryptophanamide and L-tryptophan methyl ester) (Fig. 2). The negative charge associated with the carboxyl group does not appear to be required for TRAP activation, because both L-tryptophan methyl ester and L-tryptophanamide activated TRAP at a concentration of 1 mM (Table I). In fact, the methyl ester derivative resulted in substantial TRAP activation at a concentration of 50 μM (Table I). However, removal of the carbonyl moiety and the negative charge (L-tryptophanol) or the entire carboxyl group (tryptamine) prevented TRAP activation (Table I). These results suggest that the hydrogen acceptor capability of the carbonyl moiety is involved in TRAP activation and that the negative charge of the carboxyl group enhances but is not required for TRAP activation. These results are similar to findings with E. coli TrpR, for which it was shown that the α-carboxyl group enhances but is not essential for corepressor activity (16Marmorstein R.Q. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9149-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studies with E. coli TrpR it was proposed that a substituent other than hydrogen at the N-1 position of L-tryptophan would sterically interfere with the protein-DNA contact surface and deprive the repressor-operator interaction of a stabilizing hydrogen bond (16Marmorstein R.Q. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9149-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that 1-methyl-L-tryptophan did not activate TRAP (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This result seemed to indicate that the hydrogen donor capability of the indole ring's secondary amine was required for TRAP activation (Fig. 2). Using the more sensitive filter binding assay, we found that 1-methyl-L-tryptophan at a concentration of 1 mM resulted in low level TRAP activation (Table I). This result indicates that the presence of the secondary amine, though not absolutely required, greatly enhances TRAP activation. Perhaps L-tryptophan donates the hydrogen atom at the N-1 position to a suitable hydrogen bond acceptor in TRAP. Several mtrB mutations have been isolated that are resistant to the L-tryptophan analogs 5-fluoro-L-tryptophan (4Gollnick P. Ishino I. Kuroda M.I. Henner D.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8726-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and 5-methyl-L-tryptophan (17Hoch S.O. Roth C.W. Crawford I.P. Nester E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 38-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because these analogs can activate TRAP (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but are not suitable for protein synthesis (11Antson A.A. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and because the drugs depress L-tryptophan synthesis, wild type cells presumably are inhibited. Thus, analog resistance arises by a loss of TRAP activity. Results with the transcription attenuation assay indicated that the hydrogen atom at position 5 of the L-tryptophan benzene ring could be replaced by a fluoro (5-fluoro-L-tryptophan) or a methyl (5-methyl-L-tryptophan) group and still allow TRAP activation (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These and other analogs with benzene ring substitutions at positions 4, 5, or 6 were tested in the filter binding assay. Each of these analogs at a concentration of 1 mM activated TRAP (Table I). The modifications included the replacement of a hydrogen with a methyl group at position 4 (4-methyl-L-tryptophan), a hydroxyl, fluoro, or methyl group at position 5 (5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, 5-fluoro-L-tryptophan, or 5-methyl-L-tryptophan), or a fluoro or methyl group at position 6 (6-fluoro-L-tryptophan or 6-methyl-L-tryptophan). Of these, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, 5-fluoro-L-tryptophan, and 6-fluoro-L-tryptophan activated TRAP at a concentration of 50 μM (Table I). Notably, the level of TRAP activation by these analogs correlates with the physical size of the chemical substituent replacing the hydrogen; however, the relative polarity of the various substituents may effect TRAP activation (Fig. 2 and Table I). Previous results suggested that substitution of a pyridine ring for the benzene ring of L-tryptophan (7-aza-L-tryptophan) eliminated TRAP activation (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, this compound gave significant TRAP activation at a concentration of 1 mM when it was tested in the more sensitive filter binding assay (Table I). This result suggests that TRAP can tolerate a significant distortion of the heterocyclic ring of the indole moiety of L-tryptophan and still be activated. However, loss of the heterocyclic ring, as in L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, could not be tolerated (Fig. 2 and Table I). Several other L-tryptophan analogs were also tested for the ability to activate TRAP in the filter binding assay. Of these, only substitution of the α-hydrogen with a methyl group (α-methyl-L-tryptophan) still permitted TRAP activation (Fig. 2 and Table I). Taken together, the results of our TRAP activation studies indicate that TRAP can tolerate relatively modest changes in the structure of the indole ring of L-tryptophan; however, changes that disrupt the functional groups that may form hydrogen bonds with TRAP tend to have more serious consequences. Even a modest change such as methylation of the α-amino group of L-tryptophan (N-methyl-L-tryptophan) completely abolished TRAP activation (Fig. 2 and Table I). In addition, changes that eliminate the carbonyl moiety of the α-carboxyl group (L-tryptophanol and tryptamine) rendered the analog ineffective in TRAP activation, whereas analogs that retain the carbonyl moiety (L-tryptophan methyl ester and L-tryptophanamide) still can activate TRAP, albeit at substantially reduced levels in the case of L-tryptophanamide (Fig. 2 and Table I). Furthermore, disruption of the hydrogen bonding capability of the heterocyclic amino group of L-tryptophan (1-methyl-L-tryptophan) resulted in a dramatic decrease in its ability to activate TRAP (Fig. 2 and Table I). Previously, using the transcription attenuation assay, we found that D-tryptophan, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan, 7-aza-DL-tryptophan, tryptamine, and indole-3-propionic acid could not prevent TRAP activation when the analogs were present in a 50-fold molar excess over L-tryptophan (3Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We repeated and extended these L-tryptophan competition experiments using the filter binding assay with analogs that were unable to activate TRAP (Table II). An L-tryptophan concentration of 5 μM was selected for analog competition analysis; at this concentration even slight competition will result in a substantial change in activation of TRAP (Fig. 1). Competition experiments were initially performed at an analog concentration of 1 mM (200-fold molar excess over L-tryptophan). Indole and 5-methylindole were very effective competitors; other analogs that were unable to activate TRAP showed only modest competition (data not presented). Competition by indole and 5-methylindole was examined at a range of concentrations, and both analogs were found to be much less effective at a 20-fold molar excess (100 μM) than at a 200-fold excess (1 mM) (Fig. 2 and Table II). This requirement for excess competitor may reflect a weaker affinity for TRAP and/or the analogs may not induce cooperative binding. The fact that these analogs bind to TRAP and compete with L-tryptophan suggests that the indole ring is sufficient to confer attachment to the tryptophan-binding site(s) of TRAP. However, the indole moiety is insufficient to activate TRAP; as seen with other L-tryptophan analogs, the α-carboxyl and α-amino groups are required as well. The results of these studies indicate that TRAP activation by L-tryptophan is highly cooperative and that TRAP activation is stereospecific. We determined that the α-amino group and the carbonyl moiety of the α-carboxyl group of the ligand are required for TRAP activation and that the secondary amine of the indole ring of L-tryptophan greatly enhances TRAP activation. We found that indole and 5-methylindole are effective competitors of L-tryptophan activation of TRAP, suggesting that the indole ring is recognized by the protein and that bound indole prevents L-tryptophan binding. However, indole and 5-methylindole did not activate TRAP. We thank Bob Matthews and Peter Margolis for critical reading of the manuscript. We also thank Virginia Horn for technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W2021317260,"The expression of CYP2C12 is liver-specific and regulated at the transcriptional level by growth hormone (GH). In attempts to elucidate the nature of signaling molecules mediating the GH regulation of this gene in rat hepatocytes, a role for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) as a transducer of GH-induced levels of P4502C12 mRNA was investigated. GH was shown to induce tyrosyl-phosphorylation of p42 and p44 microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases and to reduce the electrophoretic mobility of a 100-kDa protein, immunologically related to cPLA2. These events were observed in parallel with GH-stimulated release of [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) from cellular phospholipids of rat hepatocytes labeled with [3H]AA. These rapid effects of GH action, as well as the GH-induced expression of CYP2C12, were inhibited in cells treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Similarly, when the GH-induced liberation of [3H]AA was blocked by the PLA2 inhibitor mepacrine or the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, GH-induced accumulation of P4502C12 mRNA was absent. These results suggest a correlation between PLA2 activity and GH regulation of the CYP2C12 gene. The inhibitory effect of mepacrine on GH induction of P4502C12 mRNA was reversed by AA addition, further supporting a role for eicosanoids in the regulation of CYP2C12. Finally, inhibitors of P450-mediated AA metabolism, SKF-525A and ketoconazole as well as eicosatetraynoic acid, blocked the GH-mediated induction of P4502C12 mRNA, whereas more specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase metabolism did not. Based on these results, we suggest that GH signaling in rat hepatocytes, leading to increased expression of CYP2C12, involves PLA2 activation and subsequent P450-catalyzed formation of an active AA metabolite. The expression of CYP2C12 is liver-specific and regulated at the transcriptional level by growth hormone (GH). In attempts to elucidate the nature of signaling molecules mediating the GH regulation of this gene in rat hepatocytes, a role for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) as a transducer of GH-induced levels of P4502C12 mRNA was investigated. GH was shown to induce tyrosyl-phosphorylation of p42 and p44 microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases and to reduce the electrophoretic mobility of a 100-kDa protein, immunologically related to cPLA2. These events were observed in parallel with GH-stimulated release of [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) from cellular phospholipids of rat hepatocytes labeled with [3H]AA. These rapid effects of GH action, as well as the GH-induced expression of CYP2C12, were inhibited in cells treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Similarly, when the GH-induced liberation of [3H]AA was blocked by the PLA2 inhibitor mepacrine or the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, GH-induced accumulation of P4502C12 mRNA was absent. These results suggest a correlation between PLA2 activity and GH regulation of the CYP2C12 gene. The inhibitory effect of mepacrine on GH induction of P4502C12 mRNA was reversed by AA addition, further supporting a role for eicosanoids in the regulation of CYP2C12. Finally, inhibitors of P450-mediated AA metabolism, SKF-525A and ketoconazole as well as eicosatetraynoic acid, blocked the GH-mediated induction of P4502C12 mRNA, whereas more specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase metabolism did not. Based on these results, we suggest that GH signaling in rat hepatocytes, leading to increased expression of CYP2C12, involves PLA2 activation and subsequent P450-catalyzed formation of an active AA metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1971634457,"Transgenic mice which overexpress kinase-deficient human insulin receptors in muscle were used to study the relationship between insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and the in vivo activation of several downstream signaling pathways. Intravenous insulin stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity by 7-fold in control muscle versus ≦1.5-fold in muscle from transgenic mice. Similarly, insulin failed to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of receptor β-subunits or insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in transgenic muscle. Insulin substantially stimulated IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in control versus absent stimulation in transgenic muscles. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor 1 modestly stimulated PI 3-kinase in both control and transgenic muscle. The effects of insulin to stimulate p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-fos mRNA expression were also markedly impaired in transgenic muscle. Specific immunoprecipitation of human receptors followed by measurement of residual insulin receptors suggested the presence of hybrid mouse-human heterodimers. In contrast, negligible hybrid formation involving insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors was evident. We conclude that (i) transgenic expression of kinase-defective insulin receptors exerts dominant-negative effects at the level of receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activation; (ii) insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity is required for in vivo insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation, IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activation, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-fos gene induction in skeletal muscle; (iii) hybrid receptor formation is likely to contribute to the in vivo dominant-negative effects of kinase-defective receptor expression.

Insulin's diverse actions are initiated by binding to its specific transmembrane receptor. The intracellular β-subunits of the insulin receptor possess intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity which is stimulated by insulin binding to the extracellular α-subunits and is augmented by β-subunit tyrosyl autophosphorylation. The preponderance of current data suggests that most, if not all, of insulin's biological effects are mediated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. Moller D.E. Insulin Resistance. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, New York1994: 9-24Google Scholar). However, several mutated versions of the insulin receptor with impaired tyrosine kinase activity (toward exogenous substrates) reportedly retain the capacity to mediate signaling toward one or more biological actions of insulin (2Wilden P.A.

However, the relationship between the receptor tyrosine kinase and activation of these (or other) cellular signaling intermediates in any in vivo target tissues for insulin has not been directly addressed. We have recently generated lines of transgenic mice which express a dominant-negative mutant human insulin receptor (Ala1134 → Thr) in skeletal and cardiac muscle (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mice are mildly insulin resistant as determined by hyperinsulinemia and reduced glycemic responsiveness to exogenous insulin (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, skeletal muscle from these transgenic mice displayed reduced insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this animal model provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of altered insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in an important insulin target tissue. In the present study, we investigated the consequences of impaired insulin receptor kinase activity for the ability of insulin administered in vivo to regulate molecules that participate in several important signaling pathways (IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, MAP kinase, and c-fos mRNA) in muscle. We also provide evidence which supports the hypothesis that the mechanism(s) responsible for trans-dominant effects of kinase-deficient insulin receptor expression involves the formation of hybrid heterodimer complexes between endogenous murine receptors and overexpressed mutant human receptors. The construction of transgenic mice with muscle-specific overexpression of a mutant human insulin receptor (Ala1134→ Thr) was described previously (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice (inbred FVB-NJ strain) used in the present study were 8-12-week-old hemizygous transgenics derived from two independent lines of transgenic mice. Similar numbers of mice from both lines were used for experiments described below. Age- and sex-matched littermate control mice were used for each experiment. The level of muscle insulin receptor expression in control versus transgenic mice was determined by immunoblotting with a nonspecies-specific anti-insulin receptor antibody (IR-C) directed against the C terminus of the receptor β-subunit (kindly provided by B. Cheatham and C. R. Kahn, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston). Muscle protein lysates were prepared from samples of powdered frozen muscle as described below. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye binding assay kit (Bio-Rad) or BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Aliquots of muscle lysate containing solubilized protein (300 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TNA (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide) with the addition of 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature followed by the addition of the IR-C antibody (1:500) for an additional 2 h. After removal of unbound antibody, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h followed by washing for 2 × 10 min in TNA plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 2 × 10 min in TNA with 0.1% Tween 20. Detection was accomplished using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). The procedure for measurement of muscle insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was similar to previously described methods (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Klein H.H. Kowalewski B. Drenckhan M. Neugebauer S. Matthaei S. Kotzke G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 883-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, fasted mice (overnight) were anesthetized with Avertin (Tribromoethanol, tertamyl alcohol, Aldrich) and kept on a warming pad. Samples of gluteal or gastrocnemius muscle (50-200 mg) were removed 2 min following intravenous injection (tail vein) of the indicated doses of insulin or recombinant IGF-1 (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) or saline. Muscle samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and Polytron homogenized in ice-cold Buffer A containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. After incubation for 30 min and brief centrifugation, supernatant containing 100 μg of soluble protein was incubated overnight at 4°C in microtiter wells coated with a nonspecies-specific insulin receptor antibody (AB-3, Oncogene Science). Tyrosine kinase activity of the bound insulin receptors was measured by adding 20 μl of poly-Glu-tyr (4:1) (Sigma) (4 mg/ml in water) and 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.5 μM ATP, and 7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min of incubation at 20°C, the reaction was stopped by spotting onto filter paper (Whatman 3MM). Filter papers were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. Muscle lysates were prepared as described above. Solubilized proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with TNA containing 5% albumin for 2 h at 37°C. The membranes were then incubated with affinity-purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (αPY provided by R. J. Smith, Joslin Diabetes Center, 24) in TNA plus 5% bovine serum albumin for 12-16 h at 4°C. Membranes were washed 2 × 5 min in TNA plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 1 × 5 min in TNA plus 0.1% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with 125I-Protein A (1 μCi/ml) (ICN Biomedical, Costa Mesa, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands corresponding to phosphorylated IRS-1 or insulin receptor β-subunit were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The level of IRS-1 protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting of mouse muscle lysate with anti-IRS-1 antibody (gift of Morris White, Joslin Diabetes Center) using methods described above. Gluteal and gastrocnemius muscle lysates were prepared as described above after 2 min intravenous stimulation with insulin, IGF-1, or saline. Cleared muscle lysates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity that was measured in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibodies to IRS-1 (αIRS-1, affinity purified polyclonal antibody prepared by injecting rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acids in the C-terminal region of rat IRS-1, provided by R. J. Smith, Joslin Diabetes Center). Enzyme activity in reconstituted immunoprecipitates was assayed as described previously (25Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), with some modification. Muscle lysate containing 3 mg of solubilized protein was incubated with αIRS-1 and protein A-Sepharose (Pierce). Immune complexes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μM Na3VO4, three times with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM LiCl, and twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 μM Na3VO4. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of the Tris-NaCl buffer containing 12 mM MgCl2 and 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL). The PI 3-kinase reaction (room temperature) was initiated by adding 10 μl of 440 μM ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. After 10 min of vigorous vortexing, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 N HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The phases were separated by centrifugation, and the lower organic phase was spotted onto thin layer chromatography plates (25Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Lipids were resolved by chromatography in CH3OH/CHCl3/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2) and visualized by autoradiography. Radioactivity in the spots which co-migrated with a PI-3-P standard was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Mice were fasted for 48 h, followed by anesthesia with Avertin and placement on a warming pad. Following intravenous administration of the indicated insulin doses or saline, mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points and muscle was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscle was homogenized and solubilized in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 followed by incubation for 30 min at 4°C, and brief centrifugation. The phosphorylation state of p42 and p44 MAP kinases was assessed by electrophoretic mobility as follows. Aliquots of muscle lysate containing 70 μg of solubilized protein were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with an anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibody (α-C2, provided by John Blenis, Harvard Medical School). The conditions for immunoblotting, washing, and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence are described above. For c-fos mRNA expression, fasted mice (overnight) were anesthetized with Avertin, followed by intraperitoneal injection of 10 milliunits/g insulin as a combination of regular (Humulin R, Lilly) and long-acting (Humulin N) insulin (26Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A dose of intraperitoneal glucose (1.0 mg/g body weight) that was empirically determined to prevent the development of hypoglycemia was also administered. After 1 h, mice were sacrificed, and a sample of muscle was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Twenty μg of total RNA (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) was separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels followed by transfer to nylon membranes. Membranes were hybridized (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a random-primed [32P]dCTP-labeled fragment of rat c-fos cDNA (provided by M. Jakubowski, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston). After washing with high stringency (28Mountjoy K.G. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Holdaway I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), membranes were subjected to autoradiography as described previously (28Mountjoy K.G. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Holdaway I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). A random-primed labeled [32P]dCTP β-actin cDNA probe was also prepared and used as described previously (28Mountjoy K.G. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Holdaway I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The bands corresponding to c-fos and β-actin transcripts were quantitated by PhosphorImager. Muscle lysates from control and transgenic mice were prepared using Buffer A as described above. Aliquots of lysate (500 μl) containing 200 μg of solubilized protein were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal human-specific anti-insulin receptor antibody (83-14, kindly provided by K. Siddle, Cambridge University, U.K.) and Protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4°C. After immunoprecipitating three times, aliquots of the supernatant were used for an insulin receptor binding assay and immunoblotting with nonspecies-specific anti-insulin receptor antibody (IR-C). Immunoprecipitated proteins (present in the pellet) were also analyzed by immunoblotting with IR-C. For the insulin binding assay, procedures were as described previously (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting of insulin receptors present in the pellet or supernatant, proteins were separated, blotted, and probed with IR-C exactly as described above (“Quantitation of Muscle Insulin Receptor Expression”). IGF-1 receptors present in solubilized muscle lysates (and in 83-14 immunoprecipitates from muscle lysates) were detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-mouse IGF-I receptor antibody (α-IGFR, provided by L. H. Wang, Mount Sinai, New York). Protein lysates prepared from CHO cells which overexpress human IGF-I receptors (CHO-IGFR, provided by Richard Roth, Stanford University) and CHO cells which overexpress human insulin receptors (CHO-IR, 4) were used as controls in the above experiments. Two independent lines of transgenic mice which overexpress mutant Thr1134 human insulin receptors in skeletal and cardiac muscle were generated and characterized as described previously (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to verify that mutant human receptors were overexpressed in muscles that were subsequently studied, solubilized gluteal and gastrocnemius muscle proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibody IR-C which recognizes both murine and human insulin receptors. As shown in Fig. 1, analysis of these muscles confirmed that the level of mutant receptor expression in both lines of transgenic mice was severalfold higher than the expression of endogenous insulin receptors in control mice. We previously showed that gluteal muscle insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was markedly impaired in transgenic mice after administration of insulin by intraperitoneal injection (22Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, insulin was administered intravenously followed by removal of gluteal or gastrocnemius muscle samples. Equal aliquots of solubilized muscle proteins were applied to microwells coated with the nonspecies-specific insulin receptor antibody (AB-3), and in vitro insulin receptor kinase activity toward poly-Glu-Tyr was measured. Experiments conducted in control mice established that maximal insulin receptor kinase activity was achieved with insulin doses greater than 5 milliunits/g (Fig. 2A). Thus, subsequent experiments were performed using this maximally effective insulin dose. Fig. 2B shows that insulin stimulated receptor phosphotransferase activity by 5-6-fold over basal in control gluteal and gastrocnemius muscles. In contrast, insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity in muscles from transgenic mice was markedly impaired (less than 1-fold over basal). Tyrosyl phosphorylation of insulin receptor β-subunits and IRS-1 was assessed by direct immunoblotting of solubilized muscle proteins with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. First, dose-response curves were generated using gluteal muscle derived from control mice (Fig. 3). For both insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation, the results paralleled the effect of insulin to stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase activity toward the exogenous substrate since partial stimulation was evident with 1.0 milliunits/g and maximal stimulation was achieved with 5.0-50 milliunits/g. For subsequent experiments 5 milliunits/g insulin was used. Insulin increased receptor autophosphorylation by 200% in gluteal and 182% of basal in gastrocnemius muscles from control mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, insulin stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation by 297% in control gluteal and 208% of basal in control gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. 4, A and C). In contrast, in both sets of muscle derived from transgenic mice there was no detectable insulin stimulation of either receptor or IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In separate experiments we determined that the level of IRS-1 protein expression in transgenic gluteal muscle was comparable to the level of expression in control mice (not shown). To investigate whether the defect involving insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation in transgenic muscle was associated with impairment of PI 3-kinase activation, PI 3-kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates was assayed. Initially, we found that the in vivo insulin dose-response curve for PI 3-kinase in control muscle paralleled insulin's effects on receptor kinase activity or IRS-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Subsequently, we compared control muscles to transgenic muscles after treatment with 5 milliunits/g intravenous insulin. PI 3-kinase activity in control gluteal and gastrocnemius muscles was increased by 37- and 16-fold of basal, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, there was no detectable insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity in transgenic gluteal and gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. 5, B and C). In order to determine whether overexpression of mutant insulin receptors would exert transdominant effects on IGF-1 receptor-mediated signaling, we measured muscle PI 3-kinase activation after in vivo IGF-1 administration. We first established that intravenous injection of IGF-1 was capable of exerting a biologic response. Thus, doses of 0.5 μg/g body weight or more provoked hypoglycemia in control mice. Using a high dose of IGF-1 (2.0 μg/g), PI 3-kinase activity in control mouse muscle was substantially augmented (974 ± 193% of basal, n = 7 mice). In contrast, stimulated transgenic muscle PI 3-kinase activity was only 231 ± 33% of basal (n = 8 mice). However, we found that this dose of IGF-1 was associated with persistent activation of muscle insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in control mice (not shown). Therefore, in subsequent experiments we used 0.5 μg/g of IGF-1, a dose that was not associated with activation of muscle insulin receptors. This lower IGF-1 dose resulted in a similar degree of modest PI 3-kinase stimulation in both control and transgenic muscle (274.5 ± 46% of basal versus 244 ± 33%, respectively, not significant). Thus, the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate PI 3-kinase exclusively through its own receptors was apparently preserved in transgenic muscle. In order to explore the effect of impaired muscle insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity on the ability of insulin to activate MAP kinases, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to assess the phosphorylation state of p42 (ERK2) and p44 (ERK1) MAP kinases. Preliminary experiments showed that maximal MAP kinase phosphorylation occurred with insulin doses ≧10 milliunits/g (not shown). As depicted in Fig. 6A, insulin administration to control mice resulted in time-dependent phosphorylation of muscle p42 MAP kinase with maximal effects occurring by 5 min. This time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation was also seen with p44 MAP kinase, although this isoform is apparently not as abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle. In comparing the molecular weight shift of MAP kinase in gluteal muscles derived from transgenic versus control mice, we noted that insulin stimulated substanti"

Two plasmids, one containing the amino terminus of P fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transactivator, GAL4, and the other containing the amino terminus of NP fused to the herpesvirus transactivator, VP16, were transfected in COS-1 cells along with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid containing GAL4 DNA-binding sites. A specific and high-affinity interaction between NP and P was observed as measured by the activation of the CAT gene. Mapping of the domains in P (603 amino acids) involved in the association with NP revealed that NH2-terminal 40 and COOH-terminal 20 amino acids are important for such association. Interestingly, a stretch of NH2-terminal amino acids as short as 63-403 interacted with NP more than the wild type, reaching greater than 2.5-fold as measured by the CAT assay. These results suggest that a domain is present in P that negatively regulates its interaction with NP. Deletion of NH2-terminal 40 and COOH-terminal 160 amino acids of NP reduced the CAT activity by more than 95%.

Barik S. De B.P. Pharmacol & Ther. 1991; 51: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Galinski M.S. Adv. Virus Res. 1991; 39: 129-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The nucleocapsid protein (NP) is the most abundant component that encapsidates the genomic RNA to form the NP-RNA template and maintains the structural integrity and the template function of the RNA genome. The other two proteins associated with the NP-RNA template constitute the RNA polymerase complex, which consists of the large protein (L) and the phosphoprotein (P). L (251 kDa) is likely to be the RNA polymerase, whereas P (90 kDa) is an auxiliary protein essential for the function of L (3Sanchez A. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1985; 143: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The three RNP-associated proteins play important roles in the life cycle of the virus. During the transcriptive phase, in vivo or in vitro, the L⋅P complex interacts with the NP-RNA template to transcribe the genomic RNA into six distinct mRNAs (4De B.P. Galinski M.S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, during the replication step in vivo, NP forms a soluble complex with P, and the resulting NP⋅P complex interacts with the transcribing RNP to switch transcription reaction to replication (5Horikami S.M. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirements of the formation of both the L⋅P complex and the NP⋅P complex in transcription and replication, respectively, have been shown in vitro and in vivo for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototype negative strand RNA virus (6Banerjee A.K. Barik S. Virology. 1992; 188: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Pattnaik A.K. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2948-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Peluso R.W. Moyer S.A. Virology. 1988; 162: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, this has also been demonstrated in Sendai virus, a paramyxovirus, by expression of the recombinant proteins in the cell (5Horikami S.M. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Curran J. Homann H. Buchholz C. Rochat S. Neubert W. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4358-4364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism and the roles played by the respective complexes in the switch from transcription to replication remain unclear.For many paramyxoviruses, including HPIV-3, the P mRNA has the capacity to encode multiple proteins (1Banerjee A.K. Barik S. De B.P. Pharmacol & Ther. 1991; 51: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Galinski M.S. Adv. Virus Res. 1991; 39: 129-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For HPIV-3, a protein, designated P/D, is synthesized, in addition to the wild-type P, by an RNA editing mechanism by incorporating Gly residues at a specific site (10Galinski M.S. Troy R.M. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1992; 186: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A basic protein, designated C, is synthesized by translation of an alternate +1 open reading frame of the P mRNA (11Luk D. Sanchez A. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1986; 153: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The precise functions of these proteins and their interactions, if any, with L, P, and NP during the life cycle of the virus remain to be determined.To gain insight into the replication process of HPIV-3, we have studied the formation of the NP⋅P complex, which is the essential component involved in the switch from transcription to replication. We used a modified two-hybrid system (12Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) to study the nature of the interaction between these two proteins in an in vivo context as well as map the interacting domains. Using a GAL4/VP16-based three-plasmid transfection system we have been able to identify the interacting domains of N and P of VSV (13Takacs A.M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10375-10379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here we report that NP and P of HPIV-3 interact very strongly in vivo, and by mutational studies, we identified the interacting domains. Additionally, a domain within P has been characterized that seems to act as a negative regulator in its interaction with NP.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidspGAL4, originally called pSG424, which encodes the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 under the SV40 ori/early promoter control, was provided by M. Ptashne (Harvard University) (14Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). pVP16, originally named pAASVVP16, which encodes the VP16 transactivating domain of herpesvirus under the SV40 ori/early promoter control, was provided by H. Vasavada (A. Miles Co.) (15Vasavada H.A. Ganguly S. Germino F.J. Wang Z.X. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10686-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pGALVP16, originally named pSGVPΔ490, which encodes GAL4 DNA binding domain fused with VP16 transactivating domain was provided by M. Ptashne and has been described elsewhere (16Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid, pG5B-CAT, which contains five copies of the GAL4 binding site, the E1b TATA promoter, and the CAT gene, was also provided by M. Ptashne (Harvard University) and has been described previously (17Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The internal control plasmid, pRSV-β-gal, which contains the β-galactosidase gene under Rous sarcoma virus promoter control, was obtained from the Promega Company. pVPN of VSV and pGALP of VSV were described previously (13Takacs A.M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10375-10379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Takacs A.M. Perrine K.G. Barik S. Banerjee A.K. New Biol. 1991; 3: 581-591PubMed Google Scholar).pGALP (HPIV-3) was constructed by amplifying the entire P gene of HPIV-3 by using pPET3aP as template and the oligonucleotide primers containing either a BamHI site (the 5′ primer) or a SacI site (the 3′ primer). The purified and digested 1.8-kb PCR product was ligated with BamHI/SacI-digested pGAL4. pGALP/D was made similarly except that pPG7 (10Galinski M.S. Troy R.M. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1992; 186: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The P mutant plasmids were constructed via PCR using plasmid pPET3aP as template and oligonucleotide primers that spanned the portion of the P gene of interest and contained either a BamHI site or SacI site. To ensure that the fused P is in frame, two extra nucleotides were added between the BamHI site and the first codon of P at the 5′ primer. The linker joining GAL4 and all P gene sequences encodes the following peptide: Pro-Glu-Phe-Pro-Gly-Ile-Leu.pVPNP was made by amplifying the entire NP gene of HPIV-3 by using pPET3aNP as template and the oligonucleotide primers containing either an EcoRI site (the 5′ primer) or a ClaI site (the 3′ primer). The purified and digested 1.6-kb PCR product was ligated with EcoRI/ClaI-digested pVP16. The mutant pVPNP plasmids were also made by PCR using plasmid pPET3aNP as a template and oligonucleotide primers that spanned the portion of the NP gene of interest and contained either an EcoRI or a ClaI site. The linker joining all VP16 and NP sequences encodes the following peptide: Glu-Phe-Ala.pGALC was made by amplifying the entire C gene of HPIV-3 by using pPET3aC (obtained by inserting a full-length C gene into pPET3a plasmid) as template and the oligonucleotide primers containing either a BamHI site (5′ primer) or a SacI site (3′ primer). The purified and digested 0.6-kb PCR product was ligated with BamHI/SacI-digested pGAL4. The linker joining the GAL4 and C sequences encodes the same peptide as is present between the GAL4 and P sequences.Similarly, pVPC was constructed by amplifying the entire C gene of HPIV-3 by using pPET3aC as template and the oligonucleotide primers containing either an XbaI site (5′ primer) or a ClaI site (3′ primer). To create an XbaI site in the pVP16 vector, the pVP16 was digested with EcoRI, filled with Klenow, fused with an 8-mer linker containing an XbaI site, and finally digested with XbaI and ClaI. The purified and digested 0.6-kb PCR product was ligated with the corresponding XbaI/ClaI-digested pVP16. The linker joining the Vp16 and C sequences encodes the following peptide: Glu-Phe-Ser-Arg.All plasmid constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and by dideoxy sequencing across each junction region and mutant region.Plasmid Transfection and CAT AssayCOS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 units/ml of streptomycin. For transfection, 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-gal, 0.8 μg of the test and reporter plasmids were mixed with 20 μg of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for at least 15 min and then added to a 60 × 35-mm dish containing 5 × 105 cells subcultured the previous day. After 6 h the transfection solution was aspirated away, and the cells were grown in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with serum for 48 h. Cells were harvested, and 2 μg of cell extract was assayed for CAT activity (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After autoradiography of the separated acetylated chloramphenicol forms, the spots were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). 10 μg of cell extract was assayed for β-galactosidase activity (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Western Blot Analyses of Expressed ProteinsA rabbit polyclonal antibody to GAL4 (amino acids 1-147) was provided by M. Ptashne (Harvard University). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to HPIV-3 was kindly provided by Ranjit Ray (St. Louis University). The expression levels of all the VPNP (wild-type as well as mutant) chimeras in the transfected cell extracts were determined by immunoblotting with the antibody to HPIV-3 using gene screen membrane (DuPont) following the manufacturer's protocol. The expression levels of GALP and GALC chimeras in the transfected cell extracts were similarly assayed by the antibody against GAL4.RESULTSAssociation of the HPIV-3 NP and P in VivoA GAL4/VP16-based three-plasmid system was used to study the association of NP and P in vivo. Plasmids were constructed that encoded the following fused proteins: the amino terminus of P of HPIV-3 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding region and the amino terminus of NP of HPIV-3 fused to the VP16 transactivating domain. When these two plasmids along with the CAT reporter plasmid were co-transfected into COS-1 cells, any association of NP and P in vivo would activate transcription of the CAT gene via the VP16 transactivating region. This could then be assayed by the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms.Fig. 1 shows the results of the three-plasmid transfections. When the reporter plasmid was transfected (CAT alone), when pGALP (PP) was transfected with pVP16, or when pVPNP (NPP) was transfected with pGAL4, no CAT activity was detected. pGALVP16 (GALVP), which produced a high level of CAT activity, served as positive control. These results indicate that either NP fused to VP16 or P fused to GAL4 alone cannot activate the CAT gene by binding to the promoter or to any proteins associated with the promoter. However, when both pGALP and pVPNP were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid there was an extremely high level of CAT gene expression, which was shown by more than 90% conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms. This result demonstrates the high affinity interaction between NP and P in vivo. Since the CAT activity from NP and P co-transfection is so high, we titrated the cell extract used in the assay to determine the amount that would result in CAT activity within the linear range. Fig. 2 shows that cell extracts containing as little as 5.0 μg of protein resulted in almost complete conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms. Depending on the individual cell extract, only 1.0-2.0 μg of protein equivalent of cell extract was needed to obtain CAT activity within the linear range. This concentration of cell extract was used in all subsequent CAT assays. Each fraction was also tested for β-galactosidase activity, which measured the efficiency of transfection. The CAT activity in each fraction was calculated based upon β-galactosidase activity. In a separate series of experiments (data not shown) the expression levels of P and NP chimeras were measured by Western blot analyses (see “Materials and Methods”). The extent of protein synthesis in each reaction was similar.Figure 2:Titration of CAT activity from the transfected cell extract. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pGALP, pVPNP, and the reporter plasmid. Aliquots of cell extracts as indicated were used for CAT assay as described in the text. CE, cell extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the CAT activity is due to a specific NP and P interaction, the HPIV-3 P was replaced with P of VSV (P<itinf;V). Similarly, HPIV-3 NP was replaced by nucleocapsid protein(N) of VSV (NV). When the heterologous plasmids were co-transfected, no CAT activity was detected in either case. As expected, VSV P- and N-containing appropriate plasmids produced high CAT activity (13Takacs A.M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10375-10379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results clearly show that NP of HPIV-3 does not interact with P of VSV, or vice versa. Thus, the interaction between NP and P is highly specific for HPIV-3.Domains of P Involved in Its Interaction with NPNext, we tested different P mutants to investigate the domains of P involved in the interaction with NP. As shown in Fig. 3, deletion of the COOH-terminal 10 amino acids (Δ10C) reduced the CAT activity by 40% while Δ20C reduced the CAT activity by 70%, suggesting that the COOH terminus of P is involved in its association with NP. Interestingly, further deletions of amino acids from the COOH terminus, e.g. Δ40C and Δ100C and so on, resulted in a gradual increase in CAT activity. The highest CAT activity (more than 250% of the wild type) resulted when 410 amino acids were removed from the COOH terminus (Δ410C), leaving only an NH2-terminal 193-amino acid fragment. Further deletions from the COOH-terminal end, i.e. Δ510C and Δ540C, resulted in a slight decrease in interaction, but the truncated proteins continued to interact strongly. However, the deletion mutant Δ570C lost completely its capacity to interact with NP. Thus, an NH2-terminal P fragment as short as 63 amino acids long interacted with the NP more strongly (greater than 2-fold) than the wild type. The largest NH2-terminal fragment that interacted more than the wild type is Δ200C (Fig. 3), i.e. 403 amino acids long. These data strongly suggest that a domain is present in P, which resides between amino acids 63 and 403, that negatively regulates its interaction with NP.Figure 3:Domains of P involved in the association with NP. A, schematic representation of P showing the COOH-terminal deletion mutants of the 603-amino acid P fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding region. The number of amino acids deleted from the COOH-terminal end of P is indicated. B, CAT activity is shown from the co-transfection of pGALP mutants with pVPNP and the reporter plasmid. 2.0 μg of cell extract was used in each reaction. Average CAT activity from at least three experiments of each P mutant was determined by CAT assay and expressed as a percentage of that of wild-type P, representing 100% CAT activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm that the removal of such a regulatory domain from P indeed increases the association of P with NP, we constructed a plasmid (PAB, Fig. 4) that contains 230 NH2-terminal amino acids linked in-frame with the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids of P. As shown in Fig. 5, the PAB interacts with NP as efficiently as the PΔ350C (250 and 240% of the wild type, respectively), confirming that the NH2-terminal one-third of P interacts more strongly (more than 2.5-fold) than the wild-type P. The deleted portion of P thus appears to act as the negative regulatory domain in its association with NP.Figure 4:Association of NP with internally deleted P and P/D. A, schematic representation is shown of the various P mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding region. The number of amino acids deleted from P is described under “Results.” B, CAT activity of the co-transfection of pGALP mutants with pVPNP and the reporter plasmid is shown. 2.0 μg of cell extract was used for each reaction.

Troy R.M. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1992; 186: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) although it contains the NH2-terminal 241 amino acids, interacts poorly with NP compared with PΔ350C or PAB and even less than the wild-type P (70% of the wild type). Thus, it seems that the frameshifted COOH-terminal portion of the P/D down-modulates the interaction between P/D and NP.Next, we studied the requirement of the NH2-terminal region of P for its association with NP. As shown in Fig. 5, removal of 20 amino acids from the NH2 terminus (Δ20N) decreases the CAT activity by more than 80%. Further removal of amino acids (Δ40N and Δ80N) resulted in total abrogation of CAT activity. These data, coupled with the COOH-terminal deletion data (Fig. 3), indicate that both ends of P are needed for its interaction with NP. However, the NH2-terminal domain seems to be more critical than the COOH-terminal domain since further deletion from the latter end increases its interaction with NP.Interaction of C with NP or PThe same three-plasmid system was used to study the possible interaction between NP and C or P and C in vivo. Plasmids were constructed that encode the C protein fused to either the GAL4 DNA-binding region or the VP16 transactivating domain. As shown in Fig. 6, when pGALC or pVPC were co-transfected with VPNP or GALP, respectively, along with reporter plasmid, no CAT activity was detected, even when 5-fold excess of the cell extracts compared with pGALP and pVPNP were used. These results indicate that the C protein of HPIV-3 does not interact with P or NP of HPIV-3 in this system.Figure 6:Association of NP⋅C or P⋅C of HPIV-3 in vivo. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids and the reporter plasmid. The resulting cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” P, pGALP of HPIV-3; NP, pVPNP of HPIV-3; VPC, VP16 fused to C; GALC, Gal fused to C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All P mutants, P/D, and C were tested by Western blot analyses to confirm their extent of expression. The expression levels are quite consistent, comparable with that of the wild-type P, and easily detected by Western blot analyses (data not shown).Domains of NP Involved in Its Interaction with P in VivoFinally, we studied the domain of NP responsible for interaction with P. By systematic NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions of NP, we made several VPNP mutant chimeras. As shown in Fig. 7, deletions of the COOH-terminal 20 (Δ20C) and 80 (Δ80C) amino acids did not reduce CAT activity significantly. However, deletion of an additional 80 amino acids (Δ160C) totally abrogated the interaction. Similarly, deletion of the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids (Δ20N) did not reduce the CAT activity, but removal of 40 (Δ40N) and 80 (Δ80N) amino acids from the NH2 terminus reduced the CAT activity by more than 95%. These results indicate that both ends of NP are needed for P interaction but that the NH2 terminus of NP seems to be critical for its association with P.Figure 7:Domain of NP required for the association with P in vivo.

The expression levels are consistent with that of the wild-type NP (data not shown).DISCUSSIONIt is becoming increasingly clear that P of negative strand RNA viruses, with linear single strand RNA as the genetic material, is an important auxiliary protein with direct roles in transcription and replication of the virus (1Banerjee A.K.

The analysis offers general means for targeted experimentation, which allows discrimination between various types of transport mutants. It is generally believed that catalysis by a proton symporter proceeds via the formation of a ternary complex among substrate, proton, and carrier as depicted in Fig. SIA. The binding sites for proton and substrate are oriented simultaneously toward either the outside or the inside of the cell. The “unloaded” states of the carrier, Eo and Ei, and the fully loaded states, Eo•S•H and Ei•S•H, are mobile forms of the carrier, i.e. they can reorient the binding sites spontaneously. In contrast, the binary complexes between carrier and either substrate are immobile. The membrane potential is believed to exert its kinetic effect on one of the mobile forms, in the case of LacY, the lactose transport protein of E. coli, the unloaded carrier (Garcia et al., 1983Garcia M.L. Viitanen P. Foster D.L. Kaback H.R. Biochem. 1983; 22: 2524-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The coupling of substrate and proton flux is a direct consequence of the mobile and immobile states of the carrier (for a recent discussion see Krupka, 1993Krupka R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reorientation of the binding sites and, therefore, transport takes place only after both proton and substrate have bound to their respective binding sites. Binding of one of the two substrates to the unloaded carrier changes the carrier from a mobile to an immobile state. The carrier becomes “locked” in a state with the binding sites oriented toward the side of the membrane from which the binding took place. Both substrates can lock the carrier independently of each other in the immobile state. Therefore, we postulate that two types of mutants with an uncoupled phenotype can be found: the “ES leak” type and the “EH leak” type (Fig. SI, B and C, respectively). Binding of the substrate to the unloaded carrier in the ES leak type does not result in locking of the carrier, whereas binding of the proton does. In the EH leak type this is just the other way around. In the present paper we analyze the behavior of the ES leak and the EH leak types of uncoupled mutants in steady state kinetic measurements. It is demonstrated that the degree of coupling may be very different when inferred from initial rate measurements or steady state accumulation levels. The analysis suggests ways to discriminate relatively easily between mutants with an ES or EH leak. This pinpoints the mutated residues to the interactions between carrier and substrate or carrier and proton. Some properties of the hypothetical enzymes are strikingly similar to those of various LacY mutants listed in Table I.Table I:Properties of LacY mutants defective in energy coupling to transport Open table in a new tab The kinetic behavior of the wild-type enzyme and the uncoupled mutants was analyzed by numerical solution of the steady state equations using the computer program CACES (Lolkema, 1993Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17850-17860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basic set of rate constants pertinent to Fig. SIA used in the simulations was as follows. The affinity constant for the substrate was 1 mM with rate constants of 1000 mM−1 s−1 and 1000 s−1, respectively. The pK of the proton binding site was 7 with 1000 μM−1 s−1 and 100 s−1 for the rate constants. The rate constants pertinent to the translocation of the unloaded carrier and the ternary complex were 20 s−1 in both directions. This set corresponds to a symmetrical carrier with rapid binding equilibria relative to the translocation equilibria. In a second set the binding equilibria were made slow relative to the translocation equilibria by increasing the rate constants of the latter to 2000 s−1. This set will be referred to as non-rapid binding equilibria. The rate constants for the translocation of the binary complexes were set to zero in the kinetic scheme representing the wild-type carrier. Unless otherwise stated, in the ES leak type of mutant (Fig. SIB) the rate constants for the translocation of the enzyme-substrate complex E•S were made identical to the translocation rate constants of the wild-type translocations. The same adjustment was made to the rate constants for the translocation of the protonated carrier E•H in the EH leak type of mutant (Fig. SIC). A membrane potential Δψ was included in the simulations by affecting the forward and backward rate constants (koi and kio, respectively) of selected translocation equilibria as follows: koi = koi0 exp(0.5Δψ/RT) and koi0 = kio0 exp(−0.5Δψ/RT). The maximal rate of proton motive force (pmf)1( 1The abbreviation used is: pmfproton motive force.) -driven substrate uptake catalyzed by the fully coupled enzyme follows a bell-shaped curve when simulated at different pH values, irrespective of whether the binding steps are fast or slow relative to the translocations (Fig. 1, A and B, asterisk). The pH dependence is the result of two counteracting steps in the catalytic cycle, i.e. the protonation and deprotonation of the carrier at the external and internal face of the membrane, respectively (see Fig. SIA). Since both steps are obligatory for turnover, the highest rates are observed at intermediate pH values. At lower pH values the enzyme piles up in state Ei•H (state 6), at higher pH the enzyme piles up in state Eo:S (3). The highest maximal rate is observed at pH 7 (the pK of the proton binding sites) in the case of facilitated influx or efflux (data not shown) and is shifted toward more acidic values in the presence of a pmf (Fig. 1). proton motive force. In the case of the ES leak (Fig. SIB), the maximal rate of uptake increases with pH and reaches a plateau at alkaline pH values (Fig. 1, A and B, ▴). The ES leak opens up two alternative routes for turnover of the carrier (cycles Ia and Ib). Cycle Ia represents facilitated diffusion of the substrate catalyzed by the unprotonated carrier. It prevails at high pH values and compensates for the decreased rate of uptake at higher pH values observed with the wild-type enzyme. At low pH values, the major pathway proceeds via the translocation of the ternary complex. Cycle Ib depicts a transport mode for the proton catalyzed by the enzyme-substrate complex E•S. Under conditions of accumulation of the substrate inside the cell, i.e. when state Ei•S becomes populated, the cycle provides a slip for the proton. Introduction of the EH leak results in two similar cycles. Cycle IIa provides a pathway for the proton, resulting in a proton leak in the absence of substrate. Cycle IIb represents a facilitated diffusion cycle for the substrate catalyzed by the protonated carrier. It compensates for the decrease in the rate at low pH values observed with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B, ○). At low pH values cycle IIb is the major pathway, whereas at high pH the major pathway is via states Ei and Eo. The affinity constants for the substrate of the transport activities shown in Fig. 1 show a sigmoidal increase with pH. Introduction of the leaks does not result in dramatic changes in the Km values. At the pH optimum the affinity constants range from 0.6 to 1.1 mM and from 0.5 to 1.7 mM in the case of rapid binding equilibria and non-rapid binding equilibria, respectively. Both in the ES leak and the EH leak the carrier shifts from symport to uniport and vice versa as a function of pH. The different cycles introduced by the two leaks result in significant different kinetic behavior of the enzyme under various conditions (see below). The coupling stoichiometry of secondary transporters is inferred either from the accumulation of the substrate inside the cells in the presence of a pmf of known magnitude or from the ratio of the initial rates of uptake of the substrate and the proton. Thermodynamic considerations of the catalyzed symport reaction require that at equilibrium the force on the substrate is counteracted by the force on the proton. Δμs=−ngradΔμ¯H+(Eq. 1) In the case of a mutant with an ES leak, the ratio of the initial rates of uptake of proton and substrate decreases sigmoidally from 1 at low to 0 at high pH values both with Δψ and ΔpH as driving force (Fig. 2A). At low pH, the major pathway is the same as in the wild-type enzyme and, consequently, the two fluxes are fully coupled. Increasing the pH results in an increasing contribution of cycle Ia to the flux with a subsequent decrease in the rate of proton influx. The stoichiometries are largely independent of the substrate concentration when the binding equilibria are fast (Fig. 2A, inset). Increasing the rate constants for the translocations has no effect on the coupling at low substrate concentrations but results in reduced coupling at higher substrate concentrations (not shown). The accumulation levels under zero flux conditions for the substrate show a similar dependence on the pH. Accumulation is high at low pH values and negligible at high pH values (Fig. 2B). Also, the accumulation levels are independent of the substrate concentration in the case of rapid binding equilibria (Fig. 2B, inset) and are reduced in the case of non-rapid binding equilibria at high substrate concentrations. An important difference between the two experimental approaches is that at a given pH value the coupling inferred from accumulation ratios is significantly lower than from initial rate measurements. The pH profile of the mutant with an EH leak is opposite to that of the mutant with an ES leak. The ratio of the initial rates of proton uptake and substrate uptake increases with increasing pH (Fig. 2C). The ratio ranges from values below 1 at low pH to values above 1 at high pH, showing that the proton flux can be slower or faster than the substrate flux depending on the conditions. In contrast to what was observed with the ES leak, already with the rapid binding equilibria, the ratio of proton to substrate flux is strongly dependent on the substrate concentration (Fig. 2C, inset). With the non-rapid binding equilibria the curves in the inset of Fig. 2C shift to the right, resulting in a lower proton to substrate flux ratio at a fixed substrate concentration. Increasing concentrations of substrate decrease the degree of coupling from initial rates by pulling the enzyme in the ternary complex, thereby reducing the uncoupled proton flux via cycle IIA. The EH leak results in accumulation levels that also increase sigmoidally with pH (Fig. 2D). The substrate flux follows the uncoupled pathway via cycle IIb at low pH and the coupled pathway of the wild-type enzyme at high pH. The uncoupled pathway does not result in accumulation, independent of the substrate concentration used. Toward higher pH values the accumulation becomes more and more dependent on the substrate concentration, resulting in full coupling at high substrate concentrations (Fig. 2D, inset). In the case of non-rapid binding equilibria the concentration of substrate needed to achieve full coupling at high pH is higher (data not shown). The effect of the substrate concentration on the degree of coupling is opposite for initial rate measurements and accumulation. In the case of an ES leak, both the stoichiometries from initial rates and accumulation are higher in the presence of a membrane potential than in the presence of a pH gradient of the same magnitude. This is just opposite for the EH leak. The effects of the membrane potential and pH gradient on the accumulation of substrate are analyzed in more detail in Fig. 3. The difference in accumulation in response to a membrane potential or a pH gradient increases with increasing magnitude of the forces. Analysis of the degree of coupling, ngrad (see Equation 1), indicates that in both types of mutants the coupling does not change with the membrane potential but decreases with the pH gradient in the ES leak and increases with the pH gradient in the EH leak (Fig. 3, insets). A change in the degree of coupling requires a change in the relative contributions of coupled and uncoupled pathways. With the ES leak, the relative contributions of the uncoupled pathway via cycle Ia and the coupled pathway are determined by the state of protonation of the carrier on the outside. Therefore, increasing the pH gradient by increasing the internal pH will not result in higher accumulation levels, i.e. the degree of coupling decreases. With the EH leak, the increase of the internal pH favors deprotonation of the carrier on the inside, which results in an increase of the coupled relative to the uncoupled pathway (cycle IIb), i.e. the degree of coupling increases. The wild-type proton symporter does not catalyze net proton transport after equilibration of the substrate inside the cell. A mutant with an ES leak cannot transport protons in the absence of substrate. However, the rate of proton influx under zero flux conditions for the substrate increases rapidly with increasing external substrate concentrations (Fig. 4, ○). Apparently, the substrate induces a H+ leak corresponding to cycle Ib in the kinetic scheme for the mutant with the ES leak. The proton symporter with the EH leak confronts the cell with a continuous influx of protons via cycle IIa. Fig. 4(•) shows the inhibition of the proton flux by equilibration of the cells with substrate. The presence of substrate at both sides of the membrane reduces the flux through cycle IIa by pulling the enzyme in the enzyme-substrate complex (E•S•H). Thermodynamically, the pH gradient and the membrane potential are equivalent, i.e. a pH gradient and a membrane potential of the same magnitude result in the same level of accumulation of the substrate by the wild-type enzyme. Kinetically, the two gradients are not equivalent since they act on different steps in the kinetic scheme. While the pH gradient reflects different external and internal proton concentrations, the membrane potential affects the rate constants for the isomerization of the unloaded carrier (Fig. SI). A membrane potential of physiological polarity speeds up the transition from state Ei to E0 and inhibits the transition in the opposite direction. Therefore, the rate of efflux of substrate down a concentration gradient catalyzed by a wild-type symporter is inhibited by a membrane potential of normal polarity (inside negative). The pH profiles of the efflux activities of the wild-type enzyme and the mutants with the ES leak and the EH leak are similar to the profiles shown in Fig. 1 for influx. Mutants with the ES leak are characterized by a high rate of efflux at high pH, which is catalyzed by the unprotonated carrier as described by cycle Ia. Both translocation steps in cycle Ia are affected by the membrane potential. The membrane potential tends to speed up efflux through its effect on the transition between E•Si and E•S0 but inhibits efflux through its effect on the transition between Eo and Ei. The latter step becomes rate-limiting as the membrane potential increases. The net effect is an inhibition of the rate of efflux by the membrane potential under conditions where the carrier catalyzes essentially uniport of the substrate (Fig. 5, ○). Mutants with an EH leak show high rates of efflux at low pH values. Cycle IIb is responsible for the efflux. None of the steps in this cycle are affected by the membrane potential, and, consequently, the rate of efflux under these conditions is not significantly affected by the membrane potential (Fig. 5, •). Functional analysis of mutant secondary transporter enzymes may yield important information about residues involved in substrate and proton binding, translocation, coupling, etc. Such studies will also improve our knowledge about the kinetic mechanism of the wild-type enzyme. However, in spite of major efforts by a number of laboratories it has proven to be difficult to associate (mutated) residues with specific steps in the kinetic mechanism. In part, this is caused by the complicated relation between the kinetic behavior and the role of individual residues. In this study we analyze the kinetic behavior of two types of uncoupled mutants, those with mobile enzyme-substrate (ES leak) and enzyme-proton (EH leak) complexes. The two mechanisms of uncoupling are directly linked to the binding of substrate and proton (see Introduction), and, therefore, mutated residues that result in either type of uncoupling are involved in the events that follow upon the binding of substrate or proton to the carrier. The ability to discriminate between residues involved in substrate or proton binding adds a lot of detail to the role of the individual residues. It should be stressed that the analysis is general to symporters, irrespective of transported cation and/or substrate. The aim of the present study is to describe the steady state kinetic characteristics of the ES leak and EH leak type of mutants by simulating those experiments that are particularly discriminative. The major conclusions are as follows: (i) the two types of mutants can be discriminated easily by various criteria (summarized in Table II); (ii) in partially coupled systems, the degrees of coupling inferred from initial rates and accumulation are not the same; and (iii) the coupling characteristics are largely independent of the rate constants in the kinetic scheme.Table II:The kinetic behavior of mutant enzymes with an ES leak and an EH leak Open table in a new tab Numerical analyses as used in this study require the assignment of numerical values to the rate constants pertinent to the kinetic scheme. The basic set of rate constants we have used represents a rather simple enzyme that is symmetrical with respect to the two sides of the membrane and in which the binding equilibria are rapid relative to the translocation equilibria. This choice improves the comprehensibility of the results. However, this set may not always be valid, e.g. functional asymmetry of secondary transporters has frequently been observed, and the binding equilibria are not necessarily fast relative to the translocation equilibria (Viitanen et al., 1993Viitanen P. Garcia M.L. Foster D.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 22: 2524-2531Google Scholar; Page, 1987Page M.G.P. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For this reason we have tested various additional schemes in which non-rapid binding equilibria, asymmetry, and cooperativity between the binding sites were introduced. The outcome of these analyses is that the coupling characteristics of the mutants described in this study do not differ much between the various schemes even though other kinetic parameters may be very different. Thus, the phenomena in the presented plots represent trends that are largely independent of the assumptions made in the original model. Importantly, the numbers should not be compared literally with any experimental data. Also, the analysis given in this study is one of extreme cases; the mutant carriers are characterized by one mobile and one immobile binary complex. Real mutations may affect the mobility of the two binary complexes differently, i.e. the E•S complex becomes more mobile than the E•H complex or the other way around. The observed phenotype will be according to the binary complex with the highest mobility, but the experimental behavior may differ in details from the analysis given here. The lactose transport protein of E. coli is the most extensively studied bacterial transport system (for reviews see Kaback, 1990Kaback H.R. The Bacteria. Vol. XII. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 151-202Google Scholar; Poolman and Konings, 1993Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 5-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and reports on LacY mutant characteristics provide ample evidence for the existence of ES leak and EH leak types of mutants (Table I). Various mutants of LacY have been isolated that are defective in uphill transport of galactosides but have a more or less normal H+:galactoside stoichiometry. This apparent discrepancy in the results is also observed in the mutants with the ES and the EH leak. It follows that ngrad≤ nkin (Equations 1 and 2). In the case of the ES leak this is caused by the presence of substrate inside the cell under conditions of accumulation. A significant internal substrate concentration introduces a futile cycle for the substrate via cycle Ib. Substrate that enters the cell via the ternary complex leaves the cell again via the ES leak while the proton stays inside. In the case of the EH leak the proton flux proceeds via the EH leak (cycle IIa) in the absence of substrate. Addition of the substrate induces a flux via the ternary complex, thereby decreasing the flux through the proton leak (see Fig. SIC). At a particular substrate concentration the flux through the EH leak changes its direction from out-to-in to in-to-out. This is the point where the net substrate flux starts exceeding the net proton flux. Both substrate and proton enter the cell solely via the ternary complex, but part of the protons leave the cell again via the leak. The concentration needed to invert the flux through the EH leak depends strongly on the pH under the rapid binding equilibrium assumption (Fig. 2C, inset). Nevertheless, at each pH value a substrate concentration exists at which the coupling stoichiometry from initial rate measurements equals 1 (Fig. 6). Thus, a mutant with an EH leak may demonstrate an apparent full coupling between the proton and the substrate flux but, nevertheless, be unable to accumulate the substrate. The double mutant A177V/H322N of LacY is a clear example of this phenotype (Table I). A wild-type proton symporter functioning at full activity will not significantly decrease the steady state proton motive force. The primary proton pumps can easily compensate for the substrate-coupled influx of protons via the carrier. This may be different when cells overproduce a transporter. Then, the increased “load” on the pmf may result in a decreased steady state value of the pmf as is observed after addition of lactose to E. coli cells overexpressing the LacY protein (Brooker, 1991Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4131-4138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; King and Wilson, 1990bKing S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9645-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of some LacY mutants (A177V/A177T, A177V/K319N, Y236F/Y236H/Y236N/Y236S, see Table I) results in a lowering of the pmf even in the absence of substrate. In the LacY-A177V mutant, this defect is reduced in the presence of the galactoside TDG, which restores the pmf to near normal values (King and Wilson, 1990bKing S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9645-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The properties of this mutant are consistent with an EH leak (Fig. 4). The presence of substrate at both sides of the membrane reduces the flux through cycle IIa by pulling the enzyme in the enzyme-substrate complex. The double mutant A177V/K319N also exhibits a proton leak, which is reflected in a lowered pmf and an increased H+ leakage, but, in contrast to the single A177V mutant, this leak is enhanced in the presence of the non-metabolizable substrate TDG (Brooker, 1991Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4131-4138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of mutant LacY proteins in which Arg-302 is substituted for Ser, His, or Leu also causes a sugar-dependent H+ leak (and lowering of ΔpH) (Matzke et al., 1992Matzke E.A. Stephenson L.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19095-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The behavior of all these mutants mimics that of transport proteins with an ES leak pathway (Fig. 4). The enzyme-substrate complex functions as a facilitator for proton transport (cycle Ib), which is driven by the pmf. The presence of substrate at both sides of the membrane pulls the enzyme in the substrate-associated state. Saturation of the carrier with substrate results in the highest proton leak activity. It is tempting to classify the various mutations of Table I as ES leak type or EH leak type. However, in general, the experimental data is too incomplete to assign the mutants unambiguously to a particular leak type. The present analysis offers relatively simple means for further experimentation which should give a more solid basis for the classification. The data in Table I should be regarded as evidence for the validity of the two mechanisms of uncoupling analyzed in this paper. We thank Prof. Dr. W. N. Konings for critical reading of the manuscript and many helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2142284369,"To describe the role of the lysyl binding site in the interaction of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA, FGK1K2P) with a forming fibrin clot, we performed binding experiments with domain deletion mutants GK1K2P, K2P, and the corresponding point mutants lacking the lysyl binding site in the absence and the presence of ε-amino caproic acid (EACA). Occupation of the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain with EACA has a pronounced effect on the binding of FGK1K2P to a fibrin clot (C50 = 77 ± 11 nMversus 376 ± 45 nM with EACA). Deleting the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain (substitution D236N) also impairs fibrin binding but to a lesser extent (C50 = 169 ± 20 nM). Although the binding of K2P to a fibrin clot is weak (C50 = 1163 ± 490 nM), it still is 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the binding of EACA to K2P. Therefore it was surprising to find that deletion of the lysyl binding site in K2P completely abolishes fibrin binding. Even when both the F domain and the lysyl binding site were deleted, considerable fibrin binding is still observed (C50 = 557 ± 126 nM), suggesting other than F and K2-mediated interactions. The binding of FGK1K2P, FGK1K2P (D236N), GK1K2P, and GK1K2P (D236N) to fibrin could be competitively inhibited by FGK1K2P and K2P, indicating that all molecules recognize the same interaction sites on a fibrin clot. Based on these results, a new model for the interaction of t-PA with a forming fibrin clot is proposed. The fibrin binding sites in t-PA are not confined to the F and K2 domain. The main role of the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain of t-PA appears indirect rather than direct, most likely stabilizing a conformation favorable for fibrin binding. To describe the role of the lysyl binding site in the interaction of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA, FGK1K2P) with a forming fibrin clot, we performed binding experiments with domain deletion mutants GK1K2P, K2P, and the corresponding point mutants lacking the lysyl binding site in the absence and the presence of ε-amino caproic acid (EACA). Occupation of the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain with EACA has a pronounced effect on the binding of FGK1K2P to a fibrin clot (C50 = 77 ± 11 nMversus 376 ± 45 nM with EACA). Deleting the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain (substitution D236N) also impairs fibrin binding but to a lesser extent (C50 = 169 ± 20 nM). Although the binding of K2P to a fibrin clot is weak (C50 = 1163 ± 490 nM), it still is 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the binding of EACA to K2P. Therefore it was surprising to find that deletion of the lysyl binding site in K2P completely abolishes fibrin binding. Even when both the F domain and the lysyl binding site were deleted, considerable fibrin binding is still observed (C50 = 557 ± 126 nM), suggesting other than F and K2-mediated interactions. The binding of FGK1K2P, FGK1K2P (D236N), GK1K2P, and GK1K2P (D236N) to fibrin could be competitively inhibited by FGK1K2P and K2P, indicating that all molecules recognize the same interaction sites on a fibrin clot. Based on these results, a new model for the interaction of t-PA with a forming fibrin clot is proposed. The fibrin binding sites in t-PA are not confined to the F and K2 domain. The main role of the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain of t-PA appears indirect rather than direct, most likely stabilizing a conformation favorable for fibrin binding. Only in the presence of fibrin t-PA1( 1The abbreviations used are: t-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatorEACAε-amino caproic acidbpbase pair(s)S-2288H-D-Ile-L-Pro-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide dihydrochlorideC50concentration of fibrin(ogen) at which binding is half-maximalS-2251H-D-Val-L-Leu-L-Lys-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloridePPACKPhe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl.) efficiently converts its substrate plasminogen into the fibrin-degrading enzyme plasmin. The enzyme appears to play an essential role in dissolving fibrin rich clots in the bloodstream (Thorsen et al., 1972Thorsen S. Glas-Greenwalt P. Astrup T. Thromb. Diathes.

Fibrin binding of t-PA is thought to be a prerequisite for this enhanced plasminogen activation (Hoylaerts et al., 1982Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol.

This fibrin binding is localized in the heavy chain of t-PA (Rijken and Groeneveld, 1986Rijken D.C. Groeneveld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3098-3102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the elucidation of the cDNA structure, it became apparent that t-PA is composed of several domains (Pennica et al., 1983Pennica D. Holmes W.E. Kohr W.J. Harkins R.N. Vehar G.A. Ward C.A.

S. A. 1984; 81: 5355-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). From the amino terminus, t-PA consists of a finger domain (F), an epidermal growth factor domain (G), two kringle domains (K1, K2), and a serine protease domain (P). Both the F and K2 domain were found to be involved in fibrin binding to a forming fibrin clot (Verheijen et al., 1986Verheijen J.H. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. de Munk G.A.W. Pouwels P.H.

A. 1986; 83: 4670-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It was further shown that t-PA interacts with lysyl-Sepharose and arginyl-Sepharose (Radcliffe and Heinze, 1978Radcliffe R. Heinze T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Wallen et al., 1981). The interaction with lysyl-Sepharose can be disturbed by L-lysine, L-arginine, or the lysine analogue ε-amino caproic acid (EACA) (Radcliffe and Heinze, 1978Radcliffe R. Heinze T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Allen and Pepper, 1981Allen R.A. Pepper D.S. Thromb.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding of t-PA with fibrin can be partially blocked with the lysine analogue EACA (van Zonneveld et al., 1986bvan Zonneveld A.J. Veerman H. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14214-14218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subsequently, isolated kringle 2 domains were shown to interact with EACA and lysyl-Sepharose (Byeon and Llinas, 1991Byeon I.J.L. Llinas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1035-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; de Serrano and Castellino, 1993de Serrano V.S. Castellino F.J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This led to the view that t-PA binds to a forming fibrin clot via two modes: a lysyl binding site-mediated interaction and a non-lysyl-dependent interaction that requires the presence of the F domain (van Zonneveld et al., 1986bvan Zonneveld A.J. Veerman H. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14214-14218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). tissue-type plasminogen activator ε-amino caproic acid base pair(s) H-D-Ile-L-Pro-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride concentration of fibrin(ogen) at which binding is half-maximal H-D-Val-L-Leu-L-Lys-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl. Based on binding isotherms of t-PA to a forming fibrin clot, two independent nonidentical binding sites on the fibrin are proposed (Nesheim et al., 1990Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity interaction is F domain mediated, while a lower affinity interaction is K2 domain mediated. However, this model is questioned by the observation of one class of t-PA binding sites on a forming fibrin clot. Furthermore, the high affinity of t-PA for a forming fibrin clot could not be fully accounted for by the F-mediated and the K2-mediated interaction (Horrevoets et al., 1994Horrevoets A.J.G. Smilde A. de Vries C. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12639-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the lysyl binding site of t-PA in fibrin binding is intricate. The K2 domain is thought to interact via an intra-chain lysyl residue of the fibrin network, and therefore the binding site was called aminohexyl binding site. It was shown that increasing the amount of carboxyl-terminal lysyl residues in the fibrin network by partial degradation with plasmin results in new binding sites for t-PA (de Vries et al., 1989de Vries C. Veerman H. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12604-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although, the affinity of the K2 domain for aminohexyl-Sepharose differs from the affinity for lysyl-Sepharose, both interactions can be inhibited with EACA (de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain by the substitution of one amino acid residue (Asp236 replaced by Asn236) abolishes binding to aminohexyl- and lysyl-Sepharose (Weening-Verhoeff et al., 1990Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Quax P.H.A. van Leeuwen R.T.J. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Verheijen J.H. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structures in the K2 domain mediating lysyl binding and aminohexyl binding must be considered equivalent. Substitution of one amino acid residue in the K2 domain (t-PA (D236N), t-PA (D236A) results in a t-PA analogue that no longer interacts with lysyl- or aminohexyl-Sepharose but still possesses high affinity for fibrin (Weening-Verhoeff et al., 1990Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Quax P.H.A. van Leeuwen R.T.J. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Verheijen J.H. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Bennet et al., 1991). This observation stands in clear contrast to the large effect of EACA on the fibrin binding of t-PA (van Zonneveld et al., 1986b, de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We studied the role of the lysyl binding site of t-PA in fibrin binding by performing fibrin binding experiments with domain deletion mutants lacking a functional lysyl binding site in the absence and presence of EACA. To describe the interaction site of t-PA and t-PA variants on a forming fibrin clot, we performed competition experiments with FGK1K2P and K2P. We have found that for fibrin binding of t-PA, in addition to the F and the lysyl binding site-mediated interactions, other interactions must also exist. Furthermore, the binding sites of FGK1K2P (D236N) and the K2P on a forming fibrin clot appear to be in close proximity to each other. The lysyl binding site in the K2 domain appears not to interact directly with an aminohexyl group of the fibrin network, but it is probably involved in stabilizing a favorable conformation of t-PA needed for fibrin binding. Nomenclature and numbering of t-PA mutant proteins is according to Pannekoek et al., 1990Pannekoek H. Lijnen H.R. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. Recombinant t-PA (referred to as FGK1K2P), t-PA del (I5-H44) (referred to as GK1K2P), t-PA del (R7-C168) (referred to as K2P), and the point mutant t-PA D236N (referred to as FGK1K2P (D236N)) have been described before (Verheijen et al., 1986Verheijen J.H.

The construction of the corresponding domain deletion mutants t-PA D236N del (I5-H44) (referred to as GK1K2P (D236N)) and t-PA D236N del (R7- C168) (referred to as K2P (D236N)) are described below. The construction of the t-PA D236N del (I5-H44) was performed as follows. From the plasmids containing the reading frame for GK1K2P (peV2t-PA4) (Verheijen et al., 1986Verheijen J.H. Caspers M.P.M.

From the plasmid containing the sequence coding for FGK1K2P (D236N) (Weening-Verhoeff et al., 1990Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Quax P.H.A. van Leeuwen R.T.J. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Verheijen J.H.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Cells that incorporated the plasmids and thus were Neo-resistant were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Boehringer Mannheim), L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1.2 mg/ml of the neomycin analogue geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For purification of the recombinant proteins, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 KIU/ml Trasylol (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and 10 mM ε-amino caproic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to prevent plasmin activity, 0.3 g/liter human serum albumin (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) L-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.2 mg/ml geneticin. Recombinant t-PA mutants were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody ESP-2 (Campro Scientific, The Netherlands) against the protease domain of t-PA coupled to agarose. A 0.5-ml aliquot of anti-t-PA-Sepharose suspension was placed on a disposable PD-10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The tandem column was equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, pH 7.5. Approximately 50 ml of conditioned medium was loaded onto the column followed by washing with the buffer mentioned above. The column was then washed with 2 column volumes of a buffer containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 M NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80. Subsequently, the column was reequilibrated with the same buffer without NaCl. The t-PA mutant was eluted from the column with a buffer containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, and 3.0 M KSCN, pH 7.5 (Merck). Column fractions containing plasminogen activator activity were pooled for further characterization. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed under nonreducing conditions on 10% acrylamide gels with 5% stacking gels using the Laemmli system (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to remove SDS and placed on plasminogen-containing fibrin agarose layers (Granelli-Piperno and Reich, 1978Granelli-Piperno A. Reich E. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Upon incubation, the positions of plasminogen activators appear as clear lysis zones on an opaque background. Conversion of the single-chain form t-PA analogues to the two-chain form was performed as described previously (Wallén et al., 1981Wallén P. R M. Bergsdorf N. Kok P. Prog. Fibrinolysis. 1981; 5: 16-23Google Scholar). In short, plasmin-Sepharose slurry (200 μg plasmin/g of wet Sepharose-4B or Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) was washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80. 50 μl of a 50% plasmin-Sepharose suspension or 50% Sepharose-4B suspension was added to 450 μl of t-PA analogue (10 pmol) in the same buffer. The reaction was carried out with constant mixing at 37°C. Samples were removed from the incubation mixture at time intervals (t = 0, t = 10, t = 20, t = 30, t = 60, t = 90 min) centrifuged down, and 20 μl was transferred to wells of a microtiterplate containing 130 μl of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 and 20 KIU/ml Trasylol. Conversion of t-PA analogues from the single-chain to the two-chain form was confirmed by spectrophotometric activity determination with S-2288 (H-D-Ile-L-Pro-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride, Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden). Spectrophotometric assays were performed as described previously (Verheijen et al., 1985Verheijen J.H. de Jong Y.F. Chang G.T.G. Thromb. Res. 1985; 39: 281-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (250 μl total volume) contained plasmin-Sepharose or Sepharose-treated t-PA analogues, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, Trasylol 20 KIU/ml, and 1 mM S-2288. The absorbance of the reaction mixtures was measured at 405 nm in an eight-channel microtiter plate reader against suitable blanks without termination of the reaction. The absorbance at 405 nm was plotted against time (ΔA/Δt) for six time points. For labeling of two-chain t-PA and t-PA analogues, an active site-directed inhibitor of t-PA was used. The inhibitor 4-aminobenzoyl-Gly-Arg-CH2Cl (a kind gift of Dr. E. Shaw) was iodinated with 125I and purified as described before (Rauber et al., 1988Rauber P. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 1.5 pmol of t-PA analogues in 100 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 were incubated with 2 μM iodinated inhibitor for 4 h at room temperature. Radiolabeled t-PA and t-PA analogues were bound on a 1-ml column of zinc chelate-Sepharose and extensively washed with 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, and then eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mM imidazole (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Specific activities of the labeled t-PA or t-PA analogues (final concentration, 5 nM) were approximately 2.6 104 cpm/pmol. Binding to a lysyl-Sepharose column was performed as described previously (de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In short, radiolabeled two-chain t-PA analogues (approximately 100 fmol in 500 μl) in buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80) were applied to 1-ml lysyl-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer (flow rate, 50 ml/h at room temperature). These columns were washed with 2.5 ml of buffer. Specifically bound analogues (see below) were eluted with 2.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mM EACA. Radioactivity was assessed in the run-through, in washing fluid, in eluate, and in the column. The fraction of the total counts/min is given. Fibrin binding was performed as described previously (de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled t-PA analogues (0.06 nM, final concentration) were mixed with fibrinogen (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden), which was depleted of plasminogen and plasmin as described before (de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 15 mM Veronal, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.005% Tween 80, and 500 Trasylol KIU/ml, pH 7.75. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, clots were centrifuged, and radioactivity in the supernatant was determined. t-PA bound was expressed as the fraction of the total amount of t-PA analogue added to the fibrinogen solution (F). The data were fitted to the Equation 1. F=[t−PAbound]/[t−PAtotal]=[fibrino(gen)total]/([fibrino(gen)total]+C50)(Eq. 1) Spectrophotometric assays were performed as described previously (Verheijen et al., 1985Verheijen J.H. de Jong Y.F. Chang G.T.G. Thromb. Res. 1985; 39: 281-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (250 μl total volume) contained plasmin-treated t-PA analogues in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1.0 mM S-2288. The two-chain t-PA or t-PA analogue sample was tested at four different concentrations. The absorbance change at 405 nm (ΔA/Δt) for each concentration was determined. These were plotted against the four different concentrations of t-PA or t-PA analogues, representing the absorbance change/concentration t-PA analogue. The absorbance change/concentration for a known amount of t-PA standard was compared with the absorbance change/concentration of the t-PA analogues. Since the amidolytic activity for the P domain of the t-PA standard is similar to the amidolytic activity of the P domain of the t-PA analogues, the concentration of t-PA was calculated (Bakker et al., 1993Bakker A.H.F. van der Greef W. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Verheijen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18496-18501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric assays were performed as described previously (Verheijen et al., 1982Verheijen J.H. Nieuwenhuizen W. Wijngaards G. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 175-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (250 μl of total volume) contained various amounts of plasmin-treated t-PA analogues, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, 0.12 μM Glu-plasminogen, and 0.7 mM S-2251. In certain cases, 120 μg/ml of CNBr-digested fibrinogen were included. The absorbance of the reaction mixtures was measured at 405 nm in an eight-channel microtiter plate reader against suitable blanks without termination of the reaction. The t-PA analogue sample was tested at 10, 20, and 40 pM (final concentration) of active enzyme both for reaction mixtures containing fibrinogen fragments and for reactions mixtures without fragments. Fibrinogen fragments were prepared as described previously (Verheijen et al., 1982Verheijen J.H. Nieuwenhuizen W. Wijngaards G. Thromb.

The change in absorbance was monitored over time for each t-PA analogue in the presence and in the absence of CNBr digest of fibrinogen. For each enzyme concentration, a slope was calculated, representing the absorbance change over time squared (ΔA/Δt2). These slopes, in turn, were plotted against enzyme concentration, representing the absorbance change/time squared/molar concentration of enzyme, and finally expressed as ΔA h−2 pmol−1. The ratio of the slope in the presence of fibrinogen fragments to the slope in the absence of fragments is the enhancement factor. This ratio reflects the extent to which fibrinogen fragments enhance the activity of the particular t-PA analogue preparation. t-PA (final concentration, approximately 4 μM) and K2P (final concentration, approximately 8 μM) were inactivated with 50 μM PPACK in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1 M NaCl for 6 h at room temperature. PPACK-treated t-PA and K2P were separated from PPACK with a Sephadex G-50 fine column equilibrated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1 M NaCl. The inhibition of t-PA and K2P was confirmed using a spectrophotometric assay (see “Determination of the t-PA Analogue Concentration.”) 880 nM plasminogen-free fibrinogen was incubated with radiolabeled t-PA analogues (final concentration, 0.1 nM) and t-PA (final concentration, approximately 0.5 μM), K2P (final concentration, approximately 0.5 μM), or human serum albumin (final concentration, approximately 0.3 μM) in 15 mM Veronal, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Tris-HCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween pH 7.75. Clotting was performed with 2 NIH units of thrombin/ml. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, clots were disrupted by vortexing. After centrifugation, radioactivity in the supernatant was determined. t-PA bound is expressed as the fraction of total added amount of t-PA analogue. To study the role of the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain of t-PA in the interaction of t-PA with a forming fibrin clot, we constructed t-PA domain deletion analogues in which the lysyl binding site is impaired by a single amino acid substitution, FGK1K2P (D236N), GK1K2P (D236N), and K2P (D236N). The recombinant proteins show the expected molecular weight on a zymogram (Fig. 1). All of the domain deletion variants specifically interact with lysyl-Sepharose. The mutation D236N in the different domain deletion mutants results in a loss of lysyl binding capacity (Table I). All molecules convert plasminogen to plasmin (Table II). In comparison with the t-PA variants, which show interaction with lysyl-Sepharose, the t-PA variants lacking the lysyl binding site activate plasminogen with lower efficiency (Table II, column 2). In the presence of CNBr-digested fibrinogen as a fibrin mimic, the plasminogen activation of all molecules was enhanced (, column 3). The FGK1K2P and GK1K2P molecules showed a higher enhancement of plasminogen activation than the corresponding lysyl binding site mutants FGK1K2P (D236N) and GK1K2P (D236N). Interestingly K2P (D236N), which shows no interaction with a forming fibrin clot (see below), still activates plasminogen in the presence of fibrin mimic as efficiently as K2P.Table I:Binding to lysyl-Sepharose Open table in a new tab Table II:Fibrin-dependent plasminogen activation Open table in a new tab Fibrin binding experiments were performed with low concentrations of t-PA or t-PA analogues (<0.1 nM), and the fraction of total t-PA or t-PA analogues bound at different fibrin(ogen) concentrations was assessed (Fig. 2). For t-PA, a high affinity interaction with a forming fibrin clot is found (Fig.2A). When the C50 of this interaction was determined, a value of 77 ± 11 nM was found (Table III). Fibrin binding of t-PA in the presence of 5 mM EACA is markedly reduced (Fig. 2A). Determination of the C50 for this interaction resulted in a value of 376 ± 46 nM (Table III). Deletion of the lysyl binding site (FGK1K2P (D236N)) also effects the binding to a forming fibrin clot (Fig. 2B), resulting in a C50 value of 169 ± 20 nM (Table III). The presence of 5 mM EACA had no influence on the fibrin binding of FGK1K2P (D236N), confirming the absence of a functional lysyl binding site in this molecule. Deletion of the F domain in t-PA (GK1K2P) reduces fibrin binding (Fig. 2C). Blocking the lysyl binding site in GK1K2P with 5 mM of EACA resulted in a lowered fibrin binding. Surprisingly, even when the F domain and the lysyl binding site in t-PA are lacking (GK1K2P (D236N)), considerable fibrin binding is still observed (Fig. 2D, C50 GK1K2P (D236N); 557 ± 126 nM (Table III)). As noticed with t-PA, occupying the lysyl binding site with EACA has a greater effect on fibrin binding than deleting the lysyl binding site. The K2P binding to fibrin is weak (Fig. 2E, C50 1163 ± 490 nM (Table III)) and is completely inhibited in the presence of 5 mM EACA. Deleting the lysyl binding site in this molecule also abolishes fibrin binding (Fig. 2F).Table III:Determination of C50 values of binding of t-PA and t-PA analogues to fibrin in the absence and presence of EACA Open table in a new tab To study the t-PA binding site on a forming fibrin clot, we performed competition experiments. Table IV shows the result of such a competition experiment. The binding of radiolabeled FGK1K2P is partially competed by FGK1K2P and K2P. The fibrin binding of FGK1K2P (D236N) lacking the lysyl binding site was only partially inhibited by FGK1K2P but also by K2P. This result suggests that the t-PA binding site in fibrin is also recognized by K2P. Binding of GK1K2P lacking the F domain is competed by K2P but also by FGK1K2P. Fibrin binding of GK1K2P (D236N) lacking both the F domain and the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain could be completely inhibited by FGK1K2P and K2P, indicating that the molecule GK1K2P (D236N) still recognizes the same t-PA binding site on fibrin. Competition with bovine serum albumin at competitor concentrations comparable with K2P and FGK1K2P did not occur (not shown).Table IV:Competition experiments of radiolabeled t-PA and t-PA analogues with t-PA and K2P Open table in a new tab The first models describing the interaction of t-PA with a forming fibrin clot were based on the idea that t-PA not only consists of structurally autonomous domains but also of functionally autonomous domains (van Zonneveld et al., 1986a). In these first models, there is a prominent role for the F and the K2 domain (van Zonneveld et al., 1986b; Verheijen et al., 1986Verheijen J.H. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. de Munk G.A.W. Pouwels P.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12639-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a model in which the K1 domain plays an important role in the interaction of t-PA to preformed fibrin has been described (Kaczmarek et al., 1993Kaczmarek E. Lee M.H. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The F/K2 models may be further subdivided into models in which the t-PA interaction sites on the fibrin are in juxtaposition (van Zonneveld et al., 1986b; de Vries et al., 1990; Horrevoets et al., 1994Horrevoets A.J.G. Smilde A. de Vries C. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12639-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a model in which the t-PA interaction sites are further apart (Nesheim et al., 1990Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All F/K2 models stress the importance of an direct interaction between the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain and a lysyl side chain of the fibrin network. Besides these models, in which the functional autonomy of domains is stressed, a model was presented in which the fibrin interaction sites in t-PA were spread over many domains, except the K2 domain (Bennet et al., 1991). Our results with the GK1K2P (D236N) a molecule that shows considerable interaction with a forming fibrin clot, suggest that besides the F and K2-mediated interaction, other fibrin interaction sites in t-PA exist. Interestingly, this molecule also shows enhanced plasminogen activation in the presence of fibrin. This indicates that besides the finger domain and lysyl binding site in the K2 domain, other domains of t-PA are involved in fibrin-dependent plasminogen activation. Remarkably, the fibrin binding of FGK1K2P (D236N) a molecule that no longer can interact via its lysyl binding site in the K2P part can be competitively inhibited by K2P. It seems therefore unlikely that the binding sites on fibrin for K2P and FGK1K2P (D236N) are far apart on the fibrin surface. This result questions the model of Nesheim (Nesheim et al., 1990Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which no such competition would be expected. The role of the lysyl binding site in binding to a forming fibrin clot is more complicated than expected. In the presence of 5 mM EACA, fibrin binding is more perturbed than after the deletion of the lysyl binding site. Such a result could be explained by steric hindrance. EACA binding to the lysyl binding site blocks the fibrin binding site and so reduces fibrin binding. Deletion of the lysyl binding site abolishes the interaction with EACA and therefore a possible inhibition of fibrin binding by EACA should no longer be possible. To test this steric hindrance hypothesis, we studied the fibrin binding of K2P in more detail. Fibrin binding of this molecule can be completely inhibited by 5 mM EACA. It is known that the dissociation constant of EACA for K2P is approximately 100 μM (Byeon et al., 1991; de Munk et al., 1989de Munk G.A.W. Caspers M.P.M. Chang G.T.G. Pouwels P.H. Enger-valk B.E. Verheijen J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 2 orders of magnitude higher than the dissociation constant of binding of K2P to fibrin (C50 1163 ± 490 nM). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that fibrin binding is not solely aminohexyl-mediated and that the fibrin binding site comprises more than the lysyl binding site. However deletion of the lysyl binding site in the K2P molecule not only abolishes binding to EACA but also to fibrin. Therefore, steric hindrance does not seem to be a satisfying explanation for the observed difference in fibrin binding between t-PA in the presence of EACA and t-PA without a lysyl binding site. A more likely explanation for this effect is to assume additional indirect effects of occupation of the lysyl binding site such as induction of a conformational changes in the t-PA molecule. Conformational changes upon occupation of a lysyl binding site in the closely related and structurally similar molecule plasminogen have been described (Markus et al., 1978Markus G. Evers J.L. Hobika G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 733-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Christensen and Molgaard, 1992Christensen U. Molgaard L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plasminogen can occur in a closed conformation in the absence of EACA and an open conformation in the presence of EACA. The most likely explanation for this behavior is the occupancy of the lysyl binding site by an intramolecular lysyl or arginyl residue in the closed conformation (Ponting and Marshall, 1992Ponting C.P. Marshall S.A. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that a similar mechanism could be operating in t-PA since the solubility of t-PA increases considerably on addition of lysine or arginine (Hasegawa and Kondo, 1985Hasegawa A. Kondo S. October 2 European Patent Application EP 0156169. 1985; Google Scholar; Ichimura et al., 1987Ichimura M. Saki K. Kunihiro Y. Nakashiro T. European Patent Application 0217379 April 8. 1987; Google Scholar). Furthermore electron microscopic studies suggest that the structure of the molecule is ellipsoidal with the domains folded toward each other (Margossian et al., 1993Margossian S.S. Slayter H.S. Kaczmarek E. McDonagh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Based on differential scanning calorimetry experiments, an interaction between the FG domains and the P domain was predicted. Although no involvement of the lysyl binding site could be detected (Novokhatny et al., 1991Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a strong interdomain interaction involving lysyl binding sites has been observed in crystals of kringle 2 domain (de Vos et al., 1992de Vos A.M. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Westbrook M.L. Kossiakoff A.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that replacement of stretches of charged amino acid residues containing lysyl residues or arginyl residues by alanyl residues influences the fibrin binding of the resulting t-PA analogue (Bennet et al., 1991). In view of these data, we propose an alternative model for the high affinity interaction of t-PA with fibrin and the role of the lysyl binding site in this (Fig. 3). In analogy to plasminogen, t-PA could occur in two conformations, an open conformation and a closed conformation. The interaction between the lysyl binding site in the K2 domain and a lysyl residue stabilizes the closed conformation. The addition of EACA or mutation of the lysyl binding site would free t-PA in a more open conformation. In the closed conformation, the affinity for fibrin is higher than in the open conformation. It has not escaped our notice that occupation of the lysyl binding site in t-PA by EACA could reflect a first step in the pathway of fibrin-dependent plasminogen activation. Occupation of the lysyl binding site by plasminogen would free the P domain of t-PA from the fibrin surface making it available for the hydrolysis of the Arg561-Val562 bond of plasminogen. However, the enhancement of the plasminogen to plasmin conversion by K2P (D236N), that does not interact with a forming fibrin clot suggests that yet another mechanism of plasminogen activation exists, independent of the t-PA binding to fibrin. We thank Drs. D. C. Rijken and W. Nieuwenhuizen for critically reading the manuscript and for helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1583083752,"Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) is found in neurosecretory vesicles in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. We expressed various human DBH cDNAs in two mammalian cell lines, using the vaccinia virus expression system. The expression of a full-length DBH cDNA (DBH-f) reproduced the native DBH electrophoretic pattern and led to the synthesis of an active enzyme composed of two subunits of 77 and 73 kDa. In contrast, a truncated cDNA lacking the first ATG (DBH-t) generated a single band of 73 kDa. Analysis of mutated recombinant clones demonstrates that the two polypeptides do not result from the use of an alternative translation initiator codon. These results, combined with deglycosylation experiments, allow us to attribute the double band pattern to an optional cleavage of the signal peptide. When the NH2-terminal extremity is shortened, cleavage becomes obligatory, underlining the role of the first 14 amino acids in the regulation of the cleavage of the signal peptide. Subcellular analysis of recombinant DBH-t and DBH-f proteins indicates that DBH is anchored to the membrane by two distinct mechanisms; one of them is due to the non-removal of the signal peptide, whereas the second one is independent of the presence of the signal sequence. Moreover, quantification of the fractionation experiments suggests that the two modes of membrane attachment are additive."

The oligosaccharide comigrated with a pentasaccharide standard derived from chondroitin sulfate, but acid hydrolysis gave 98% [3H]GlcN. Heparin lyase III digestion yielded [3H]GlcNAc, suggesting that the GlcNAc residue was α-linked to the nonreducing terminus. Enzymatic treatment of [6-3H]Gal-labeled material yielded the tetrasaccharide, ΔGlcA-[3H]Gal-[3H]Gal-xylitol. These findings suggest that pentasaccharide had the structure, GlcNAcα1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl.

Cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Salt Lake City, UT), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity. Cells were passaged with trypsin every 3-4 days and revived periodically from frozen stocks. Decorin from bovine skin (a generous gift from M. Höök, Texas) was used to prepare oligosaccharide standards. The GAG chain was released by β-elimination, and the terminal xylose residue was reduced to [3H]xylitol with NaB3H4. Briefly, 0.5 μg of decorin was dissolved in 50 μl of water and mixed with 50 μl of a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH, 20 mM NaBH4, and 5 mCi of NaB3H4 (12.6 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). After 24 h at 4°C, 10 μl of 10 N acetic acid was added in a fume hood to stop the reaction. Authentic chondroitin 4-sulfate (1 mg) was added as carrier. The sample was diluted with 9 volumes of water and applied to a 0.5-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel. The column was washed twice with 12.5 ml of a 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.25 M NaCl.

The samples were centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 10 min (IEC HN-SII centrifuge), and the supernatant was decanted into a fresh tube. IgG-Agarose beads (Sigma) were added (0.2 ml), and the sample was mixed end-over-end overnight at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged 1,100 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were aspirated. The pellets were washed 3 times with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide (14 ml). 35S-Labeled samples were dissolved in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0), and an aliquot was treated at 37°C for 4 h with 10 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku), 2 milliunits of heparin lyase III (EC 4.2.2.8, Seikagaku), or both enzymes in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204694) Google Scholar) and boiling the samples in a water bath for 7 min. The samples were loaded on a 5-16% linear gradient SDS-PAGE gel (200 × 160 × 1.5 mm) and electrophoresed at constant voltage (80 V) overnight (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204694) Google Scholar). The gel was dried on a piece of filter paper, and the radioactive proteoglycans were visualized by autoradiography. All purification steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. [6-3H]Gal and [6-3H]GlcN-labeled betaglycan chimeras bound to IgG-agarose beads were washed with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and suspended in bicarbonate buffer (0.5 ml) containing 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 50 μg/ml L-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma). After the samples were incubated at 37°C, they were centrifuged. The proportion of total counts in the supernatant increased from less than 1% at the beginning of the reaction to 65-100% by 40 min. The reaction was continued for another 40 min and then stopped by boiling the samples in a water bath for 10 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected. Chondroitin 4-sulfate (1 mg, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to each sample. DEAE-Sephacel columns (0.5 ml) were prepared in a disposable pipette tip and equilibrated with 0.25 M NaCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6). The samples were loaded, and the columns were washed with 12.5 ml of buffer containing 0.25 M NaCl to remove protein A fragments and any betaglycan segments without GAG chains. Peptides containing chains were eluted with 2.5 ml of buffer containing 1 M NaCl and precipitated by adding 4 volumes of ethanol. The precipitated glycopeptides were resuspended in 0.5 M NaOH containing 1 M sodium borohydride (0.1 ml) and incubated at 4°C for 24 h to liberate any O-linked GAG or oligosaccharide chains. After β-elimination, the samples were neutralized with acetic acid and diluted 500-fold with water. The β-eliminated material was subjected to another round of chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel to separate small oligosaccharides from large GAG chains. The flow-through (50 ml) and 0.25 M NaCl wash fraction (10 ml) were collected. The GAG chains were eluted with 2.5 ml of 1 M NaCl buffer and precipitated with ethanol. The flow-through sample was loaded on a 0.5-ml column of AG1-X2 resin (200-400 mesh, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) equilibrated with water. The column was eluted stepwise with 5 ml each of water, 0.015, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 1 M ammonium acetate (pH 7.0). Each fraction was collected and lyophilized. Samples collected from AG1-X2 were analyzed by gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography (Progel TSK-G2500, 300 × 7.8 mm, inner diameter, Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated in 0.5 M pyridinium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and radioactivity in the effluent was detected by in-line liquid scintillation counting (Packard Instrument Company, Downers Grove, IL). The column was calibrated with tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexasaccharide standards prepared from chondroitin sulfate as described above. Material that migrated in the position of the pentasaccharide standard was collected for further analysis. [6-3H]GlcN-labeled material from the mutant was acid hydrolyzed for 4 h at 100°C as described by Hardy et al., 1988Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar. A sample was mixed with standard GlcN and GalN (10 nmol) and applied to a CarboPac PA-1 column (Dionex Corp) equilibrated with 16 mM NaOH. The column was run at 1 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The elution position of sugar standards was monitored by pulsed amperometric detection. The radiolabeled sugars were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and their elution positions were compared with that of the sugar standards. An aliquot of the intermediate labeled either with [6-3H]GlcN or [6-3H]Gal was dissolved in 50 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 milliunits of heparin lyase III (Seikagaku, heparitinase I) and incubated at 37°C overnight. The enzyme was inactivated by boiling the sample for 10 min. Samples were filtered through a microconTM 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), and the filtrates were applied to the CarboPac PA-1 column. The CarboPac PA-1 column was equilibrated in 0.1 M NaOH and calibrated with 104 cpm of each linkage region standards. The samples and standards were eluted with a gradient of sodium acetate as described by Shibata et al., 1992Shibata S. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Fractions (1 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the radiolabeled sugar was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. We have described a mutant designated pgsD-677 that lacks the α-GlcNAc transferase involved in the polymerization of heparan sulfate chains (Lidholt et al., 1992Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz K.J. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Enzymatic studies showed that the mutant transferred α-GlcNAc residues to a disaccharide resembling the terminal sugars of the linkage region (GlcAβ1-3Gal-). This finding suggested that cells use two α-GlcNAc transferases to assemble heparan sulfate, one to initiate the chain (α-GlcNAc transferase I) and another to polymerize the chain (α-GlcNAc transferase II) (Fritz et al., 1994Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this idea is correct, then pgsD-677 cells should accumulate an intermediate consisting of α-GlcNAc attached to the linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcNAcα1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-). Attempts to identify oligosaccharide intermediates on native core proteins in the mutant did not meet with success because their concentration was too low, and O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides interfered with the analyses (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, a fusion protein was made consisting of a 45-amino acid segment of betaglycan fused by its N terminus to the 286-amino acid IgG-binding domain of Staphylococcal protein A and the signal peptide from the secreted metalloprotease, transin. This segment of betaglycan (residues 518-562) has two GAG attachment sites at Ser535 and Ser546 (Zhang and Esko, 1994Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; López-Casillas et al., 1994López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The site at Ser535 primes both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, whereas the site at Ser546 primes only chondroitin sulfate (Zhang and Esko, 1994Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; López-Casillas et al., 1994López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type cells were transiently transfected with the construct and labeled with [6-3H]GlcN. Chimeras secreted into the growth medium were purified by affinity chromatography using IgG-agarose (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both cell lines glycosylated the chimeras, but the amount of [6-3H]GlcN-labeled material was higher in wild-type cells than in the mutant (Table I). This result was not unexpected since the mutant makes chondroitin sulfate, whereas the wild-type makes both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate and most of the label was found in the repeating disaccharide units of the GAG chains. In contrast, comparable amounts of material was made in mutant and wild-type cells labeled with [6-3H]Gal. This precursor labels the internal Gal residues found in the linkage region, suggesting that the chimeras expressed by mutant cells might contain linkage fragments.Table I:Yield of [6-3H]GlcN or [6-3H]Gal-labeled oligosaccharides in wild-type and mutant pgsD-677 cells Open table in a new tab Analysis of 35SO4-labeled chimeras by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) revealed that wild-type cells produced sulfated material that separated into two broad bands, typical of proteins containing variably sized GAG chains (lane 3). The upper, more slowly migrating material consisted of chimeras containing two GAG chains since none was made in chimeras containing only one attachment site.2( 2L. Zhang, G. David, and J. D. Esko, submitted for publication.) Digesting the samples with chondroitinase ABC (lane 4) or heparin lyase III (lane 5) collapsed the upper band from wild-type cells, indicating that most of these chimeras contained one chondroitin sulfate and one heparan sulfate chain. Samples treated with both enzymes yielded only a residual core protein (~45 kDa) that labeled with 35SO4 due to sulfate-containing linkage fragments resistant to enzyme digestion (lane 6). The chimeras expressed in pgsD-677 cells mostly contained one chondroitin sulfate chain (lane 1), and all of the material collapsed into the ~45-kDa range after chondroitinase ABC treatment (lane 2). The reduced amount of chimeras containing two GAG chains in the mutant suggested that some molecules containing a chondroitin sulfate chain might bear an oligosaccharide intermediate at the site where heparan sulfate assembled in wild-type cells. A purification scheme for finding intermediates was devised (Fig. 2). Chimeras were first affinity purified from cells labeled with [6-3H]Gal or [6-3H]GlcN. They were then treated with trypsin to remove the protein A domain. This region contains potential N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites that might interfere with the identification of linkage region intermediates. The peptide derived from betaglycan does not contain Arg or Lys residues, and the closest cleavage site was 5 amino acids into the protein A domain (Nilsson et al., 1985Nilsson B. Abrahmsen L. Uhlén M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, trypsin should have generated a fragment containing 45 amino acids from betaglycan and 5 amino acids from protein A. Next, the mixture was separated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography to select fragments containing a GAG chain. This step ensured that any oligosaccharides found subsequently would have been made on fragments that also supported the assembly of a complete GAG chain. Treating this material with alkali liberated the O-linked chains. A second round of chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel separated the GAG chains from neutral or weakly charged oligosaccharides. The latter material was then separated by strong anion-exchange chromatography on a column of AG1-X2 resin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Prior calibration of the column with linkage region fragments showed that oligosaccharides containing a charge of −1 or −2 would bind to the column and elute with 50 mM ammonium acetate. Material eluting under these conditions was used for the analytical studies described below. Gel filtration chromatography showed that some of the oligosaccharides labeled with [6-3H]GlcN from mutant cells migrated in the same position as a pentasaccharide standard derived from authentic chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 3A). Lesser amounts of tetrasaccharide and trisaccharide were also present. In contrast, wild-type cells contained mostly short oligosaccharides and little if any material migrating like pentasaccharides (Fig. 3B). Another aliquot was analyzed by chromatography on a CarboPac PA-1 column under alkaline conditions (Shibata et al., 1992Shibata S. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the labeled oligosaccharides from the mutant eluted like the pentasaccharide standard, except that its position was shifted by one fraction (Fig. 4A). Wild-type cells did not produce any material migrating in this position (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:A pentasaccharide exists in pgsD-677 mutant but not in wild-type cells. An aliquot of material purified by AG1-X2 chromatography was analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column (Shibata et al., 1992Shibata S. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of radioactivity in each fraction was monitored. A, pgsD-677; B, wild-type; 3, Galβ1-3Galβ1-4xylitol; 4, ΔGlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4xylitol; and 5, GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4xylitol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The putative pentasaccharide intermediate represented ~0.1% of the starting material from chimeras labeled with [6-3H]GlcN and ~2% of material labeled with [6-3H]Gal. The labeling of the pentasaccharide with [6-3H]GlcN suggested that it contained GlcNAc, but some GalNAc may have been present since GalNAc can be made from GlcNAc through epimerization of the corresponding nucleotide sugars (Kingsley et al., 1986Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 67: 785-795Google Scholar). Acid hydrolysis, however, released 98% [3H]GlcN and less than 2% [3H]GalN (Fig. 5). Fractions containing pentasaccharides were pooled from gel filtration (Fig. 3, shaded area). This material migrated on the Carbopac PA-1 column like the major oligosaccharide peak found in the material prior to gel filtration (Fig. 4). The pentasaccharide was resistant to β-hexosaminidase (data not shown), suggesting that the GlcNAc residue was not β-linked or that it was inaccessible. When [6-3H]GlcN-labeled material was treated with 10 milliunits of heparin lyase III, [6-3H]GlcNAc was released (Fig. 6A). Heparin lyase III recognizes N-acetyl or N-sulfated GlcN residues linked α-(1-4) to GlcA in heparan sulfate chains (Nader et al., 1990Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L.S. Pinhal M.A.S. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C.T. Dietrich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16807-16813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction normally liberates disaccharides with a nonreducing terminal β-D-Δ4, 5-unsaturated glucopyranosyluronic acid. Apparently, the enzyme also acts on the terminal αGlcNAc residues. Treating [6-3H]Gal-labeled intermediate with heparin lyase III should liberate radiolabeled tetrasaccharide with a Δ4, 5 unsaturated glucopyranosyluronic acid at the nonreducing end (Δ4, 5-GlcAβ1-3[3H]Galβ1-3[3H]Galβ1-4xylitol). Analysis of the products of the reaction showed a single radiolabeled product that migrated exactly at the position of standard tetrasaccharide on the CarboPac PA-1 column (Fig. 6B). Together, these data indicated that the pentasaccharide accumulating in pgsD-677 cells had the structure GlcNAcα1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl. The GAG chains of proteoglycans assemble by the stepwise addition of monosaccharides to the nonreducing terminus of nascent chains (Rodén, 1980Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The sequential addition of sugars suggests that discrete oligosaccharide intermediates should exist in vivo. Vertel et al., 1994Vertel B.M. Grier B.L. Li H. Schwartz N.B. Biochem J. 1994; 301: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar found xylose on a truncated aggrecan precursor that fails to be secreted. However, more complex intermediates have not been detected on core proteins, possibly because of their rapid and efficient conversion to full-length chains. Intermediates accumulate when GAG synthesis is altered by drugs. Spiro et al., 1991Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J.

The accumulation of these compounds may reflect detoxification reactions (glucuronidation) or utilization of alternate substrates by enzymes belonging to other biosynthetic pathways. Mutants provide another way to find intermediates, since they should accumulate metabolites upstream from the block imposed by the mutation. Quentin et al., 1990Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar showed that xylose residues occur on a natural proteoglycan core protein in human fibroblasts deficient in galactosyltransferase I. The accumulation of the pentasaccharide, GlcNAcα1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-, in a mutant altered in heparan sulfate polymerization suggests that the assembly of chains normally goes through this intermediate. Its absence in wild-type cells suggests that the conversion of pentasaccharide to heparan sulfate occurs rapidly and quantitatively under normal conditions. Because the mutant is defective in chain polymerization (Lidholt et al., 1992Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz K.J. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the presence of α-GlcNAc-terminated pentasaccharide provides another piece of evidence that a unique α-GlcNAc transferase catalyzes the addition of the first α-GlcNAc residue (Fritz et al., 1994Fritz T.A.

Hexasaccharides from chondroitin sulfate containing these modifications would have eluted from the AG1-X2 column with ≤1 M ammonium acetate. Thus, if phosphorylation or sulfation had occurred, we would have detected the modified oligosaccharides. The lack of phosphorylation and sulfation is not surprising since it does not occur universally or stoichiometrically in chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate (Sugahara et al., 1988Sugahara K.

The chimera used in this study makes 40% heparan sulfate and 60% chondroitin sulfate in wild-type cells, and about one-half of the material contains two chains (Fig. 1). Therefore, the amount of pentasaccharide (plus tetrasaccharide and trisaccharide) should have represented ~40% of material labeled with [6-3H]Gal in pgsD-677 cells instead of only ~2% (Table I). Several possibilities may explain this discrepancy. Core proteins with immature chains may be degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi by proteolysis (Su et al., 1993Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J. Zemsky J. Green R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by endolytic cleavage of the carbohydrate chains (Villers et al., 1994Villers C. Cacan R.

Addition and removal of sugars occurs normally during the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W1486789696,"Periodate modification of human serum transferrin produces a species that binds Fe(III) weakly at pH 7.4 contrary to previous reports that Fe(III)-binding activity is completely lost. Ternary complexes of periodate-modified transferrin and either Fe(III) with nitrilotriacetate (NTA), oxalate, citrate, or EDTA, or of Cu(II) with oxalate could be formed. Peak wavelength maxima of these spectral bands are identical to those reported for native transferrin in the absence of bicarbonate. No carbonate ternary complexes of periodate-modified transferrin with Fe(III), Al(III), Cu(II), or Zn(II) could be formed. Conditional (Fe(NTA)) binding constants (log <i>K</i>) for C- and N-terminal modified sites are 7.33 and 7.54, respectively. The respective extinction coefficients at 470 nm are decreased 45% compared with the native protein. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the complex closely resembles that of the Fe(III)⋅NTA ternary complex formed with native transferrin in the absence of bicarbonate. Anions, including bicarbonate, at high concentrations destabilize formation of this Fe(III)⋅NTA ternary complex, while Fe(III) chelators readily remove the bound Fe(III). Bicarbonate, sulfate, and pyrophosphate still bind to the modified binding sites in the absence of metal although with slightly lower affinity and with lower molar difference absorptivities. Results are interpreted as an inhibition of a crucial protein conformational change by an intramolecular cross-link, preventing formation of the particularly stable metal-carbonate ternary complex from the less stable metal-chelate ternary complex. The method can be used to produce monosited transferrins."
https://openalex.org/W2152864843,"The nocP-nocR divergent gene arrangement of the nopaline catabolism (noc) operon of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid pTiT37 was examined with respect to the expression of the nocP promoter. Under repressive conditions, i.e. in the absence of nopaline, four distinct levels of PnocP expression were observed. The lowest level of expression, i.e. full repression, was detected in the presence of the NocR repressor, together with the remote noc operator and productive transcription from the divergent nocR promoter. The next level was observed in the absence of either the NocR protein or of the operator or of both. The third level was detected when abortive transcription from the nocR promoter occurred, irrespective of the presence or absence of the NocR protein. The highest level of PnocP expression was observed in the absence of both productive transcription from PnocR and the operator sequence, whether or not the NocR protein was present. Under inductive conditions, i.e. in the presence of nopaline, expression of PnocP was activated if both the NocR protein and the operator were present. Absence of either NocR or the operator resulted in lack of inducibility of the nocP promoter. Transcription from the divergent nocR promoter had no influence on the activation of PnocP. It was also found that the absence of the operator affected plasmid supercoiling in vivo. The results suggest that DNA topology has a role in the regulation of the nocP promoter.

Remote operators, which are situated outside of the −65 to +20 region of the regulated promoter, are found in many prokaryotic operons, for example in ara, deo, gal, and lac(1Collado-Vides J. Magasnik B. Gralla J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 371-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These operators, however, have one or more remote or proximal (between the −65 and +20 positions) counterparts, and interaction of a regulatory protein with these multiple sites modulates expression of the regulated promoter (2Lobell R.B. Schleif R.F. Science. 1990; 250: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Amouyal M. Mortensen L. Buc H. Hammer K.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, in those operons where only a single operator is involved, the position of the operator is proximal to or slightly remote from the promoter, as has been shown for promoters regulated by the Fur, LexA, MetJ, and PurR proteins (1Collado-Vides J. Magasnik B. Gralla J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 371-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, gene expression is repressed or activated by direct contact between the regulatory protein and the RNA polymerase (6Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, regulation of gene expression by a single remote operator, which is more than 70 bp1( 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s).) upstream of the −35 hexamer of a σ 70 promoter, has not yet been reported to date. base pair(s). In this respect, the position of a putative operator (OnocP), which we have localized in the noc operon of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid pTiT37, is unusual. In this operon, two genes, nocP (formerly called nocB) and nocR, are divergently transcribed by nonoverlapping promoters. The NocR protein alternatively represses or activates expression of PnocP, depending on the absence or presence of nopaline, respectively (7Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) . The putative operator is located 3 bp downstream of the −10 hexamer of the nocR promoter and centered 137 bp upstream of the −35 hexamer of the regulated nocP promoter. Its deletion resulted in failure of NocR binding in vitro(8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) . There are no other binding sites for the NocR protein in the noc promoter region (7Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) , and no regulatory sites exist in the coding regions of either the nocP or the nocR genes (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This report addresses the role of the putative operator in the regulation of the nocP promoter. The results demonstrate that in the absence of the inducer, expression of PnocP is much higher in the absence than in the presence of the operator, when the NocR repressor is present. Furthermore, different levels of PnocP expression were observed depending upon productive or abortive transcription from the divergent nocR promoter and presence or absence of the operator sequence, even in the absence of the NocR regulatory protein. In the presence of the inducer, PnocP was activated only in the presence of both NocR and the operator. Transcription from the adjacent nocR promoter did not perturb the activation. The noc operator was also found to affect plasmid supercoiling in vivo. The results suggest that expression of PnocP can be controlled through a single remote operator and that at least repression of the nocP promoter may be interpreted in terms of alteration of local DNA topology. Construction of plasmids pNOC100, pNOC32, pNOC12, and pNOC12Δo has been described previously (7Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To construct pNOC860, the operator-deleted nocR promoter fragment (PnocRΔa) was excised from pNOC12Δo by digestion with HindIII+BamHI and was inserted in front of the promoterless β-glucuronidase (gusA) gene of pBI101.3 (9Bevan M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). The PnocRΔa-gusA fusion was then cloned upstream of the PnocP -luc fusion of pNOC100. The wild type and the operator-deleted nocR promoters from pNOC12 and pNOC12Δo were cloned into pNOC100, yielding pNOC202 and pNOC301, respectively. For these procedures standard DNA manipulation techniques were used (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were routinely maintained in Escherichia coli DH5α and were conjugated into the pTiT37-carrying A208 (11Van Larebeke N. Genetello C. Hernalsteens J.P. Depicker A. Zaenen J. Messens E. Van Montagu M. Schell J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1977; 152: 119-124Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the Ti plasmid-free C58C1 (12Sciaky D. Montoya A.L. Chilton M.-D. Plasmid. 1978; 1: 238-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) A. tumefaciens strains by triparental mating (13Ditta G. Stanfield S. Corbin D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Induction and measurement of the reporter enzymes were performed as described previously (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), except that p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucuronide was used as the substrate for β-glucuronidase. To examine their topoisomers, plasmids pNOC12 and pNOC12Δo were introduced into the E. coli strain HB101. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani media at 37°C to the mid-log phase and treated with oxolinic acid at 50 μg/ml final concentration for 20 min. Plasmid DNAs were isolated by the modified alkaline lysis method of Saunders and Burke (14Saunders S.E. Burke J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To separate plasmid topoisomers, electrophoresis of the samples were done on a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), in the presence of 24 μg/ml chloroquine at 40 V for 20 h at room temperature followed by staining with ethidium bromide. A CATGN4CATG direct repeat (Fig. 1) has been identified as the only binding site for the NocR protein in the nocP-nocR promoter region and has been proposed to act as an operator in expression of the nocP promoter regulated by the NocR protein (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this sequence, two plasmids, pNOC32 and pNOC860 (Fig. 2), were used. Since both plasmids contain the luc and gusA reporter genes fused to the nocP and nocR promoters, respectively, transcriptional activity of the promoters can be extrapolated by measuring activities of the Luc and GusA enzymes. Plasmid pNOC32 has the wild type promoter region, whereas in pNOC860 the putative operator is deleted.Figure 2:Structure of the pNOC plasmids used in this study (B). The top part (A) shows the arrangement of the nocP-nocR region in the Ti plasmid pTiT37. Genes are labeled by differently shaded boxes. In pNOC860, pNOC301, and pNOC12Δo the position of the deleted sequence is labeled by a black box. The flanking regions of the plasmids are not shown, and genes are not drawn to scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the A. tumefaciens strain A208, supplementing the NocR protein from trans, a 15-fold higher expression of PnocP was detected in the mutant pNOC860 plasmid than in the wild type plasmid pNOC32, in the absence of nopaline. Since the presence of the direct repeat is needed for binding of NocR in vitro(8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the higher expression of PnocP of pNOC860 in a NocR+ background could be due to the failure of NocR binding and indicates the operator role of the CATGN4CATG sequence. As the NocR protein is not needed for expression of the isolated nocP promoter, we concluded previously that NocR is a repressor in the absence of nopaline (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Expression of PnocP in the absence of the operator (strain A208/pNOC860), however, was only 16-17% of the constitutive expression of the isolated nocP promoter (data not shown). This observation is contradictory to the rule that deleting the binding site of a repressor results in constitutive expression of the regulated gene (15Lewin B. Genes IV. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1990: 257-259Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed the reverse experiment, i.e. the wild type pNOC32 plasmid was introduced into a NocR− strain, C58C1. Since the NocR protein autoregulates its own synthesis (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the 9-fold higher expression of PnocP in strain C58C1/pNOC32 (Table I) confirmed the absence of the NocR protein. The lack of the nocR gene in strain C58C1 was also confirmed by Southern hybridization (data not shown). In this proven NocR− strain, expression of the nocP promoter was similar to that of strain A208/pNOC860. Furthermore, in the nocR−OnocP− double mutant C58C1/pNOC860 strain, similar expression of PnocP was observed to that which was detected in the A208/pNOC860 and the C58C1/pNOC32 strains (Table I). These results revealed that the nocP promoter is expressed equally in either the absence of the NocR protein or in the absence of the operator or in the absence of both. Therefore, there is another factor which caused the relatively low expression of PnocP under these circumstances.Table I:Expression of the nocP and nocR promoters in Agrobacterium Open table in a new tab One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that competition of closely spaced promoters, like PnocP and PnocR, for the RNA polymerase influences their expression (16Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 394-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, despite the 9-fold variation observed between expression of the nocR promoter in strains A208/pNOC860, C58C1/pNOC32, and C58C1/pNOC860, only a 1.3-1.5-fold difference was observed between expression of PnocP in the same strains. This result indicates that there is no competition between the nocP and nocR promoters and that expression of PnocP is independent of the strength of PnocR. An alternate explanation for the low level expression of PnocP observed in the absence of the NocR protein is that the transcription process from the nocR promoter influences expression of the divergent nocP promoter. Transcription generates negative supercoils behind the transcribing RNA polymerase in a topologically closed domain (17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 18Figueroa N. Bossi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9416-9420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Tsao Y.-P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and the generated torsional stress may affect functions of the nearby sequences (19Tsao Y.-P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Thompson R.J. Davies J.P. Lin G. Mosig G. Drlica K. Riley M. The Bacterial Chromosome.

Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The supercoil-generating effect of the transcription, however, depends on the transcript length (23Brill S.J. Sternglanz R. Cell. 1988; 54: 403-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To study this aspect in the noc operon, we truncated the gusA gene from the nocR promoter in plasmid pNOC32 to produce plasmid pNOC202 (Fig. 2). As a consequence of the lack of the gusA gene, transcription from the nocR promoter is abortive in plasmid pNOC202, resulting in a much shorter transcript compared with plasmid pNOC32 in which productive transcription occurs. Plasmid pNOC202 was then introduced into both the NocR− C58C1 and NocR+ A208 strains. A 4.7-fold higher expression of PnocP was observed in the absence (pNOC202) than in the presence (pNOC32) of the gusA gene (Table I). In the NocR+ A208 strain, however, deletion of the gusA gene resulted in a 47-fold increase of expression of the nocP promoter (: A208/pNOC202 versus A208/pNOC32). The absolute levels of PnocP expression, however, were the same in either the A208/pNOC202 or the C58C1/pNOC202 strains (Table I). These results demonstrate that in the absence of the gusA gene, expression of the nocP promoter is independent of the NocR protein, even in the presence of the operator, and that the presence of the gusA gene is needed for full repression of PnocP by the NocR protein. Furthermore, the presence of the gusA gene fused to the nocR promoter has reduced expression of the nocP promoter, even in the absence of the NocR protein. To determine how the abortive transcription from PnocR affects expression of PnocP in the absence of the operator, a plasmid, pNOC301 (Fig. 2), which lacks both the operator and the gusA gene, was constructed and introduced into the NocR+ A208 and NocR− C58C1 strains. Similar levels of PnocP expression were detected in either the presence or the absence of the NocR protein (Table I). The expression of PnocP in pNOC301, however, was 3.5-fold higher than in pNOC202 and about 10-fold higher than in pNOC860, in either the A208 or the C58C1 strains (Table I). These results indicated that the enhanced expression of PnocP in the operator-deleted plasmid pNOC301 is independent of the NocR protein and simply due to the absence of the operator sequence. Comparison of the data also revealed that absence of the operator sequence did not influence expression of PnocP when the gusA gene is fused to the nocR promoter (pNOC860 versus pNOC32, in strain C58C1). In contrast, deletion of the operator resulted in a 3.5-fold increase of PnocP expression in the absence of the gusA gene (pNOC31 versus pNOC202, in strain C58C1). The results described earlier in this section suggested that supercoils generated by the transcription of an adjacent gene may repress expression of PnocP. Furthermore, the presence of the operator did or did not affect expression of PnocP, depending on abortive or productive transcription of PnocR, respectively. This suggested that the operator influences DNA topology, depending on the supercoil level of the neighboring sequences. To study this, two plasmids, pNOC12 and pNOC12Δo (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), containing and lacking the operator sequence, respectively, were introduced into the E. coli strain HB101 which is wild type for both gyrase and topoisomerase I. Plasmid DNAs exist in a negatively supercoiled form inside the bacterial cells (24Giaever G. Snyder L. Wang J.C. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 29: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and can be isolated in this form. When plasmids pNOC12 and pNOC12Δo were isolated from untreated bacteria, no difference was observed in their topoisomer distribution (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, treating the strains with a gyrase inhibitor, oxolinic acid (25Drlica K. Franco R.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2253-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), resulted in a shift of the topoisomers of both plasmids (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), indicating relaxation of the DNA as the consequence of inhibition of gyrase by oxolinic acid. Despite the relaxation of both plasmids, the operator-deleted mutant plasmid pNOC12Δo became less relaxed compared with the operator-containing plasmid, pNOC12 (Fig. 3, lane 3 versus lane 4). Activities of the nocP and nocR promoters were also determined in all of the constructed strains under inductive conditions, i.e. in the presence of nopaline (Table I). The results revealed that the presence of both the NocR protein and the operator is needed for activation of the nocP promoter. Absence of either resulted in failure to induce of PnocP. In contrast to the repression, activation of PnocP, however, was nearly the same in either the presence or the absence of a productive transcription from the nocR promoter (only a 1.09-fold difference was observed). Nopaline did not influence expression of the nocR promoter (Table I), in agreement with our previous report (8Marincs F. White D.W.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We analyzed the expression of the nocP promoter of the A. tumafaciens Ti plasmid pTiT37, and two main points should be highlighted from the results described above. First, we have found that productive transcription from the adjacent nocR promoter represses expression of the divergent nocP promoter, even in the absence of the NocR regulatory protein. In previous studies, only activation of a mutant promoter in a topoisomerase I mutant strain has been reported when a divergent transcription unit was placed upstream of the promoter (26Chen D. Bowater R.P. Dorman C. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8784-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bowater R.P. Chen D. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5647-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, results from different experiments, in good correlation with each other, revealed that an upstream sequence, which is the operator for the nocP promoter in the presence of the NocR regulatory protein, modulates both expression of PnocP and DNA supercoiling, even in the absence of NocR. To our knowledge no similar effects have been reported for a bacterial operator to date. The mechanism by which the noc operator affects DNA topology is not clear yet. However, since an 18-bp alternating purine-pyrimidine putative Z-DNA forming sequence overlaps the noc operator (Fig. 1), a B-Z or Z-B transition is possible, as it has been demonstrated previously that B to Z transition of synthetic purine-pyrimidine (alternating dG-dC) sequences influences the supercoil level of DNA (29Nordheim A. Peck L.J. Lafer E.M. Stollar B.D. Wang J.C. Rich A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 93-100Crossref Google Scholar). Full repression of the nocP promoter was observed only in the presence of the NocR protein, its binding site, and productive transcription from the divergent nocR promoter. Thus it is possible that a mutual interaction between binding of the NocR protein to the remote operator and DNA supercoiling has a role in repression of the nocP gene. Our results suggest that repression of the nocP promoter is influenced by changes in the local supercoiling level. The sensitivity of PnocP to supercoiling is not unexpected, because it has the features, namely a 19-bp intervening region between the −35 and −10 hexamers and G-C pairs in the −10 hexamer (Fig. 1), which have been found in supercoil-sensitive promoters (30Condee C.W. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rosenberg M. Chepelinsky A.B. McKenney K. Science. 1983; 222: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the repression, activation of the nocP promoter was not sensitive to the transcription from the adjacent nocR promoter. This observation suggests that repression and activation of the nocP promoter may occur by different molecular mechanisms. This proposal is supported by the observation that insertion of an extra 47 bp into plasmid pNOC32 between the regulated nocP promoter and the operator did not influence repression, but dramatically decreased activation of PnocP (data not shown). In conclusion, our results suggest that gene expression can be regulated through a single operator at a distance and that DNA supercoiling is one part of the cellular repertoire by which gene expression is regulated in naturally found divergent promoter pairs.
