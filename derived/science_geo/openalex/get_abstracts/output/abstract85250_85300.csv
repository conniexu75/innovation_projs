https://openalex.org/W1968282235,"In the macronuclear rRNA genes of Tetrahymena thermophila, a 413 bp intervening sequence (IVS) interrupts the 26S rRNA-coding region. A restriction fragment of the rDNA containing the IVS and portions of the adjacent rRNA sequences (exons) was inserted downstream from the lac UV5 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Transcription of this template by purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro produced a shortened version of the pre-rRNA, which was then deproteinized. When incubated with monovalent and divalent cations and a guanosine factor, this RNA underwent splicing. The reactions that were characterized included the precise excision of the IVS, attachment of guanosine to the 5' end of the IVS, covalent cyclization of the IVS and ligation of the exons. We conclude that splicing activity is intrinsic to the structure of the RNA, and that enzymes, small nuclear RNAs and folding of the pre-rRNA into an RNP are unnecessary for these reactions. We propose that the IVS portion of the RNA has several enzyme-like properties that enable it to break and reform phosphodiester bonds. The finding of autocatalytic rearrangements of RNA molecules has implications for the mechanism and the evolution of other reactions that involve RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2165781463,"We have asked whether oncogenesis by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a slowly oncogenic retrovirus, involves integration of viral DNA within a certain region of the host genome. We first identified a C3H mouse mammary tumor bearing a single new MMTV provirus and cloned a 19 kilobase (kb) DNA restriction fragment containing a junction of viral and host sequences. Host sequences from this clone were used to retrieve 25 kb of the uninterrupted locus (termed MMTV int1) from a bacteriophage library of normal mouse DNA. Hybridization with subcloned DNA fragments of MMTV int1 detected abnormal restriction fragments in digests of DNA from 18 of 26 C3H mammary tumors. The rearrangements all appeared to be due to the insertion of an MMTV provirus, and the integration sites were located in at least five clusters over a total distance of 19 kb. A polyadenylated 2.6 kb RNA species transcribed from int1 was found in the few tumors tested, but not in lactating mammary glands from C3H mice. Of 12 tested viral oncogenes, none exhibited homology with cloned DNA from this locus. We propose that tumorigenesis by MMTV is strongly favored by proviral insertion within the int1 locus, perhaps as a consequence of enhanced expression of a novel cellular oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1968244375,"Enhancers, or activators, dramatically increase the transcriptional activity of certain eukaryotic genes. A series of multiple point mutations affecting the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer-activator region were generated in order to define the nucleotide sequence required for this function. Three independent assays provided information leading to the identification of nucleotides essential for enhancer function. One class leads to a decrease in gene expression, while the second completely abolishes functional activity. One critical replacement appears to be the first G (guanine) in a sequence TGGAAAG (T, thymine, A, adenine) located in the 5' region of the 72 base-pair repeat of SV40. Comparison of this sequence with nucleotide sequences in other known enhancers leads to the identification of potential related core elements."
https://openalex.org/W2084818621,The oncogene (v-myb) of avian myeloblastosis virus and a large portion of its cellular homolog (c-myb) have been molecularly cloned and sequenced. The portion of c-myb we analyzed contains seven interspersed segments (or exons). Fusion of these exons creates a continuous nucleotide sequence that is remarkably similar to the sequence of v-myb and that potentially encodes a protein very similar to that specified by v-myb. Comparisons between the sequences of v-myb and c-myb indicate that transduction of c-myb to form v-myb probably resulted from an initial DNA rearrangement and the subsequent use of a spliced RNA as an intermediate.
https://openalex.org/W2045710759,"Escherichia coli deletion mutants lacking DNA topoisomerase I have been identified previously and shown to grow at a normal rate. We show that such strains grow normally only because of spontaneously arising mutations that compensate for the topoisomerase I defect. Several of these compensatory mutations have been found to map at or near the genes encoding DNA gyrase, gyrA and gyrB. DNA gyrase assays of crude extracts show that strains carrying the mutations have lower gyrase activity. Thus the mutations are in the gyrase structural genes or in nearby regulatory sequences. These results, in conjunction with DNA supercoiling measurements of others, indicate that in vivo DNA superhelicity is a result of a balance between topoisomerase I and gyrase activities. An excess of negative supercoils due to an absence of topoisomerase I is deleterious to the cell, but a moderate gyrase deficiency is not harmful."
https://openalex.org/W2035400738,"A double-stranded DNA cut has been observed in the mating type (MAT) locus of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in cultures undergoing homothallic cassette switching. Cutting is observed in exponentially growing cells of genotype HO HML alpha MAT alpha HMR alpha or HO HMLa MATa HMRa, which switch continuously, but not in a/alpha HO/HO diploid strains, in which homothallic switching is known to be shut off. Stationary phase cultures do not exhibit the cut. Although this site-specific cut occurs in a sequence (Z1) common to the silent HML and HMR cassettes and to MAT, only the Z1 sequence at the MAT locus is cut. The cut at MAT occurs in the absence of the HML and HMR donor cassettes, suggesting that cutting initiates the switching process. An assay for switching on hybrid plasmids containing mata- cassettes has been devised, and deletion mapping has shown that the cut site is required for efficient switching. Thus a double-stranded cut at the MAT locus appears to initiate cassette transposition-substitution and defines MAT as the recipient in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2047258951,Two adenovirus type 5 mutants were constructed to probe the function of the virus-encoded RNA polymerase III transcripts (VA RNAs). Each mutant fails to synthesize one of the two VA RNA species. The variant that does not produce the minor VAII species grows normally. The mutant that cannot synthesize the major VAI species grows more poorly than its parent. Analysis of the mutant's growth defect indicates that the adenovirus VAI RNA is required for efficient translation of viral mRNAs at late times after infection.
https://openalex.org/W2057203470,Bacterial chromosomes and plasmid (pBR322) DNA from topoisomerase I-defective Escherichia coli strains have been characterized with respect to superhelical density. The topoisomerase I defect results in increased negative superhelical density of both the bacterial chromosome and pBR322. Thus topoisomerase I is involved in determining the level of supercoiling in bacteria. Three of the topoisomerase I-defective strains were studied carry secondary mutations that decrease superhelical density; these additional mutations are closely linked to the gyrB locus in two of the strains and to the gyrA locus in the third strain.
https://openalex.org/W2089396478,"We have found that the transforming proteins of Rous sarcoma virus, Harvey sarcoma virus and Abelson virus all contain tightly bound lipid. This modification could play a role in the binding of these proteins to cellular membranes. The lipid associated with p60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, is located in the NH2-terminal domain of the polypeptide. This is the region of the protein that has been shown previously to participate in binding the protein to membranes. Two mature forms of p21, the transforming protein of Harvey sarcoma virus, contain lipid. Lipid is not, however, associated with newly synthesized p21. While mature p60src and p21 are bound to cellular membranes, the newly synthesized forms of these proteins are not. The posttranslational addition of lipid may therefore be the means by which these proteins acquire an affinity for membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1990946747,"DNA sequencing studies indicate that only one of two closely linked human embryonic α-like globin genes, zeta (ζ), encodes a functional polypeptide. The other is a pseudogene (ψζ) that differs by only 3 bp in the protein coding sequence, one of which converts the codon for amino acid 6 into a chain termination codon. Both ζ-globin genes differ from all other α-like genes thus far reported in that they contain large introns consisting, in part, of simple repeat sequences. Intron 1 of each gene contains a variation of the repeat sequence ACAGTGGGGAGGGG, while intron 2 contains the repeat sequence CGGGG. Comparison of the human ζ- and α-globin gene sequences reveals that the embryonic and adult α-like genes began to diverge from each other relatively early in vertebrate evolution (400 million years ago). In contrast, the β-like embryonic globin gene, epsilon (ϵ), is the product of a much more recent evolutionary event (200 million years ago). Thus, even though the temporal and quantitative expression of ζ- and ϵ-globin genes must be coordinately controlled during development, their evolutionary histories are clearly distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2060354164,"Mutants of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) were constructed by deleting large nucleotide segments in each of the viral oncogenes termed v-erbA and v-erbB. Mutants in erbA (erbA −B+) retained the ability to transform fibroblasts in vitro, and these cells exhibited most of the transformation characteristics that typify wild-type AEV-transformed fibroblasts. In addition, the mutants induced small erythroid colonies upon infection of bone marrow cells in culture. Chickens inoculated with erbA −B+ virus or with erbA −B+-transformed cells developed sarcomas or atypical erythroid leukemias. The erythroid cells transformed in vivo or in vitro by the erbA −B+ viruses appeared not to be as tightly blocked in differentiation as wild-type transformed cells. In contrast, fibroblasts infected with the erbA +B− mutant resembled normal cells in all transformation parameters tested, and no bone marrow cell transformation was observed with the mutant. The results indicate that the main transforming properties of AEV are encoded in erbB and that its effects are enhanced by erbA."
https://openalex.org/W2032410345,We have investigated the contact points of a positive transcription factor with the internal control region of the 5S ribosomal RNA genes of Xenopus. The methylation of any one of eight G residues clustered at the 3′ end of the internal control region on the noncoding strand of the DNA or the ethylation of their surrounding phosphates interferes with the binding of this protein. The importance of the 5′ half of the control region is shown by a binding affinity of the protein to oocyte 5S RNA genes that is one fourth that to somatic 5S RNA genes. This can be attributed to two base changes at residues 53 and 55 in the 5′ part of the control region. The different affinities of the transcription factor for the oocyte and somatic 5S RNA genes may contribute to their differential expression in somatic cells. The almost exclusive location of strong contact points on the noncoding strand of the gene suggests how transcription events could proceed repeatedly along a gene that is assembled into a stable transcription complex. It is proposed that the complex is transiently shifted to the noncoding strand as each round of RNA synthesis occurs from the coding strand.
https://openalex.org/W1974841001,"The number of transcripts of the cellular oncogene ras, which is homologous to the transforming gene of Harvey sarcoma virus, increases during liver regeneration in rats. The increase in these transcripts in liver polysomal polyadenylated RNA occurs at the time of activation of DNA synthesis during the regenerative process induced by partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride injury. The number of ras transcripts returns to basal levels within 72 hours. These observations show that transcription of a cellular oncogene increases in a regulated way in a nonneoplastic growth process."
https://openalex.org/W1964990343,"Transcriptional control signals occur at three separate locations upstream from the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene. I have used two approaches to examine how these signals function in relation to one another. First, double mutants that simultaneously mutate various pairs of transcriptional signals were constructed. Analyses of the transcriptional phenotypes of such mutants suggest that the two most distally located signals may function in the same metabolic step, whereas the proximal signal appears to function in a process distinct from that of the distal signals. Second, the distances that normally separate the three transcriptional signals were systematically altered. These condensation and expansion mutants were studied to determine to what extent the spatial relationship between the signals is important to their function. The transcriptional phenotypes of these spacing-change mutants show that the amount of DNA that separates the three transcriptional signals is not rigidly fixed."
https://openalex.org/W2046837990,"E26 and avian myeloblastosis virus are replication-defective avian retroviruses that contain the myb oncogene and cause leukemia in chickens with short periods of latency. Animals infected with E26 develop erythroleukemia and also contain low numbers of transformed myeloid cells, while avian myeloblastosis virus induces a purely myeloid leukemia. In both cases the type of leukemia induced is independent of the subgroup of the helper virus used. E26-transformed erythroid and myeloid cells can each be propagated selectively from explanted leukemic cells with media supplemented with factors that promote the growth either of normal chicken erythroid precursors or of myeloid progenitor cells. E26 also induces the outgrowth of transformed cells from bone marrow cells infected in vitro. These cells are also either erythroid or myeloid, depending on the culture conditions employed. Most of the erythroid cells transformed by E26 are erythroblast-like, but a significant number are more mature, including erythrocyte-like cells as well as some cells that appear to be aberrant in differentiation. Both erythroid and myeloid E26-transformed cells produce infectious virus and express P135 E26, the putative (gag-myb-x) transforming protein of the virus. Thus E26 is a virus that is capable of generating factor-dependent transformed cells in two different hematopoietic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2099122369,"The herpes simplex virus genome consists of two components, L and S, which invert relative to each other during viral replication. The a sequence is present at the genomic termini in direct orientation and at the L-S junction in inverted orientation. Previously, we showed that insertion of a fragment spanning the L-S junction into the viral genome causes additional inversions. In this study, we determine the nucleotide sequence of the genomic termini and show that insertion of either the free S terminus or the L terminus causes inversions in the viral genome. We conclude that the a sequence is the inversion-specific sequence, that linear unit-length molecules packaged in virions are generated by cleavage between adjacent copies of the a sequence, that cleavage produces 3′ single-base extensions on the genomic termini and that the signal for cleavage is contained within the a sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1968436729,"Mouse and human DNA used as in vitro-labeled ""high-complexity"" probes revealed hybridization between specific herpesvirus DNA fragments on Southern transfers and repetitive sequences present at 10(3) to 10(5) copies per mammalian cell genome. Several different sites of major cell-virus sequence homology have been detected in both the herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 genomes, and these are located predominantly within the L and S inverted repeat regions and near the center of the L unique region. The hybrids persisted even in relatively stringent conditions, and appear to correlate closely with some of the previously recognized regions of size heterogeneity in the viral genome. Cloned viral DNA fragments from each site hybridized to different sets of discrete bands and dispersed elements within restriction-endonuclease-digested genomic DNA from a variety of vertebrate species. Localized cell-virus homology was also detected in both the human Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2073810164,"The LEU2 structural gene and its regulatory sequences were isolated on a 2200 bp Xho I-Sal I fragment. Sequencing of the 5'-noncoding region showed that at -151 there is an open reading frame of 23 codons of which six are for leucine. The leucine codon usage in this reading frame follows exactly that of other yeast genes. At the carboxy-terminal end and immediately after the peptide reading frame, a 14 bp hairpin (followed by a T-rich segment) can form in the putative mRNA; this arrangement closely resembles an RNA polymerase terminator. These and other features suggest a model for regulation. Preceding this is a gene (which starts at -463) for tRNALeu3, the major tRNALeu isoacceptor. RNA polymerase III transcription start and termination signals flank 5' and 3' ends, respectively, of the structural gene. The features noted above are in the same DNA strand that codes for the LEU2 gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2165748041,"The restriction fragments carrying the region preceding the Escherichia coli crp structural gene were transcribed. The 5′ end of the crp mRNA was determined by RNAase partial digestion and S1 digestion methods. Thus the crp gene has been shown to possess a 167 bp leader. CRP-cAMP specifically prevents the crp transcription. In other words, the crp gene is regulated autogenously. DNAase foot-printing studies indicated that CRP-cAMP binds to the crp gene at positions +26 to +67. This region exhibits a striking sequence homology to the CRP-binding sites in other genes. CRP and RNA polymerase bind to the crp regulatory region simultaneously. These results suggest a different mechanism for transcriptional repression of the crp gene by CRP-cAMP from that of a typical operator-repressor model."
https://openalex.org/W2071958238,"To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which steroid hormones exert their regulatory function, we investigated the interaction of a glucocorticoid-receptor complex with purified DNA fragments from cloned mouse mammary tumor (MMTV) proviral DNA. With a DNA-cellulose binding assay, rat and mouse glucocorticoid receptors were found to interact with a high affinity site or sites in or near the promoter region of the MMTV proviral DNA. The assay allowed the use of unpurified as well as purified receptor, and therefore made it possible to investigate the binding properties of mutant receptors. Two nuclear-transfer-deficient receptors have a decreased affinity for specific as well as unspecific DNA, but are still capable of distinguishing between the two types of DNA. The existence of specific DNA binding sites for steroid-receptor complexes is discussed in the context of a general model of steroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W2066663508,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific ligands is mediated through clustering of receptor-ligand complexes in coated pits on the cell surface, followed by internalization of the complex into endocytic vesicles. We show that internalization of asialoglycoprotein by HepG2 hepatoma cells is accompanied by a rapid (t1/2 = 0.5-1 min) depletion of surface asialoglycoprotein receptors. This is followed by a rapid (t1/2 = 2-4 min) reappearance of surface receptors; most of these originate from endocytosed cell-surface receptors. The loss and reappearance of asialoglycoprotein receptors is specific, and depends on prebinding of ligand to its receptor. HepG2 cells also contain abundant receptors for both insulin and transferrin. Endocytosis of asialoglycoprotein and its receptor has no effect on the number of surface binding sites for transferrin or insulin. We conclude that binding of asialoglycoprotein to its surface receptor triggers a rapid and specific endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex, probably due to a clustering in clathrin-coated pits or vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1990775747,"To identify the initial steps of vesicular stomatitis virus transcription, we reconstituted purified nucleocapsid template with solubilized transcriptase and characterized the in vitro products of de novo transcription. In the absence of UTP and GTP, only leader gene products were synthesized; mRNA oligonucleotides were detected only after transcription of full-length leader was permitted. These data suggest that vesicular stomatitis virus polymerase does not enter the genome independently at each gene, but each polymerase begins transcription at the 3' end of the genome, and reaches internal genes only by sequentially transcribing the 3' preceding sequences. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the observed sequential transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus mRNAs is due to obligatory entrance of all polymerases at the leader gene, and suggest that the transcriptase and replicase may recognize the same promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2019428388,"Temperature-sensitive mutants in the N complementation group of human adenovirus type 5 are defective at the nonpermissive temperature for replication of virus DNA and for transformation of rat embryo cells. We show that nuclear extracts prepared from Ad5ts149-infected cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature fail to replicate DNA in vitro. The defect lies in the first step in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis, the formation of a covalent linkage between the terminal protein precursor (pTP) and dCMP. A 140 kilodalton (140 kd) protein which complements these defective extracts and contains DNA polymerase activity has been purified from HeLa cells infected with wild-type Ad2. It is tightly associated with the 80 kd pTP in a replication complex. Both of these proteins are products of the E2B region of the adenovirus genome, and the 140 kd protein coding sequences lie immediately downstream from those encoding the 80 kd protein. These results demonstrate that adenovirus encodes a novel DNA polymerase that is required for priming of DNA synthesis at the origin of replication. This protein may also function in the initiation of transformation of cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014581468,"The surface of rabies virus is composed of an approximately 60,000 dalton glycoprotein, in which most of the antigenic and immunogenic determinants of the virus reside. We have constructed plasmids for the direct expression in Escherichia coli of the mature full length rabies glycoprotein gene and also for the expression of a glycoprotein gene which has been truncated to exclude the coding region for a hydrophobic, possibly transmembrane, domain of the protein. Escherichia coli harboring the plasmids synthesize analog proteins which conform by several biochemical and antigenic criteria to rabies glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2085653300,"The susceptibility to repair of particular base mismatches by the hex system of Streptococcus pneumoniae was examined by comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type and eight mutant alleles of the malM gene. A detailed restriction map was constructed for pLS70, and the nucleotide sequence was determined for its 3475 bp chromosomal insert, which contains the entire malM gene (encoding amylomaltase), portions of malX and malP (encoding a membrane protein and a phosphorylase, respectively) and a control region. Transition mismatches were highly susceptible to repair; transversion mismatches, much less so. A mismatch caused by a single-nucleotide deletion was reparable, but mismatches with longer deletions were not. The hex system also reduced spontaneous reversion of mutations corresponding to transitions. It is suggested that recognition of donor or nascent DNA strands by the hex system depends on single-strand breaks in the target strand, and that the role of DNA methylation in mismatch repair of Escherichia coli can be accommodated to this model."
https://openalex.org/W2121391662,"Homology is an important feature of recombination. We have used the rll cistrons of bacteriophage T4 to determine the extent of homology required for recombination. We varied the amount of homologous DNA available for recombination in both marker rescue experiments and deletion-by-deletion crosses. Our results suggest that the primary pathway for recombination in T4 requires 50 bp of homology. Our finding that recombination is detectable when fewer than 50 bp of homology are available suggests that there is a second, less efficient pathway of recombination in T4. This pathway may be used during the formation of deletions."
https://openalex.org/W2056015403,"We have identified a lethal mutation in the D. melanogaster RNA polymerase II locus, RpIIC4, caused by insertion of a transposable element associated with the phenomenon of hybrid dysgenesis (P element). Using previously cloned P element sequences as a hybridization probe we have isolated a hybrid lambda phage clone carrying a 10 kb genomic DNA fragment containing a 1.3 kb P element insert and flanking sequences from the RpII locus. The non-P sequences in this clone (lambda DmRpII-1) hybridize to polytene chromosome band region 10C, the cytogenetic location of RpIIC4, and revertants which lose the lethal RNA polymerase II mutation also lose P element sequences from the locus. We have generated several additional P element insertions into the locus and shown that they can occur at two or more different sites. These experiments illustrate that mutagenesis by P element insertion and use of cloned P DNA to retrieve the DNA sequences into which insertion has occurred may be a general method for cloning genetically defined loci in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2125824729,The gene prlA codes for a factor that appears to function in the export of proteins in Escherichia coli. This conclusion is based on the finding that mutations altering the prlA gene product restore export of envelope proteins with defective signal sequences. Previous results showed that the prlA gene lies in an operon (spc) known to code for ten different ribosomal proteins. Our studies show that the prlA gene lies promoter-distal to the last known ribosomal protein gene in this operon. Evidence from gene fusions constructed in vitro suggests that prlA codes for a protein containing at least 300 amino acids. Thus a heretofore unidentified protein specified by a gene within the spc operon appears to be a component of the cellular protein export machinery.
https://openalex.org/W2034939386,"An enzyme system prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae carries out the replication of exogenous yeast plasmid DNA. Replication in vitro mimics that in vivo in that DNA synthesis in extracts of strain cdc8, a temperature-sensitive DNA replication mutant, is thermolabile relative to the wild-type, and in that aphidicolin inhibits replication in vitro. Furthermore, only plasmids containing a functional yeast replicator, ARS, initiate replication at a specific site in vitro. Analysis of replicative intermediates shows that plasmid YRp7, which contains the chromosomal replicator ARS1, initiates bidirectional replication in a 100 bp region within the sequence required for autonomous replication in vivo. Plasmids containing ARS2, another chromosomal replicator, and the ARS region of the endogenous yeast plasmid 2 microns circle give similar results, suggesting that ARS sequences are specific origins of chromosomal replication. Used in conjunction with deletion mapping, the in vitro system allows definition of the minimal sequences required for the initiation of replication."

https://openalex.org/W2124581290,"We have cloned and characterized members of a small multigene family that encodes late-stage histone H3 and H4 mRNAs from the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus. Unlike their highly repetitive histone gene counterparts, which are expressed at an earlier developmental stage, late H3 and H4 histone genes are not present in tandem repeats. In addition, the late stage H3 and H4 genes are not always tightly clustered together with the H1, H2A and H2B genes as they are in early histone genes. The spacer DNA that separates adjoining H3 and H4 coding regions is not conserved between nonallelic members of the late histone gene family. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a continuous 2100 bp segment of DNA including both H3 and H4 coding sequences, the entire spacer DNA separating the genes and surrounding nonhistone DNA. The late histone H3 and H4 genes encode proteins identical to their early gene counterparts; however, the 5' leader sequence is shorter in late genes and the codon usage is different."
https://openalex.org/W2028428589,"The functional expression of a novel gene in a genetically engineered plant has not yet been reported. One major barrier in movement toward this goal is our limited understanding of the molecular bases of gene expression. Attempts to establish genetic engineering as a practical facet of plant breeding are also complicated by the fact that genes for most important plant characteristics have not yet been identified. However, the benefits to be gained from all aspects of plant improvement are stimulating research into both the development of plant transformation technology and the isolation and characterization of genes responsible for valuable traits. As scientists develop greater knowledge of plant molecular genetics, we can expect to see practical applications in such diverse areas as improvement of plant nutritional quality, decreases in fertilization requirements, and increases in resistance to environmental stresses and pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1975509826,"We transferred a chicken lysozyme gene recombinant by microinjection into primary cultures of chicken oviduct cells. The recombinant gene is a fusion between the lysozyme promoter, including 1.4 kb of upstream sequences, and the coding region of the gene for SV40 T antigen (plys-T). The expression of plys-T is stimulated by the steroid hormones progesterone and dexamethasone, but not by estradiol. The number of oviduct cells expressing coinjected or separately injected control genes is not increased by steroids. A deletion mutant lacking the lysozyme sequences between -161 and +15 does not express T antigen, indicating that transcription of plys-T starts within the lysozyme promoter region. By screening different cell types we found that microinjected plys-T is expressed in chicken oviduct cells but not in chicken macrophages or fibroblasts or in rat II fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2020360827,"Mutant Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain A66 is shown to differ from its wild-type progenitor (strain A6) by a spontaneous 2.7 kb DNA insert into the T-DNA region of its Ti plasmid. Tobacco stems transformed by A66 exhibit an attenuated response characterized by slow growth and shoot proliferation. Clonal analysis demonstrates that this response is due to an alteration in the growth and regenerative potential of transformed cells, rather than to variation in the frequency of fully autonomous cells within the primary tumor. Cloned A66 transformed tobacco cells exhibit an auxin requirement for growth that can be overcome by shoot proliferation. Other host species, however, may complement the A66 mutation yielding fully auxin-independent tumors when transformed by this bacterium."

The product of the gene affected in this mutant appears to be necessary for the correct maturation of the mitochondrial pre-mRNA of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I. It does not affect, however, the overall splicing of cytochrome b pre-mRNA or the intron excision of the 21S ribosomal RNA precursor. This gene has been isolated by genetic complementation in yeast, and its DNA sequence has been determined. It is transcribed, as detected by S1 mapping experiments, and could encode a protein of 436 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1969347353,"The expression of the two nonallelic but highly homologous rat insulin genes (1 and 2) in a transplantable β-cell tumor is found to be 10-fold higher for rat1 insulin than rat2 insulin, while in normal pancreatic tissue there are approximately equal amounts of each protein. No large sequence rearrangements of the genes were apparent by restriction analysis of the tumor DNA, and both genes were found to be specifically hypomethylated in the tumor as compared with other nonpancreatic tissue. Equivalent amounts of both insulin 1 and 2 precursor transcripts, as well as stable, mature mRNAs were detected in the tumor. However, two-dimensional gel analysis of immunoprecipitated rat1 and rat2 preproinsulins synthesized in vitro revealed a 10:1 ratio of rat1 to rat2 proteins. A 1:1 ratio was obtained when the tumor mRNA was treated in vitro with vaccinia virus capping extract, suggesting a structural modification at the 5′ terminus of the rat2 mRNA. These results are discussed in the context of insulin regulation by glucose, shown to be due to translational control."
https://openalex.org/W2025329718,"Phage λ controls its integration and excision by differential catalysis of the forward and reverse reactions. The λ Int protein is required for both directions, but Xis for excision only. Previous electron microscopic observations have shown that Int protein forms a stable, condensed protein-DNA complex with the phage (attP) and prophage left (attL) substrate sites, but not with the host (attB) or prophage right (attR) sites. We have found that Int and Xis together produce a stable, condensed complex with attR. The attR complex involves the P region DNA to the left of the crossover point (O site). In contrast, the attP complex includes DNA on both sides of the crossover point (P and P′), and the attL structure involves the P′ DNA to the right of O. In the presence of Int and Xis, the attL and attR sites form a paired structure. We conclude that the role of Xis is to provide a distinct reactive structure at attR, allowing attL and attR to pair efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2140848403,"The genome of the highly oncogenic avian retrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T (REV-T) differs from that of the helper virus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A by a substitution (rel and a large deletion. Further deletions, constructed in vitro, within the helper-virus-related sequences of REV-T have little effect on the ability of the virus to transform chicken spleen cells in vitro. However, deletions that extend into rel abolish transformation. Substitution of helper-virus-related sequences for the deleted region in the non-rel portion of REV-T also abolishes transformation. Viruses with revertant phenotype were obtained both spontaneously and by construction in vitro from these substituted recombinants. The revertant viruses have various mutations, including deletions and insertions, in the helper-virus-related sequences. Thus the additional helper-virus-related sequences suppress expression of transformation in cis, and the deletion in REV-T seems necessary for expression of the transforming properties of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2079256662,"We have tagged the replication initiator protein of the plasmid R6K near the C-terminal end by fusion, in the correct reading frame, with the 89 amino acid long N-terminal alpha-donor polypeptide of beta-galactosidase of E. coli. This fusion was carried out with recombinant DNA methods. The protein chimera thus generated retained the activities of both initiation of DNA replication in vivo at the replication origin gamma of R6K and hydrolysis of beta-galactopyranoside when complemented in vivo with the alpha-acceptor polypeptide coded by the lac Z gene containing the M15 deletion. Using the simple and convenient assay for detecting beta-galactosidase, we have partially purified the tagged replication initiator, and have demonstrated that the protein binds to specific DNA sequences of the R6K chromosome. The protein bound to DNA sequences located at two places in the 5' untranslated leader region of the initiator protein cistron."
https://openalex.org/W2149344699,"Accurate and quantitative transcription of the tk gene requires sequence elements that reside within 110 nucleotides of 5'-flanking DNA. We have determined the boundaries of a hypersensitive region in 5'DNA flanking the tk gene by analyzing the relative sensitivity of specific restriction sites clustered in this region. Five different restriction enzymes, recognizing over 50 sites in the promoter region of the tk gene, each show a preferential cleavage in nuclei at a restricted number of sites residing between positions -4 and -182. Thus the tk promoter sequences are contained entirely within a hypersensitive region. Analysis of this site in tk+ transformants, a tk- mutant and tk+ rerevertant indicates that expression of tk RNA is correlated with structural alterations in the tk promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2083315136,"Salmonella possesses several flagella, each capable of counterclockwise and clockwise rotation. Counterclockwise rotation produces swimming, clockwise rotation produces tumbling. Switching between senses occurs stochastically. The rotational sense of individual flagella on a single cell could be monitored under special conditions (partially de-energized cells of cheC and cheZ mutants). Switching was totally asynchronous, indicating that the stochastic process operates at the level of the individual organelle. Coordinated rotation in the flagellar bundle during swimming may therefore derive simply from a high counterclockwise probability enhanced by mechanical interactions, and not from a synchronizing switch mechanism. Different flagella on a given cell had different switching probabilities, on a time scale (greater than 2 min) spanning many switching events. This heterogeneity may reflect permanent structural differences, or slow fluctuations in some regulatory process."

https://openalex.org/W2015897732,"We have analyzed actin mRNA sequences present in the terminal stages of the development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Four different actin mRNA sequences were detected in migrating pseudoplasmodia. Nucleotide sequence analysis of primer-extension products derived from the four mRNA sequences showed that they each encoded an actin protein with the same eight N-terminal amino acids and that they did not derive from transcription of any previously characterized actin gene. Preculmination pseudoplasmodia of Dictyostelium contain two distinct populations of committed cells, termed prespore and prestalk cells. We show that prestalk cells contain all four of the actin mRNA sequences found in pseudoplasmodia, while prespore cells contain only three of the sequences, and mature spores contain only two. Thus there is a differential loss of actin mRNA sequences during spore-cell differentiation in Dictyostelium."

https://openalex.org/W1985304059,"Injections of cyclic adenosine monophosphate into molluscan neurons often produce a transient membrane depolarization. By using the calcium indicator dye arsenazo III, it was found that cyclic nucleotide injections into neurons of Archidoris montereyensis resulted in elevation of internal calcium concentrations. However, this was demonstrated to be a secondary consequence of an induced increase in membrane sodium permeability, and not due to any direct effect of cyclic adenosine monophosphate on cellular calcium influx or internal calcium regulating processes."
https://openalex.org/W2005456143,"A subclass of cell-surface glycoproteins from embryonic chicken neural retina contains a high mannose-type oligosaccharide that terminates with glucose linked via a phosphodiester bond to penultimate mannose. This unusual oligosaccharide seems responsible for the glycoprotein attachments to the cell-surface baseplate ligatin. Using beta-32P-UDP-3H-glucose, we demonstrate in retinal homogenates the existence of a UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucose-1-phosphotransferase (GlcPTase) that catalyzes the synthesis of such a linkage. Characterization of the doubly labeled product resulting from activity of the transferase reveals a family of endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides displaying a cation-exchange profile similar to that of oligosaccharides derived from ligatin-associated proteins synthesized in vivo. Further analysis confirms that the incorporation of label is due to a terminal 3H-glucose joined via a 32P-phosphodiester linkage to carbon 6 of a penultimate mannose. We propose that GlcPTase may be a controlling enzyme for the targeting of certain newly synthesized proteins to the cell surface."
