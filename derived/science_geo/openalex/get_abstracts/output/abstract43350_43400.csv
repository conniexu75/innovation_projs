https://openalex.org/W1975642325,"We have investigated the early events of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. Time course experiments revealed the assembly, in two steps, of a large (50S) pre-mRNA splicing complex, preceded by formation of two other complexes that sediment at approximately 22S and 35S. Pre-mRNA and the intermediates and products of the in vitro splicing reaction cosediment with the 50S complex, while only pre-mRNA is associated with the 22S and 35S complexes. No splicing is observed in the absence of a 50S complex. Formation of the 50S complex requires ATP, whereas formation of the 22S and 35S complexes does not. U-snRNPs are necessary for assembly of the 35S and the 50S complexes but not for assembly of the 22S complex. Analysis with mutant substrate RNAs demonstrated that a polypyrimidine stretch near the 3' splice site and an intact 5' splice site are absolutely required for splicing complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1588018069,"A mixed micellar assay for protein kinase C was developed to investigate the specificity and stoichiometry of activation by phospholipids and diacylglycerols. Triton X-100 mixed micelles containing 8 mol % phosphatidylserine (PS) and 2.5 mol % sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (diC18:1) activated rat brain protein kinase C in the presence of Ca2+ to the same degree as sonicated PS/diC18:1 did in the standard assay. However, protein kinase C activity was more responsive to diC18:1 in the mixed micellar assay than the standard assay. At 8 mol % PS and 100 microM Ca2+, diC18:1 stimulated maximally at 1 mol %. At 2.5 mol % diC18:1 and 100 microM Ca2+, PS did not activate until 3 mol % and then did so cooperatively with maximal stimulation occurring at 6-8 mol %. Direct evidence for a Ca2+-, PS-, and diC18:1-dependent interaction of protein kinase C with mixed micelles was obtained by molecular sieve chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. These data permit inferences pertaining to the number of diC18:1 and PS molecules/micelle which are required for activation. For diC18:1, a single molecule may be sufficient but no more than 2 molecules are required. For PS, greater than 4 but less than 10 molecules are required. These data establish that a phospholipid bilayer is not required for protein kinase C activation and that activation of monomeric protein kinase C occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2125959590,"A multicomponent complex termed spliceosome (splicing body) is unique to the splicing of messenger RNA precursors in vitro. This 60S RNA-protein complex contains RNAs from the previously characterized bipartite splicing intermediate, the 5' exon RNA, and the lariat intervening sequence-3' exon RNA, as well as some intact 455 nucleotide precursor RNA. This complex contains snRNPs, particularly U1 RNP, as shown by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera. Formation of the 60S complex appears to be an early and essential step in splicing, because the 60S complex forms during the early stage, or lag time, of the reaction before the first covalent modification, cleavage at the 5' splice site of precursor RNA. The 60S complex forms only under conditions that permit splicing; both ATP and a precursor RNA containing authentic 5' and 3' splice sites are required for formation, while antiserum specific for U1 RNP inhibits its formation. RNA within the 60S complex, predominantly precursor RNA, was chased into products with accelerated kinetics and more complete conversion than purified precursor RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2085261165,"Rapid laser pulse-induced photolysis of an adenosine triphosphate precursor in muscle fibers abruptly initiated cycling of the cross-bridges. The accompanying changes in tension and stiffness were related to elementary mechanochemical events of the energy-transducing mechanism. When inorganic phosphate was present at millimolar concentrations during liberation of adenosine triphosphate in the absence of calcium, relaxation was accelerated. Steady active tension in the presence of calcium was decreased but the approach to final tension was more rapid. These results suggest that, during energy transduction, formation of the dominant force-generating cross-bridge state is coupled to release of inorganic phosphate in a reaction that is readily reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2052794916,"Vasopressin induces a concentration-dependent increase in atriopeptin immunoreactivity in plasma. Rat plasma, rat atrial extract, and synthetic atriopeptin III (APIII) produced parallel displacement curves of iodine-125-labeled APIII binding to specific antiserum. Fractionation of plasma atriopeptin immunoreactivity by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the major portion consists of two species of low molecular weight peptides in a ratio of 10 to 1. Both peaks exhibited potent vasorelaxant activity, suggesting the presence of the carboxyl terminal Phe-Arg sequence of atriopeptin in each species. Sequence determination of the purified peptides indicated that the major peptide is Ser-Leu-Arg-Arg-APIII and the minor peptide APIII. It appears that the former is the major species of atrial peptide in the rat circulation and that it is the product of selective cleavage of the high molecular weight precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1488817529,"A heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan is on the surface of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells apparently intercalated into their plasma membranes. Mild treatment of the cells with trypsin releases the GAG-bearing region (ectodomain) of this molecule as a discrete proteoglycan which is readily purified. At physiological pH and ionic strength, the ectodomain binds collagen types I, III, and V but not types II, IV, or denatured type I. The proteoglycan binds to a single class of high affinity saturable sites on type I collagen fibrils, sites which are selective for heparin-like glycosaminoglycans. The binding of NMuMG cells to type I collagen duplicates that of their cell surface proteoglycan; cells bind to native but not denatured collagen, and binding is inhibited by heparin but not by other glycosaminoglycans. These binding properties suggest that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans could act as receptors for interstitial collagens and mediate changes in cell behavior induced by collagenous matrices."
https://openalex.org/W1976613562,"A characteristic feature of infection by Staphylococcus aureus is bloodstream invasion and widespread metastatic abscess formation. The ability to extravasate, which entails crossing the vascular basement membrane, appears to be critical for the organism's pathogenicity. Extravasation by normal and neoplastic mammalian cells has been correlated with the presence of specific cell surface receptors for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. Similar laminin receptors were found in Staphylococcus aureus but not in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a noninvasive pathogen. There were about 100 binding sites per cell, with an apparent binding affinity of 2.9 nanomolar. The molecular weight of the receptor was 50,000 and pI was 4.2. Eukaryotic laminin receptors were visualized by means of the binding of S. aureus in the presence of laminin. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic invasive cells might utilize similar, if not identical, mechanisms for invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2015606306,"The gene for staphylococcal enterotoxin A (entA), in two wild-type strains, is carried by related temperate bacteriophages. Hybridization analysis of DNA from entA-converting phage PS42-D and its bacterial host suggests that this phage integrates into the bacterial chromosome by circularization and reciprocal crossover (the Campbell model) and that the entA gene is located near the phage attachment site. DNA from three of eight staphylococcal strains that did not produce enterotoxin A and seven wild-type enterotoxin A-producing (EntA+) strains had extensive homology to the entA-converting phage PS42-D DNA, although there was a high degree of restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. At least one EntA+ strain did not produce detectable viable phage after induction. These data indicate that a polymorphic family of Staphylococcus aureus phages (some of which may be defective) can carry the entA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2085338003,"Fractionation of a nuclear extract derived from Drosophila tissue culture cells reveals the presence of multiple components involved in accurate transcription of both distal and proximal promoters of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene. Transcription of deletion mutants indicates that a region between -24 and -85 upstream of the distal start site contains sequences required for RNA synthesis in vitro. Moreover, sequences that overlap this same upstream control region are specifically bound and protected from DNAase digestion by a promoter-specific transcription factor, Adf-1. Analysis of proximal promoter mutants identified multiple upstream elements that influence transcription, and DNAase footprint analysis detected three specific binding regions. Adf-1 binds at least one of these proximal promoter regions but interaction at this site is not specifically required for transcription. Our results suggest that multiple sequence-specific DNA binding proteins interact differentially with the proximal and distal promoters of Adh to activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1974269871,"The Gin function of bacteriophage Mu catalyzes inversion of the G DNA segment, thus switching the host range of Mu phage particles. This site-specific recombination event takes place between inverted repeat sequences (IR) that border the G segment. Sequences in the Mu beta region extending approximately from position 118 to 178 are essential for efficient inversion. In cis this region, termed sis, stimulates inversion about 15-fold. Neither the relative orientation of sis with respect to the IR sequences nor the distance to IR substantially influences the stimulatory effect. For full activity purified Gin protein must be supplemented with crude host factor from E. coli K12. We suggest that, in addition to Gin, a DNA-binding host protein is required for efficient G inversion."
https://openalex.org/W1482589873,"Sequential extractions of the basement membrane producing Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor yielded heparan sulfate proteoglycans with different size core proteins, but the same size heparan sulfate side chains. Saline, a nondenaturing solvent, extracted a small high density proteoglycan with a heterodisperse core protein of Mr = 95,000-130,000 whereas subsequent extraction with 7 M urea, a denaturing solvent, removed a large, low density proteoglycan with a Mr = 350,000-400,000 protein core. The denaturing conditions required for extraction of the large proteoglycan suggest that it interacts strongly with other basement membrane components. Antibodies to these proteoglycans cross-react with both proteoglycans, but the large proteoglycan has additional antigenic sites not present on the small proteoglycan. These proteoglycans may be derived from the same or similar gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1969376748,"Antibody responses to hapten-polypeptide conjugates require peptide-specific helper T cells. The latter can be primed in tissue culture by providing small numbers of dendritic cells. Primed, irradiated helper T cells then induce B-cell growth and differentiation in the apparent absence of dendritic cells. Both stages of the antibody response--the induction of helper T lymphoblasts by dendritic cells and the delivery of help from T to B cell--occur in discrete cell aggregates that can be isolated by velocity sedimentation. If helper T blasts revert to smaller ""memory"" lymphocytes, dendritic cells again are needed to initiate the antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W1998081080,"We studied the mechanism of recombination by determining the structure of the products of the phage lambda Int system. Electron microscopy of RecA-coated products revealed only knots and catenanes containing a regular right-handed spiral structure. The structure and distribution of products establish that the recombination sites pair by essentially random collision, rather than by tracking. However, the distribution also indicates that the binding of the enzyme must introduce nonrandom components into the reaction and stabilize at least two additional supercoils that become links in the product. Moreover, the regularity of the structures indicates that the strand exchange is accomplished in a very simple way, introducing only a single link into the product. All other links result from the direct conversion of substrate supercoils into knot and catenane links. These supercoils must be in a right-handed, braided form, rather than solenoidally wound as in nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1579927323,"The 75,000-dalton cell-binding domain of fibronectin (f75k) and synthetic peptides derived from its sequence have been used to examine the cell-surface fibronectin receptor. The spreading of baby hamster kidney fibrolasts on f75k-coated substrates and the direct binding of [3H]f75k to these cells were both competitively inhibited by a synthetic peptide of fibronectin with the sequence Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, indicating that the peptide and f75k interact with the same cell-surface sites. Related peptides, including the inverted sequence Ser-Asp-Gly-Arg, also competed for f75k binding. Our results provide the first evidence that fibroblastic baby hamster kidney cells recognize the same fibronectin amino acid sequence in direct binding of soluble ligand and in indirect inhibitory biological assays, thus correlating our direct fibronectin-receptor binding assay with biological functional assays for the fibronectin receptor in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1965817871,"Intragenic, second-site reversion has been used to identify amino acid substitutions that increase the affinity and specificity of the binding of lambda repressor to its operator sites. Purified repressors bearing the second-site substitutions bind operator DNA from 3 to 600 fold more strongly than wild type; these affinity changes result from both increased rates of operator association and decreased rates of operator dissociation. Three of the revertant substitutions occur in the alpha 2 and alpha 3 DNA binding helices of repressor and seem to increase affinity by introducing new salt-bridges or hydrogen bonds with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the operator site. The fourth substitution alters the alpha 5 dimerization helix of repressor and appears to increase operator affinity indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W1258498198,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) synthesized in cultures of rat embryo fibroblasts have been isolated and characterized. Cells grown in the presence of [35S]sulfate secreted a large amount of radiolabeled macromolecules into the culture medium of which only a small proportion was identified as HSPG. However, the majority of radiolabeled proteoglycans isolated from the cell layer were HSPGs. Here, two types of HSPG were detected. One type had an Mr of 5-8 X 10(5) as estimated by gel chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and lacked hydrophobic properties in that it showed no affinity for octyl-Sepharose and could not be inserted into liposomes. The other HSPG type had an estimated Mr of 3-5 X 10(5), was retained on octyl-Sepharose, and could be inserted into liposomes. In addition, the cells contained low molecular weight heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. Treatment of living cells with 0.2% Triton X-100, which retained stress fibers and extracellular matrix but solubilized cell membranes, released a proportion of the smaller HSPG together with the heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. The cytoskeleton-matrix residue remaining after detergent extraction of the cell contained the larger species of HSPG in addition to the smaller HSPG. The presence of the smaller hydrophobic HSPG in the detergent-treated cytoskeleton-matrix preparations suggests that it may form part of a transmembrane cytoskeleton-matrix linkage."
https://openalex.org/W7299164,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) affects hormone secretion and synthesis in GH4C1 cells, a clonal strain of rat pituitary cells. Recent evidence suggests that the intracellular mediators, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, which are generated as a result of TRH-induced hydrolysis of the polyphosphatidylinositols, may be responsible for some of the physiological events regulated by TRH. Because diacylglycerol is an activator of protein kinase C, we have examined a role for this enzyme in TRH action. The subcellular distribution of protein kinase C in control and TRH-treated cells was determined by measuring both enzyme activity and 12,13-[3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding in the cytosol and by measuring enzyme activity in the particulate fraction. Acute exposure of GH4C1 cells to TRH resulted in a decrease of cytosolic protein kinase C, and an increase in the level of the enzyme associated with the particulate fraction. The redistribution of protein kinase C induced by TRH was dose- and time-dependent, with maximal effects occurring within the first minute of TRH treatment. Analogs of TRH which do not bind to the TRH receptor did not induce redistribution of protein kinase C, while the active analog, methyl-TRH, did promote redistribution. Treatment of GH4C1 cells with phorbol myristate acetate also resulted in a shift in protein kinase C distribution, although the response was slower than that produced by TRH. TRH-induced redistribution of protein kinase C implies translocation of the enzyme from a soluble to a membrane-associated form. Because protein kinase C requires a lipid environment for activity, association with the membrane fraction of the cell suggests activation of the enzyme; thus, protein kinase C may play a role in some of the actions of TRH on GH4C1 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1556584428,"The precursor protein of a basement membrane specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan has been identified as a 400,000 Mr polypeptide. Antibodies against large and small forms of this proteoglycan, isolated from a basement membrane (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm, EHS) tumor, immunoprecipitated the same 400,000 protein from pulse-labeled EHS cells. The proteoglycan precursor protein was not recognized by antibodies against other basement membrane components or by antibodies to the cartilage proteoglycan. Furthermore, heparan sulfate proteoglycan purified from the EHS tumor blocked the immunoprecipitation of the precursor protein. Pulse-chase studies with [35S]methionine showed the precursor protein was converted to a proteoglycan. Pulse-chase studies with 35SO4 showed the large, low density proteoglycan appeared first and was degraded to a smaller, high density proteoglycan. We propose that the precursor protein is used after very little or no modification in the assembly of a large, low density heparan sulfate proteoglycan and that a portion of the population of these macromolecules are subsequently degraded to a smaller form."
https://openalex.org/W1554245862,"Glycogenosis type II is an inherited lysosomal storage disease with acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency as the primary defect. Using cultured skin fibroblasts, we have studied the biosynthesis of acid alpha-glucosidase in clinically different forms of this disease. Three unrelated patients were identified (one with an infantile, one with a juvenile, and one with an adult form of the disease) producing normal quantities of the 110-kDa precursor form of acid alpha-glucosidase. However, post-translational modification to mature 76-kDa enzyme protein was either completely deficient or extremely inefficient. No abnormalities were observed in glycosylation of the mutant precursors, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]mannose, but phosphorylation was only detectable for the precursor synthesized by fibroblasts from the juvenile patient. In three other patients (one with a juvenile and two with adult forms of glycogenosis type II) apparently reduced synthesis of precursor protein was observed, but the processing to mature enzyme seemed to be undisturbed. Finally, neither precursor nor mature forms of acid alpha-glucosidase were detectable in one particular case of infantile glycogenosis type II. The studies reveal an unexpected degree of genetic heterogeneity in this disease and identify various mutants which could be of importance to further elucidate the biosynthetic events during lysosomal enzyme formation."
https://openalex.org/W1579578540,"Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB were found to have molecular weights of 159,000 and 150,000 and Stokes radii of 6.2 and 5.9 nm, respectively. Both enzymes have frictional ratios of 1.7. Myosin IA consists of 22% alpha-helix, 32% beta-structure, and 46% unordered structure, while myosin IB is 16% alpha-helix, 46% beta-structure, and 38% unordered. Both myosins remain monomolecular under conditions in which other myosins form filaments. Beads coated with myosin IA or IB move unidirectionally on actin cables of Nitella. Movement requires ATP and phosphorylation of the myosin I heavy chain which is also required for actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. Movement is inhibited by myosin I antiserum that inhibits actin-activated ATPase activity. These studies establish that these nonfilamentous, monomolecular myosins with single heavy chains of 130,000 and 125,000 daltons (IA and IB, respectively) can support actin-dependent movement analogous to that supported by filamentous myosins."
https://openalex.org/W1838061312,The Ca2+ ATPase of heart sarcolemma was stimulated by the exposure of sarcolemma vesicles to ATP and the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effect of the phosphorylation system was primarily on the Km(Ca2+) of the pumping ATPase. The ATPase purified from heart sarcolemma or erythrocytes became phosphorylated under the conditions mentioned above. Hydroxylamine treatment of the labeled ATPase has shown that the phosphorylation was additive to be acylphosphate formed on the ATPase during the reaction cycle. The stoichiometry of the kinase-promoted phosphorylation (i.e. the fraction of the ATPase molecules that became labeled) approached 30% with both the heart and the erythrocyte enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1483460411,"Calcium is required for effective fibrin polymerization. The high affinity Ca2+ binding capacity of fibrinogen was directly localized to the gamma-chain by autoradiography of nitrocellulose membrane blots of fibrinogen subunits incubated with 45Ca2+. Terbium (Tb3+) competitively inhibited 45Ca2+ binding to fibrinogen during equilibrium dialysis, accelerated fibrin polymerization, and limited fibrinogen fragment D digestion by plasmin. The intrinsic fluorescence of Ca2+-depleted fibrinogen was maximally enhanced by Ca2+ and Tb3+, but not by Mg2+, at about 3 mol of cation/mol of fibrinogen. Protein-bound Tb3+ fluorescence at 545 nm was maximally enhanced by resonance energy transfer from tryptophan (excitation at 290 nm) at about 2 mol of Tb3+mol of fibrinogen and about 1 mol of Tb3+/mol of plasmic fragment D94 (Mr 94,000). Fibrinogen fragments D78 (Mr 78,000) and E did not show effective enhancement of Tb3+ fluorescence, suggesting that the Ca2+ site is located within gamma 303 to gamma 411, the peptide which is absent in fragment D78 but present in D94. When CNBr fragments of the carboxyamidated gamma-subunit were assayed for enhancement of Tb3+ fluorescence, peptide CBi (gamma 311-336) bound 1 mol of Tb3+/mol of CBi. Thus, the Ca2+ site is located within this peptide. The sequence between gamma 315 and gamma 329 is homologous to the calmodulin and parvalbumin Ca2+ binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1509088285,"Ternary complex formation of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and plasminogen (Plg) with thrombospondin (TSP) or histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) has been demonstrated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, an affinity bead assay, and a rocket immunoelectrophoresis assay. The formation of these complexes was specific, concentration dependent, saturable, lysine binding site-dependent, and inhibitable by fluid phase plasminogen. Apparent Kd values were approximately 12-36 nM for the interaction of TPA with TSP-Plg complexes and 15-31 nM with HRGP-Plg complexes. At saturation the relative molar stoichiometry of Plg:TPA was 3:1 within the TSP-containing complexes and 1:1 within HRGP-containing complexes. The activation of Plg to plasmin by TPA on TSP- and HRGP-coated surfaces was studied using a synthetic fluorometric plasmin substrate (D-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin). Kinetic analysis demonstrated a marked increase in the affinity of TPA for plasminogen in the presence of surface-associated TSP or HRGP. Compared to fluid phase activation or activation on fibronectin- or Factor VIII-related antigen-coated surfaces there was a 35-fold increase in efficiency of plasmin generation. A substantial amount (up to 71%) of the plasmin formed remained surface-associated and was found to be protected from inhibition by alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Greater than 200-fold increase in inhibitor concentration was required to effect 50% inhibition. Complex formation of locally released tissue plasminogen activator with Plg immobilized on TSP or HRGP surfaces may thus play an important role in effecting proteolytic events in nonfibrin-containing microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2024399865,"The addition to mixed-leukocyte reactions of monoclonal antibodies to interferon-γ abrogated alloantigen recognition and induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by inducing early and highly effective suppressor T lymphocytes. This inhibitory activity was not confined to in vitro models, since daily injection of the antibodies into CBA/J mice blocked the usual rejection of allogenic tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1492900516,"We have used phorbol esters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), to study the actions of protein kinase C (a TPA receptor) on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations [( Ca2+]i) and hormone secretion in rat pituitary cells (GH cells), and to elucidate the role of diacylglycerol (a protein kinase C activator) in thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) action. TPA had a dual action on [Ca2+]i, inducing a stimulatory phase from 300 (basal) to 420 nM, which was interrupted in 30-60 s by an inhibitory phase which transiently lowered [Ca2+]i to 240 nM and rose in 3-10 min to yield the stimulatory phase. TPA-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i were induced by other phorbol esters and mezerein but not by phorbol or activators of kinases different from protein kinase C. Both phases of TPA action on [Ca2+]i were abolished by 5-min pretreatment with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (1.33 mM) or Ca2+ channel antagonists (verapamil or nifedipine). TPA also enhanced the rate of sustained hormone secretion without inducing a burst of hormone release (unlike TRH). Also, stimulation of secretion by TPA was not inhibited by Ca2+ channel antagonists and was resistant (10%) to EGTA. Simultaneous addition of TPA with the ionophore ionomycin (100 nM) reconstituted a TRH-like spike, nadir and plateau of [Ca2+]i. Ionomycin generated the spike in [Ca2+]i by releasing TRH-sensitive Ca2+ stores, while TPA induced the nadir (inhibitory phase), and a nifedipine/verapamil-sensitive plateau of [Ca2+]i (stimulatory phase). Concurrent (but not separate) addition of ionomycin and TPA also reconstituted a TRH-like burst of hormone secretion. These and previous results indicate that activation of protein kinase C by TPA or diacylglycerol (which is elevated by TRH) and a simultaneous spike in [Ca2+]i are required for burst secretion. Diacylglycerol may also mediate the TRH-induced nadir and plateau of [Ca2+]i; the latter process contributes to Ca2+-dependent stimulation of steady secretion by TRH."
https://openalex.org/W1564957024,"An intracellular (ATP + Mg2+)-dependent Ca2+ pumping mechanism has been identified and characterized within the cultured clonal neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115. Using cell suspensions treated with 0.005% saponin which selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane in 95-98% of the cells, it was possible to show clearly that the intracellular Ca2+ pump mechanism is of non-plasma membrane origin and therefore can be compared directly with the Ca2+ pump characterized in detail in synaptosomal membrane vesicles (Gill, D. L., Grollman, E. F., and Kohn, L. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 184-192; Gill, D. L., Chueh, S. H., and Whitlow, C. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10807-10813) which was proven by flux reversal studies to be derived from the neural plasma membrane (Gill, D. L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10986-10990). The intracellular Ca2+ pump in N1E-115 cells is distinct from mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and is increased up to 8-fold higher as cells reach confluency. In similarity to the neural plasma membrane pump, the intracellular Ca2+ pump within N1E-115 cells has high affinity for Ca2+ (Km = 0.28 microM), is dependent on both ATP (Km = 26 microM) and either Mg2+ or Mn2+ which half-maximally activate Ca2+ pumping at 0.35 mM and 0.32 mM, respectively, and shows similar specificity for Sr2+ and Ba2+ which half-maximally inhibit Ca2+ transport at 50 microM and 1.5 mM, respectively. In contrast to the neural plasma membrane pump, the intracellular Ca2+ pump displays approximately 40-fold higher sensitivity to La3+ (IC50 = 5 microM) and an apparent 400-fold lower sensitivity to VO4(3-) (IC50 = 185 microM), although the inhibitory effectiveness of VO4(3-) is increased 37-fold by a 15-min preincubation of the permeabilized cells with VO4(3-) in the absence of ATP (apparent IC50 = 5 microM). In further contrast to the neural plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, the intracellular pump within N1E-115 cells is stimulated more than 20-fold by oxalate (giving prolonged linear Ca2+ accumulation), is resistant to low saponin concentrations, and is not modified by calmodulin even after extensive treatment with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and/or calmodulin antagonist drugs. However, calmidazolium is effective in inhibiting the intracellular Ca2+ pump with an IC50 of approximately 2 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1500480452,"Incubation with a high concentration of a mating pheromone, alpha factor, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae induced the accumulation of Ca2+ ion in MATa cells, but not in MAT alpha or MATa/alpha cells, after a lag of 30-40 min. The alpha factor did not cause a nonspecific lesion of the membrane barrier, but induced Ca2+ transport activity specifically. This induction of Ca2+ transport activity correlated with formation of a projection on the cells, or with localized cell elongation, but not with G1 arrest or agglutinin induction. The increased Ca2+ transport activity was maintained only in the continuous presence of a high concentration of alpha factor and de novo protein synthesis. Kinetic studies of induction of Ca2+ transport by alpha factor and effects of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, on mating suggested an essential role of this physiological reaction in the initiation of sexual conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W2144492301,"We have used transcriptional activity assays and DNase I footprinting techniques to examine in vitro the binding of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and lambda repressor protein to the bacteriophage lambda rightward promoter-operator region. For the lambda PR promoter, the activity and physical binding results determined at several repressor concentrations correlated very well. Good agreement was also found for repression of PRM, which occurred at higher repressor concentrations; however, our results indicate that at low repressor concentrations, RNA polymerase can physically occupy PRM in a transcriptionally inactive form. These inactive formed with a binding constant similar to that previously measured for closed complexes at PRM. A kinetic study of PR open complex formation on an OR2-template in the presence of lambda repressor showed that decreased initiation frequency from this promoter was due largely to a decrease in KB. The kinetically determined inhibition constant for repressor (Ki = 4 nM) was similar to the dissociation constant (Kd approximately 2 nM) determined from the footprinting studies."
https://openalex.org/W1502617093,"Phosphofructokinase from rat heart perfused with epinephrine was purified to homogeneity and various allosteric properties were determined under conditions which approximate physiological concentrations of the substrates, effectors, and pH. The molecular weights of the protomer of the enzyme isolated from the hormone-stimulated and the control hearts are both approximately 83,000. The epinephrine-stimulated and the control enzymes contain 1.1 and 0.66 mol of phosphate/mol of protomer, respectively. Both enzymes can be fully phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase indicating that the phosphorylation site is new and distinct from the known phosphorylation site of skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase. Pure phosphofructokinase isolated from the epinephrine-stimulated heart is significantly less sensitive to inhibition by ATP and citrate, and the K0.5 values for Fru-6-P (0.18 mM) and Fru-2,6-P2 (3 microM) are one-half those for the enzyme from control hearts. In the presence of in vivo concentrations of ATP, citrate, and Fru-6-P at pH 7.1, both enzymes are inactive in the absence of Fru-2,6-P2. Moreover, the K0.5 values for Fru-2,6-P2 of the hormone-stimulated and untreated enzymes are 3 and 6 microM, respectively. These differences in the allosteric properties of phosphofructokinases from the hormone-treated and the control hearts disappear when the enzymes are dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase. Determination of the glycolytic intermediates showed a 2-fold increase in Fru-6-P, Fru-2,6-P2, and AMP and 13-fold increase in Fru-1,6-P2. Partially purified Fru-6-P,2-kinase from epinephrine-stimulated and control hearts show KFru-6-P0.5 = 4 and 15 microM, respectively. These results indicate that rat heart phosphofructokinase in vivo requires Fru-2,6-P2 for its activity. Epinephrine stimulates phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase which results in a more active form. The hormone also increases Fru-2,6-P2 which appears to be the result of an activation of Fru-6-P,2-kinase by a covalent modification."
https://openalex.org/W1557208861,"The biosynthesis, proteolytic processing, and transport of lysosomal acid phosphatase in normal and I-cell human skin fibroblasts was studied by metabolic labeling of the cells and isolation of acid phosphatase by immunoprecipitation. Several forms of the enzyme were identified in pulse-chase experiments. The largest precursor form had a Mr of 110,000. It was accompanied by several smaller polypeptides (Mr = 84,000-62,000), which were localized to light membranes containing the markers of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. These polypeptides were further processed to mature forms with apparent Mr of 57,000, 48,000, and 43,000 that accumulated in the cells and were associated with dense lysosomes. Less than 10% of newly synthesized acid phosphatase was secreted mainly as Mr = 112,000 and 74,000 forms. The processing of acid phosphatase was inhibited by NH4Cl and by a peptidyldiazomethyl ketone inhibitor of cysteine proteinases. The intracellular Mr = 110,000, 57,000, and 48,000 and the secreted Mr = 112,000 and 64,000 forms contained phosphorylated oligosaccharides cleavable by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Transport of acid phosphatase into lysosomes was sensitive to NH4Cl and dependent on mannose 6-phosphate specific receptors by the following criteria: (i) inhibition of endocytosis of acid phosphatase by mannose 6-phosphate, (ii) enhancement of the secretion of acid phosphatase in the presence of antibodies to the mannose 6-phosphatase specific receptor, and (iii) secretion of about two-thirds of newly synthesized acid phosphatase in I-cell fibroblasts. Obviously, the mechanism of transport of acid phosphatase into lysosomes is indistinguishable from that operating for other lysosomal enzymes in fibroblasts. In contrast to other lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase appears to be subjected to an early proteolytic processing, presumably within the endoplasmic reticulum, which results in secretion of several processed forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1497976286,"Fructose-2,6-P2 and fructose-1,6-P2 are strong activators of muscle phosphofructokinase. They have been shown to be competitive in binding studies, and it is generally thought that they affect the physical and catalytic properties of the enzyme in the same manner. However, there are indications in published data that the effects of the two fructose bisphosphates on phosphofructokinase are not identical. To examine this possibility, the kinetics of activation of rat skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase by the two fructose bisphosphates were compared in the presence of other regulatory metabolites. Citrate greatly increased the K0.5 of the enzyme for fructose-2,6-P2, with little effect on the maximum activation. In contrast, citrate greatly decreased the maximum activation by fructose-1,6-P2, with only a small effect on the K0.5. Changes in the concentrations of the inhibitor ATP or the activator AMP similarly altered the K0.5 for fructose-2,6-P2, but altered the maximum activation by fructose-1,6-P2. Finally, when fructose-1,6-P2 was added in the presence of a given concentration of fructose-2,6-P2, phosphofructokinase activity was decreased if the activation by fructose-2,6-P2 alone was greater than the maximum activation by fructose-1,6-P2 alone. These results are consistent with competition of the two fructose bisphosphates for the same binding site, but indicate that the conformational changes produced by their binding are different."
https://openalex.org/W1564509901,"An intracellular heparan sulfate oligosaccharide has been identified in rat hepatocytes cultured in the presence of [35S]sulfate. Pulse-chase experiments suggest that [35S]sulfate is first incorporated into heparan sulfate proteoglycans which are subsequently converted to the low molecular weight component. The oligosaccharide (Mr 7000) contains little or no protein and is also present in rat liver homogenates. Subcellular fractionation and density gradient centrifugation in Percoll of liver homogenates demonstrated that the oligosaccharide was present in lysosomes or in particles of similar distribution and buoyant density. Structural analysis of oligosaccharides isolated from a rat liver lysosomal fraction indicate that glucuronic acid is present in the reducing end of the oligosaccharide and that this residue is preferentially linked to an N-acetylated glucosamine unit. These data suggest that the heparan sulfate oligosaccharide is generated through the action of a heparan sulfate-degrading endoglucuronidase previously found in human platelets and rat liver (Oldberg, A., Heldin, C.-H., Wasteson, A., Busch, C., and Hook, M. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5755-5762)."
https://openalex.org/W10933997,"Phosphofructokinase is known to associate with the human erythrocyte membrane both in vitro and in vivo. Such association activates the enzyme in vitro by relieving the allosteric inhibition imposed by ATP (Karadsheh, N.S., and Uyeda, K. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7418-7420). We now demonstrate that ADP, ATP, and NADH, all of which are known to bind to the enzyme's adenine nucleotide activation site, are particularly potent in eluting the enzyme from the membrane. In addition, both inside-out red cell membrane vesicles and a 23-kDa fragment containing the amino terminus of the membrane protein, band 3, cause a slow, partial, and reversible inactivation of phosphofructokinase. The dependence of the residual phosphofructokinase activity on phosphofructokinase concentration demonstrates that inactivation occurs through the dissociation of active tetramers to inactive dimers. Dimers of phosphofructokinase associate with the membrane more avidly than tetramers. The kinetics of phosphofructokinase inactivation are consistent with the dissociation of tetramers in solution followed by the binding of dimers to the membrane. There is no indication of an association equilibrium between tetramers and dimers of phosphofructokinase bound to the membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that the amino-terminal segment of band 3 binds to the adenine nucleotide activation site, which is thought to be located in a cleft between the dimeric subunits of phosphofructokinase. As a result, band 3 not only rapidly activates the phosphofructokinase tetramer but also slowly inactivates the enzyme by preferentially binding its dissociated subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1608800757,"Detailed kinetic and equilibrium studies of the binding of two radiolabeled 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists to putative calcium channels in rat brain membranes were performed. (+/-)-[3H]Nitrendipine, a racemic ligand, and (+)-[3H]isopropyl 4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1, 4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-methoxycarbonylpyridine-3-carboxylate (PN200-110), a pure isomer, were used and their binding properties were quantitated and compared. Analysis of equilibrium binding revealed a single high affinity component for each radioligand with the same density of binding sites for both ligands. Association rates were determined over a 60-fold range of concentration of each radioligand. For both radioligands, the pseudo-first order association time courses were biphasic with the rate of the faster component dependent on radioligand concentration and the rate of the slower component independent of both the structure of the radioligand and the concentration of the radioligand. Dissociation rates were determined after various times of association. The dissociation of the optically pure radioligand, (+)-[3H]PN200-110, was monophasic at all association times, consistent with a single bound species being present throughout association. However, (+/-)-[3H]nitrendipine dissociation was biphasic after short association times (1-10 min). The biphasic dissociation observed with (+/-)-[3H]nitrendipine is consistent with the two optical isomers binding with approximately the same association rate but having different dissociation rates. These results appear to reflect the existence of two interconvertible binding states of the putative calcium channel in the membrane, one which binds the radioligands with high affinity in a simple bimolecular reaction and one which has no detectable affinity for the ligands. This mechanism of isomerization before ligand binding has been modeled by numerical solution of the differential equations of the scheme providing estimates of the rate constants for each reaction in the scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2063823607,"A specific label for voltage-dependent calcium channels is essential for the isolation and purification of the membrane protein that constitutes the calcium channel and for a better understanding of its function. A fraction of Crotalus atrox that increases voltage-dependent calcium currents in single, dispersed guinea pig ventricular cells was isolated. In the doses used, neither sodium nor potassium currents were changed. The fraction was active in the absence of detectable phospholipase or protease activity, and the active component, designated atrotoxin, produced its effect rapidly and reversibly. The effect was produced by extracellular but not intracellular application of the agent. The increase in Ca2+ current was blocked by the Ca2+ channel blockers cobalt and nitrendipine. The active fraction completely blocked specific [3H]nitrendipine binding to guinea pig ventricular membrane preparations. The inhibition of nitrendipine binding by atrotoxin was apparently via an allosteric mechanism. Thus atrotoxin was shown to bind to the Ca2+ channel and to act as a specific Ca2+ channel agonist."
https://openalex.org/W168619308,"The role of the intracellular thiol glutathione in the reductive activation of neocarzinostatin was investigated in Chinese hamster V79 cells. The cells were pretreated with agents that either lower (buthionine sulfoximine or diethyl maleate) or elevate (oxothiazolidine carboxylate) intracellular glutathione levels. These cells were then exposed to 1-5 micrograms/ml neocarzinostatin for 1 h and assayed for survival. Depletion of glutathione to levels at or below the limit of detection resulted in a marked reduction in neocarzinostatin cytotoxicity, while increasing glutathione levels to 250% of control values had little or no effect on neocarzinostatin toxicity. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of cysteine in untreated and glutathione-depleted cells showed cysteine levels lower than 0.2 microM, indicating that cysteine does not play a major role in the reductive activation of neocarzinostatin in untreated or glutathione-depleted cells. When intracellular cysteine levels were artificially elevated by oxothiazolidine carboxylate treatment of glutathione-depleted cells, neocarzinostatin toxicity was about two-thirds that seen in cells with normal glutathione levels. In cell-free systems, others have shown that reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol are necessary for the activation of neocarzinostatin to a species that will cleave DNA. In this study, we have identified glutathione as the major cellular reducing agent for the activation of neocarzinostatin in a mammalian cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1525035492,"Rho protein is responsible for termination of transcription of the cro gene of bacteriophage lambda. Since rho is known to interact with the RNA whose synthesis is being terminated, we measured the specificity and strength of binding of rho to isolated cro transcripts, using a nitrocellulose filter retention assay. The association constant (K alpha) for the binding of rho to a 372-nucleotide cro transcript was determined to be 7 +/- 2 X 10(8) M-1 at 37 degrees C and about 20-fold less at 4 degrees C. Although NTP cleavage is required for rho activity, the presence of ATP did not alter the K alpha. Rho bound less tightly (K alpha less than 10(8) M-1) to partial cro transcripts smaller than 290 nucleotides and had very little affinity (K alpha less than 10(6) M-1) for lambda 4 S RNA, lambda 6 S RNA, and partial cro transcripts smaller than 160 nucleotides. In contrast, cro transcripts as short as 100 nucleotides bound if guanosine residues were replaced with inosine. In addition, rho bound readily to 3' fragments of cro RNA that had 85 or more residues. A common feature of the RNA molecules that bind tightly to rho protein is that they have a stretch of at least 85 nucleotides with relatively few (less than 14%) guanosine residues. Such a segment is thus likely to be largely single-stranded. These results suggest that the binding of rho to lambda cro mRNA is dependent on a 3' terminal segment that has those properties."

In contrast to others (Vanderhoek, J., and Bailey, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6752-6756), we report that increased 15-HETE formation was not uniquely attributable to 5 mM ibuprofen, and it did not originate from enzymatic activation. For instance, ibuprofen (1-5 mM) did not affect the isolated 15-lipoxygenase enzyme in the 100,000 X g supernatant from neutrophil lysates, and dose-dependent increases in 15-HETE biosynthesis, proportional to lactate dehydrogenase release, were evident with benoxaprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, or etodolac. At similar supratherapeutic concentrations (1-5 mM), aspirin and phenylbutazone did not influence lactate dehydrogenase release or 15-HETE production. In further contrast, neutrophils did not tolerate 1-5 mM ibuprofen. Biochemical, morphological, flow cytometric, and fluorochromatic analyses each indicated cytological damage. A correlation between lactate dehydrogenase release and increased 15-HETE formation was a dose-dependent property also exhibited by arachidonic acid alone (10-100 microM). We conclude that cytological damage, facilitating access of arachidonic acid to 15-lipoxygenase in a cytosolic compartment, accounts for this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1514574411,"The calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha-primase complex purified by immunoaffinity chromatography catalyzes the synthesis of RNA initiators on phi X174 single-stranded viral DNA that are efficiently elongated by the DNA polymerase. Trace amounts of ATP and GTP are incorporated into products that are full length double-stranded circular DNAs. When synthetic polydeoxynucleotides are used as templates, initiation and DNA synthesis occurs with both poly(dT) and poly(dC), but neither initiation nor DNA synthesis was observed with poly(dA) and poly(dI) templates. Nitrocellulose filter binding and sucrose gradient centrifugation studies show that the DNA polymerase-primase complex binds to deoxypyrimidine polymers, but not to deoxypurine polymers. Using d(pA)-50 with 3'-oligo(dC) tails and d(pI)-50 with 3'-oligo(dT) tails, initiator synthesis and incorporation of deoxynucleotide can be demonstrated when the average pyrimidine sequence lengths are 8 and 4, respectively. These results suggest that purine polydeoxynucleotides are used as templates by the DNA polymerase only after initiation has occurred on the oligodeoxypyrimidine sequence and that the pyrimidine stretch required by the primase activity is relatively short. Analysis of initiator chain length with poly(dC) as template showed a series of oligo(G) initiators of 19-27 nucleotides in the absence of dGTP, and 5-13 nucleotides in the presence of dGTP. The chain length of initiators synthesized by the complex when poly(dT) or oligodeoxythymidylate-tailed poly(dI) was used can be as short as a dinucleotide. Analysis of the products of replication of oligo(dC)-tailed poly(dA) shows that initiator with chain length as low as 4 can be used for initiation by the polymerase-primase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1492724133,"Like other vertebrate nonmuscle myosins, thymus myosin contains two phosphorylatable light chains. Phosphorylation of these light chains regulates the actin-activated ATPase of this myosin. The time courses for the phosphorylation of both monomeric and filamentous thymus myosin by gizzard myosin light chain kinase fitted single exponentials to greater than 85% phosphorylation. This indicates that the two heads of thymus myosin are phosphorylated at the same rate and suggests that these phosphorylations are random processes. The actin-activated ATPases of thymus myosins with different levels of light chain phosphorylation were also determined. A linear relationship was obtained between the extent of light chain phosphorylation and stimulation of the actin-activated ATPase. Since thymus myosin appears to be phosphorylated randomly, this linear relationship indicates that phosphorylation of one head of thymus myosin stimulates the actin-activated ATPase of that head independently of the phosphorylation of the second head. The apparent random phosphorylation of thymus myosin light chains contrasts with the reported ordered phosphorylation of the light chains of filamentous smooth (gizzard) muscle myosin. Also, while the actin-activated ATPases of the two heads of thymus myosin are regulated independently, both heads of gizzard myosin must be phosphorylated before the ATPase of either head is activated by actin."

D., and Sugino, A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 7261-7265). Most of this DNA primase activity was separated from DNA polymerase activity, although a small amount remained associated with DNA polymerase I. The primase, active as a monomer, has a molecular weight of about 60,000. The primase synthesizes oligoribonucleotides of discrete size, mainly eight or nine nucleotides, in the presence of single-stranded template DNA and ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates; it utilizes deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates as substrate with 10-fold lower efficiency. Product size, chromatographic properties, alpha-amanitin resistance, and molecular weight of the primase activity distinguish it from RNA polymerases I, II, and III. The DNA products synthesized by both primase and DNA polymerase I on a single-stranded DNA template were 200-500 nucleotides long and covalently linked to oligoribonucleotides at their 5'-ends. Addition of yeast single-stranded DNA-binding protein (Arendes, J., Kim, K. C., and Sugino, A. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 80, 673-677) stimulated the DNA synthesis 2-3-fold."

The six monobiotinyl-toxins were isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, and the residue modified in each was identified by peptide mapping and amino acid analysis. We evaluated the role of each lysine in the binding of toxin to the acetylcholine receptor by measuring the affinity of each biotinyltoxin for receptor and by determining which biotinyltoxins could bind receptor and avidin simultaneously. The effect of biotinylation of each residue decreased the affinity of toxin for receptor in the order Lys 23 greater than Lys 49 greater than Lys 35 greater than Lys 69 congruent to Lys 12 greater than Ile 1. Biotinyltoxin modified either at Lys 12 or at Lys 69 is effective in cross-linking avidin to receptor, while biotinyltoxin modified at Lys 49 can form a low-affinity avidin-biotinyltoxin-receptor complex. Taken together, these results help define the surface of toxin that binds to receptor."

Addition of inorganic phosphate to the labeling medium increased both the rate of labeling and the number of modified thiol residues. Addition of ATP gave a marked kinetic protection from labeling, suggesting that the label was attached to a protein domain which is sensitive to changes at the catalytic site. Quenching of pyrene fluorescence emission of labeled ATPase by acrylamide and cesium chloride gave linear Stern-Volmer plots. The Stern-Volmer quenching constants of pyrene-ATPase fluorescence were 10 times lower than the constant obtained for acrylamide quenching of the fluorescent adduct of pyrene-maleimide-cystein used as a control, indicating that the pyrene moiety of the probe was considerably shielded from the medium solvent when covalently attached to the ATPase. The efficiency of quenching of pyrene-ATPase fluorescence increased by a significant amount upon addition of 100 microM Ca2+, when compared to the quenching in the presence of a Ca2+ chelator. It suggests that occupancy of the high affinity Ca2+ sites of the ATPase increases the accessibility of medium solvent into hydrophobic domains of the enzyme. The fluorescence lifetime of the solubilized pyrene-ATPase emission was 144-149 ns. The fluorescence polarization of pyrene-ATPase solubilized by nonionic detergent C12E8 was rho = 0.10 and it increased with an increase in the viscosity of the medium yielding a linear Perrin plot. The rotational correlation time for the soluble ATPase was 532 ns, corresponding to the overall rotation of a detergent-pyrene-ATPase particle with radius of 87A."

When the platelet and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase proteins were digested in the native state with trypsin, the platelet Ca2+-ATPase, which had an apparent undigested molecular mass of 103 kDa, yielded 78-kDa and 25-kDa fragments. Calcium transport activity depended on the integrity of the 103-kDa protein, while the digested protein had residual ATPase activity. Tryptic digestion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum pump protein, which also had an undigested molecular mass of 103 kDa, yielded products with apparent molecular masses of 55 kDa, 36 kDa, and 26 kDa. Distinct patterns were also observed when the platelet and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump proteins were digested with chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Chymotrypsin digestion of the platelet protein resulted in the appearance of products with apparent molecular masses of 70 kDa, 39 kDa, and 31 kDa, while a similar digestion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump protein yielded 54-kDa, 52.5-kDa, 46-kDa, 41-kDa, and 36-kDa fragments. Exposure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and platelet Ca2+-ATPase proteins to S. aureus protease also yielded dissimilar fragmentation patterns.

(1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 105, 942-948). We have now demonstrated the effect of phosphorylation by protein kinase C on the smooth muscle myosin molecule. In glycerol/urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the 20,000-dalton light chain phosphorylated by protein kinase C co-migrated with that phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase. Moreover, the light chain phosphorylated by both kinases migrated more rapidly than did the light chain phosphorylated by either myosin light chain kinase or protein kinase C alone. Myosin phosphorylated by protein kinase C formed a bent 10 S monomer while that phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase was an unfolded and extended 6 S monomer in the presence of 0.2 M KCl. In addition, myosin phosphorylated by kinases had a sedimentation velocity of 7.3 S, thereby suggesting that the myosin was partially unfolded. The unfolded myosin was visualized electron microscopically. The fraction in the looped form was higher when for myosin phosphorylated by both kinases higher than for that phosphorylated by light chain kinase alone. Therefore, phosphorylation by protein kinase C does not lead to the change in myosin conformation seen with myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1675564361,"Abstract Rat liver plasma membranes contain (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase sensitive to inhibition by both glucagon and Mg2+. We have previously shown that Mg2+ inhibition is mediated by a 30,000-dalton inhibitor, originally identified as a membrane-bound protein. In fact, this inhibitor is also present in the 100,000 X g supernatant of the total liver homogenate. Its purification was achieved from this fraction by a combination of ammonium sulfate washing, gel filtration, and cationic exchange chromatography. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) treatment caused the inactivation of the purified inhibitor, which suggested that this protein possesses at least one NEM-sensitive sulfhydryl group essential for its activity. Treatment of the liver plasma membranes with NEM resulted in a 2- and 5-fold decrease in the affinity of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase for glucagon and Mg2+, respectively, while the basal enzyme activity remained unchanged. This effect of NEM was concentration-, pH-, and time-dependent, optimal conditions being obtained by a 60-min treatment of plasma membranes with 50 mM NEM, at pH 7 and at 4 degrees C. The presence of 0.5 mM Mg2+ during NEM treatment of the plasma membranes prevented NEM inactivation. Reconstitution experiments showed that addition of the purified inhibitor to NEM-treated plasma membranes restored the inhibitions of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase by both magnesium and glucagon. It is proposed that the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase inhibitor not only confers its sensitivity of the liver (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase to Mg2+, but also mediates the inhibition of this system by glucagon."

The native Mr = 115,000, determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels suggests that the enzyme is composed of 6-8 subunits, identical as to molecular size (Mr = 17,000).

Other small secondary alcohols, such as 2-butanol, 2- and 3-pentanol, cyclobutanol, and cyclopentanol are substrates, as are the corresponding ketones of these alcohols. Primary alcohols, such as ethanol and 1-propanol, are oxidized at rates less than 5% of that observed for 2-propanol.

https://openalex.org/W1511798214,"We have previously demonstrated, based on comparison of homologous amino acid sequences and of two-dimensional CNBr peptide gel patterns, that the myosin heavy chain in pectoralis muscles of Storrs, Connecticut chickens is different from that of their normal controls (Huszar, G., Vigue, L., De-Lucia, J. Elzinga, M., and Haines, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7429-7434). Others have shown, however, that genomic banks and mRNA complements of the control and birds are not different. In the present studies, we have examined the hypothesis that the dystrophic myosin heavy chain is not a novel gene product, but is a developmental isozyme which is expressed in pectoralis muscles of adult chickens due to the process. Two-dimensional maps of myosin heavy chain CNBr peptides were prepared from breast muscles of 17-day in ovo (embryonic), 25-day posthatch (neonatal), and adult birds of the Storrs and of two control strains. Also, myosin and actomyosin ATPase enzymatic activities of the various preparations were determined in the pH range of 5.5 to 9.0. Analysis of the peptide maps demonstrates that the embyronic, neonatal, and control adult myosin heavy chain isozymes are distinctly different gene products with only minute variations between the respective developmental isozymes in and control muscles. However, the pectoralis myosin heavy chain of adult birds, which is a homogeneous isozyme population by amino acid sequences and gel patterns, corresponds to that of the neonatal-type myosin heavy chain. The ATPase properties of the embryonic, neonatal, or adult pectoralis myosins and actomyosins were not different, whether the level of specific activity or the pattern of pH activation is considered. Since the mobility of neonatal chicks (primarily neonatal-type isozymes) is not restricted, the differences in myosin heavy chain structures are part of the syndrome, but not the cause of avian muscular dystrophy."
