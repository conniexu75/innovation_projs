https://openalex.org/W2064242629,"We have investigated the role of subcellular localization in the regulation of protein kinase B (PKB) activation. The myristoylation/palmitylation motif from the Lck tyrosine kinase was attached to the N terminus of protein kinase B to alter its subcellular location. Myristoylated/palmitylated (m/p)-PKBα was associated with the plasma membrane of transfected cells, whereas the wild-type kinase was mostly cytosolic. The activity of m/p-PKBα was 60-fold higher compared with the unstimulated wild-type enzyme, and could not be stimulated further by growth factors or phosphatase inhibitors.In vivo 32P labeling and mutagenesis demonstrated that m/p-PKBα activity was due to phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473, that are normally induced on PKB following stimulation of the cells with insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). A dominant negative form of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) did not affect m/p-PKBα activity. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of m/p-PKBα was not required for its activation or phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473, suggesting that this domain may serve as a membrane-targeting module. Consistent with this view, PKBα was translocated to the plasma membrane within minutes after stimulation with IGF-1. This translocation required the PH domain and was sensitive to wortmannin. Our results indicate that PI3-K activity is required for translocation of PKB to the plasma membrane, where its activation occurs through phosphorylation of the same sites that are induced by insulin or IGF-1. Following activation the kinase detached from the membrane and translocated to the nucleus.

PKBα was found to mediate insulin- and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)-induced cellular responses, such as the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (11Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P.

PKBα is the cellular homologue of the oncogene product v-Akt encoded by the AKT8 retrovirus, which induces thymic lymphomas in mice (16Staal S.P. Hartley J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cloning of v-akt revealed that it was created by fusion of viral Gag sequences to the N terminus of mouse PKBα, which adds an N-terminal myristoylation signal to the oncoprotein and could account for its transforming ability (2Bellacosa A.

The activation of PKBα by insulin or IGF-1 is mediated by phosphorylation of Thr308 in the catalytic domain and Ser473 at the C terminus (22Alessi D.R. Andjelković M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of both sites is blocked by pretreatment of the cells with the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin. Substitution of both regulatory sites by aspartic acid residues to mimic phosphorylation by the introduction of a negative charge, produces a constitutively active enzyme (22Alessi D.R. Andjelković M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). This work predicted the existence of an upstream kinase(s) that phosphorylate(s) these sites, and recently a protein kinase activity was identified and purified capable of phosphorylating Thr308 in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) (Refs. 24Alessi D.R.

The enzyme has therefore been termed 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). The PH domain of PKB has been reported to play a role in the activation process (6Franke T.F. Yang S.I.

Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), but PKB activation can also occur in its absence, depending on the agonist and the type of deletion mutants used (21Andjelković M.

Since PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 are located in the plasma membrane, the interaction of PKB with one or both of these phosphoinositides may play a role in recruiting PKB to the membrane. To address this question, we have added a membrane targeting signal to the N terminus of PKBα and find that this is sufficient for maximal phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, and activation of PKBα in the presence or absence of the PH domain. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the IGF-1-induced activation of PKB is accompanied by its translocation to the membrane, followed by the translocation to the nucleus. The pECE and pCMV constructs encoding hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged PKBα have been described (21Andjelković M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.H. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Myristoylated/palmitylated (m/p)-HA-PKBα was created by polymerase chain reaction with HA-PKBα as template, using a 5′ oligonucleotide encoding the 12-amino acid N-terminal sequence of Lck, which carries the myristoylation/palmitylation signal, followed by two Ala residues and the HA epitope, and a 3′ oligonucleotide encoding amino acids 468–480 of PKBα. The resulting product was subcloned as a SalI/NotI fragment into pECE.HA-PKBα. The pECE expression constructs encoding PKBα phosphorylation site mutants at Ser473 and Thr308, or both have been described (22Alessi D.R. Andjelković M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). To create the membrane targeted versions of these mutants, the CelII/EcoRII fragment of pECE.HA-PKBα-S473A and NotI/EcoRI fragment of pECE.HA-PKBα-T308A were subcloned into the respective restriction sites of pECE.m/p-HA-PKBα. The pECE construct encoding m/p-HA-PKBα-ΔPH was made by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ oligonucleotide encoding the 12-amino acid N terminus of Lck, followed by two Ala residues, the HA epitope and amino acids 119–125 of PKBα, and a 3′ oligonucleotide encoding amino acids 468–480. The product was subcloned as a SalI/EcoRI fragment into the same restriction sites of the pECE vector (32Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). TheBglII/XbaI fragments from the above described pECE constructs were transferred into the same restriction sites of the pCMV5 vector (33Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H.

The constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. The construct SRα-p85αΔ478–513 has been described (34Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K.

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells seeded at 106/10-cm dish and 0.5 × 106/6-cm dish, respectively, were transfected the following day by a modified calcium phosphate method (35Chen C. Okayama H. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with 1–2 μg/ml plasmid DNA. The transfection mixture was removed after a 16-h incubation and cells were serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation for 15 min with 100 nm insulin (Novo-Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), 50 or 100 ng/ml IGF-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 0.1 mm pervanadate prepared as described previously (21Andjelković M.

Pretreatment with 100 μm LY 294002 (Calbiochem) was performed during the last 12 h of serum-starvation. Rat embryo fibroblast (REF-52) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS as described previously (36Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Watrin A. Labbé J.C. Cavadore J.C.

Transfected 293 cells were collected in ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysed by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C. The P100 and S100 fraction were obtained by additional centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. P100 was resuspended in lysis buffer. Cells were extracted on plates in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% w/v Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 nm okadaic acid (LC Laboratories), 0.1% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The HA-PKBα protein was immunoprecipitated from 100–200 μg of cell-free extracts, or 50 μg of the S100 and P100 fractions with the anti-HA epitope 12CA5 monoclonal antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes on beads were washed once with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, followed by lysis buffer and finally with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of reaction volume containing 30 μl of immunoprecipitate in kinase buffer, 30 μm peptide GRPRTSSFAEG as substrate (11Cross D.A.E.

Cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). The filters were blocked for 30 min with 5% skimmed milk in 1 × Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20, followed by a 2-h incubation with 50-fold diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-PKBα antisera specific for the C terminus (Abα469/480; Ref. 4Jones P.F.

The secondary antibodies were 1,000-fold diluted alkaline-phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and anti-mouse Ig (Southern Biotechnology Associated), or 5,000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-linked Ig (Amersham). Detection was performed using the AP color development reagents from Bio-Rad or by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). To normalize expression levels of PKB, FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were employed at a 200-fold dilution, the signal detected by chemifluorescence using a Storm 840/860 PhosphorImager and quantified with ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). 293 cells were plated and transfected on sterile coverslips. Fixation of cells with formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 were performed according to Ref. 37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manuel. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. The 12CA5 monoclonal antibody diluted 50-fold in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was applied for one hour at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a 50-fold dilution, or with 100-fold diluted biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), followed by 200-fold diluted streptavidin coupled to Texas Red (Amersham). DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS, once with H2O, mounted on glass slides using Gelvatol, and photographed with a LEITZ DMRD Leica camera. Confocal images were collected on a Leica TCS 4D microscope. REF-52 cells were subcultured on either 25-mm glass coverslips (Schutt Labortechnik, Göttingen, Germany) or acid-washed coverslips. Microinjection was performed with a normal Leitz micromanipulator, as described previously (38Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J.C. hemmingsi B.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were injected with 0.5 mg/ml PKB construct in the presence of 1 mg/ml biotinylated rabbit IgG (Sigma). Cells were serum-starved for 36–48 h before stimulation with 1 μm okadaic acid/10% FCS. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and further treated as described previously (36Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Watrin A. Labbé J.C. Cavadore J.C. Cell. 1990; 60: 151-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PKB was detected using Abα469/480 followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, and HA-PKBα was detected with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Microinjected cells were identified by costaining the cells with streptavidin coupled to Texas Red (Amersham). DNA was stained using Hoechst stain 33358 (1 μg/ml bisbenzemidine). The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 0.2 m Pipes, pH 7.2, for at least 20 min, washed in PBS, scraped from the dish using a rubber policeman, and embedded in 10% pig skin gelatin before cryoprotection in 2.3 m sucrose in PBS. Ultrathin sections were cut at −110 °C in a Reichert Ultracut E cryomicrotome, mounted on carbon/Formvar-coated grids, and labeled using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody followed by a rabbit anti-mouse antibody and finally protein A gold (7 or 5 nm particle size prepared as described by Lucocq; Ref.39Lucocq J.M.

All visible parts of the plasma membrane and adjacent cytoplasm of labeled cells were photographed at magnification ×15,000. Cytoplasm areas and membrane profile length were estimated using a square lattice grid with 1-cm line spacing as described in Ref. 41Lucocq J.M. J. Anat. 1994; 184: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar. Gold particles over the nucleus were not included in the analysis and gold particles were only assigned to the plasma membrane if they lay within 2 particle widths of the plasma membrane profile. 293 cells transfected with HA-PKBα DNA constructs were serum-starved overnight, washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM, and incubated for 4 h (Fig. 5) or 12 h (Fig. 10) with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) in either the presence or absence of 100 μm LY294002 (Fig. 10). The cells were then stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 and placed on ice. The medium was aspirated, the cells washed twice with ice-cold DMEM buffer and then lysed. HA-PKBα was immunoprecipitated from the lysates, alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by C18 chromatography exactly as described previously (22Alessi D.R.

To investigate the role of membrane targeting in the activation of PKB, the N-terminal membrane localization sequence from Lck was attached to the N terminus of HA-PKBα (see Fig.1). This signal was chosen because it contains the consensus sequence for both myristoylation and palmitylation (42Resh M. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be sufficient to localize a number of cytosolic proteins to the plasma membrane (43Zlatkine P. Mehul B. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 673-679PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutants of m/p-HA-PKBα were also prepared in which the ATP-binding site (Lys179) or the phosphorylation sites (Thr308, Ser473) were mutated to Ala, or in which the N-terminal 118 amino acids containing the PH domain, or the C-terminal 14 amino acids encompassing the Ser473phosphorylation site were deleted (Fig. 1). To confirm that the Lck myristoylation/palmitylation signal provides membrane attachment of m/p-HA-PKBα, we determined the subcellular localization of the proteins expressed in 293 cells by immunofluorescence using the anti-HA epitope antibody. HA-PKBα was found in the cytosol of serum-starved, unstimulated 293 cells (Fig.2, A and B). However, all forms of m/p-HA-PKBα (Fig. 2, C–G) were highly concentrated at the plasma membrane. No immunostaining occurred if the 293 cells were transfected with vector alone (Fig.2 H). Overexpression of m/p-HA-PKBα, m/p-HA-PKBα-S473A, or m/p-HA-PKBα-ΔPH in 293 cells resulted in rounding of the cells, which was not observed when either wild-type HA-PKB or other m/p-HA-PKBα mutants were overexpressed. The activity of m/p-HA-PKBα in unstimulated cells was over 60-fold higher than that of HA-PKBα. This is higher than the activity of PKBα obtained after stimulation of the wild-type kinase with insulin, IGF-1, or vanadate (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with this finding, the activity of m/p-HA-PKBα could not be increased further by stimulation of the cells with insulin, IGF-1, or vanadate (Fig. 3 A). m/p-HA-PKBα from unstimulated cells, like HA-PKBα from IGF-1-stimulated cells, could be inactivated by treatment with protein phosphatase 2A in vitro (data not shown). No PKB activity was detected when kinase-inactive m/p-HA-PKBα-K179A was expressed in 293 cells (Fig.3 A). The intracellular localization of wild-type HA-PKBα and m/p-HA-PKBα were confirmed by biochemical studies. About 80% of HA-PKBα activity and 75% of HA-PKBα protein were detected in the 100,000 ×g supernatant (S100) of unstimulated 293 cells, wherea"

However, in vivo MMP-8 expression was observed in mononuclear fibroblast-like cells in the rheumatoid synovial membrane. In addition, we detected MMP-8 mRNA expression in cultured rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and human endothelial cells. Up-regulation of MMP-8 was observed after treatment of the cells with either tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nm). Western analysis showed a similar regulation at the protein level. The size of secreted MMP-8 was 50 kDa, which is about 30 kDa smaller than MMP-8 from PMN. Conditioned media from rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts contained both type I and II collagen degrading activity. However, degradation of type II collagen, but not that of type I collagen, was completely inhibited by 50 μm doxycycline, suggesting specific MMP-8 activity. In addition, doxycycline down-regulated MMP-8 induction, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Thus MMP-8 exerts markedly wider expression in human cells than had been thought previously, implying that PMN are not the only source of cartilage degrading activity at arthritic sites. The inhibition of both MMP-8 activity and synthesis by doxycycline provides an incentive for further studies on the clinical effects of doxycycline in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Extracellular matrix degradation is fundamental to connective tissue remodeling during physiological processes as well as during the progress of several pathological phenomena. Matrix turnover is regulated by a delicate balance among the production, activation, and inhibition of proteolytic enzymes. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP(s), matrix metalloproteinase(s); PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil(s) RSF, rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; APMA, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; kb, kilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: MMP(s), matrix metalloproteinase(s); PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil(s) RSF, rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; APMA, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; kb, kilobase(s). form a gene family of at least 14 enzymes participating in extracellular matrix remodeling. MMPs, together with the factors associated with their regulation, are reported to be highly implicated in various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, corneal ulceration, atherosclerosis, and tumor invasion and metastasis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Woessner J.F.

Previous studies have demonstrated that neutrophil-derived MMPs such as collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9, 92-kDa type IV collagenase), play a key role in the degradation of extracellular matrix constituents i.e. during the course of inflammatory diseases (4Weiss S.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 393-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among collagenases, MMP-8 most effectively hydrolyzes the native type I and II collagens, whereas MMP-1 prefers type III collagen. MMP-8 is a considerably more efficient enzyme than MMP-1 with respect to almost all substrates except for type III collagen (9Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-1 is transcribed and expressed by human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and collagenase-3 by some human malignant breast tumors (10Freije J.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas MMP-8 has been shown to be stored in subcellular specific granules of mature human peripheral blood PMN after synthesis during PMN maturation in bone marrow (15Mainardi C.L. Pourmotabbed T.F. Hasty K.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 302: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that PMN MMP-8 transcription is completed before PMN emigrate from bone marrow (15Mainardi C.L. Pourmotabbed T.F. Hasty K.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 302: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that MMP-8 activity is regulated by factors that affect the release of MMP-8 by degranulation and not its biosynthesis (4Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar). However, by using in situ hybridization, Cole and Kuettner (16Cole A.A. Kuettner K.E. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 26: 98-102Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that MMP-8 mRNA is also found in peripheral PMN. More recent observations (17Chubinskaya S. Huch K. Mikecz K. Cs-Szabo G.

In this study we investigated the expression and regulation of MMP-8, particularly in human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSF) and endothelial cells. It was shown that MMP-8 is also expressed in cell types other than those belonging to the PMN lineage. In these cells MMP-8 is secreted as a nonglycosylated protein. The expression of MMP-8 in RSF and endothelial cells was up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Doxycycline inhibited not only the catalytic activity of MMP-8, but also the expression of MMP-8 mRNA and protein.

The cells were used after two or six passages. Conditioned media were obtained by incubating the cells in 10-cm2 dishes for 24 h with 1.5 ml of medium 199 supplemented with 0.1% human serum albumin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 IU/ml penicillin, to which the appropriate concentration of test compound was added (10 ng/ml TNF-α or 10 nm PMA).

The permission for all of these protocols was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Oulu. For collecting the media for Western blot analysis, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 24 h with medium 199 without serum. For RNA analysis total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells: RSF, squamous cellular carcinoma, gingival fibroblasts, periodontal ligament fibroblasts, HUVEC, and keratinocytes. In addition, RNA was isolated from human bone marrow, alveolar bone, and radicular jaw cyst specimen and from purified PMN immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after purification. RNA extraction and purification were performed as described (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Cycles (denaturation step at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing step at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension step at 72 °C for 30 s) were performed using a thermal reactor. Specific primers for MMP-8 (not recognizing MMP-1 or other MMPs) were designed, based on the published DNA sequence (9Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

Primers for the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene β-actin were as described previously (30Ballagy-Pordany A. Ballagy-Pordany A. Funa K. Anal.

PCR analysis was also carried on human genomic DNA (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 522-bp PCR products from human bone marrow, peripheral blood PMN, and human gingival fibroblasts were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe for MMP-8 was obtained by PCR of mRNA from bone marrow and was characterized by sequencing. For Western blot analysis, serum-free cell culture medium (200 μl) or purified PMN MMP-8 (5–10 ng) was freeze-dried and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filter paper. Nonspecific binding was eliminated by incubating with PBS supplemented with 5% non-fat dry milk for 90 min at 37 °C. The blots were incubated either with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (affinity-purified IgG fractions) against human MMP-8 (13Michaelis J. Vissers M.C.M. Winternbourn C.C. Biochem.

Biochem. 1989; 29: 351-359Google Scholar) diluted 1:1,000 or with nonimmune control serum diluted 1:100 for 1 h at 20 °C. After washings, the blots were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:500) for 1 h at 20 °C. After washing, the blots were incubated for 30 min with the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase kit, and the color was developed using diaminobenzidine. MMP-8 levels were determined by a time-resolved immunofluorescence assay. The monoclonal MMP-8-specific antibodies 8708 and 8706 were used as a catching antibody and a tracer antibody, respectively. The tracer antibody was labeled using europium-chelate (32Hemmilä L. Dakubu S. Mukkala V.-M. Siitari H. Lövgren T. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% sodium azide, and 20 mg/liter DTPA. Samples were diluted in assay buffer and incubated for 1 h, followed by incubation for 1 h with tracer antibody. Enhancement solution was added, and after 5 min fluorescence was measured using a 1234 Delfia Research Fluorometer (Wallac, Turku, Finland). MMP-8 was purified from human neutrophil extracts according to Sorsa et al. (7Sorsa T. Ding Y. Salo T. Lauhio A. Teronen O. Ingman T. Ohtani H. Andoh N. Takeha S. Konttinen Y.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Endoglycosidase digestions of MMP-8 purified from PMN and from culture media of PMA-stimulated RSF and HUVEC were carried out using a modification of the method described by Mallya et al.

Briefly, endoglycosidase F digestion was carried out in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% CHAPS at 37 °C; the reaction with N-glycosidase F was done in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% CHAPS. In the deglycosylation reaction of both 0.05–0.2 mg/ml purified PMN MMP-8 or culture media of RSF and HUVEC, 0.05 unit of endoglycosidase F or 0.2 unit of N-glycosidase F was used. Before the addition of endoglycosidase, samples were denaturated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The reactions were terminated after overnight incubation by addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Antiserum to neutrophil type MMP-8 collagenase used for immunohistochemical staining was the same as that used for immunoblotting (13Michaelis J. Vissers M.C.M. Winternbourn C.C. Biochem.

The slides were placed in a humid chamber, and the sections were incubated sequentially with 1) rabbit anti-human antiserum against MMP-8, diluted 1:100–1:400 in PBS and 0.1% w/v BSA for 1 h; 2) biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:100 in PBS with 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin for 30 min; and 3) avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex, diluted 1:200 in PBS for 30 min. Finally, the sections were incubated for 5 min in a chromogen solution of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (50 mg/150 ml of PBS) and hydrogen peroxide (final concentration 0.03%). All incubations were performed at 22 °C, and slides were washed twice in PBS between each step. All slides containing consecutive sections were processed further with and without counterstaining with hematoxylin before dehydration in ethanol, clearing in xylene, and mounting. Omission of primary antiserum and use of normal rabbit serum (diluted 1:100–1:400) were included as controls. RSF were incubated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml TNF-α. Media were collected, treated with 1 mm APMA, and incubated for 12 h at 22 °C with 1.5 μm native soluble type I or II collagen in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8, in the presence or absence of 50 μm doxycycline. The collagen degradation products were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of type I or type II collagen cleaved by collagenases (MMP-1 and/or MMP-8) was analyzed by scanning the bands on gel at 595 nm using an ISCO gel scanner. Collagenase activity is expressed as a percentage of collagen degraded (5Konttinen Y.T. Lindy O. Suomalainen K. Ritchlin C. Saari H. Vauhkonen M. Lauhio A. Santavirta S. Sorsa T.

Using a sensitive RT-PCR method we analyzed whether the expression of MMP-8 mRNA could be detected in tissues other than the bone marrow. Indeed, a 522-bp MMP-8 transcript amplified from total RNA was detected in peripheral blood PMN; fibroblastic cell lines derived from mucosa (gingival fibroblasts), periodontal ligament, or rheumatoid synovia (RSF); cultured squamous cell carcinoma cells of the tongue (squamous cellular carcinoma); and HUVEC, whereas no amplified transcript was observed in cultured human oral keratinocytes (Figs.1, 2, 3). The specificity of PCR amplification of the RSF mRNA was verified by Southern blot analysis using a specific MMP-8 cDNA probe (Figs.2 and 3). Using the same MMP-8 primers as those used for MMP-8 RT-PCR, PCR amplification was carried out on human genomic DNA, resulting in a 1,400-bp product, indicating that the area of genomic MMP-8 DNA corresponding to the 522-bp mRNA RT-PCR product contains noncoding introns of the MMP-8 gene (not shown). In addition, the 522-bp PCR products were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced, which revealed 100% homology with the published human MMP-8 sequence (15Mainardi C.L. Pourmotabbed T.F. Hasty K.A. Am. J.

After isolation RNA was analyzed by using semiquantitative RT-PCR followed by Southern analysis, or by Northern analysis. RT-PCR of RSF RNA showed a 522-bp fragment, and the amount of the amplified product was increased 5-fold after the treatment of TNF-α, and 3–4-fold after PMA treatment (Fig. 2 B). For HUVEC also nonspecific bands were observed after RT-PCR (Fig. 3 A). However, Southern blotting revealed results similar to those obtained for RSF (Fig. 3 B). The amount of amplified β-actin DNA was constant in control, TNF-α-, or PMA-treated cells (Fig.3 C). The presence of MMP-8 mRNA was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2, C and D). The 3.3-kb MMP-8 mRNA was observed in TNF-α- and PMA-treated cells, whereas using this method no MMP-8 mRNA could be detected in untreated cells (Fig. 2 C). Thus, both in fibroblasts and in endothelial cells MMP-8 is expressed and regulated by inflammatory mediators or phorbol ester. To analyze MMP-8 protein expression and secretion, Western blot analysis was carried out on culture supernatants of RSF. A 50-kDa immunoreactive band was observed by using MMP-8-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig.4). The MMP-8-specific antibody used in this study did not recognize the related fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1) or other MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9) because excessive amounts of these proteins showed no cross-reactivity in Western blotting (Fig.4 A). At the protein level the induction of MMP-8 was seen also, both in TNF-α- and PMA-treated cells (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 4). Only very weak immunoreactivity was found in the culture media of untreated RSF (Fig. 4 B,lane 2). MMP-8 expression levels in RSF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In conditioned media of RSF (passage 0 and passage 2 from two different isolations) an MMP-8 production of 6.7 ± 4.0 ng/ml/24 h was determined. We assume that the 50-kDa band most likely represents the nonglycosylated form of MMP-8 (9Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bergmann U. Michaelis J. Oberhoff R. Knäuper V. Beckmann R. Tschesche H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 29: 351-359Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of PMN MMP-8 (about 80 kDa) by incubation of purified neutrophil MMP-8 withN-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase F revealed on Western blot four bands of about 70, 65, 50, and 45 kDa in size (Fig.5 A), whereas the treatment of media from PMA-treated HUVEC or RSF did not show any clear changes in the molecular mass of secreted 50 kDa MMP-8 (Fig. 5 B). Detection of MMP-8 by immunohistochemistry showed MMP-8 expression in mononuclear fibroblast-like cells in the human rheumatoid synovial membrane (Fig. 6 A), whereas no immunostaining was observed using nonimmune sera (Fig.6 B). Similar in vivo results were found in tissues from chronically inflamed gingiva and oral mucosa (data not shown). Collagenase activity in culture media of RSF, treated with TNF-α, degraded efficiently both native type I and II collagens into the characteristic αA(3/4) cleavage products (Fig. 7,lanes 2 and 5). Previous studies (34Suomalainen K. Sorsa T. Golub L.M. Ramamurthy N. Lee H.M. Uitto V.J. Saari H. Konttinen Y.T. Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have shown that doxycycline is a strong inhibitor of MMP-8 activity compared with MMP-1 activity (IC50 of 30 and 300 μm, respectively). Preincubation of culture media from RSF with 50 μm doxycycline completely prevented the specific degradation of type II collagen (Fig. 7, lane 6) but had no effect on the degradation of type I collagen (Fig. 7, lane 3). Thus, RSF do produce MMP-8 which, as shown before (9Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prefers type II collagen to type I collagen as a substrate, and its catalytical activity is specifically inhibited by doxycycline. Similar results were found in culture media of endothelial cells (not shown). We investigated further whether doxycycline affects the level of MMP-8 expression. Northern blot analysis of RSF, treated with TNF-α or PMA in the presence of doxycycline, showed a clear reduction in the amount of 3.3-kb MMP-8 mRNA (Fig.8, A and B). A similar result was obtained using RT-PCR (Fig. 8, C andD). In addition, MMP-8 protein was reduced in cells treated with TNF-α or PMA in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 8,E and F). Obviously, doxycycline not only inhibits the collagenolytic activity of MMP-8 but also affects the induced expression of the 50-kDa MMP-8 protein in synovial fibroblasts. Human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) is regarded as a PMN-specific matrix metalloproteinase that is stored in granules and released upon cell activation. This study shows that in addition to peripheral PMN, MMP-8 is expressed in RSF and human endothelial cells. This was demonstrated by RT-PCR, Northern blotting (showing the MMP-8-specific mRNA size of 3.3 kb), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, substrate specificity, and specific inhibition of enzyme activity by doxycycline. Upon MMP-8 synthesis, which is regulated in these cells by the inflammatory mediator TNF-α, the protein is secreted. MMP-8, interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) are the main proteases that can degrade different types of native collagen. MMP-8 has the highest activity toward cartilage collagen type II. In pathophysiological conditions MMP-8 is regarded as playing a central role at sites of matrix degradation; MMP-8 activity was shown in chronic bronchiectasis (35Sepper R. Konttinen Y.T. Ding Y. Takagi M. Sorsa T. Chest. 1995; 107: 1641-1647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), cystic fibrosis, in which the level of activity correlated to the disease state (36Power C.

Acta. 1996; 244: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-8 is thought to be the only collagenase that acts in cartilage aggrecan degradation (38Fosang A.J. Last K. Neame J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because its synthesis and storage were considered to be restricted to maturating PMN only, MMP-8 activity at sites of tissue destruction was thought to be mediated by the degranulation of PMN (4Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar, 9Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

In contrast to previous studies, we show that the regulation of tissue destruction by MMP-8 is most likely more complicated, and MMP-8 expression comprises various cell types and tissues. On the basis of our results we hypothesize that as with other members of the MMP family, the expression of MMP-8 is regulated by inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and interleukin-1 (19Unemori E.N. Hibbs M.S. Amento E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Hanemaaijer R. Koolwijk P. le Clercq L. de Vree W.J.A. van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Biochem.

Scand. 1995; 26: 98-102Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported the expression of MMP-8 mRNA in circulating PMN. In addition, the demonstration of MMP-8 expression in cartilage, in particular in human articular chondrocytes (16Cole A.A. Kuettner K.E. Acta Orthop.

The molecular mass of the MMP-8 protein published varies between 85 and 50 kDa, even though forms as small as 20 kDa have been reported by different research groups (7Sorsa T. Ding Y. Salo T. Lauhio A. Teronen O. Ingman T. Ohtani H. Andoh N. Takeha S. Konttinen Y.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 112-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Seltzer J.L. Adams S.A. Grant G.A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 5645-5650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variance probably reflects a different degree of MMP-8 glycosylation and whether the enzyme is found in a latent or an active form. In addition, degraded forms of MMP-8 protein may have been detected as well. In this study we observed that MMP-8 was present as a 75–85 kDa protein in PMN. However, only the 50-kDa form was seen in RSF as well as in HUVEC. After deglycosylation of the 75-kDa MMP-8 purified from PMN, the enzyme appeared as four different size bands, one of which corresponded to the size of MMP-8 expressed by RSF. Deglycosylation of the 50-kDa MMP-8 from RSF or HUVEC showed that this secreted form of MMP-8 is glycosylated significantly less or hardly at all compared with the PMN MMP-8. Therefore, it can be speculated that subgranularly stored MMP-8 in PMN requires carbohydrate moieties, whereas a low or nonglycosylated form is secreted as a latent enzyme, similar to other secreted MMPs. Doxycycline, a commonly used broad spectrum antibiotic, inhibits MMP-8 activity at low concentrations but not that of MMP-1 (7Sorsa T. Ding Y. Salo T. Lauhio A. Teronen O. Ingman T. Ohtani H.

The mechanism of this reduction is not known. Therefore, we investigated whether doxycycline may affect MMP-8 synthesis. It was observed that after preincubation with 50 μm doxycycline in RSF as well as in HUVEC both MMP-8 mRNA and MMP-8 protein expression was down-regulated, indicating that doxycycline inhibits not only MMP-8 activity but also its synthesis.

Because it has become evident that human cytokine-stimulated synovial fibroblasts, endothelial cells (this study), and joint chondrocytes (18Cole A.A. Chubinskaya S. Schumacher B. Huch K. Cs-Szabo G.

In summary, previously MMP-8 was considered to be uniquely expressed by neutrophils during their development in bone marrow, and thus MMP-8 was referred to as neutrophil collagenase. The results of the present study show that in addition to peripheral blood PMNs several non-PMN lineage cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, are able to express MMP-8 mRNA and protein both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we suggest that in future human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) should be referred to as collagenase-2 (Cl-2). We thank Sirpa Kangas and Eija Kaila for expert technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2011680158,"Munc18-1 is a neuronal protein that interacts with syntaxin 1 and is required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We have now identified two Munc18-1-interacting proteins called Mint1 and Mint2 that may mediate the function of Munc18-1. Mint proteins are detectable only in brain and are composed of an N-terminal sequence that binds Munc18-1, a middle phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and two C-terminal PDZ domains thought to attach proteins to the plasma membrane. In brain, Mint proteins are part of a multimeric complex containing Munc18-1 and syntaxin that likely functions as an intermediate in synaptic vesicle docking/fusion. The phosphotyrosine-binding domain specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphates known to be produced during vesicle exocytosis (Hay, J. C., Fisette, P. L., Jenkins, G. H., Fukami, K., Takonawa, T., Anderson, R. A., and Martin, T. F. J. (1995) Nature 374, 173–177). Our data suggest a model whereby local production of phosphatidylinositol phosphates may trigger the binding of vesicles to the active zone via the Mint·Munc18-1 complex in conjunction with syntaxin 1.

Our data suggest a model whereby local production of phosphatidylinositol phosphates may trigger the binding of vesicles to the active zone via the Mint·Munc18-1 complex in conjunction with syntaxin 1. Exocytosis is a universal process in eukaryotes with many functions. At the synapse, exocytosis of synaptic vesicles releases neurotransmitters and constitutes the first step in synaptic transmission. Synaptic vesicle exocytosis starts with the docking of the vesicles at the active zone. Docked vesicles are then primed for Ca2+ in a complex reaction that may involve partial fusion of the vesicles. Finally, Ca2+ rapidly triggers the release of neurotransmitters with a latency of a few hundred microseconds. Although several proteins that function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis have been identified, the mechanisms of docking and fusion are still incompletely understood (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ferro-Novick S.

Verhage and T. C. Südhof, unpublished data.In addition to binding strongly to syntaxin 1, Munc18-1 binds to Doc2a and Doc2b, C2 domain proteins that are associated peripherally with synaptic vesicles (10Verhage M. de Vries K.J.

Since the interactions of Munc18-1 seem insufficient to explain its function, we have now searched for additional binding proteins for Munc18-1. We have identified a family of Munc18-interacting proteins named Mint proteins with unusual properties, suggesting a new model for the docking and priming reactions that initiate exocytosis. We screened a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+-enriched rat brain RNA from postnatal day 8 with a bait vector encoding full-length Munc18-1 fused to LexA (pBTMMunc18-1-1) (11Vojtek A.B.

Of >1000 positive clones obtained from 2.8 × 108 yeast colonies, 100 clones were rescued, retransformed into fresh L40 yeast cells, and confirmed by growth on plates lacking histidine and by activation of β-galactosidase. 55 of the 100 clones were then further analyzed by cotransformation with an irrelevant bait and by sequencing. 5 clones were lost, 10 clones exhibited only weak activation of β-galactosidase and were not analyzed further, 22 clones encoded Mint1 and 7 clones encoded Mint2 (see Fig. 1; several clones were isolated multiple times independently), 3 clones encoded PSD95, 2 clones encoded syntaxin 5, 2 clones encoded a kinesin-related transcript, and 4 clones were not identified in the data banks. Rat brain cDNA libraries in λZAPII (Stratagene) were screened with random-primed DNA probes as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following human Mint cDNAs were obtained as expressed sequence tag clones from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL): human Mint1, 279624; and human Mint2, 183680, 328119, 188448, and 139567. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method using fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI370A DNA sequencer. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones were deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank. Plasmids were constructed in pVP16-3, pLexN, and pBTM116 for use as yeast two-hybrid prey and bait vectors, respectively; in pGEX-KG for expression as GST 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PTB domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. fusion proteins; in pCMV5 or pME18sf(−) for expression in COS cells; and in pMAL-C2 for expression as maltose-binding protein fusion proteins. The following plasmids were used (listed by proteins; numbers indicate encoded residue numbers).

Mint2: pGEX-Mint2/MID, residues 26–336; pCMV-Mint2, residues 1–750; pPreyMint2-1, residues 26–336; and pPreyMint2-2, residues 153–512. Munc18-1: pGEX-, pCMV-, pBTM-, pLex-, or pVP-Munc18-1, residues 1–594. Munc18-2: pBTM- or pLex-Munc18-2, residues 1–594. Syntaxin 1: pGEX-syntaxin 1A, residues 1–265; pCMV-syntaxin 1A (full-length), residues 1–288; pBTM- or pLex-syntaxin 1A, residues 1–265; and pVP-syntaxin 1A, residues 1–265.

Bacterial expression of GST and maltose-binding protein fusion proteins and COS cell transfections were performed as described (8Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Six frozen rat brains were homogenized in 15 ml of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 100 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 15 ml of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 100 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 2% Triton X-100 were added. Homogenates were extracted by end-over-end rotation for 4 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor to obtain the total brain extract. Glutathione-agarose affinity columns (1-ml bed volume) with ∼5 mg of GST-Mint1/MID, 5 mg of GST-Mint2/MID, 5 mg of GST, or 7 mg of GST-Munc18-1 were pre-equilibrated with core buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 2.5 mmMgCl2) containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.25% Triton X-100. The total brain extract was precleared by incubation for 6 h at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose followed by centrifugation (800 × g for 2 min). 13 ml of the recovered total brain extract were adjusted to 3.5 mmMgCl2 and 3.5 mm CaCl2 and loaded onto the columns by recirculation (4–10 times) under gravity flow. The flow-through fraction from the last loading cycle was collected, and columns were washed with 20 ml of core buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5% CHAPS and then sequentially eluted with 10 ml of core buffer containing 5 mm EGTA and 0.5% CHAPS (E1); 10 ml of core buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.5% CHAPS (E2); 10 ml of core buffer containing 1 mNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% CHAPS (E3); and 4 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (E4). For the binding experiments with recombinant proteins expressed in COS cells, only the fractions corresponding to E4 were used. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids) or PIP and PIP2 (Boehringer Mannheim)) were mixed in the appropriate ratios with 4 mg of total phospholipids/tube. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, 20 μCi of [3H]phosphatidylcholine (1 mCi/ml, 37 MBq/ml; Amersham Corp.) was added as a tracer, and the remaining solvent was removed by N2. Dried phospholipids were resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl by vortexing for 1 min and sonicated for 15 s. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was recovered and diluted twice with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1m NaCl; kept at 4 °C as a stock solution; and used within 2 weeks. For binding assays, 25 μg of GST fusion proteins (GST-Mint1/PTB, GST-SNAP-25, and GST-complexin I) bound to glutathione-agarose were incubated with 50 μl of the3H-liposomes in 0.1 ml of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin) for 10 min at room temperature in an Eppendorf shaker. After five washes with binding buffer, pellets were resuspended and quantitated in a scintillation counter. Most antibodies were described previously (5Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C.

Antibodies to Mint proteins were raised against GST-Mint1-3 (P730; residues 71–439), GST-Mint1-9 (P932; residues 189–471), and GST-Mint2-1 (P729; residues 26–336). Monoclonal antibodies to synaptic vesicle proteins were a kind gift of R. Jahn (Yale University). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described (5Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 10Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P.H. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C.

RNA blotting analysis was performed using commercially available blots (CLONTECH) containing total RNA from rat tissues. We screened a rat brain cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid selection with full-length Munc18-1, a protein of 594 amino acids. Among 40 strongly positive clones, 29 clones were independent isolates of two closely related cDNAs (Fig. 1). The fact that we isolated multiple overlapping clones from two homologous proteins suggests that Munc18-1 specifically interacts with these proteins, which we therefore named Mint1 and Mint2. Two observations provided further support for the specificity of the Mint/Munc18-1 interaction. First, we did not isolate Mint clones in large yeast two-hybrid screens with several other baits. Second, we detected no interaction in yeast two-hybrid assays of Mint proteins with other proteins, such as Munc18-2, syntaxin, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, and rabphilin (data not shown). Thus, Mint1 and Mint2 specifically bind to Munc18-1, but not to Munc18-2 or other trafficking proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays. Since the yeast two-hybrid clones did not contain the complete coding sequence of Mint1 or Mint2, we isolated their full-length cDNAs. Their sequences revealed that Mint proteins have a multidomain structure composed of variable N-terminal and conserved C-terminal regions (Fig. 1 B). Inspection of the different Mint prey clones localized the Munc18-1-interacting domain to the N-terminal region. The C-terminal sequences of Mint proteins are composed of a PTB domain and two PDZ domains. PTB domains from several proteins bind phosphotyrosine-containing peptides and PIPs (15Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are found in peripheral proteins of the plasma membrane, where they often bind to the cytoplasmic tails of intrinsic membrane proteins (18Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Partial sequences of human Mint1 and mouse Mint2 were identified previously by positional cloning as candidate genes for Friedreich's ataxia, although they were later shown not to be involved in the disease (20Duclos F. Boschert U. Sirugo G. Mandel J.-L. Hen R. Koenig M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Duclos F. Koenig M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 57-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The genes were designated as human X11 and mouse X11 with the notion that they represent orthologs. Our full-length sequences of both proteins from a single species, however, demonstrate that they are isoforms. Data bank searches revealed severalCaenorhabditis elegans sequences corresponding to Mint proteins, suggesting that Mint proteins are conserved in invertebrates (data not shown). Because yeast two-hybrid assays are prone to artifacts, we tested the interaction between Munc18-1 and Mint proteins by independent methods. For this purpose, we performed affinity chromatography experiments by binding rat brain proteins or recombinant proteins to immobilized GST-Mint fusion proteins or control GST proteins. We applied total rat brain homogenates solubilized with Triton X-100 to columns containing GST-Mint1, GST-Mint2, and GST and eluted bound proteins with high salt after extensive washing. Analysis of the eluates by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting revealed that we purified Munc18-1 on both Mint columns as the major component and syntaxin 1 as a minor component (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Control GST columns were unable to enrich either protein. To ensure that the column purification of Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 on immobilized Mint proteins was specific, we analyzed the eluates by immunoblotting for a number of known synaptic proteins (data not shown). Only Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 were eluted. Control GST fusion proteins did not retain Munc18-1 or syntaxin 1 (data not shown). Thus, Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 are purified on immobilized Mint proteins in a single step by a specific interaction. To ensure that Mint proteins and Munc18-1 also interact in brain, we performed immunoprecipitations with Mint1 and Mint2 antibodies from rat brain homogenates. Both revealed co-immunoprecipitation of Mint1 with Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 (Fig.3). Thus, three methods, yeast two-hybrid selection, affinity chromatography, and immunoprecipitation, show that Mint proteins are binding partners for Munc18-1.Figure 3Co-immunoprecipitation of Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 with Mint proteins from rat brain homogenates. Total brain extracts (lane 1) were subjected to immunoprecipitations using polyclonal antibodies to Mint1 or Mint2 or the respective preimmune sera as shown. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1. IgG heavy chain was weakly stained in a nonspecific reaction because of the large amount of IgG in the sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These data demonstrate that syntaxin 1 and Munc18-1 are in a complex with Mint proteins, but do not tell us whether syntaxin 1 and Munc18-1 bind independently to Mint proteins or whether only one of the two proteins binds to Mint proteins and the other is purified piggyback on the first. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we expressed Munc18-1, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25 individually in COS cells and tested their binding to Mint proteins singly or in combination (Fig.4). Munc18-1 alone bound to Mint proteins. Syntaxin 1 bound only if Munc18-1 was also added, and SNAP-25 did not bind under any condition. These results agree well with the absence of an interaction of Mint proteins with syntaxin 1 in yeast two-hybrid assays (see above) and suggest that syntaxin 1 interacts indirectly with Mint proteins via Munc18-1. We hybridized RNA blots from multiple rat tissues with Mint probes at high stringency. In agreement with in situhybridization data on X11 (20Duclos F. Boschert U. Sirugo G. Mandel J.-L. Hen R. Koenig M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the mRNAs for both Mint proteins were abundant in brain, but were not detectable in other tissues tested even after long exposures (data not shown). To investigate the localizations of Mint proteins, we performed subcellular fractionations. These showed that Mint proteins and Munc18-1 are largely membrane-bound and copurify with synaptic plasma membranes (data not shown). Although syntaxin 1 is primarily a plasma membrane protein, it is additionally present on synaptic vesicles (22Hong R.-M. Mori H. Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, the Mint·Munc18-1·syntaxin 1 complex could potentially be on plasma membranes, on synaptic vesicles, or on both. To test this, we measured the relative enrichment of different proteins in synaptic vesicles compared with total brain (Fig.5). Vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin 1, synaptogyrin, Rab3A, and synaptobrevin were greatly enriched in synaptic vesicles. By contrast, syntaxin 1 was de-enriched, and Munc18-1 and Mint proteins were barely detectable. These data indicate that Mint proteins and Munc18-1 are not components of synaptic vesicles. Compared with other membrane trafficking proteins, Mint proteins have an unusual composition since they contain PTB and PDZ domains. Recent studies in permeabilized PC12 cells revealed that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, an enzyme that generates PIPs such as PIP2, is required for exocytosis (24Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takonawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Since the PTB domain of Shc binds PIP and PIP2 (25Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the PTB domain of Mint proteins may bind PIP2. To test this, we studied the binding of 3H-labeled liposomes composed of different phospholipids to GST-Mint1 and to control GST fusion proteins (Fig. 6). PIP and PIP2 bound specifically to the PTB domain from Mint1, but not to other GST fusion proteins. Binding required only 0.7% PIP2, but much higher concentrations of PIP, suggesting that Mint proteins may prefer PIP2 in vivo. Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles starts with the docking of vesicles, proceeds by priming the vesicles for Ca2+-triggered release, and finishes with the release of neurotransmitters in a final Ca2+-dependent reaction. A number of proteins are known to function in priming and/or Ca2+-dependent release (e.g. CAPS, syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin 1, Munc18-1, and Rab3), but few proteins involved in docking of vesicles have been described (1Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 2Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1049-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 3Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). We have now identified a family of proteins called Mint proteins that interact with Munc18-1, a protein essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis.1 The following evidence supports the notion that Mint proteins bind to Munc18-1 with high affinity. 1) Mint1 and Mint2 are coexpressed with Munc18-1 and are present at significant levels only in neurons. 2) Mint proteins specifically interact only with Munc18-1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. 3) Affinity chromatography of rat brain proteins on immobilized Mint proteins leads to the purification of Munc18-1 to near homogeneity. 4) Immunoprecipitations show that Munc18-1 and Mint proteins are co-immunoprecipitated. Together, these data suggest that in brain, munc18-1 and Mint proteins form a complex. Since the affinity chromatography experiments and immunoprecipitations also purified syntaxin 1 that binds to Munc18-1 but not to Mint proteins, it is likely that brain contains a complex of Munc18-1, syntaxin 1, and Mint proteins. Although Doc2 proteins also interact with Munc18-1 (10Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P.H. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), Doc2 proteins are not copurified with Munc18-1 in the affinity chromatography experiments because the Doc2 interaction is relatively weak compared with the high affinity interaction of Mint proteins. Since both syntaxin 1 and Munc18-1 are essential for vesicle exocytosis, it seems likely that Mint proteins also function in exocytosis. Mint proteins have an unusual structure that includes domains not previously identified in vesicular trafficking proteins, suggesting a novel function. The PTB and PDZ domains in Mint proteins provide them with the potential to unite signal transduction (PTB domain), localization to intercellular junctions (PDZ domains), and vesicular membrane traffic (Munc18-1 binding). The presence of a PTB domain suggests a connection between neurotransmitter release and tyrosine phosphorylation and/or PIPs. Binding to phosphotyrosines could play a potential role in synaptic plasticity (26Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We showed that the PTB domain of Mint1 binds to PIPs in a specific reaction, an activity that could be important in view of the transient generation of PIPs during exocytosis (24Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takonawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Finally, the presence of PDZ domains in Mint proteins indicates a possible role for Mint proteins in connecting synaptic vesicles to the sites of synaptic intercellular junctions. PDZ domains are known in other proteins to localize peripheral proteins to intercellular junctions (17van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and may have an analogous function in Mint proteins. Based on the properties of Mint proteins, we would like to propose a two-stage model for synaptic vesicle exocytosis that is meant as a framework for future experiments. In the first stage (docking), we propose that the Mint·Munc18-1 complex provides a linkage between the plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles that docks the vesicles. Mint proteins could bind synaptic vesicles via their interaction with PIPs, and Munc18-1 could bind vesicles via its interaction with Doc2 proteins (10Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P.H. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The association of Mint proteins with the plasma membrane could be mediated by the binding of its PDZ domains to the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins (17van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the second stage (priming), the Mint·Munc18-1 complex delivers the docked vesicles to the syntaxin 1·SNAP-25 complex by a direct interaction. As a result, synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein on the vesicles binds to the syntaxin 1·SNAP-25 complex to form the core complex during membrane fusion. The model that we propose is highly speculative at present, but would provide potential explanations for two intriguing observations. First, Hay et al. (24Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takonawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) demonstrated an essential role for PIPs in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis from PC12 cells, suggesting that PIPs are important in exocytosis. A vesicle-docking mechanism mediated by binding of Mint proteins to PIPs is attractive because the transient production of PIPs could provide a highly localized signal for docking. Second, the so-called SNAREs synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein, SNAP-25, and syntaxin were shown to be essential for exocytosis, but not for the attachment of vesicles to the active zone (docking) (27Hunt J.M. Bommert K. Charlton M.P. Kistner A. Habermann E. Augustine G.J. Betz H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1269-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 28Broadie K. Prokop A. Bellen H.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20227-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our model explains why docking does not require syntaxin because we propose that docking is mediated by the binding of Mint proteins to the plasma membrane probably via its PDZ domains and by the binding of Mint proteins and Munc18-1 to synaptic vesicles via PIPs and Doc2 proteins. The proposed model also offers a potential explanation for how membrane traffic could be targeted to intercellular junctions by suggesting a role for PDZ domains in exocytosis. In view of the widespread occurrence of Munc18 homologues in cell types other than neurons, the model may also be applicable, at least in part, to the general process of exocytosis in non-neuronal cells.

https://openalex.org/W2147825853,"Increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) has been observed in several systems to correlate with a decreased ability of the insulin receptor to tyrosine-phosphorylate this endogenous substrate and to inhibit its subsequent association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In the present studies we have examined the potential role of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in the increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 observed in human embryonic kidney cells treated with an activator of protein kinase C, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. First, recombinantly produced kinase was shown to phosphorylate intact IRS-1 in a way that decreased the ability of isolated insulin receptor to phosphorylate the tyrosines recognized by the SH2 domains of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Second, an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation, PD98059, blocked the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced inhibition of the insulin-stimulated increase in IRS-1 associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Third, activation of MAP kinase in intact cells via a regulatable upstream kinase, a RAF:estrogen receptor construct, could also inhibit the insulin-stimulated increase in IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Fourth, an in gel kinase assay showed that MAP kinase was the primary renaturable kinase in cell extracts capable of phosphorylating an IRS-1 fusion protein. Finally, IRS-1 was found to associate in coprecipitation studies with endogenous MAP kinase. These studies implicate MAP kinase as one of the kinases capable of phosphorylating and regulating IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation.

Binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 to p85 leads to a 3–5-fold stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity (3Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol.

Although IRS-1 contains at least 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (1Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one (tyrosine 608) appears to be a principal site of interaction with the SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase, while three others (tyrosines 460, 939, and 987) play additional roles (6Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5291-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under several conditions resulting in cellular insulin resistance, such as activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (7Chin J.E. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19525-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In fact, IRS-1 contains numerous serine phosphorylation sites and is extensively serine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, possibly in part by casein kinase II (13Sun Z.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 14Tanasijevic M.J. Myers Jr M.G. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. White M.F. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18157-18166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IRS-1 contains 4 serines in the motif, Pro-X-Ser-Pro, a consensus sequence recognized by members of the MAP kinase family (15Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All 4 of these serines are located exactly 4 amino acids downstream of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and one (serine 612) is close to the major PI 3-kinase binding site, tyrosine 608. Moreover, serine 612 is phosphorylated upon PKC activation in a human kidney fibroblasts cell line (293 cells) (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and a mutant IRS-1 lacking this site is less inhibited by PKC activation. Since p42 and p44 MAP kinase activity are known to be stimulated by PKC (via the sequential activation of Raf and the MAP kinase kinase I (MEK1)), these kinases are potential candidates for mediating the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at this site (17Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar, 19Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). Two other subfamilies of MAP kinases, the stress-activated protein kinases (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinases) and p38 MAP kinase, are activated by a number of conditions causing a cellular stress response, such as osmotic shock, ultraviolet irradiation, transcriptional and translational inhibitors, and inflammatory cytokines (17Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar, 19Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). Thus, some of the same factors known to activate the various members of the MAP kinase family have been implicated in cellular insulin resistance.Previous studies have shown that PKC activation, both in CHO cells tranfected with PKCα (CHO/PKC cells) and in 293 cells stably expressing IRS-1 (293/IRS), results in decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and a decrease in its subsequent association with PI 3-kinase in whole cells. In the same studies, no decrease in IR autophosphorylation or in vitro kinase activity was observed (7Chin J.E. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6338-6347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recently this inhibition was found to correspond to the activation of a cytosolic serine kinase capable of phosphorylating IRS-1 and a synthetic peptide containing the sequence corresponding to serine 612 (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of a phosphate on serine 612 in this peptide also appears to inhibit the ability of the IR to phosphorylate the tyrosine in this peptide which corresponds to tyrosine 608 in IRS-1 (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the major PI 3-kinase binding site.The present studies were directed at identifying the Ser/Thr kinase responsible for phosphorylating IRS-1 and this IRS-1 peptide after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. Since the serine phosphorylation site in this peptide corresponds to a MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation site, we focused on the possibility that MAP kinase was responsible for this activity. A variety of approaches were utilized to investigate this question, including the use of a specific inhibitor of the upstream regulator of MAP kinase, MEK1, in vitro phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its peptide by recombinant ERK2, as well as expression of a regulatable Raf so that MAP kinase could be independently activated in cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMonoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 antibody for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Berkeley Antibody Co.

Chen D. Yang B.S. Garcia Ramirez J.J. Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNAzeo. To make the GST-IRS-1 fusion protein, anEcoRI fragment from pucIRS (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) containing nucleotides 2112–3283 of IRS-1 plus a 17 nucleotide stretch of the puc18 polylinker was cloned into pGEX4T2 (Invitrogen) to give pGEX-IRS-1B/R. The expressed fusion protein is approximately 70 kDa, corresponding to GST and residues 509–890 of IRS-1. For the Far Western studies, a 1-liter culture of pGEX-p852SH2 (21Wood E.R. McDonald O.B. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14138-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Edgar Wood, Burroughs Welcome) in BL21 cells was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors, sonicated on ice for a total of 3 min after which 1% Triton X-100 was added. Lysed cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm, and supernatants were filtered through a 0.25-μm filter and incubated with glutathione agarose at 4 °C for 2 h. GST-p85 was eluted with 1 ml of 15 mm glutathione and stored at 4 °C. The final concentration of eluted protein was approximately 800 μg/ml. For in-gel kinase assays, 1-liter cultures of BL21 cells containing pGEX-IRS-1B/R were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 6 m urea, PBS, and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatants were dialyzed overnight against PBS to remove urea. They were then incubated with glutathione agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The GST-IRS-1B/R was eluted with 2 ml of 40 mm glutathione and stored at 4 °C. The final concentration of eluted protein was approximately 500 μg/ml.Cell Culture and TransfectionsEpitope-tagged IRS-1 was transiently coexpressed with pcDNA-Raf:ER or pcDNAzeo (vector control) in 293T (a 293 line which constitutively expresses T antigen) or pBABE-Raf:ER/puro was stably expressed in 3T3-L1 cells by retroviral infection (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Transient transfections were performed in 293T cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fourteen to 17 h after transfection, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS for 24 h, at which point they were split 1:2 or 1:4 and grown for an additional 24–36 h. Retroviral infections were performed as described elsewhere (22Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). Cells were split 1:10 and 1:20 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/FCS containing 1.5 μg/ml puromycin 48 h after infection, and after 7 days surviving cell populations were screened for expression of Raf:ER by Western blotting with antibodies to the estrogen receptor. Positive cell populations were identified and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS.In Situ Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and p85 BindingTen- cm dishes of 293 cells stably expressing IRS-Myc (293/IRS) were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated with or without 1.6 μm PMA for 20 min followed by 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin. For the 3T3-L1-Raf:ER cells, they were differentiated as described, serum-starved for 16 h, followed by treatment with or without 1 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) for 2 h, then incubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin. 293T cells, transiently transfected with IRS-Myc and pcDNA-Raf:ER as described above, were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated with or without 1 μm 4-HT for 1 h, followed by treatment with or without 1 μm insulin. Cells were washed one time in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl (HBS) and lysed on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer A (50 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm vanadate, 100 mm NaF, 2.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and adsorbed with either anti-Myc or anti-p85 antibodies bound to protein G agarose to isolate total IRS-1 or p85-associated IRS-1, respectively. After 3 h at 4 °C, the agarose beads were washed two times in WGBT (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and one time in phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in gel loading buffer (40% glycerol, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 m dithiothreitol). After separation of the samples by SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon, the membrane was probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Membranes were stripped of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies by incubation in 2% phenyl phosphate in Tris/NaCl for 3 h, washed two times, and reprobed with either the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, a polyclonal antibody to p85, or a polyclonal antibody to IRS-1, followed by visualization by secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase and development with chromagenic substrates. Quantitation of the bands was performed by scanning and the amount of p85 associated or tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 was normalized to the total amounts of p85 or IRS-1 present in each lane and fold-insulin stimulation was calculated as the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the immunoprecipitates from insulin-treated cells versusuntreated cells.PI 3-Kinase Activity293 cells stably expressing IRS-Myc were serum-starved for 16 h and first treated with or without 50 μm PD98059 (a gift of Dr. Alan Saltiel, Warner Lambert), followed by treatment with or without 1 μm PMA, and then incubated with or without 1 μm insulin. Cells were lysed (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 200 μm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies bound to protein G-agarose. The beads were washed, incubated with 10 μg of PI and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated, and the phosphorylated PI was analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described previously (7Chin J.E. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6338-6347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were excised from the plates and counted.In Vitro Phosphorylation of IRS-1 by Recombinant ERK2293 cells expressing IRS-Myc were serum-starved 16 h and lysed in buffer A. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies bound to protein G-agarose. After 2 h, beads were washed two times in WGBT and one time in HBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (WGB). Either 1 μg of activated recombinant ERK2, activated with 0.25 μg of recombinant MEK in kinase buffer MEK (10 mm Hepes, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 30 °C, or 1 μg of unactivated ERK2 was added in 100 μl of MAP kinase buffer (final concentrations: 20 mm Hepes, 12 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 24 °C. Beads were washed twice in 1 m NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and once in PBS, boiled in gel loading buffer, and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Immobilon. Blots were probed with antibody to IRS-1; bands were excised and counted.Phosphorylation by IR and Far Western Blots with GST-p85IRS-1 was phosphorylated with ERK2 as described above, except that 1 mm cold ATP was added to MAP kinase buffer in place of the radioactive ATP. IR was prepared from one confluent 10-cm plate of 293 cells treated with 1.6 μm PMA, by incubation of the lysates with 60 μl of wheat germ agglutinin coupled to agarose and eluted with 60 μl of 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine as described previously. Either 10 μl of eluted IR, or 10 μl of the elution buffer, were added to each IRS-1 sample in the presence of 1 μm insulin, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Beads were washed three times in WGB followed by one wash in PBS, and IRS-1 was eluted and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Immobilon. Fifty μg of GST-p85 were preincubated with 100 μg of anti-GST antibody. After blocking, the membrane was incubated in a 10-ml solution containing a 1:500 dilution of the GST-p85/antibody complex in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% FCS, and 5% milk for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was then incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence as described for anti-phosphotyrosine blots. Blots were stripped with 200 mm glycine, pH 3.0, for 10 min, washed with TBS three times for 30 min each, and reprobed with anti-IRS-1 antibody. Quantitation was performed by scanning, and values were normalized to the total IRS-1 present in each lane.Phosphorylation of IRS-1 Peptide by Cytosolic Lysates and ERK2293T cells, transfected with IRS-Myc and ER-Raf, were serum-starved for 16 h, followed by treatment with or without 1 μm 4-HT for 1 h. Cells were scraped into 150 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 220 mm sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na-PPi, 2 mm Na-vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 μm okadaic acid), homogenized by 15 strokes, sonicated three times for 15 s, and centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatants (the cytosol) were removed, and Hepes (60 mm, final concentration) and MgCl2 (10 mm) were added. Sixty μl of cytosol were added to reaction tubes containing 100 μm IRS-1 peptide (KKHTDDGYMPMSPGVA) and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min at 24 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of buffer U (125 mmTris, pH 6.8, 6 m urea), and the samples were electrophoresed on 40% PAGE. Phosphorylated peptide bands were identified by autoradiography, excised, and counted. HEK 293/IRS cells were treated with or without 1.6 μm PMA for 20 min and lysed in lysis buffer A. Lysates were incubated with anti-ERK2 antibodies coupled to agarose for 2 h, the beads were washed three times in WGB, and then the bound ERK2 was incubated with varying concentrations of IRS-1 peptide and 100 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 20 min at 24 °C. One hundred μl of buffer U were added to the peptide-containing supernatants, and the samples were analyzed as described for cytosolic lysates.Coprecipitation of IRS-1 and ERK2293/IRS cells and 293T cells transfected with IRS-Myc and ER-Raf were treated with and without either 1.6 μm PMA or 1 μm 4-HT, respectively and lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies bound to protein G-agarose for 2 h. IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were either incubated with 100 μl of kinase mix with or without 100 μm IRS-1 peptide as described above or analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Immobilon and Western blotting with antibodies to ERK2. Blots were stripped and probed with antibodies to IRS-1. IRS-1 beads that had been incubated with kinase mix and peptide were microcentrifuged; peptide-containing supernatants were added to 100 μl of buffer U and analyzed by electrophoresis on 40% PAGE, and IRS-1 beads were washed and analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. Phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. Membranes were probed with antibodies to IRS-1, and either IRS-1 bands or peptide bands were excised and counted.In Gel Kinase AssaysConfluent 10-cm plates of 293/IRS cells were treated with or without 1.6 μm PMA for 20 min following overnight serum starvation, lysed in 200 μl of 1% SDS, PBS, passaged 10 times through an 18-gauge needle followed by 10 passages through a 21-gauge needle. Equal volumes of SDS loading buffer were added, and samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels containing either 0.1 mg/ml glutathione transferase or GST-IRS-1B/R. Gels were soaked for 4 h in 40 mm Hepes containing 2% isopropanol to remove SDS. Gels were incubated for 1 h in 30 ml of reaction buffer containing 20 mmHepes, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. Gels were washed three times in 40 mm Hepes for 1 h, followed by 1% Na-PPiin 5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h, stained 10 min with Coomassie Blue in 25% MeOH, 10% acetic acid, destained overnight, dried, and autoradiographed.Detection of Activated MAP KinaseConfluent 10-cm plates of 293/IRS cells were treated with 1.6 μm PMA for 20 min, or 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing ΔRaf:ER were treated with 1 μm 4-HT for 1 h. Cells were lysed as described previously; 10-μl samples (corresponding to 1/50 of a plate) were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Immobilon and immunoblotting with anti-active MAP kinase antibodies (Promega).DISCUSSIONPrior studies have indicated that increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 stimulated by a variety of factors interferes with both the ability of this molecule to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin treatment and its ability to subsequently associate with the PI 3-kinase (7Chin J.E.

Recent studies have implicated several serines in the IRS-1 molecule with this inhibitory response, including serines 612, 632, 662 and/or 731 (16DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

All 4 of these serine residues are in the consensus motif for MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (15Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies we provide evidence that MAP kinase can phosphorylate IRS-1 and is involved in the subsequent inhibition of insulin signaling. First, we have demonstrated that both recombinant ERK2 and ERK2 immunoprecipitated from PMA-treated 293/IRS cells have the ability to phosphorylate both full-length IRS-1 and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the serine 612 of IRS-1 (Fig. 2, Aand C). Second, we show that the major renaturable kinases in cell lysates from PMA-treated cells which can phosphorylate an IRS-1 fusion protein (containing residues 509–890) comigrate with ERK1 and 2 (Fig. 2"
https://openalex.org/W1977821533,"We proposed that the α2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein/fetuin family of serum proteins inhibits unwanted mineralization. To test this hypothesis in animals, we cloned the mouse fetuin gene and generated mice lacking fetuin. The gene consists of seven exons and six introns. The cystatin-like domains D1 and D2 of mouse fetuin are encoded by three exons each, whereas a single terminal exon encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain D3. The promoter structure is well conserved between rat and mouse fetuin genes within the regions shown to bind transcription factors in the rat system. Expression studies demonstrated that mice homozygous for the gene deletion lacked fetuin protein and that mice heterozygous for the null mutation produced roughly half the amount of fetuin protein produced by wild-type mice. Fetuin-deficient mice were fertile and showed no gross anatomical abnormalities. However, the serum inhibition of apatite formation was compromised in these mice as well as in heterozygotes. In addition, some homozygous fetuin-deficient female ex-breeders developed ectopic microcalcifications in soft tissues. These results corroborate a role for fetuin in serum calcium homeostasis. The fact that generalized ectopic calcification did not occur in fetuin-deficient mice proves that additional inhibitors of phase separation exist in serum.

Fetuins are plasma proteins that occur in high concentration (up to several grams/liter) during fetal life and gradually decrease in amount toward adulthood. The human species homologue is α2-HS1 glycoprotein (1Schultze H.E. Heide K. Haupt H. Naturwissenschaften. 1962; 49: 15-17Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar); hence, the genetic symbol for fetuins is “Ahsg.” Fetuins are members of the cystatin superfamily of proteins possessing two tandemly arranged cystatin domains and a third domain rich in proline and glycine. Secondary modifications, N-glycosylation,O-glycosylation (2Hayase T. Rice K.G. Dziegielewska K.M. Kuhlenschmidt M. Reilly T. Lee Y.C.

Despite this wealth of information on the structure of fetuins, their biological function is still far from clear. Functions proposed for fetuins are based on their ability to influence processes as diverse as opsonization, lipid transport, cell proliferation, tyrosine kinase inhibition of the insulin receptor, protease inhibition, and hematopoietic cell homing, all reviewed in a recently published monograph (6Dziegielewska K.M. Brown W.M. Fetuin. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1995Crossref Google Scholar), as well as transforming growth factor-β and bone morphogenetic protein cytokine binding (7Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and hepatocyte growth factor binding (8Ohnishi T. Nakamura O. Arakaki N. Daikuhara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Confusing but not necessarily contradictory, these results indicate molecular binding of fetuins to diverse target molecules. Binding is mediated by structural features of the protein part, as shown for transforming growth factor-β and apatite binding (7Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol.

Chong P. Long M.W. Wicha M.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 135-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to hematopoietic cells or binding of bovine fetuin to bacterial toxins (11Heerze L.D. Chong P.C. Armstrong G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25810-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In two cases, inhibition of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor signaling (8Ohnishi T. Nakamura O. Arakaki N. Daikuhara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the activity of fetuin is specific in that only serine-phosphorylated fetuin (phosphofetuin) is active, whereas the dephosphorylated form is inactive. In summary, fetuins could, like serum albumins, act as generic molecular carriers facilitating the transport of otherwise insoluble cargo molecules. Based on the finding that fetuins accumulate in bones and teeth as a major fraction of noncollagenous bone (12Triffitt J.T. Gebauer U. Ashton B.A. Owen M.E. Reynolds J.J. Nature. 1976; 262: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), a role in bone metabolism and turnover has been suggested. Our knowledge of molecular mechanisms initiating skeleton formation and mineralization has substantially increased over the past few years (13Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Recently, in a series of independent studies, it was shown that one critical component required for the very start of osteoblast differentiation and hence of skeleton mineralization is the transcription factor Osf2/Cbfa1 (14Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S. Lindhout D. Cole W.G. Henn S. Knoll J.H.M. Owen M.J. Mertelsmann R. Zabel B.U. Olsen B.R.

Regarding the opposite end, termination of mineralization and prevention of unwanted mineralization, we are still faced with the problem that most extracellular fluids are supersaturated salt solutions that must in fact be hindered from mineralizing spontaneously (18Neuman W.F. Urist M.R. Fundamental and Clinical Bone Physiology. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1980: 83-107Google Scholar). One effective inhibitor of calcification was discovered by targeted disruption of the gene for matrix GLA (γ-glutamic acid) protein (19Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). This protein is a tissue-bound inhibitor of spontaneous calcification, as lethal calcification of arteries and cartilage occurred in mice lacking matrix GLA protein. Recently, we determined that fetuins might be soluble, serum-derived inhibitors of unwanted mineralization, as fetuins inhibited apatite formation both in cell culture and in vitro (9Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect is mediated by acidic amino acids clustering in the cystatin-like domain D1. Fetuins account for roughly half of the capacity of serum to inhibit salt precipitation. Interestingly, despite extensive use of α2-HS/human fetuin as a forensic marker (20Westwood S.A. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), no complete deficiency has been reported to date. Therefore, lack of α2-HS is either phenotypically silent or prohibitive of full-term development. Evidence for either possibility can be obtained in a transgenic mouse model. To distinguish both possibilities, we cloned the mouse fetuin gene and produced mice lacking the entire fetuin gene. The Ahsg null mutant mice developed normally and reproduced four generations (through up to now). Biochemical analyses show that the ability of serum to inhibit apatite formation was reduced in the mutant mice. In addition, some homozygous fetuin-deficient female ex-breeders developed ectopic microcalcifications in soft tissues. This observation is consistent with a role for fetuins as inhibitors of phase separation in serum. To construct a vector for the targeting of the α2-HS glycoprotein/fetuin gene (Ahsg), we screened a mouse genomic library (derived from D3 ES 1The abbreviations used are: HS, Heremans Schmid; NF, nuclear factor. ES, embryonic stem; kb, kilobase(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. cells of strain 129, kindly provided by Drs. B. Bettenhausen and A. Gossler) with rat fetuin cDNA (21Rauth G. Pöschke O. Fink E. Eulitz M. Tippmer S. Kellerer M. Häring H.U. Nawratil P. Haasemann M. Jahnen-Dechent W. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We isolated two overlapping λEMBL3 clones containing a combined 28.4-kb DNA fragment that included the entire Ahsggene (6.4 kb), 7 kb of 5′-upstream sequence, and 15 kb of 3′-downstream sequence. The identity of the gene was confirmed by restriction mapping, probing with oligonucleotides corresponding to parts of the mouse fetuin cDNA sequence (22Yang F. Chen Z.L. Bergeron J.M. Cupples R.L. Friedrichs W.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and automated sequencing using a combined shotgun cloning and primer walking/sequencing approach. Contiguous traces were assembled and edited using SEQUENCHER software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Sequence data were analyzed by BLAST searches of the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank.

Transcription factor-binding sites were scored using MATINSPECTOR software and the TRANSFAC data base. 4Available athttp://transfac.gbf-braunschweig.de/cgi-bin/matSearch/ matsearch.pl. A replacement vector was constructed in several steps. The final targeting construct (see Fig. 3) was assembled in a vector consisting of an NdeI-AatII fragment of the pBR322 plasmid containing ORI and AmpR (24Blessing M. Nanney L.B. King L.E. Jones C.M. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), polylinker 1, a pMC1TKA+ cassette (25Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) in opposite transcriptional orientation to the adjacent pPGKNeoRA+ cassette (26Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), polylinker 2, and a pGKTKA+ cassette (26Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) in the same transcriptional orientation as the pPGKNeoRA+cassette. Into polylinker 1, we inserted a 2.2-kb HindIII fragment of Ahsg genomic sequence (ending 2.5 kb upstream of the start of the cDNA sequence as determined in Ref. 22Yang F. Chen Z.L. Bergeron J.M. Cupples R.L. Friedrichs W.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and into polylinker 2, we cloned a 13-kb BamHI fragment of genomic sequence (beginning 3 kb downstream of the fetuin gene polyadenylation signal). Thus, a 10.8-kb HindIII-BamHI genomic fragment containing the entire coding region of the fetuin gene was replaced by the pPGKNeoRA+ cassette positioned in the same transcriptional orientation as the Ahsggene. R1 embryonic stem cells (passage 16) (27Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar) were grown and electroporated with 150 μg ofPvuI-linearized Ahsg-neo replacement vector DNA as described (28Nagy A. Rossant J. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1993: 147-179Google Scholar). After positive-negative selection using G418 (300 μg/ml final concentration) and ganciclovir (2 μm final concentration), resistant clones were frozen, and replicas were used for DNA preparation (25Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). DNA from individual ES cell clones was digested with the ScaI restriction enzyme, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membrane. Blots were probed with a 0.9-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment located immediately upstream of the 2.2-kb HindIII fragment contained in the replacement vector. This probe detects a 13-kbScaI fragment in wild-type DNA and a 6.3-kb ScaI fragment in the correctly targeted mouse Ahsg locus (see Fig. 3). Blastocysts were harvested from 3.5-day postcoitum naturally mated C57BL/6 mice (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). About 15 ES cells were injected into each blastocoele, and blastocysts were implanted into the uterine horns of pseudopregnant female mice. Two chimeras were obtained in two independent blastocyst injection/transfer experiments. Both chimeric males transmitted the targeted Ahsg locus through the germ line. DNA was prepared by proteinase K digestion and extraction (30Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) of tail and ear biopsies taken at the time of weaning. Southern analysis was performed as described above for ES cells (see Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, the blots were stripped and reprobed with a 1.2-kb EcoRI fragment from mouse fetuin cDNA (22Yang F.

Yang (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). This probe detects the identical 13-kbScaI fragment in the wild-type Ahsg locus, but is not contained in the correctly targeted mouse Ahsglocus.Figure 2Comparison of the mouse and rat fetuin gene promoters.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For skeletal analysis, mice were eviscerated, fixed in ethanol, cleared in KOH, and consecutively stained with Alcian blue 8GX and alizarin S as described (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F.

Stain Technol. 1987; 62: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mouse sera were obtained from spontaneously clotted blood drawn by cardiac puncture. Serum fetuin level was measured by indirect ELISA using anti-mouse fetuin antiserum (diluted 1:5000), secondary peroxidase-labeled antibody, and the chromogenic substrate 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS, Boehringer Mannheim). Serum was prediluted 1000-fold and coated (50 μl) onto microtiter plates in a 2-fold dilution series. To estimate the inhibition of salt precipitation by serum, assays were done in 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1.6 mmNa2HPO4, and 4.8 mmCaCl2 containing a trace amount of45CaCl2. Sera were dialyzed by repeated spin dialysis against incubation buffer using Microcon 10 centrifuge concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). Inhibition of calcium salt precipitation was determined by incubation at 37 °C for 90 min. Salt precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation (15,000 × gfor 5 min at room temperature), dissolved in 0.5% acetic acid, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. All incubations were done in triplicates and independently repeated at least two times. Two overlapping genomic clones containing 28.5-kb contiguous genomic sequence were obtained from a mouse 129Sv library. Fig.1 A shows the structure ofAhsg, the fetuin gene locus. The restriction map of the combined clones comprises the fetuin gene of 7.5 kb, 8 kb 5′ to the first exon of the fetuin gene, and 13 kb 3′ to the fetuin gene. Upstream of the fetuin gene, we determined sequences rich in simple repeat structures. A similarity search of downstream sequence revealed extensive sequence similarity to mouse ORR1 transposon-like elements (GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession numbers U17092–U17095), also detected in noncoding regions of the mouse c-abl oncogene (GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession number U14721). Sequence analysis of the fetuin gene proper revealed simple repeat sequences, (GAAA) n and (GGAA) n , and SINE-type repeats (MMB1F) at positions 2099–2486. Additional simple repeats, (GAAA) n , (CAGA) n , (GAAA) n , and (GA) n , occurred dispersed throughout the introns at positions 3105–3241, 5594–5726, 6163–6227, 7105–7214, and 7165–7214, respectively. The exon-intron structure was similar to that of the rat fetuin gene (32Falquerho L. Patey G. Paquereau L. Rossi V. Lahuna O. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Levan G. Le Cam A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in that seven exons were also determined in the mouse fetuin gene. The exon-intron borders (Fig. 1 B, short underlines) were conserved between the rat and mouse genes, but introns were larger in the mouse gene than had been estimated for the rat gene (32Falquerho L.

A comparison of the aligned mouse fetuin promoter (Fig. 1 B,long underline) and the rat fetuin promoter (GenBank™/EMBL accession number M36547) is presented in Fig.2. Extensive sequence identity exists within 500 bases upstream of the transcription start point. Farther upstream, the promoter sequences diverge.

The genomic clones were used to construct a targeting vector for homologous recombination and positive-negative selection of recombinants (25Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig.3. Single clones resistant to G418 and ganciclovir were screened by Southern blot hybridization using probe A. Restriction enzyme digestion with ScaI generated a 13-kb fragment in the wild-type Ahsg locus, whereas the correctly recombined locus generated a 6.3-kb fragment (Fig.4 A). Three correctly targeted clones were identified among 800 resistant colonies, yielding a targeting frequency of ∼1 in 270. One of these clones consistently had a signal for the 13-kb fragment twice as strong as for the 6.3-kb fragment and therefore likely contained a chromosomal aberration. In addition, genomic DNA from ES cells and from litters of heterozygous crosses was digested with HindIII and probed with a mouse cDNA. This probe detected a 7-kb fragment in wild-type DNA and no fragment in the correctly targeted mouse Ahsg locus (Fig.4 B). Chimeras were generated by blastocyst injection from one targeted ES cell clone containing the two alleles in equimolar amounts. Two chimeras transmitted the correctly targeted locus through the germ line as demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA. Fig.4 C illustrates germ line transmission for a litter born to two heterozygous parents. The Ahsg null mutation in its homozygous state was maintained on a mixed 129Sv/C57BL/6 background. For further reference, the mutant strain is named B6,129-Ahsg tm1Mbl according to the rules of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources. Ahsg null mutant mice were born at the expected mendelian frequency from crosses of heterozygotes (example in Fig. 4 C). In an assembly of 120 total offspring, 32 mice were genotyped Ahsg wild-type (Ahsg +/+), 57 mice heterozygous (Ahsg +/−), and 31 mice homozygous (Ahsg −/−) for the null mutation. All mice were fertile and appeared healthy, with no gross abnormalities observed upon macroscopic inspection. A routine histological survey of major organs likewise indicated that mice can develop normally in the absence of zygotic fetuin (data not shown). In addition, the homozygousAhsg −/− genotype could be propagated into the F4 generation by now, indicating that Ahsg −/−need not be rescued by maternally supplied fetuin during embryonic development. We estimated the amount of fetuin present in 4-week-old wild-type Ahsg +/+, heterozygousAhsg +/−, and homozygousAhsg −/− mice by indirect ELISA. Mice were age-matched as fetuin levels in wild-type animals vary with age. In normal animals, the peak concentration of up to 1 mg/ml occurs in newborn mice, and the concentration decreases to levels around 0.200 mg/ml in adult wild-type mice. 5W. Jahnen-Dechent, unpublished observation. The ELISA was standardized with recombinant mouse fetuin expressed in Sf9 insect cells (9Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the ELISA measured 23.6 ± 7.3 ng/ml recombinant mouse fetuin at half-maximum absorbance (A 405 = 1.25). Compared with this standard, sera of 4-week-old Ahsg +/+,Ahsg +/−, and Ahsg −/−mice contained 0.84 ± 0.10 mg/ml, 0.28 ± 0.02 mg/ml, and no fetuin, respectively (Fig. 5). The data reflect the Ahsggene deletion on the protein level. Furthermore, the data indicate that fetuin gene copies are expressed independently of each other, as sera of heterozygous Ahsg +/− mice contained roughly half the amount of fetuin as sera of wild-typeAhsg +/+ mice. Fetuins accumulate in mineralized bone to high concentrations. Therefore, a biological role for fetuins has been proposed in the regulation of bone mineralization and turnover. Studies with primary osteoblasts from rat calvaria demonstrated that fetuins maintain the formation of mineralized bone nodules in this model system of bone mineralization (9Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Fetuins effectively prevented the precipitation of large amounts of apatite onto these cells that occurs in the absence of fetuins probably as a consequence of the high concentration of β-glycerophosphate required to induce mineralization in this system. To study in vivo the effect of lack of fetuin on mineralization, we performed bone and cartilage staining in normal and Ahsg −/− mice. In newborn mice, no obvious differences were observed in skeletal preparations ofAhsg +/+ and Ahsg −/−mice double-stained with Alcian blue for cartilage and alizarin red for mineralized bone. Fig. 6 Ashows stained skeletons of mice killed 2 days after birth. As in control Ahsg +/+ mice (Fig. 6 A,left), no gross skeletal deformations were present inAhsg −/− mice (Fig. 6 A,right). Upon casual inspection of the major bones, calvarial morphology and sutures, rib number and morphology, and bone length and morphology all appeared normal in Ahsg −/− mice compared with Ahsg +/+ mice and with published data on younger mice (embryonic day 18) (39Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press Ltd./Harcourt Brace & Co., London1992: 502Google Scholar). At 4 months of age, bothAhsg −/− and wild-typeAhsg +/+ mice displayed variable morphology of the costochondral junction in that the boundary between cartilage (blue) and mineralized bone (red) ranged from sharp and well defined (Fig. 6 B, left) to fuzzy and extended (Fig. 6 B, right). Double-blind examination of 18 Ahsg −/−,Ahsg +/−, and Ahsg +/+mice revealed no co-segregation of this phenotypic variation withAhsg genotype. Therefore, we conclude that deletion of the fetuin gene does not result in skeletal anomalies beyond normal variation. We observed ectopic microcalcification of soft tissues (neck, intercostal muscle, and leg muscles) in a limited number of fetuin-deficient female ex-breeders (Fig. 6 C). Ectopic calcification was not detectable in age-matched wild-type ex-breeders. It is known that serum contains inhibitors of salt precipitation (40Blumenthal N.C. Betts F. Posner A.S. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1975; 18: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown by affinity depletion of sera that fetuins contribute roughly 30% to the inhibitory activity of whole serum (9Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To test this biochemical finding, we studied the inhibition of apatite formation in sera from wild-type and mutant mice. For simplicity and improved reproducibility, we modified the original experimental setup for precipitation assays"

Laminin-1 (α1β1γ1), self-assembles through a calcium-dependent thermal gelation requiring binding interactions between N-terminal short arm domains, forming a meshwork polymer thought to contribute to basement membrane architecture (Yurchenco, P.

Laminin-5, on the other hand, neither polymerized nor co-polymerized with laminin-1. Laminin-6 failed to co-aggregate with laminin-1 at all concentrations evaluated, evidence for a lack of a related self-assembly activity.

Basement membranes are animal extracellular matrices that appear early in development and that are present in nearly all tissues. They act as supportive architecture for communities of cells, providing differentiation and migration information that are transmitted through cell receptors. These matrices consist of one or more members of the laminin family, one or more members of the type IV collagen family, entactin/nidogen, and smaller amounts of other components such as perlecan (heparan sulfate proteoglycan). From studies of the extracellular matrix components originally discovered in the EHS 1The abbreviations used are: EHS, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm; HMB, p-hydroxymecuribenzoic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviations used are: EHS, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm; HMB, p-hydroxymecuribenzoic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin. matrix and elsewhere, a model for the assembly and architecture of an idealized basement membrane scaffolding has been proposed (1Yurchenco P.D. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 351-388Crossref Google Scholar, 2Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Central to this model are the binding interactions of “classical” laminin, type IV collagen, and entactin/nidogen in which three groups of interactions play key roles: type IV collagen polymerization, laminin polymerization, and the stabilizing connections of entactin/nidogen. The type IV collagen network consists of triple helical monomers joined together through lateral, N-terminal, and C-terminal interactions (3Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,4Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The N-terminal (7S) and C-terminal (NC-1) bonds become stabilized by reducible and irreducible covalent cross-links. The laminin polymer is self-assembled from monomers in a calcium-dependent, reversible, and cooperative heat-gelation with a measured critical concentration of assembly of 70–140 nm (5Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Schittny J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3981-3991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been found, based on biochemical and electron microscopic studies conducted with laminin-1 and laminin-1 fragments, that all three short arms are involved in polymerization and furthermore all three appear to be essential for assembly (7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y. Carbonetto S. Cheng Y.S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9398-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Entactin/nidogen can form a stable noncovalent bridge between laminin and type IV collagen and also bind to perlecan and the fibulins (2Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The resulting architecture, as proposed, is that of a double polymer network bearing stabilizing entactin/nidogen cross-links.However, the different laminin and type IV collagen family isoforms recently identified may provide a molecular basis for distinct architectural variations that in turn create functional diversity. Naturally occurring and targeted mutations in the various chains of these two families illustrate functional differences. For example, mutations in the chains of laminin-5 cause skin blistering, with a loss of epidermal-dermal anchorage at hemidesmosome sites in diverse tissues. A null mutation in the β2 chain of laminin, present in glomerulus, leads to profound renal failure despite apparent compensation by the β1 chain. Mutations that affect the α2 chain of laminin-2 can cause a muscular dystrophy despite partial replacement of this chain by the α1 chain (9Xu H. Christmas P. Wu X.R. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5572-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Xu H. Wu X.R. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Nat.

Genet. 1995; 4: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Two questions arise. First, how universal is the laminin self-assembly model? Second, if there are differences in self-assembly properties among different members of the laminin and collagen-IV families, what are these differences and can they explain basement membrane structural and functional heterogeneity? In the case of the laminins, we already recognize five α, three β, and two γ subunits that can combine into at least eleven heterotrimeric molecules (12Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R. Ekblom P.

At the level of domain structure, one can define three groups: laminins that contain a complete complement of domains (laminins-1, -2, -3, -4, -10, -11), laminin which lacks domains in all three short arms (laminin-5 containing the common α3A chain splice variant), and laminins which lack an α chain short arm but which retain full-sized β and γ chains (laminins-6, -7, -8, and -9). The three-short arm hypothesis for laminin assembly predicts that only the “full-sized” laminins that have three short arms would be able to readily polymerize.In this study we have evaluated the capacity of two full-sized laminin isoforms, a laminin isoform bearing extensive short arm truncations, and a laminin isoform bearing a truncation of a single short arm, to self-assemble. In developing approaches to study some laminin isoforms, we needed to overcome the problem that unlike laminin-1, the other forms of laminin can be obtained in only modest (laminins-2, -4, and -5) or only very small (laminin-6) amounts. A solution to this difficulty was accomplished by developing a specific laminin co-polymerization assay which exploits the abundance of laminin-1, using it to drive the specific polymerization of other laminin isoforms. From the analysis we found that only full-size laminins were capable of laminin-1 type self-assembly.DISCUSSIONEarlier studies have shown that laminin-1 reversibly self-assembles into a lattice-like polymer and that this polymer is present in the basement membranes of embryonal carcinoma cells, EHS tumor, and mouse placenta (1Yurchenco P.D. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 351-388Crossref Google Scholar, 6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The assembly process is a cooperative heat-gelation in which divalent cation, in particular calcium, is required. Given evidence that type IV collagen separately polymerizes using N-terminal, C-terminal, and lateral associations into a covalently stabilized network (3Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and that entactin/nidogen binds firmly to both the laminin γ1 chain and to the triple helix of type IV collagen (26Mayer U. Timpl R. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mechan R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 389-416Crossref Google Scholar), a model for the assembly and structure of an idealized basement membrane has been described (reviewed in Refs. 1Yurchenco P.D. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 351-388Crossref Google Scholar and26Mayer U. Timpl R. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mechan R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 389-416Crossref Google Scholar). The model, however, is limited in that it only considers the classical basement membrane components, i.e. those first identified in the EHS tumors and several cultured cell lines. We have now characterized four laminin isoforms with respect to their ability to form a network polymer in a manner similar to laminin-1.Laminin-2 and laminin-4, both possessing three full short arms, were found to polymerize in a time-, concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. Self-assembly was cooperative with an apparent critical concentration of 0.2 μm, about twice the value (0.07 - 0.14 μm) observed for laminin-1. This self-assembly appeared to be closely related to that found for laminin-1 for several reasons. First, all polymerizations were inhibited by EDTA and N-terminal laminin-1 fragments E4 and E1′, the latter two previously shown to be specific inhibitors of laminin-1 self-assembly (6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, laminin-2/4 fragments inhibited laminin-1 polymerization. Third, when laminin-1 was maintained above its critical concentration, and one or both of the laminin isoforms were maintained above or below their critical concentration, co-aggregation was observed. This co-aggregation occurred with isolated laminin-2 and laminin-4, but was better between laminin-1 and -2 compared with laminin-1 and -4. A possible explanation for the difference is that laminin-1 shares two chains in common with laminin-2 but only one chain in common with laminin-4. Thus the three laminins co-polymerize and, when expressed together, can form a composite network using similar bonds between the different isoforms. Since laminin-2 and laminin-4 have α2β1γ1 and α2β2γ1 chain compositions, respectively, one can deduce that laminin-3, which has an α1β2γ1 chain composition, also polymerizes. In contrast to the full-sized isoforms, laminin-5 (α3Aβ3γ2), a rod-like molecule whose short arms lack most of their domains, was found not to polymerize at concentrations at or below 1 mg/ml, nor to co-polymerize with laminin-1. Furthermore, laminin-6 (α3Aβ1γ1), a Y-shaped laminin with two short arms, did not co-polymerize with laminin-1 and therefore, given the association between polymerization and co-polymerization, probably does not self-assemble in a manner similar to laminin-1. It is even possible, although it could not be evaluated in this study, that at higher concentrations of laminin-6 one would observe an inhibitory effect of the isoform on laminin-1, in a manner analogous to the double short arm structure E1′ (7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The self-assembly behavior of these isoforms fits a prediction of a three-arm interaction model which holds that the polymer is formed by the joining of the ends of the three short arms to create a lattice-like array (6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of laminin-5, which lacks most of the short arm domains (although does possess one domain 6 homologue in the β3 chain), to self-assemble is consistent with the above hypothesis. A more exacting test of the model, however, was provided by laminin-6. This laminin, like laminins-7, -8, and -9, and unlike laminins-1, -2, -4, has two rather than three full short arms and would be expected either not to polymerize/co-polymerize or to polymerize/co-polymerize poorly. The inability of laminin-6 to co-polymerize with laminin-1 argues that the three-arm assembly hypothesis is correct. Note that this non-co-polymerizing laminin shares two short arms (β1, γ1) in common with laminin-1, in contrast to the co-polymerizing laminin-2, which also shares two short arms (β1, γ1), and even the co-polymerizing laminin-4, which shares only one short arm (γ1) in common with laminin-1. Thus presence of an α chain short arm appears to be critical for laminin self-assembly. Recent studies 4H. Colognato and P. D. Yurchenco, unpublished results. reveal that laminin-2 isolated from the dystrophic dy 2Jmouse, which only lacks α2-domain VI, co-polymerizes poorly with laminin-1. This domain is of course absent in laminin-6 and suggests that loss of only the N-terminal globule of the α chain adversely affects self-assembly.The co-polymerization assay has proved to be a useful tool in the current study to evaluate the self-assembly properties of other isoforms in amounts below their critical concentrations. The property of co-polymerization furthermore suggests that where a given basement membrane contains a mixture of two or more polymerizing laminins, these laminins will form a cooperative network unless specifically prevented by other immobilizing bonds. Laminins-1, -2, and -4 share this property (Fig. 12). Laminin-5 can form a disulfide-stabilized bond to laminin-6 or laminin-7 (27Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Champliaud M.F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) but cannot bind to entactin/nidogen (29Mayer U. Poschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Laminins-6 and -7, on the other hand, can bind to entactin/nidogen (and indirectly to the type IV collagen network), since they possess a γ1 chain. It appears that laminin-5 forms a cable-like structure connecting the hemidesmosome of the epidermis with the underlying dermis through type VII collagen and links this cabling through the rest of the basement membrane through laminins-6 and -7 (30Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. van der Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that laminins-5, -6, and -7 have other as yet undiscovered matrix binding interactions. It is conceivable that laminins lacking critical short arms domain could form large oligomeric or polymeric complexes using a completely different set of bonds compared with laminin-1. However, it is difficult to imagine how this would occur given the homology of the remaining short arm domains with those present in laminin-1 that are found not to participate in any detectable self-assembly. Basement membranes are animal extracellular matrices that appear early in development and that are present in nearly all tissues. They act as supportive architecture for communities of cells, providing differentiation and migration information that are transmitted through cell receptors. These matrices consist of one or more members of the laminin family, one or more members of the type IV collagen family, entactin/nidogen, and smaller amounts of other components such as perlecan (heparan sulfate proteoglycan).

Central to this model are the binding interactions of “classical” laminin, type IV collagen, and entactin/nidogen in which three groups of interactions play key roles: type IV collagen polymerization, laminin polymerization, and the stabilizing connections of entactin/nidogen. The type IV collagen network consists of triple helical monomers joined together through lateral, N-terminal, and C-terminal interactions (3Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H.

The N-terminal (7S) and C-terminal (NC-1) bonds become stabilized by reducible and irreducible covalent cross-links. The laminin polymer is self-assembled from monomers in a calcium-dependent, reversible, and cooperative heat-gelation with a measured critical concentration of assembly of 70–140 nm (5Yurchenco P.D.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been found, based on biochemical and electron microscopic studies conducted with laminin-1 and laminin-1 fragments, that all three short arms are involved in polymerization and furthermore all three appear to be essential for assembly (7Yurchenco P.D.

Entactin/nidogen can form a stable noncovalent bridge between laminin and type IV collagen and also bind to perlecan and the fibulins (2Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The resulting architecture, as proposed, is that of a double polymer network bearing stabilizing entactin/nidogen cross-links. However, the different laminin and type IV collagen family isoforms recently identified may provide a molecular basis for distinct architectural variations that in turn create functional diversity. Naturally occurring and targeted mutations in the various chains of these two families illustrate functional differences. For example, mutations in the chains of laminin-5 cause skin blistering, with a loss of epidermal-dermal anchorage at hemidesmosome sites in diverse tissues. A null mutation in the β2 chain of laminin, present in glomerulus, leads to profound renal failure despite apparent compensation by the β1 chain. Mutations that affect the α2 chain of laminin-2 can cause a muscular dystrophy despite partial replacement of this chain by the α1 chain (9Xu H. Christmas P. Wu X.R. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5572-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Xu H. Wu X.R. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Nat.

Second, if there are differences in self-assembly properties among different members of the laminin and collagen-IV families, what are these differences and can they explain basement membrane structural and functional heterogeneity? In the case of the laminins, we already recognize five α, three β, and two γ subunits that can combine into at least eleven heterotrimeric molecules (12Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R. Ekblom P.

At the level of domain structure, one can define three groups: laminins that contain a complete complement of domains (laminins-1, -2, -3, -4, -10, -11), laminin which lacks domains in all three short arms (laminin-5 containing the common α3A chain splice variant), and laminins which lack an α chain short arm but which retain full-sized β and γ chains (laminins-6, -7, -8, and -9). The three-short arm hypothesis for laminin assembly predicts that only the “full-sized” laminins that have three short arms would be able to readily polymerize. In this study we have evaluated the capacity of two full-sized laminin isoforms, a laminin isoform bearing extensive short arm truncations, and a laminin isoform bearing a truncation of a single short arm, to self-assemble. In developing approaches to study some laminin isoforms, we needed to overcome the problem that unlike laminin-1, the other forms of laminin can be obtained in only modest (laminins-2, -4, and -5) or only very small (laminin-6) amounts. A solution to this difficulty was accomplished by developing a specific laminin co-polymerization assay which exploits the abundance of laminin-1, using it to drive the specific polymerization of other laminin isoforms. From the analysis we found that only full-size laminins were capable of laminin-1 type self-assembly. DISCUSSIONEarlier studies have shown that laminin-1 reversibly self-assembles into a lattice-like polymer and that this polymer is present in the basement membranes of embryonal carcinoma cells, EHS tumor, and mouse placenta (1Yurchenco P.D. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 351-388Crossref Google Scholar, 6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The assembly process is a cooperative heat-gelation in which divalent cation, in particular calcium, is required. Given evidence that type IV collagen separately polymerizes using N-terminal, C-terminal, and lateral associations into a covalently stabilized network (3Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and that entactin/nidogen binds firmly to both the laminin γ1 chain and to the triple helix of type IV collagen (26Mayer U. Timpl R. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mechan R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 389-416Crossref Google Scholar), a model for the assembly and structure of an idealized basement membrane has been described (reviewed in Refs. 1Yurchenco P.D. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 351-388Crossref Google Scholar and26Mayer U. Timpl R. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mechan R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 389-416Crossref Google Scholar). The model, however, is limited in that it only considers the classical basement membrane components, i.e. those first identified in the EHS tumors and several cultured cell lines. We have now characterized four laminin isoforms with respect to their ability to form a network polymer in a manner similar to laminin-1.Laminin-2 and laminin-4, both possessing three full short arms, were found to polymerize in a time-, concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. Self-assembly was cooperative with an apparent critical concentration of 0.2 μm, about twice the value (0.07 - 0.14 μm) observed for laminin-1. This self-assembly appeared to be closely related to that found for laminin-1 for several reasons. First, all polymerizations were inhibited by EDTA and N-terminal laminin-1 fragments E4 and E1′, the latter two previously shown to be specific inhibitors of laminin-1 self-assembly (6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, laminin-2/4 fragments inhibited laminin-1 polymerization. Third, when laminin-1 was maintained above its critical concentration, and one or both of the laminin isoforms were maintained above or below their critical concentration, co-aggregation was observed. This co-aggregation occurred with isolated laminin-2 and laminin-4, but was better between laminin-1 and -2 compared with laminin-1 and -4. A possible explanation for the difference is that laminin-1 shares two chains in common with laminin-2 but only one chain in common with laminin-4. Thus the three laminins co-polymerize and, when expressed together, can form a composite network using similar bonds between the different isoforms. Since laminin-2 and laminin-4 have α2β1γ1 and α2β2γ1 chain compositions, respectively, one can deduce that laminin-3, which has an α1β2γ1 chain composition, also polymerizes. In contrast to the full-sized isoforms, laminin-5 (α3Aβ3γ2), a rod-like molecule whose short arms lack most of their domains, was found not to polymerize at concentrations at or below 1 mg/ml, nor to co-polymerize with laminin-1. Furthermore, laminin-6 (α3Aβ1γ1), a Y-shaped laminin with two short arms, did not co-polymerize with laminin-1 and therefore, given the association between polymerization and co-polymerization, probably does not self-assemble in a manner similar to laminin-1. It is even possible, although it could not be evaluated in this study, that at higher concentrations of laminin-6 one would observe an inhibitory effect of the isoform on laminin-1, in a manner analogous to the double short arm structure E1′ (7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The self-assembly behavior of these isoforms fits a prediction of a three-arm interaction model which holds that the polymer is formed by the joining of the ends of the three short arms to create a lattice-like array (6Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of laminin-5, which lacks most of the short arm domains (although does possess one domain 6 homologue in the β3 chain), to self-assemble is consistent with the above hypothesis. A more exacting test of the model, however, was provided by laminin-6. This laminin, like laminins-7, -8, and -9, and unlike laminins-1, -2, -4, has two rather than three full short arms and would be expected either not to polymerize/co-polymerize or to polymerize/co-polymerize poorly. The inability of laminin-6 to co-polymerize with laminin-1 argues that the three-arm assembly hypothesis is correct. Note that this non-co-polymerizing laminin shares two short arms (β1, γ1) in common with laminin-1, in contrast to the co-polymerizing laminin-2, which also shares two short arms (β1, γ1), and even the co-polymerizing laminin-4, which shares only one short arm (γ1) in common with laminin-1. Thus presence of an α chain short arm appears to be critical for laminin self-assembly. Recent studies 4H. Colognato and P. D. Yurchenco, unpublished results. reveal that laminin-2 isolated from the dystrophic dy 2Jmouse, which only lacks α2-domain VI, co-polymerizes poorly with laminin-1. This domain is of course absent in laminin-6 and suggests that loss of only the N-terminal globule of the α chain adversely affects self-assembly.The co-polymerization assay has proved to be a useful tool in the current study to evaluate the self-assembly properties of other isoforms in amounts below their critical concentrations. The property of co-polymerization furthermore suggests that where a given basement membrane contains a mixture of two or more polymerizing laminins, these laminins will form a cooperative network unless specifically prevented by other immobilizing bonds. Laminins-1, -2, and -4 share this property (Fig. 12). Laminin-5 can form a disulfide-stabilized bond to laminin-6 or laminin-7 (27Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Champliaud M.F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) but cannot bind to entactin/nidogen (29Mayer U. Poschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Laminins-6 and -7, on the other hand, can bind to entactin/nidogen (and indirectly to the type IV collagen network), since they possess a γ1 chain. It appears that laminin-5 forms a cable-like structure connecting the hemidesmosome of the epidermis with the underlying dermis through type VII collagen and links this cabling through the rest of the basement membrane through laminins-6 and -7 (30Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. van der Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that laminins-5, -6, and -7 have other as yet undiscovered matrix binding interactions. It is conceivable that laminins lacking critical short arms domain could form large oligomeric or polymeric complexes using a completely different set of bonds compared with laminin-1. However, it is difficult to imagine how this would occur given the homology of the remaining short arm domains with those present in laminin-1 that are found not to participate in any detectable self-assembly. Earlier studies have shown that laminin-1 reversibly self-assembles into a lattice-like polymer and that this polymer is present in the basement membranes of embryonal carcinoma cells, EHS tumor, and mouse placenta (1Yurchenco P.D.

The early phase of murine embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, characterized by a gradual growth arrest, is accompanied with hsp27 transient accumulation. This differentiation process also correlated with changes in hsp27 phosphorylation and oligomerization. The role of hsp27 was investigated in ES clones stably transfected with murine or human hsp27 genes, placed in sense or antisense orientation. Several clones were obtained that either underexpressed endogenous murine hsp27 or overexpressed murine or human hsp27. Maintained undifferentiated, these clones showed similar growth rates. We report here that hsp27 constitutive overexpression enhanced the differentiation-mediated decreased rate of ES cell proliferation but did not alter morphological changes. In contrast, hsp27 underexpression, which attenuated cell growth arrest, induced differentiation abortion because of an overall cell death by apoptosis. Recently, we showed that hsp27 interfered with cell death probably because of its ability to modulate intracellular glutathione. hsp27 accumulation during ES cell differentiation was also correlated with an increase in glutathione, which was attenuated by hsp27 down-expression. Hence, hsp27 transient expression seems essential for preventing differentiating ES cells from undergoing apoptosis, a switch that may be redox regulated.

Recently, we reported that SHSP are also negative regulators of apoptosis that counteract Fas/APO-1 or staurosporine-induced programmed cell death (12Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). To explain the protective activity of SHSP, it has been proposed that these proteins act as molecular chaperones (13Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or actin capping/decapping enzymes (14Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vanderkerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell.

In addition, we recently reported that the expression of SHSP from different species induced an increase in glutathione that resulted in a decreased level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (10Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). This conserved property was found to be essential for the protective activity of SHSP against oxidative stress- or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death. An interesting feature of SHSP concerns their transient expression during development and cell differentiation. This was first observed inDrosophila (reviewed in Ref. 16Arrigo A.-P. Tanguay R.M. Hightower L. Nover L. Heat Shock and Development. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 106-119Google Scholar), and studies performed in other organisms revealed the ubiquitous nature of this phenomenon (reviewed in Refs. 1Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R.

Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Remarkably, during Drosophiladevelopment, Dhsp27 accumulates during the differentiation of imaginal discs, suggesting that this protein plays a role in this process (18Pauli D. Tonka C.-H. Tissières A. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 817-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent studies have strengthened the hypothesis that the mammalian small stress protein hsp27 is linked to the differentiation process. Indeed, this protein is transiently expressed and/or phosphorylated during the early differentiation of several mammalian cells including embryonal carcinoma and stem cells (19Stahl J. Wobus A.M. Ihrig S. Lutsch G. Bielka H. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Ehrlich ascites cells (20Benndorf R. Kraft R. Otto A. Stahl J. Bohm H. Bielka H. Biochem.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the expression and function of hsp27 during the in vitro pluripotential differentiation of embryonic CGR8 embryonic stem cells obtained through leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. We show that the early phase of the differentiation process is accompanied by a transient accumulation of hsp27, which occurs concomitantly with a decreased rate of cellular proliferation. hsp27 accumulation was preceded by an increase in the level of the mRNA encoding this protein. The transient increase in hsp27 level was also time correlated with an increased oligomerization of this protein, a phenomenon that was preceded by hsp27 dephosphorylation. As an approach toward understanding the role of hsp27 during cell differentiation, we have analyzed CGR8 cells that either under- or overexpressed endogenous murine hsp27 or overexpressed human hsp27. The different cell lines obtained showed similar growth rates in the presence of LIF. However, following LIF withdrawal, the differentiation-mediated decreased rate of cell proliferation was inversely proportional to the level of hsp27 present within the cell. Although murine or human hsp27 overexpression did not seem to modify the differentiation-mediated morphological changes, the underexpression of endogenous hsp27 provoked an abortion of the differentiation process because of an overall cell death by apoptosis. Remarkably, during CGR8 cell differentiation, the raise in hsp27 level correlated with an increase in glutathione, a redox modulator described as being essential for the differentiation process (27Esposito F. Agosti V. Morrone G. Morra F. Cuomo C. Russo T. Venuta S. Cimino F. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The raise in glutathione was less intense in cells that underexpress hsp27. These results are discussed in view of a role of hsp27 as switch that allows differentiating cells to escape from apoptosis through a redox-dependent mechanism. The murine embryonic stem cell CGR8 was obtained from A. Smith (Center of Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, UK). Undifferentiated CGR8 cells were grown on gelatinized flasks in BHK21 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with LIF (1/1000 conditioned medium from p10-6R DIA-LIF transfected COS cell line) (28Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donalson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), 0.05 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 × minimal essential medium, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To induce differentiation, CGR8 cells were dissociated by trypsinization and seeded at 3 × 105 cells/ml on bacterial grade Petri dishes (Bibby Sterilin Ltd., Stone, UK) in LIF-devoid growth medium. The mammalian expression vector psvK3 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) bearing or not human (psvhsp27; Ref. 9Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.-P. J. Immunol. 1995; 215: 363-374Google Scholar) or murine (psvWT; Ref. 29Knauf U. Jakob U. Engel K. Buchner J. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) hsp27 cDNAs under the control of the early promoter of SV40 virus were used. To construct antisense expression vectors EcoRI-EcoRI orSacI-SacI, DNA fragments containing the entire human or murine hsp27 coding sequences, respectively, were subcloned in reverse orientation in the corresponding site of psvK3 polylinker; these expression vectors were denoted psvant-hhsp27 (human hsp27) and psvant-mhsp27 (murine hsp27). Anti-hsp70 serum was from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, UK). The specificity of anti-human hsp27 and anti-murine hsp27 antibodies was as previously described (2Arrigo A.-P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,9Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.-P. J. Immunol. 1995; 215: 363-374Google Scholar). DNA transfection was performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (Bio-Rad). 5 × 106 CGR8 cells were resuspended in Opti-MEM medium (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) and incubated 10 min at room temperature in the presence of DNA made of 10 μg of pMC1neopoly(A) plasmid (30Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morle F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 50 μg of psvK3, psvant-hhsp27, psvant-mhsp27, psvhsp27, or psvWT vector. After being electroporated (500 microfarads, 250 V), cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then reseeded on gelatin-treated flasks in BHK-21 medium. 250 μg/ml G418 were added 48 h after electroporation, and resistant clones were isolated 10 days later. Cellular proliferation was monitored by counting cells using a hemocytometer chamber and a Nikon TMS inverted photomicroscope equipped with phase-contrast equipment. Cells were also labeled for 1 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham International) as described by Mehlen and Arrigo (3Mehlen P. Arrigo A.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 321-334Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis was performed essentially as described by Susuki et al. (31Susuki K. Watanabe M. Miyoshi J. Radiat. Res. 1992; 129: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At different times before and following LIF removal, cells were washed, fixed with ethanol, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with RNase I. 50 μg/ml propidium iodide were added, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Facscalibur, Becton Dickinson, Belgium). Total RNA from undifferentiated CGR8 cells or CGR8 cells derived from embryoid bodies were prepared with RNAzolTMB (Bioprobe-Interchim, Montluçon, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR analyses, 1 μg of total RNA was denatured for 10 min at 65 °C and reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C in a medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm dithiothreitol (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), 0.5 μm random hexamers (Pharmacia, St-Quentin-Yvelines, France), 0.5 μm of each dNTP (Pharmacia), 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions were stopped by incubating the mixtures 5 min at 95 °C. For PCR reactions, 5 μl of the RT reactions were transferred in a medium containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.2 μm of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). HPRT-, collagen IV-, or β-major globin-specific primers were identical to those described by Kelleret al. (32Keller G. Kennedy M. Papayannopoulou T. Wiles M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler for 30 cycles with a regimen of 94 °C for 1.5 min, 50 °C (for HPRT) or 55 °C (for collagen IV and β-major globin) for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. Aliquots (10 μl) of each PCR reaction were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (2% agarose Nu sieve; Tebu, France) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. RNA (10 μg) was analyzed in 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond C extra membrane (Amersham International); hybridization was then performed at 65 °C (33Yang H. McLeese J. Weisbart M. Dionne J.L. Lemaire I. Aubin R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3337-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The murine hsp27 probe was a 0.6-kilobase SacI cDNA fragment of the psvWT plasmid (29Knauf U. Jakob U. Engel K. Buchner J. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At different times before and following LIF removal, CGR8 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The 20,000 × g supernatants were then applied to a Sepharose 6B gel filtration column (1 × 100 cm) (Pharmacia, Sweden), equilibrated, and developed in the lysis buffer devoid of Triton X-100. The presence of hsp27 in the fraction eluted of the column was detected by one-dimensional immunoblot analysis using anti-hsp27 serum. Molecular mass markers used to calibrate the gel filtration column included blue dextran (>2,000,000 Da), thyroglobulin (669,000 Da), apoferritin (440,000 Da), β-amylase (200,000 Da), and carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da). One- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblots using hsp27 or hsp70 antisera were performed as already described (9Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.-P. J. Immunol. 1995; 215: 363-374Google Scholar, 11Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Briolay J. Fostan P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.-P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and revealed with the ECL kit from Amersham Corp. Autoradiographs were recorded onto X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). A Bioprofil system (Vilber Lourmat, France) was used for quantification. The analysis was performed within the range of proportionality of the film. The level of hsp27 expressed in CGR8 cells was compared with serial dilutions of the purified protein (StressGen Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The vital dye Trypan blue (Sigma, St-Quentin, France) was used to monitor cell death (9Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.-P. J. Immunol. 1995; 215: 363-374Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was analyzed essentially as described by Hockenberyet al. (35Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a medium containing 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and nucleic acids were precipitated in ethanol before being analyzed by gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose; Nu sieve, Tebu, France). Thereafter, the gel was incubated for at least 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 20 μg/ml RNase A before being stained with ethidium bromide. Total cellular content glutathione from undifferentiated CGR8 cells (6 × 106 cells) or CGR8 cells derived from embryoid bodies was determined by the Bioxytech GSH-400 enzymatic method from OXIS International (Bonneuil-sur-Marne, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immediately following LIF removal, CGR8 cells gradually decreased their growth rate and underwent pluripotential differentiation. The accumulation of markers, which are specific for different tissues, was used to follow the differentiation of these cells (32Keller G. Kennedy M. Papayannopoulou T. Wiles M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). This was assessed by specific RT-PCR analysis that was performed before and at different times following LIF withdrawal. As seen in Fig.1 A, the presence of collagen IV mRNA, a marker specific of endodermic cells, began to be detectable 4 days after LIF removal. 1 day later, the mRNA encoding the β-major globin precursor, a marker of hematopoietic cells, was observed. As a control, the level of the ubiquitous HPRT mRNA remained detectable during the whole differentiation process (Fig.1 A). Cell growth inhibition was monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell numeration. Fig.1 B demonstrates that, 12 h after LIF removal, [3H]thymidine incorporation decreased by a factor of almost 2 compared with the value determined in cells kept in the presence of LIF. After 24 h of differentiation, a 6-fold decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed. This phenomenon reflected the gradual cell division inhibition of differentiating CGR8 cells, which is illustrated in Fig. 1 C by cell numeration. FAC-scan analysis of the different phases of the cell cycle revealed that the early differentiation of CGR8 cells is accompanied with an increased number of cells in G1 phase (not shown and Ref.36Savatier P. Lapillonne H. Van Grunsven L.A. Rudkin B.B. Samarut J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 309-322PubMed Google Scholar). Since hsp27 has been increasingly linked to cell differentiation, we investigated the level of this protein during the differentiation of CGR8 cells. This was assessed by analyzing the level of this protein before and at different times following LIF withdrawal. The immunoblot analysis presented in Fig. 2 Ashows that hsp27, which is already expressed in undifferentiated CGR8 cells, displayed a transient increased level in cells incubated in the absence of LIF. The maximal increase of hsp27 level (2.5-fold) was observed 24 h after LIF removal. By 72 h of differentiation, the level of this protein was below that observed in control cells (see Fig. 4 C for a quantitative analysis of this phenomenon). A similar observation has been previously reported when ES cells were launched to differentiate as a consequence of retinoic acid treatment (19Stahl J. Wobus A.M. Ihrig S. Lutsch G. Bielka H. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, the accumulation of hsp27 in response to LIF withdrawal did not result in a stress response because the level of the major stress protein hsp70 was not significantly altered (not shown). Analysis performed at the mRNA level showed, already 6 h after LIF removal, an increased accumulation of the mRNA encoding hsp27 (Fig. 2, B and C). This phenomenon lasted for about 12 h; thereafter, the level of hsp27 mRNA rapidly declined.Figure 4Analysis of hsp27 levels in the different CGR8 cell lines. A, immunoblot analysis of the different clones. CGR8 cells were transfected with either the control (cont.) or hsp27 expression vectors. Vectors carrying either antisense (ant-hsp27) or sense (hsp27) hsp27 gene (murine or human) constructions were used (see “Experimental Procedures”). Stable cell lines were obtained, and the level of hsp27 was determined in immunoblot analysis of total cellular proteins probed with an antiserum that recognizes both human and murine hsp27. B, control immunoblot probed with anti-hsp70 antisera. Autoradiographs of ECL-revealed immunoblots are presented. Note the drastic decreased level of the endogenous murine hsp27 in clone ES-ant-hsp27-2 and ES-ant-hsp27-11. Murine hsp27 is slightly increased in clone ES-hsp27-11 and strongly increased in clone ES-hsp27-5. Both resulted in a transfection with the murine sense construct. A slight increase in ES-hsp27-2 and ES-hsp27-3 clones is also observed, but in this case, the transfection was performed with the human sense construct.C, kinetics of endogenous hsp27 accumulation during differentiation of either control CGR8 cells or CGR8 cells that underexpress or overexpress murine hsp27. Total cellular proteins were isolated from ES-control-1, ES-hsp27-5, or ES-ant-hsp27-2 cells following LIF withdrawal and analyzed in immunoblots probed with an antiserum specific for murine hsp27. In each case, the level of hsp27 was estimated by densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are in the form of percentage of hsp27 level calculated as the ratio between the level of hsp27 determined for the different samples to that obtained in ES-control-1 cells maintained in the presence of LIF. Percentage of hsp27 level is presented as a function of the duration of cell culture in the absence of LIF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because changes in hsp27 phosphorylation and oligomerization have been reported to occur during HL60 cell differentiation (24Spector N.L.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we have investigated these different properties of hsp27 during the differentiation of CGR8 cells. Phosphorylation analysis was assessed by two-dimensional immunoblots as already described (11Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Briolay J. Fostan P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.-P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and was performed before and at different times following LIF withdrawal. As seen in Fig. 3 A, in cells kept in the presence of LIF, hsp27 was resolved as two major isoforms: “a” and “b.” The “a” isoform is the non-phosphorylated form, whereas the “b” isoform is the major phospho-isoform of the protein (1Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. Heat Shock Proteins: Structure, Function and Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1994: 335-373Google Scholar, 11Mehlen P. Mehlen A.

J. 1995; 312: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because similar levels of the “a” and “b” isoforms are detected in cells kept in the presence of LIF, this means that hsp27 is strongly phosphorylated in undifferentiated CGR8 cells. 1 h after LIF withdrawal, the level of the “b” isoform had declined, and this isoform was no more detectable later, particularly during the transient accumulation of this protein (between 12 and 48 h). These results therefore suggest that ES differentiation is characterized by a drastic dephosphorylation of hsp27. In addition of being a phosphoprotein, hsp27 also undergoes changes in its oligomerization state (1Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. Heat Shock Proteins: Structure, Function and Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1994: 335-373Google Scholar, 11Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). To study this particular property of hsp27 during ES differentiation, CGR8 cells were harvested and lysed at various time points before and at different times following LIF withdrawal. Lysates were subjected to sizing chromatography on a Sepharose 6B column, and the proteins present in the different fractions were analyzed in immunoblot probed with anti-hsp27 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It is seen in Fig.3 B that in undifferentiated CGR8 cells, hsp27 is in the form of small oligomers whose molecular masses are comprised between 30 and 150 kDa. Remarkably, 24 h after LIF withdrawal, and concomitantly with hsp27 accumulation, hsp27 oligomers drastically shifted toward high molecular masses (100–600 kDa). By 48 h, the reverse phenomenon occurred because the distribution of hsp27 oligomers was again observed in the range of 30–150 kDa. These results therefore indicate that a drastic dephosphorylation and a transient increase in the oligomerization state of hsp27 occur during ES differentiat"

This is critical for clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells and propagation of immune responses. Additionally, under some conditions antigen receptor stimulation initiates apoptosis of T lymphocytes through the induced expression of CD95 ligand and its receptor. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor, NFAT, which is critical for the inducible expression of many cytokine genes, also plays a critical role in the regulation of T cell receptor-mediated CD95 ligand expression. Two sites within the CD95 ligand promoter, identified through DNase I footprinting, bind NFAT proteins from nuclear extracts of activated T cells. Although both sites appear important for optimal expression of CD95 ligand in activated T cells, mutational analysis suggests that the distal NFAT site plays a more significant role. Furthermore, these sites do not appear to be required for constitutive CD95 ligand expression in Sertoli cells.

Two sites within the CD95 ligand promoter, identified through DNase I footprinting, bind NFAT proteins from nuclear extracts of activated T cells. Although both sites appear important for optimal expression of CD95 ligand in activated T cells, mutational analysis suggests that the distal NFAT site plays a more significant role. Furthermore, these sites do not appear to be required for constitutive CD95 ligand expression in Sertoli cells. Adaptive immune responses require the activation of T lymphocytes through antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IL-2, interleukin 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; DTT, dithiothreitol; CsA, cyclosporin A; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; bp, base pair(s). stimulation. Signaling events initiated by TCR ligation lead to the activation of transcription factors that regulate expression of cytokine genes, such as IL-2. This is important for the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells and propagation of immune responses (1Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol.

Immunopathol. 1997; 83: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, once the antigenic stimulus has been cleared, the expanded population of cells must be eliminated to prevent accumulation of excessive lymphocytes (2Musci M.A. Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A.

Recently, it has been proposed that one mechanism by which this occurs is through the induced expression of CD95 ligand (4Alderson M.R. Tough T.W. Davis-Smith T. Braddy S. Falk B. Schooley K.A.

Once expressed, CD95 ligand engages its receptor, CD95, also expressed on the population of activated lymphocytes (8van Parijs L. Abbas A.K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the absence of costimulatory signals that can delay apoptosis (9Boise L.H. Noel P.J. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin.

Abbas A.K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Additionally, autoreactive T cells that are inappropriately activated in the periphery are believed to undergo apoptosis through a similar process (13Abbas A.K. Cell. 1996; 84: 655-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The significance of CD95 ligand expression in the process of activation-induced cell death has been highlighted by recent studies that demonstrate that blocking CD95/CD95 ligand interactions prevents apoptosis of TCR-stimulated lymphocytes (5Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 7Ju S.T.

Interestingly, in addition to its inducible expression on activated lymphocytes, CD95 ligand is constitutively expressed on epithelial cells within the eye and Sertoli cells within the testes (14Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 15Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Constitutive CD95 ligand expression participates in maintenance of the “immune privileged” status of these tissues by inducing apoptosis in infiltrating, CD95-bearing, activated lymphocytes (17Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 240-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Despite improved understanding of the important physiological roles for CD95 ligand in immune privileged sites and in controlling T cell homeostasis, little is yet known about the regulation of CD95 ligand expression in these various cell types. In contrast, much is known about the signaling pathways that couple TCR ligation to expression of cytokine genes. Engagement of the TCR leads to rapid activation of protein tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk families (18Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These protein tyrosine kinases then couple to the activation of the Ras and phospholipase Cγ1 signaling intermediates (19Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Ras activation drives signals that ultimately lead to induction of members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, important for regulation of the IL-2 gene promoter (20Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Stimulation of phospholipase Cγ1 leads to the calcium-dependent activation of the serine phosphatase, calcineurin (22Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Activated calcineurin then functions to dephosphorylate nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) family members. Dephosphorylated NFAT proteins then enter the nucleus where they also serve an essential role in regulating the expression of many cytokine genes, including IL-2 (20Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,23Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits NFAT-dependent transcriptional events by binding calcineurin and blocking its enzymatic activity, thus preventing the redistribution of NFAT to the nucleus (24Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that treatment of lymphocytes with CsA also inhibits TCR-mediated CD95 ligand expression (6Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 25Anel A. Buferne M. Boyer C. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Golstein P. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additionally, lymphocytes from mice with targeted gene disruption of the transcription factor, NFATp, display a pronounced defect in activation-induced CD95 ligand expression (27Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. de la Brouse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work from our laboratory (28Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar) utilizing a reporter construct driven by elements of the CD95 ligand promoter suggests that NFAT may play an important role in regulating CD95 ligand expression in activated T cells. In this study, we explore further the hypothesis that NFAT regulates CD95 ligand expression in activated lymphocytes. Using DNase I footprint analysis, we define two potential NFAT binding sites within the CD95 ligand promoter region. Both sites bind NFAT proteins independently, in an inducible and specific fashion. Yet, mutational analysis demonstrates that the distal NFAT site is more important than the proximal site for regulation of the CD95 ligand promoter in activated T cells. In contrast to the findings in T cells, experiments examining constitutively expressed CD95 ligand in Sertoli cells demonstrate that neither NFAT site is required for constitutive promoter activity in these cells. The following reagents were used in this study: sodium d-luciferin (Sigma), CsA (Sigma), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, Sigma: used for stimulations at 50 ng/ml), ionomycin (Sigma: used for stimulations at 1 μm). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-Jurkat clonotypic TCR β chain mAb, C305 (29Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar); MOPC IgG2 (Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA); anti-NFATp (mAb G1-D10) and anti-NFATc (mAb 7A6) were gifts of G. Crabtree. C305 ascites was immobilized on plastic culture dishes by incubating at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml C305 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h. PDT102, a pGEX3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) construct containing the NFATc Rel similarity domain (amino acids 415–591), was a gift of G. Crabtree. The following reporter constructs were used in this study: CMV-βgal; CD95L-486 (28Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar); Luc-link (28Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar), Distal Mut-486 (see below), Prox. Mut-486 (see below), and Double Mut-486 (see below). The Jurkat human leukemic T cell line was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml), streptomycin (1000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm). The TM4 Sertoli cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml), streptomycin (1000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm). For transient transfections, 15 × 106 Jurkat or 20 × 106 TM4 Sertoli cells were subjected to electroporation in 400 μl of cytomix intracellular buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.6), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mm EGTA (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2: pH adjusted with KOH and freshly added 2 mm ATP (pH 7.6) and 5 mm glutathione) with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V/960 microfarads (Jurkats) or 320 V/960 microfarads (TM4 cells). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfecting 5 μg of a CMV-βgal reporter construct followed by quantification of β-galactosidase expression using the Galacto-Light assay kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The distal, proximal, and double NFAT binding mutants were created using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction with the forward (F) and reverse (R) end primers (F, 5′-GAACAAGCTTAATGTATAAAAAAGCATGCAATTATAATTC-3′; R, 5′-ACATAAGCTTGGCAGCTGGTGAGTCAGGCCA-3′) and the following primers to incorporate the NFAT binding site mutations: CD95 ligand Distal Mut (F, 5′-GTGGGAATCAACTTCCAGG-3′; R, 5′-CCTGGAAGTTGATTCCCAC-3′), CD95 ligand Prox Mut (F, 5′-TAGCTATTAGATCTCTATAA-3′; R, 5′-TTATAGAGATCTAATAGCTA-3′). Wild type CD95L-486 served as a template for creation of distal and proximal NFAT mutants. The distal mutant served as a template for creation of the double mutant. All polymerase chain reaction-derived constructs were confirmed by fluorescent automated sequencing (University of Iowa DNA facility, Iowa City, IA). The minimal IL-2 promoter luciferase construct was created by digesting the triplicated IL-2 distal NFAT reporter with Xho-1 to drop out the IL-2 NFAT sequences followed by religation of the Xho-1 ends. The triplicated distal and proximal CD95 ligand NFAT constructs were created by annealing the following oligonucleotides containing overhanging Xho-1-compatible sites followed by cloning into the Xho-1 site of the IL-2 minimal promoter construct: distal NFAT triplication (F, 5′-TCGAGGTGGGCGGAAACTTCCAGTGGGCGGAAACTTCCAGTGGGCGGAAACTTCCAC-3′) and (R, 5′-TCGAGTGGAAGTTTCCGCCCACTGGAAGTTTCCGCCCACTGGAAGTTTCCGCCCACC-3′); proximal NFAT triplication (F, 5′-TCGAGTTAGCTATGGAAACTCTTTAGCTATGGAAACTCTTTAGCTATGGAAACTCTC-3′) and (R, 5′-TCGAGAGAGTTTCCATAGCTAAAGAGTTTCCATAGCTAAAGAGTTTCCATAGCTAAC-3′). Transformants of the PDT102 vector were grown to OD 0.5 at 600 nm visible light and then stimulated with 0.005m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in 3 ml of cold PBS, and sonicated to disrupt cell walls. After addition of 330 μl of 10% Triton (in PBS), cellular debris was pelleted. The supernatant was tumbled with glutathioneS-transferase-conjugated agarose beads for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times in 1% Triton followed by PBS. Glutathione S-transferase-NFAT protein was then eluted by tumbling beads with 1 ml of elution buffer (20 mmglutathione in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mmNaCl) for 10 min at 4 °C. The eluate was then dialyzed for 2 h in DB buffer (see DNase footprinting) without bovine serum albumin but supplemented with 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mm PMSF. Protein was quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay. 5 × 107Jurkat cells were left unstimulated, stimulated with immobilized C305 mAb, 50 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μm ionomycin, or with PMA plus ionomycin in the presence of 200 ng/ml CsA and then lysed in 500 μl of TLB buffer (40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1.0 mm DTT). Samples were centrifuged immediately at 4 °C for 2 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and nuclei lysed in 300 μl of NB buffer (0.42 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT) by tumbling for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then dialyzed twice for 2 h in dialysis buffer (0.1 m KCl, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. CD95 ligand constructs were subcloned into the HindIII site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to allow digestion with ClaI andEcoRV to generate a 5′ overhang at the −1 end of the promoter and a blunt site at the −486 end. 25 μg of DNA was digested and gel-purified followed by incubation with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dGTP (Amersham Corp.) and 5 units of Klenow enzyme for 25 min at room temperature. Probes were then purified with Stratagene push columns. DNase footprint analysis was performed by incubating 20,000 cpm of probe with indicated amounts of recombinant protein and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) in 20 μl of DB buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol) for 30 min on ice. Reactions were then digested with 0.75 units of DNase I diluted in DD buffer (50 mmCaCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9)) for 5 min. Digestion was stopped by addition of 200 μl of DNase stop solution (2.5 m NH4 acetate, 25 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA) and 500 μl of 100% EtOH. DNA was precipitated in a dry ice/EtOH bath for 15 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed in 70% EtOH, resuspended in 5 μl of formamide loading buffer, and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. Reactions were resolved on a 5% sequencing gel. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with 4 μg of nuclear extract protein or 5 ng of recombinant protein in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm HEPES, 1.25 mm DTT, 1.1 mm EDTA, and 15% (v/v) glycerol in a volume of 20 μl. The binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 20,000 cpm (0.1–0.5 ng) double-stranded oligonucleotides end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. A 1000-fold excess of unlabeled specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides were used as competitors where indicated. Supershifts were performed by addition of 1 μl of both α-NFATp and α-NFATc antibodies in the binding reactions or 1 μl MOPC as a negative control. In addition to the CD95 ligand promoter probes described in Fig. 1 B, the following double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were used in these experiments: nonspecific, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′; IL-2 dist WT, 5′-GGTCAGAAAGGAGGAAAACTGTTTCATA-3′. Transfected cells were treated as indicated, followed by lysis in 100 μl of harvest buffer (100 mm KPO4 (pH 7.8), 1.0 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were then mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer (200 mm KPO4 (pH 7.8), 10 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2) followed by addition of 100 μl of 1.0 mm luciferin. Luciferase activity, expressed in arbitrary light units, was determined in triplicate for each experimental condition using a luminometer (Monolight 2010; Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). We have shown previously that a CD95 ligand reporter comprised of 486 base pairs of DNA immediately 5′ of the translational start site of the human CD95 ligand gene contains critical promoter elements for TCR-induced transcriptional activation in the Jurkat T cell line (28Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, this reporter reflects constitutive expression of CD95 ligand in the TM4 Sertoli cell line. This previous study also suggests that NFAT may play a role in the induced but not constitutive expression of CD95 ligand. To explore the role of NFAT in CD95 ligand expression further, we first attempted to map NFAT binding sites within the CD95 ligand promoter. As shown in Fig. 1 A (lanes 3 and 4), DNase I footprint analysis reveals two regions within the 486-base pair probe that are protected from enzymatic digestion through interactions with recombinant NFAT protein. We designated these regions as putative NFAT distal and NFAT proximal sites based on their location relative to the predicted TATA box.Lane 1 demonstrates that in the absence of recombinant protein both NFAT sites are DNase I-sensitive. The two sites appear to bind recombinant protein with grossly equivalent affinities as each site is partially protected from DNase I cleavage with 50 ng of protein and protected more with 500 ng. Additionally, NFAT appears to bind both DNA strands, as labeling either strand individually provides NFAT-mediated DNase I-protected sites at similar regions of the promoter (data not shown). Each protected site corresponds to approximately 20 base pairs within the CD95 ligand promoter. Sequence analysis reveals that both regions contain an identical GGAAA sequence that differs sufficiently from previously defined NFAT binding sites to fail recognition by a GCG computer search using the data bases described in Refs. 30Wingender E. J. Biotech. 1994; 35: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 31Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3117-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. Many of the previously described NFAT sites within cytokine promoters bind NFAT family members cooperatively with other transcription factors (23Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are no consensus AP-1, ATF-2, Oct-1, or other recognizable transcription factor binding sites surrounding the CD95 ligand promoter NFAT elements. This suggests that the putative NFAT sites we have identified in the CD95 ligand promoter might bind NFAT proteins in the absence of these other transcription factors. In support of this, DNase footprint analysis using recombinant AP-1 protein failed to demonstrate AP-1 binding either independently or in cooperation with recombinant NFAT protein (data not shown). It is possible, of course, that other unidentified transcription factors may interact with NFAT proteins at these sites. To address further the specificity of NFAT binding to the two sites, each was mutated independently in the context of the 486-base pair promoter (Fig. 1 B). Both mutant probes were then assessed for their ability to bind recombinant NFAT protein in the DNase I cleavage assay. As shown in lanes 7 and 8 of Fig.1 A (representing an experiment performed with duplicate samples), mutation of the distal NFAT site disrupts the ability of NFAT protein to protect this site from DNase I cleavage. However, the non-mutated proximal site is still protected from DNase I cleavage in the presence of NFAT protein. Similarly, as shown in lanes 11 and 12, mutation of the proximal NFAT site prevents NFAT protein-mediated protection from DNase I cleavage, whereas the intact distal site still binds protein and is efficiently protected from digestion. Note that DNase I enzymatic activity is primarily targeted to purine residues, and hence both mutations alter the DNase I cleavage patterns slightly. To confirm the specificity of NFAT protein binding to these two sites we designed 19-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to either the distal or proximal NFAT binding sites (Fig.1 B) for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Each radiolabeled probe was incubated with recombinant NFAT protein in the absence or presence of specific or nonspecific DNA competitors, and complex formation was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the wild type probe containing the distal NFAT site forms a complex with NFAT protein (lane 1) which is competed with an excess of unlabeled specific probe (lane 2) but not with an excess of a nonspecific probe (lane 3). Furthermore, a probe with a mutation in the predicted distal NFAT binding site fails completely to bind protein (lanes 4-6). Similarly, a probe containing the wild type proximal NFAT site sequence forms a complex with NFAT protein (lane 7) which is competed with excess unlabeled specific probe (lane 8) but not excess unlabeled nonspecific probe (lane 9). A mutation in the predicted proximal NFAT binding site again abolishes all protein binding (lanes 10–12). As a positive control, a probe containing a previously defined IL-2 NFAT site binds NFAT protein (lane 13) and is competed with excess unlabeled specific probe (lane 14) but not excess unlabeled nonspecific probe (lane 15). Overall these data indicate that there are at least two NFAT binding elements in the 486-bp CD95 ligand promoter region which can bind NFAT protein in a sequence-specific fashion. Next, to address whether NFAT proteins from activated lymphocytes can bind the putative CD95 ligand NFAT sites, distal and proximal NFAT site probes were used in EMSAs with nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells left unstimulated or activated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb or PMA plus ionomycin (agents that bypass TCR-mediated protein tyrosine kinase events to initiate signals leading to NFAT activation). In addition, nuclear extracts were prepared from cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin in the presence of CsA, blocking signaling events leading to NFAT nuclear translocation. The EMSAs reveal similar results using either the distal (Fig.2, A and B) or proximal (Fig. 2, C and D) NFAT probes. Neither probe forms a specific complex with nuclear proteins from unstimulated extracts (lane 1, Fig. 2, A and C). However, activation via the TCR or with PMA plus ionomycin induces complex formation with both the distal and proximal probes (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 2, A and C). Treatment with CsA inhibits complex formation with both distal and proximal probes (lane 4, Fig. 2, A andC). To address the specificity of binding in these experiments both probes were mixed with nuclear extracts from PMA and ionomycin-activated Jurkat cells in the presence of various DNA competitors. An excess of unlabeled nonspecific DNA probe does not inhibit complex formation (lane 5, Fig. 2, A and C andlane 11, Fig. 2, B and D) nor do probes that incorporate mutations in the NFAT binding sites (lane 7, Fig. 2, A and C). Yet excess unlabeled probes specific for either the distal or the proximal NFAT sites compete complex formation with the labeled distal or proximal NFAT probes, respectively (lane 6, Fig. 2, A andC and lane 12, Fig. 2, B andD). To begin to address whether the composition of the complexes associated with the distal and proximal NFAT sites are similar, a cross competition experiment was performed. Excess unlabeled proximal probe competes complex formation with the labeled distal probe (lane 8, Fig. 2 A) and unlabeled distal probe competes complex formation with the labeled proximal probe (lane 8, Fig.2 C). This suggests that the proteins from activated nuclear extracts that form complexes with either probe are likely to have similar binding characteristics. To assess further whether the putative NFAT sites bind to NFAT proteins from activated Jurkat cell nuclear extracts, supershift experiments were performed with NFAT-specific antibodies.

In both instances the specific complexes are supershifted (lane 9, Fig. 2, A andC), indicating that each probe binds NFAT proteins from activated nuclear extracts. A nonspecific isotype control antibody does not induce a supershift (lane 10, Fig. 2, A andC). Interestingly, in contrast to what has been shown for the IL-2 NFAT sites, antibodies specific for AP-1 transcription factor components fail to supershift complexes formed with distal and proximal CD95 ligand NFAT probes, whereas supershift formation is detected with a control probe containing an AP-1 site (data not shown). Finally, we examined whether the specificities of NFAT complex formation with the CD95 ligand NFAT sites are similar to that of an NFAT site from the IL-2 promoter. Complex formation with either labeled distal or proximal CD95 ligand NFAT probe is competed efficiently with a probe containing a canonical NFAT binding site derived from the IL-2 gene promoter (lane 13, Fig. 2, B andD). This suggests that NFAT protein binding specificities for each site are similar. Collectively, these results indicate that both the distal and proximal CD95 ligand promoter NFAT sites are capable of binding nuclear NFAT proteins from T cells in an inducible and specific fashion. Having determined that both the distal and proximal CD95 ligand promoter NFAT sites are capable of binding NFAT proteins from activated lymphocytes, experiments were designed to test whether these sites are capa"
https://openalex.org/W2048741586,"The Ras-dependent activation of Erk kinases by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is thought to involve tyrosine phosphorylation of docking proteins that serve as scaffolds for the plasma membrane recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as the Grb2-mSos complex. We have investigated the role of two GPCR-regulated tyrosine phosphoproteins, p125<sup>FAK</sup> (FAK) and Shc, in the Ras-dependent activation of Erk kinases by endogenously expressed GPCRs in Rat 1a fibroblasts. Several lines of evidence suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and Shc are independently regulated. The GPCRs for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), thrombin, and bombesin mediate equivalent increases in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and FAK-Grb2 association. In contrast, only LPA and thrombin receptors significantly stimulate Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2 complex formation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is pertussis toxin-insensitive, can be mimicked by calcium ionophore, and is inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc is inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment, is not induced by calcium ionophore, and is insensitive to cytochalasin D. In each case, the rapid stimulation of Erk 1/2 correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc but not of FAK. The dissociation of FAK-Grb2 complex formation from receptor-mediated activation of Erk 1/2 indicates that recruitment of Grb2-mSos to the plasma membrane is not sufficient to mediate rapid Erk activation. Using four mechanistically distinct inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, concanavalin A, hypertonic medium, depletion of intracellular potassium, and monodansylcadaverine, we find that GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation is also endocytosis-dependent. Thus, we propose that an additional step involving vesicle-mediated endocytosis is required for the rapid, Ras-dependent activation of Erk kinases in fibroblasts."

All of these stress protein groups have been intensively studied, excluding the hsp110 species.

Moreover, as is the case with the hsp70 family, multiple members of the hsp110 family have also been found in individual organisms (8Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C.

These studies indicate that hsp110 is a significantly enlarged and diverged relative of the hsp70 family of proteins but also includes unique sequence components. The notable constitutive expression and stress inducibility of hsp110 is highly suggestive of a major role in unstressed cells as well as in the heat shock response and the expression of thermotolerance (1Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Landry J. Bernier D. Chretien P. Nicole L.M. Tanguay R.M. Marceau N. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2457-2461PubMed Google Scholar). A description of the heat shock response in eucaryotes is not possible without an understanding of the roles played by this major stress protein. We describe here an analysis of the characteristics of hsp110, both in vivo and in vitro. cDNA for hsp110 was cloned into pRSET vector (Invitrogen), resulting in introduction of a His6-(enterokinase recognition sequence)-Arg-Ser tag to the amino terminus of hsp110 (pRSET-hsp110). pRSET-hsp110 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109(DE3) cells. The transformant containing pRSET-hsp110 was grown at 37 °C in LB medium with ampicillin until the OD reached 0.6, when the expression of His-hsp110 was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside during further incubation at 30 °C for 5 h. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, using lysozyme treatment and sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 30 min, and His-hsp110 was purified from the supernatant on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (QIAGEN, Inc.) following manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the supernatant was loaded on the column, washed with sonication buffer, washed with wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and hsp110 was eluted with wash buffer containing 500 mmimidazole (instead of 60 mm). The eluent was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl for 48 h and concentrated by sprinkling polyethylene glycol 8000 or by ultrafiltration using Centricon 50. The concentration of proteins was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Myc epitope (EEQKLISEEDLLR) was added to the COOH terminus of hsp110 using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the fragment fromSstI site to the stop codon of hsp110 cDNA. Amplification was performed using primers containing theSstI site, the inserted Myc epitope, and the stop codon. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified region was verified by DNA sequencing. The Myc-tagged cDNA for hsp110 was cloned into pUHD10–3 (gift from Dr. H. Bujard), which contains the tetracycline-dependent promoter (tet-hsp110). The plasmid tet-hsp110 was cotransfected with the thymidine kinase-hygromycin plasmid into Rat-1-R12 (ATCC) and tetracycline-dependent transactivator 1 (HtTA-1) (ECACC) cells, which are Rat-1 and HeLa cell lines, respectively, transformed with the tetracycline-dependent transactivator. Doxycycline (tetracycline derivative, 2 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum + penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mixture). For stable clone selection, 150 μg/ml hygromycin and 400 μg/ml G418 were included in the culture medium. hsp110-Myc-expressing clones were screened by Western analysis with monoclonal antibody against Myc epitope in the absence of doxycycline. Selected clones were routinely maintained in medium containing doxycycline, hygromycin, and G418. 150 nmluciferase (Boehringer Mannheim) or 75 nm citrate synthase (Sigma) alone or with bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, hsp110, or hsc70 (StressGen, Inc.) were equilibrated to room temperature in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm ATP (as indicated) followed by incubation at 43 °C in a thermostated cuvette. Light scattering by protein aggregation was determined by measuring the increase of optical density at 320 nm with a spectrophotometer. After measuring the light scattering, the samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant and pellet were separated. The samples taken before centrifugation were considered as total protein. Total, supernatant, and pellet fractions were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-luciferase (or anti-hsp110) antibody. Luciferase (150 nm) was incubated with hsp110 (150 nm) in buffer used for aggregation experiments at room temperature or 43 °C for 30 min and chilled on ice. Anti-hsp110 antibody was added to the luciferase solution, and the buffer was adjusted to radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 18 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose pellet was collected and washed six times, and the pellet was resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western analysis with anti-hsp110 or anti-luciferase antibody. Luciferase (150 nm) was incubated with ovalbumin, hsp110, or hsc70 at 43 °C for 30 min and diluted to 15 nm into 60% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL; Promega) or hsc70 (1.6 μm) and Hdj-1 (3.2 μm) in a buffer containing 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP (total, 50 μl) at 30 °C. For the measurement of luciferase activity, the reactivation solution was 5-fold-diluted in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 μl was added to luciferase assay solution (Promega); the activity was measured with Lumat LB 9501 (Berthoid). Hamster hsp110-transfected Rat-1-R12 cells (described above) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and were induced to overexpress hsp110 by removal of 2 ng/ml doxycycline. Cells were cultured in the absence of doxycycline for 2 days with fresh changes of doxycycline-free media twice a day to remove residual drug. After indicated heat exposures, cells were counted and plated at different dilutions. After 10–14 days, colonies were stained with methylene blue and counted. The uninduced cells were treated identically, except doxycycline was maintained in the culture media. The presence or absence of doxycycline had no effect on the heat sensitivity of the parental Rat-1 cells. HeLa tetracycline-dependent transactivator 1 cells (HtTA-1, described above) were cultured and treated as described for Rat-1 cells. To assess the role of hsp110 in vivo, we determined the effect of its overexpression on the long-recognized phenomenon of thermotolerance. For this purpose, we established two tissue culture cell lines (HeLa and Rat-1) in which the expression of hsp110 can be selectively controlled by a tetracycline-regulated expression system (“tet-off”) in which removal of tetracycline induces its gene expression (12Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the expression of hamster hsp110 (induced), with a Myc-tag added to the carboxyl end in the control and heated Rat-1 cells using this system. In the top panel, an antibody reactive with both hamster and rat hsp110 demonstrates the expression of these hsp110 proteins in control and heated Rat-1 cells, whereas in the bottom panel, an anti-Myc antibody demonstrates the expression of hamster hsp110 in control cells. In these in vivo expression studies, the inducible level of hamster plus rat hsp110 in control cells was approximately comparable to the level of induction of rat hsp110 alone after heat exposure (i.e. is physiological). The expression data from the HeLa line were comparable. Hamster hsp110-induced cells were then challenged with potentially lethal heat doses, following which, the number of surviving cells was determined by clonogenicity. The effect of overexpression of hsp110 on the resistance of Rat-1 cells and HeLa cells is presented in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. It is evident that cells containing exogenous hsp110 were significantly more resistant to heat killing. For comparative purposes, a survival analysis of fully thermotolerant cells arising from a conventional pre-heat treatment is also presented. Overexpression of hsp110 alone is capable of achieving approximately 25–33% full thermotolerant effect (the survival for uninduced Rat-1 cells at the later time point fell below the level of detection). This indicates that in the absence of overexpression of other hsps, hsp110 is still effective in protecting cells against potentially lethal heat exposures. To better understand how hsp110 may protect cells from thermal shockin vivo, we determined the characteristics of this proteinin vitro by utilizing previously applied assays for the analysis of other heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones. For this purpose, we purified histidine-tagged hsp110 from E. coli to homogeneity. Since hsp110 shares sequence similarities with the hsp70 family and since hsp70 proteins have been studied for their abilities to inhibit protein aggregation and promote protein folding (13Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 15Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we similarly examined the ability of hsp110 to perform these chaperoning functions. For aggregation studies, we used luciferase and citrate synthase as model proteins. It is seen in Fig.2 A that hsp110 is efficient in inhibiting the heat-induced aggregation of luciferase in vitro. Most notably, hsp110 was nearly totally effective in inhibiting aggregation as assayed by light scattering when present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests that the interaction of one hsp110 to one denatured luciferase protein was sufficient to maintain solubility as measured in this way. For comparitive purposes, the efficiency of hsc70 in this process was examined in parallel. Consistent with some earlier studies (13Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) but not others (15Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), hsc70 was also capable of inhibiting the protein aggregation. However, in this case, total suppression of luciferase aggregation requires the association of 4 hsc70 proteins to 1 luciferase protein compared with the 1:1 ratio obtained with hsp110. Heat-induced aggregation studies using citrate synthase (shown in Fig. 2 B) provide very similar data to that presented in Fig. 2 A with luciferase. Therefore, in this important molecular chaperoning characteristic, hsp110 functions in a manner similar to hsc70 but is far more efficient in performing this molecular process than is hsc70. The effect of hsp110 on luciferase aggregation as presented in Fig.2 A was also examined by Western blotting analysis using an antibody against luciferase. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that whereas some freshly prepared luciferase is insoluble (pellet) under control conditions, most of the enzyme remains in the supernatant (Spt). However, when heated in the presence of bovine serum albumin, most luciferase is seen to become insoluble (-hsp110). If hsp110 is present during heating at a 1:1 molar ratio with luciferase (+hsp110), it is clear that the enzyme remains maximally soluble. In these studies, the presence or absence of ATP had no effect on the outcome, despite the fact that hsp110 contains the consensus sequences for ATP binding characteristic of this family of ATP binding proteins (4Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Chen X. Easton D. Oh H. Lee-Yoon D. Liu X. Subjeck J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To verify that this protective effect of hsp110 was due to its direct interaction with luciferase, we precipitated hsp110 and examined the coimmunoprecipitation of luciferase. As seen in Fig. 2 D, luciferase coprecipitates with hsp110 (bottom panel) only when heated but not when the two proteins were incubated at room temperature. Moreover, luciferase was not coimmunoprecipitated with hsp110 when it was incubated with pre-heated hsp110 at room temperature (data not shown). Therefore, these experiments demonstrate that hsp110 selectively recognizes denatured proteins and prevents their aggregation during heat shock in vitro. That these proteins are heat-denatured is indicated by their loss of enzymatic activity. Additionally, whereas hsp110 inhibited aggregation, it had no effect on the rate of loss of this enzyme activity, nor was activity regained by further incubations of the hsp110·luciferase complex at room temperature (data not shown). Thus, hsp110 is a potent chaperone in inhibiting aggregation but is incapable of refolding of heat-denatured proteins on its own. This suggests that hsp110 would require the cooperation of other hsps and/or chaperones to refold denatured substrate proteins. To initially address this question, luciferase was heated in the presence of ovalbumin, hsc70, or hsp110 and then added to 60% RRL that has been shown to be an optimal refolding medium (17Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nemmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.3 A, luciferase heated in the presence of hsp110 regained 70% original activity, whereas luciferase heated with hsc70 regained only 20% original activity (at the same molar ratio, 20 × hsp110 or hsc70 to 1 × luciferase). It is clear from this data that optimal folding requires significant additional hsp110 or hsc70 compared with optimal maintenance of solubility (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that when bound to hsp110, denatured luciferase is maintained in a folding competent state. Since hsc70 and Hdj-1 alone have been shown to be a folding ensemble, we repeated the above RRL refolding assay using only these specific molecular chaperones. Although less efficient than RRL, Fig. 3 B demonstrates that hsp110 functionally interacts with hsc70·Hdj-1 to refold heat-denatured luciferase to 25% original activity. Whereas ATP is not required for inhibition of luciferase aggregation, it is necessary for the refolding functions of RRL or hsc70·Hdj-1 as has been demonstrated previously (13Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Lastly, when the refolding step employs hsp110 (and not hsc70) and Hdj1, no recovery of luciferase activity is obtained when the holding step also uses hsp110 (Fig. 3 B). However, when the holding step (i.e. during heating) employs hsc70, a small amount of refolding is achieved by adding hsp110 and Hdj-1, probably reflective of the interaction of hsc70 (already present) and Hdj-1. This indicates that (i) hsp110/hsc70·Hdj-1 is a relevant protein folding machine, (ii) that based on Figs. 2, A and B, and Fig.3 A, hsp110 is notably more efficient than is hsc70 in protecting the denatured protein during the initial heating phase for subsequent refolding and iii), that Hdj-1 does not function as a folding co-chaperone with hsp110. hsp110 was one of the earliest heat shock proteins described in mammalian cells and has been noted in numerous studies (e.g.Refs. 1Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Landry J. Bernier D. Chretien P. Nicole L.M. Tanguay R.M. Marceau N.

In Chinese hamster cells, hsp110 accounts for 0.7% total cell protein after heat shock compared with 3.2% for hsc70 + hsp70 and 1.2% for hsp90 (1Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Its expression levels in the Rat-1 and HeLa cells are less distinctive than in Chinese hamster cells; however it remains as one of the major heat-inducible proteins in these cell lines. Its constitutive expression in different murine tissues varies widely, with highly significant levels of expression in liver and brain (4Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Yasuda K. Nadai A. Harayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Indeed, the expression of hsp110 in brain is comparable to heat-shocked Chinese hamster cells (i.e. making it approximately 0.7% total brain mass). Additionally, like the hsp70 family, the hsp110 family possesses at least three distinct members, each of which is approximately 60% identical in amino acid sequence to the other. These are hsp110, apg-1 (osp94), and apg-2 (9Kaneko Y. Nishiyama H. Nonoguchi K. Higashitsuji H. Kishishita M. Fujita J. J. Biol.

The cell and tissue expression of apg-1 and apg-2 is less well characterized than hsp110, although in testis and in renal medullary duct cells, apg-1/osp94 has been shown to be highly expressed (9Kaneko Y.

The level of expression of hsp110 and its family members in different cell lines and in murine tissues speaks to a significant role for this class of stress proteins in both the stress response and in the normal functioning of the nonstressed cell. The recent cloning of the cDNA for this protein from a variety of organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals has shown it to be a large and highly diverged relative of the hsp70 family (4Lee-Yoon D.

Secondary structure analysis of hsp110 demonstrates that it exhibits significant similarity to the secondary structure of hsp70 and DnaK, whose structures are well studied by several methods including crystallography. hsp70/DnaK is composed of 1) an amino-terminal ATP binding domain followed by 2) a 100-amino acid β-sheet region that has been identified as the peptide binding domain and 3) a carboxyl-terminal α-helical region that is involved in regulation of hsp70/DnaK function and appears as a lid covering the peptide binding domain (19Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of hsp110 demonstrates that it appears to have the same basic 1) ATP binding domain, 2) β-sheet (peptide binding) domain, and 3) carboxyl end α-helical region. However, the ATP binding domain of hsp110 binds and hydrolyzes ATP poorly relative to hsc70 2M. Murawski, H. Oh, and J. Subjeck, unpublished data. (6Yasuda K. Nadai A. Harayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The β-sheet configuration (i.e. the predicted peptide binding region of hsp110) shows some sequence homology to corresponding regions in the structure of DnaK and appears to be of similar overall size and organization. 3D. Easton and J. Subjeck, manuscript in preparation. The regulatory, α-helical “lid” region of hsp110 is similar to that of DnaK but is larger than the corresponding region in DnaK. The predominant structural difference between hsp110 and DnaK/hsp70 is that the α-helical lid region of hsp110 is connected by a 100-amino acid “loop” to the β-sheet peptide binding domain, a structure that is virtually absent in hsp70 (4Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that is responsible for much of the increased size of hsp110. If the α-helical lid plays an important role in peptide binding as suggested (cf. Ref. 19Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), the interposition of this 100-amino acid loop between it and the peptide binding domain may have significant functional implications that could be related to the differences between hsp110 and hsc70 described here. It is also in the predicted α-helical lid region of hsp110 that the conserved sequences, which act as a signature for members of the hsp110/SSE family, reside (4Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that hsp110 must be added to the list of identified molecular chaperones that can inhibit the aggregation of denatured cellular proteins, a list that includes the small heat shock proteins, hsp90, the immunophilins, p23, as well as members of the hsp70 family (13Freeman B.C.

Hui-Chen J.C. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, it is evident from both the aggregation studies of luciferase and citrate synthase (Fig.2) and from the refolding studies of luciferase with reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 3) that hsp110 is significantly more efficient in maintaining heat-damaged proteins in a soluble, refoldable state than is its evolutionary relative, hsc70. Interestingly, earlier reports are contradictory concerning the ability of mammalian hsp70 to hold denatured protein in vitro. Minami et al. (15Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) report that hsc70 alone does not inhibit aggregation of luciferase, whereas hsc70 plus Hdj-1 does. Freeman and Morimoto (13Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) show that hsp70 and hsc70 maintain the solubility of β-galactosidase as indicated by native gel electrophoresis, an observation in agreement with the present report. It is also shown here that hsp110 cannot refold luciferase on its own or with the addition of Hdj-1, a well known co-chaperone for folding with hsc70. However, the refolding obtained with rabbit reticulocyte lysate was much faster and higher than by hsc70 and Hdj-1, suggesting that other components in this lysate are required for efficient refolding of the denatured proteins. It is likely that other chaperones and co-chaperones exist, one or more of which could interact in protein folding with hsp110, possibly including a DnaJ homolog other than Hdj-1. Whereas the structural and sequence similarities between hsp110 and hsc70 indicate a similarity in function between these proteins, hsp110 could also play a primary role in the folding pathway without being directly involved in the final folding step. Furthermore, a molecular interaction between hsc70 and hsp110 has been observed in all cell lines and mouse tissues examined as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation studies and can be reproducedin vitro. 4X. Chen, H. Oh, and J. Subjeck, unpublished data. This suggests that in many instances at least, hsp110 may not function independently of hsc70 (and vice versa) and that the truein vivo physiologic function of these chaperones requires a cooperative interaction with substrate proteins, perhaps utilizing the different peptide binding capacities and ATP binding and hydrolysis characteristics of each. Indeed, since hsp110 is a prominent mammalian hsp (as it also appears to be in other organisms), it may play a primary role for holding the unfolded peptide chain, with hsc70 playing a secondary function in this initial chaperoning step. That these in vitro chaperoning functions have a physiologic role in vivo is indicated by the thermoresistance/thermotolerance studies described in this report. A partial but significant degree of heat resistance is obtained by the overexpression of hsp110 in both HeLa and Rat-1 cells as determined by the cell ability to continue to proliferate and form colonies after severe heat exposures. This strongly suggests that the in vitro properties described above are operative in vivo. Lastly, the hsp70 family has been shown to contain different cellular compartmental members with grp78 (or BiP) representing the endoplasmic reticulum representative. Likewise, hsp110 has a strong structural homolog resident in the endoplasmic reticulum known as grp170 (16Chen X. Easton D. Oh H. Lee-Yoon D. Liu X. Subjeck J.

Multiple compartmentalization of these large and greatly diverged hsp70-related proteins further underscores the physiological importance of this family, and further studies of hsp110 and grp170 are necessary to understand the full complement of major molecular chaperones and how they interact in mammalian cells. We are deeply indebted to Dr. Brian Freeman for supplying the purified Hdj-1 and for his valuable comments.

MAGUKs are characterized by three types of protein-protein interaction modules: the PDZ domain, the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and the guanylate kinase (GuK) domain. The arrangement of these domains is conserved in all previously known MAGUKs: either one or three PDZ domains in the NH2-terminal half, followed by the SH3 domain, followed by a COOH-terminal GuK domain. In this report, we describe the cDNA cloning and subcellular distribution of MAGI-1, a MAGUK with three unique structural features: 1) the GuK domain is at the NH2 terminus, 2) the SH3 domain is replaced by two WW domains, and 3) it contains five PDZ domains. MAGI-1 mRNA was detected in several adult mouse tissues. Sequence analysis of overlapping cDNAs revealed the existence of three splice variants that are predicted to encode MAGI-1 proteins with different COOH termini. The longest variant, MAGI-1c, contains three bipartite nuclear localization signals in its unique COOH-terminal sequence and was found predominantly in the nucleus of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. A shorter form lacking these signals was found primarily in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. This distribution, which is reminiscent of that seen for the tight junction protein ZO-1, suggests that MAGI-1 may participate in the transmission of regulatory signals from the cell surface to the nucleus.

These proteins share a common modular structure that consists of either one or three PDZ domains, a single Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a single region of homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiaeguanylate kinase (GuK), known as the GuK domain. The MAGUK family includes the epithelial tight junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2, theCaenorhabditis elegans vulval protein LIN-2A, and the neurexin-binding protein CASK (3Anderson J.M. Curr.

The latter two represent a subfamily of MAGUKs characterized by an additional domain at the NH2 terminus that is similar to calmodulin kinase II. All MAGUKs studied to date localize to regions of cell-cell contact, such as tight junctions in epithelial cells and synaptic junctions in neurons, where they nucleate the assembly of multiprotein complexes via their protein-protein interaction domains (6Gomperts S.N.

In addition, ZO-1 was found in the nucleus of cultured cells under certain growth conditions (8Gottardi C.J. Arpin M. Fanning A.S. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 proteins bind to the cytoplasmic COOH termini of the Shaker-type K+ channel andN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2 subunits, resulting in clustering of these molecules on the neuronal surface (11Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar,16Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

DLG, the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian PSD-95 family, colocalizes with Shaker K+ channels in larval neuromuscular junctions, and these channels fail to cluster at synapses in Drosophila larvae that harbor mutant DLG alleles (19Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In heterologous cells, the channel clustering activity of PSD-95 requires only the first PDZ domain and a region at the NH2terminus that is conserved among the other PSD-95 family members, suggesting that the second and third PDZ domains may recruit additional membrane or cytoplasmic proteins (20Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The name PDZ domain is derived from three members of the MAGUK family:PSD-95, DLG, and ZO-1 (21Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, PDZ domains are not restricted to MAGUKs. More than 50 proteins are known to contain PDZ domains; many of these lack the GuK and SH3 domains, and several contain domains that confer protein kinase, protein phosphatase, or other enzymatic activities (3Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are repeats of 80–100 amino acids in length that engage in either homotypic interactions (PDZ-PDZ dimers) or, more commonly, heterotypic interactions in which the ligand is the COOH terminus of a transmembrane or a cytoplasmic protein. The single PDZ domain in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase binds to PDZ domains in PSD-95, PSD-93, and α1-syntrophin (10Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar); these are currently the only known examples of homotypic interactions mediated by PDZ domains. In contrast, several heterotypic ligands for PDZ domains have been identified. In addition to the PSD-95 ligands described above, these interactions include the following: 1) the COOH terminus of the FAS receptor binds to the third PDZ domain of the tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1 (23Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar); 2) the COOH terminus of the APC tumor suppressor protein binds to the second PDZ domain of SAP97/hDLG (24Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar); 3) the COOH terminus of the testis determining factor SRY binds to PDZ domains in the nuclear protein SIP-1 (25Poulat F. de Santa Barbara P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7167-7172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); and 4) the transient receptor potential protein, eye protein kinase C, and phospholipase C-β bind to the third, fourth, and fifth PDZ domains, respectively, of theDrosophila photoreceptor protein InaD (26Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The latter finding supports the notion that multivalent PDZ domain proteins enable the formation of multiprotein complexes via interaction of their individual PDZ domains with distinct targets (3Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the third PDZ domain of SAP97/hDLG and of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 bound to a synthetic peptide ligand were recently determined (27Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J.

Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), has begun to reveal the mechanism by which specificity is achieved in heterotypic PDZ domain interactions. One group of PDZ domains, including those in the PSD-95 family, bind COOH-terminal sequences that conform to the consensus (S/T)XV (where X is any amino acid), such as those found in the Shaker K+ channel andN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits. The hydroxyl group of the serine or threonine at the −2-position in this consensus forms a hydrogen bond with a histidine (His372 in PSD-95) that is conserved in most PDZ domains (28Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The single PDZ domains in p55 and LIN-2A contain a valine in place of the semiconserved histidine, and these domains prefer ligands in vitro that contain aromatic residues in the −2-position (29Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase represents a third variant in which the histidine is replaced by a tyrosine. Besides forming homotypic complexes with other PDZ domains, the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase PDZ domain binds to peptides in vitro that terminate in the sequence DXV (30Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, a single residue in each PDZ domain (corresponding to His372 in PSD-95) may dictate which amino acid is found in the −2-position of its cognate ligand. Several other structural features of PDZ domains are predicted to contribute in a more subtle manner to the selection of a particular COOH-terminal tripeptide sequence as a ligand (27Cabral J.H.

Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Moreover, interactions with amino acids that are adjacent to the tripeptide consensus probably impart additional specificity. GuK domains in MAGUKs were named because of their similarity toS. cerevisiae GuK, which uses ATP to phosphorylate GMP, producing guanosine diphosphate and adenosine diphosphate (31Berger A. Schiltz E. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three classes of GuK domains have been found in MAGUKs: those that lack both the GMP- and ATP-binding residues (ZO-1 and ZO-2), those in which the GMP-binding residues are conserved but the ATP-binding motif is absent (PSD-95 family), and those that conserve both the GMP- and ATP-binding residues (p55, LIN-2A, and CASK) (32Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, none of the GuK domains in MAGUK proteins are known to be catalytically active. A clue to the function of the GuK domain in MAGUK proteins emerged recently when two groups identified a synaptic protein, designated GKAP by one group and SAPAP by the other, which binds to the GuK domains of the PSD-95 proteins (33Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.-P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 34Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). GKAP was found in a complex with PSD-95 and Shaker K+ channels, suggesting that it may serve to anchor this complex in the postsynaptic density. Although it is not yet known if the interaction between GKAP and PSD-95 is regulated by guanine nucleotide binding, this finding suggests that the GuK domains in other MAGUK proteins may also function as sites for protein-protein interaction. A protein-protein interaction module that has not previously been found in MAGUK proteins is the WW domain (35Staub O. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 4: 495-499Google Scholar, 36Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The WW domain was named for two conserved tryptophan residues and was first identified as two repeats in mouse YAP65 (Yes-associatedprotein of 65 kDa) (37Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). WW domains have been identified by sequence similarity in more than 30 proteins from various species, and interactions mediated by WW domains have been implicated in human diseases such as Liddle's syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and Alzheimer's disease (38Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). WBP1 and WBP2 are candidate ligands for the single WW domain in human YAP65 (39Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These proteins bind to the YAP65 WW domain via polyproline sequences that conform to the consensus sequence PPXY, designated the PY motif. However, the WW domains in formin-binding proteins bind to a proline-rich sequence in formins that does not match the PY motif, indicating that not all WW domains bind to this consensus (40Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The same study also demonstrated overlap between the WW domain binding site and a SH3 domain binding site, raising the possibility that these two domains may sometimes compete with one another for the same ligand. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine in a synthetic PY motif abolished its interaction with the YAP65 WW domain, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for some WW domain interactions (41Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.-J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a MAGUK with three features that distinguish it from all other known members of the family: 1) the GuK domain is at the NH2 terminus rather than at the COOH terminus; 2) the SH3 domain is replaced by two WW domains; and 3) it contains five PDZ domains rather than the usual one or three. This protein has been designated MAGI-1, formembrane-associated guanylate kinase with an inverted arrangement of protein-protein interaction domains. The yeast strain L40, the plasmids pBTM116 and pVP16, and the mouse embryo cDNA library in pVP16 (42Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Michael White of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Bait constructs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the desired fragment containing 5′-BamHI and 3′-PstI restriction sites. The product of each reaction was subcloned into the corresponding sites in pBTM116, and each plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. For β-galactosidase assays, a 2-ml culture of each yeast strain was grown for 16 h in −Trp/−Leu medium and then diluted 10-fold with the same medium and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer Z (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0), and lysed by two freeze/thaw cycles, followed by vortexing in the presence of glass beads. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1.5 × 104 g, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration of each supernatant was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Five μg of protein from each lysate was adjusted to a total volume of 30 μl with buffer Z and mixed with 200 μl of reaction buffer from the Luminescent β-Galactosidase Detection Kit II (CLONTECH). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, at which time each reaction was progressing in a linear manner, the relative light units emitted by each reaction were measured in a luminometer. Blank values were obtained by measuring the β-galactosidase activity in 5 μg of protein from a lysate of nontransformed yeast. The 478-bp cDNA insert was excised from pVP16-K65 by digesting with NotI and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the PrimeIt II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). This probe was used to screen an oligo dT/random-primed mouse lung cDNA library in Lambda ZAP II (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eleven MAGI-1 cDNAs were isolated from a total of ∼5 × 105 plaque-forming units. Additional MAGI-1 cDNAs were isolated in a similar manner from an oligo dT-primed mouse brain library. The size of each cDNA insert was determined by restriction mapping, and selected clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing using T3, T7, and specific internal primers. The entire 5,296-bp MAGI-1b cDNA was sequenced on both strands. A 678-bp XhoI restriction fragment, spanning nucleotides 759–1437 of MAGI-1, was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to probe a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). The probe was used at a concentration of 2 × 106 cpm/ml in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR film for the indicated time, the blot was stripped and rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe. A 417-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 2–140 of MAGI-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the vectors pRSETA (Invitrogen) and pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia). The resulting plasmids, designated pRSETA-MAGI2–140 and pGEX-2TK-MAGI2–140, were transformed into BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen). Recombinant His6-MAGI2–140 protein was expressed and purified by Ni2+-Sepharose affinity chromatography and used to immunize rabbits as described previously (43James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). GST-MAGI2–140 was expressed and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, and the glutathioneS-transferase was cleaved with thrombin as described previously (43James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14182-14190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding MAGI2–140. An affinity column was prepared by cross-linking 2 mg of MAGI2–140 to AminoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce), and anti-MAGI-1 polyclonal IgG was affinity-purified as described previously (43James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14182-14190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preimmune IgG was isolated from crude serum obtained from the same rabbit by purification on protein A-agarose. A polyclonal antibody directed against lamin B was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 541–554 of mouse lamin B that had been coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and anti-lamin B IgG was isolated from crude serum by purification on protein A-agarose. All polyclonal antibodies were used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml; the anti-FTα monoclonal antibody, described previously (45Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1383-1390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. A 4,680-bp SmaI-EcoRI fragment of the MAGI-1b cDNA, containing the complete open reading frame, was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid was designated pcDNA3-MAGI-1b. Digestion of this plasmid with ApaI removed a 2,050-bp fragment from the 3′-end of the insert, which was replaced by the corresponding region from the MAGI-1c cDNA, yielding pcDNA3-MAGI-1c. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm dish as described previously (43James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14182-14190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 16-h incubation, whole-cell lysates were prepared in buffer A (0.05m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m urea, 1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.5), and the protein concentration of each lysate was determined as described above. An equal amount of protein from each lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibody as described previously (46James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on day 0 at a density of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and harvested on day 3 by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.5) and lysed by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 103 ×g, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and designated the postnuclear supernatant. The 103 ×g pellet was resuspended in buffer B, subjected to an additional 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant from this step was combined with the postnuclear supernatant and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 105 × g to yield 105 ×g supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions. The 103 × g pellet was resuspended in buffer B, layered onto a cushion of buffer C (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.1m NaCl, 1 m sucrose, pH 7.5), and centrifuged for 30 min at 104 × g. The supernatant from this step was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B and designated the nuclear fraction. The protein concentration of each fraction was determined, and an equal percentage of each fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Localization of K-RasB to the plasma membrane requires a COOH-terminal farnesylated cysteine plus a polybasic domain, a stretch of six contiguous lysines (amino acids 175–180) that are separated from the farnesylated cysteine by four amino acids (47Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which these structural features target K-RasB to the plasma membrane is not known. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that interact with the COOH terminus of K-RasB. Preliminary studies revealed that full-length K-RasB failed to interact with Raf in the yeast two-hybrid system, whereas a mutant that was truncated after cysteine 185, thus preventing its farnesylation, interacted efficiently with Raf (data not shown). Farnesylated K-RasB is apparently unable to be transported into the nucleus, where it must reside to function properly in the yeast two-hybrid system. Thus, the bait used in subsequent cDNA library screens, designated K-RasB165–185, contained a segment from the COOH terminus of K-RasB that was truncated after cysteine 185. A 478-bp cDNA, designated K65, was isolated from a mouse embryo library. K65 interacted with K-RasB165–185 and with an essentially full-length bait, K-RasB1–185. K65, like Raf, failed to interact with a farnesylated K-RasB bait (data not shown). However, K65 also failed to interact with nonfarnesylated versions of H-Ras and Rac1, a Ras-related protein that also has a polybasic domain, suggesting that its interaction with K-RasB1–185 was specific (data not shown). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of K65 with sequences in GenBankTM revealed a region of ∼100 amino acids that represented a novel PDZ domain, which was designated MAGI1 (Fig.1). MAGI1 retained the ability to interact with K-RasB1–185 when removed from the flanking sequences present in K65, suggesting that K-RasB was behaving as a heterotypic ligand for this novel PDZ domain (TableI, line a).Table IInteraction of K-RasB with MAGI 1 in the yeast two-hybrid systemBaitWTMut. 1Mut. 2a.

https://openalex.org/W2086347143,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogen for endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and a major regulator of angiogenesis in vivo. VEGF121 and VEGF165 are the most abundant of the five known VEGF isoforms. The structural difference between these two is the presence in VEGF165 of 44 amino acids encoded by exon 7 lacking in VEGF121. It was previously shown that VEGF165 and VEGF121 both bind to KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1 but that VEGF165 binds in addition to a novel receptor (Soker, S., Fidder, H., Neufeld, G., and Klagsbrun, M. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5761–5767). The binding of VEGF165 to this VEGF165-specific receptor (VEGF165R) is mediated by the exon 7-encoded domain. To investigate the biological role of this domain further, a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the VEGF165 exon 7-encoded domain was prepared. The fusion protein inhibited binding of125I-VEGF165 to VEGF165R on human umbilical vein-derived EC (HUVEC) and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. The fusion protein also inhibited significantly125I-VEGF165 binding to KDR/Flk-1 on HUVEC but not on porcine EC which express KDR/Flk-1 alone. VEGF165had a 2-fold higher mitogenic activity for HUVEC than did VEGF121. The exon 7 fusion protein inhibited VEGF165-induced HUVEC proliferation by 60% to about the level stimulated by VEGF121. Unexpectedly, the fusion protein also inhibited HUVEC proliferation in response to VEGF121. Deletion analysis revealed that a core inhibitory domain exists within the C-terminal 23-amino acid portion of the exon 7-encoded domain and that a cysteine residue at position 22 in exon 7 is critical for inhibition. It was concluded that the exon 7-encoded domain of VEGF165 enhances its mitogenic activity for HUVEC by interacting with VEGF165R and modulating KDR/Flk-1-mediated mitogenicity indirectly and that exon 7-derived peptides may be useful VEGF antagonists in angiogenesis-associated diseases.

VEGF121 is the only VEGF isoform that does not bind to heparin and is totally secreted into the culture medium. VEGF165 is functionally different than VEGF121in that it binds to heparin and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and is only partially released into the culture medium (24Houck K.A.

VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR/Flk-1 and/or Flt-1, are expressed by EC and by several types of non-EC such as NIH 3T3, Balb/c 3T3, human melanoma, and HeLa cells (26Terman B.I.

It appears that VEGF activities such as mitogenicity, chemotaxis, and induction of morphological changes are mediated by KDR/Flk-1 but not Flt-1, even though both receptors undergo phosphorylation upon binding of VEGF (31Millauer B.

Recently, we have characterized a new VEGF receptor which is expressed on EC and various tumor-derived cell lines such as breast cancer-derived MDA-MB-231 (231) cells (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although both VEGF121 and VEGF165bind to KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1, only VEGF165 binds to the new receptor. Thus, this is an isoform-specific receptor and has been named as the VEGF165 receptor (VEGF165R). VEGF165R has a molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa, and it binds VEGF165 with a K d of about 2 × 10−10m, compared with approximately 5 × 10−12m for KDR/Flk-1. In structure-function analysis, it was shown directly that VEGF165 binds to VEGF165R via its exon 7-encoded domain which is absent in VEGF121 (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). VEGF165 is a more potent mitogen for EC than is VEGF121 (36Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the interaction of VEGF165 with VEGF165R enhances KDR/Flk-1-mediated VEGF165 bioactivity. To address this hypothesis, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing a peptide corresponding to the 44 amino acids encoded by exon 7 (amino acids 116–159 of VEGF165) was prepared. The GST-exon 7 fusion protein inhibited the binding of125I-VEGF165 to receptors on human umbilical cord vein-derived EC (HUVEC) and on 231 cells. The inhibitory activity was localized to the C-terminal portion of the exon 7-encoded domain. Furthermore, the fusion protein inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC. These results suggest that the exon 7-encoded domain contributes to the enhanced VEGF165 mitogenic activity for HUVEC and that exon 7-derived peptides are potential antagonists of VEGF mitogenic activity for EC. Human recombinant VEGF165 and VEGF121 were produced in Sf-21 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding human VEGF165 or VEGF121 as described previously (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 37Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B.Z. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). VEGF165 was purified from the conditioned medium of infected Sf-21 cells by heparin affinity chromatography, and VEGF121 was purified by anion exchange chromatography. Basic FGF was kindly provided by Dr. Judith Abraham (Scios, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.125I-Sodium was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Disuccinimidyl suberate and IODO-BEADS were purchased from Pierce. Glutathione-agarose, NAP-5 columns, and pGEX-2TK plasmid were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. TSK-heparin columns were purchased from TosoHaas (Tokyo, Japan). Molecular weight marker was purchased from Amersham Corp. IL). Porcine intestinal mucosal-derived heparin was purchased from Sigma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD) and grown on gelatin-coated dishes in M-199 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) and a mixture of glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (GPS). Basic FGF (1 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium every other day. Porcine endothelial cells (PAE), parental and transfected to express KDR/Flk-1 (PAE-KDR), were kindly provided by Dr. Lena Claesson-Welsh and grown in F12 medium containing 10% FCS and GPS as described (32Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 (231) cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and GPS. HUVEC were seeded in gelatin-coated 96-well dishes at 4,000 cells/200 μl/well in M-199 containing 5% FCS and GPS. After 24 h, VEGF isoforms and VEGF exon 7-GST fusion proteins were added to the wells at the same time. The cells were incubated for 72 h, and [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added for 10–12 h. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were trypsinized and harvested by an automatic cell harvester (TOMTEC) and loaded onto Filtermats (Wallac). The Filtermats were scanned and cpm were determined by a MicroBeta counter (Wallac). The results represent the average of samples assayed in triplicate, and the standard deviations were determined. All experiments were repeated at least three times and similar results were obtained. The radioiodination of VEGF165 and VEGF121 was carried out using IODO-BEADS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, one IODO-BEAD was rinsed with 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, dried, and incubated with 125I-sodium (0.2 mCi/μg protein) in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 5 min at room temperature. VEGF (1–3 μg) was added to the reaction mixture, and after 5 min the reaction was stopped by removing the bead. The solution containing 125I-VEGF was adjusted to 2 mg/ml gelatin and purified by size exclusion chromatography using a NAP-5 column that was pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 2 mg/ml gelatin. Aliquots of the iodinated proteins were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. The specific activity ranged from 40,000 to 100,000 cpm/ng protein. Binding and cross-linking experiments using125I-VEGF165 and125I-VEGF121 were performed as described previously (29Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). VEGF binding was quantified by measuring the cell-associated radioactivity in a γ-counter (Beckman, Gamma 5500). The counts represent the average of three wells. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and similar results were obtained.125I-VEGF cross-linked complexes were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned after 24 h by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Subsequently, the gels were exposed to x-ray film. Different segments of exons 7 and 8 of VEGF were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from human VEGF cDNA using the following primers: exon 7 + 8 (Ex 7+8), CGGGATCCCCCTGTGGGCCTTGCTC and GGAATTCTTACCGCCTCGGCTTGTC; exon 7 (Ex 7), CGGGATCCCCCTGTGGGCCTTGCTC and GGAATTCTTAACATCTGCAAGTACGTT; exon 7 with residues 1–10 deleted (Ex 7d-(1–10)), CGGGATCCCATTTGTTTGTACAAGAT and GGAATTCTTAACATCTGCAAGTACGTT; exon 7 with residues 1–21 deleted (Ex 7d-(1–21)), CGGGATCCTGTTCCTGCAAAAACACAG and GGAATTCTTAACATCTGCAAGTACGTT; exon 7 with residues 1–22 deleted (Ex 7d-(1–22)), CGGGATCCTGCAAAAACACAG and GGAATTCTTAACATCTGCAAGTACGTT, and exon 7 with residues 30–44 deleted (Ex 7d-(30–44)), CGGGATCCCCCTGTGGGCCTTGCTC and GGAATTCTAGTCTGTGTTTTTGCA. The amplified products were digested with BamHI andEcoRI restriction enzymes and cloned into the vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) encoding GST (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) to yield the plasmid p2TK-exon 7+8 and its derivatives. Escherichia coli(DH5α) were transformed with p2TK-exon 7+8 and derivatives to produce GST fusion proteins (see Fig. 5 B for sequences). Bacterial lysates were subsequently separated by a glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Samples eluted from glutathione-agarose were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and silver staining. GST fusion proteins were further purified on a TSK-heparin column as described previously (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). VEGF165 and VEGF121 differ in their ability to interact with VEGF receptors expressed on HUVEC (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 39Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). VEGF121 binds to KDR/Flk-1 to form a 240-kDa labeled complex (Fig. 1, lane 2), whereas VEGF165, in addition to forming this size complex, also forms a lower molecular mass complex of 165–175 kDa (Fig. 1,lane 1). This isoform-specific receptor has been named the VEGF165 receptor (VEGF165R). These differential receptor binding properties suggest that VEGF165 and VEGF121 might also have differential mitogenic activities. Accordingly, the ability of the two VEGF isoforms to stimulate HUVEC proliferation was tested. VEGF165 was a more potent mitogen for HUVEC than was VEGF121 (Fig.2). VEGF165 stimulated half-maximal DNA synthesis at 1 ng/ml and maximal stimulation at 4 ng/ml resulting in an 8-fold increase over control. On the other hand, 2 ng/ml VEGF121 were required for half-maximal stimulation and 20 ng/ml for maximal stimulation resulting in a 4-fold increase in HUVEC proliferation over control. Thus, twice as much VEGF121 compared with VEGF165 was needed to attain half-maximal stimulation, and VEGF121-induced proliferation was saturated at about one-half the level induced by VEGF165. Taken together, these results suggest that there might be a correlation between the enhanced mitogenic activity of VEGF165 for EC compared with VEGF121 and the ability of VEGF165 to bind to an additional receptor (VEGF165R) on HUVEC.Figure 2HUVEC proliferation in response to VEGF165 and VEGF121. HUVEC were cultured in 96-well dishes (5,000 cell/well) for 24 h. Increasing amounts of VEGF165 (closed circles) or VEGF121 (open circles) were added to the medium, and the cells were incubated for 3 more days. DNA synthesis based on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into HUVEC DNA was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results represent the average counts in three wells, and the standard deviations were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous studies indicated that the binding of VEGF165 to VEGF165R is mediated by the 44 amino acids encoded by exon 7 (VEGF amino acids 116–159) which is present in VEGF165 but absent in VEGF121 (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that an excess of exon 7-encoded peptide might inhibit VEGF165 binding to VEGF165R. GST fusion proteins containing a peptide encoded by VEGF exon 7 or by VEGF exons 7 and 8 were prepared. The 6 amino acids encoded by exon 8 which is C-terminal to exon 7 were included to facilitate the preparation of the fusion protein but did not affect the results in any way (data not shown). The exon 7 fusion protein binds directly to VEGF165R on 231 cells (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It also binds directly to VEGF165R on HUVEC but not to KDR/FLK-1 on HUVEC (Fig. 1 , lane 3). The ability of the GST-VEGF165exons 7- and 8-encoded peptide (GST-Ex 7+8) to compete with125I-VEGF165 binding to HUVEC, which express both KDR/Flk-1 and VEGF165R, to PAE-KDR cells which express only KDR/Flk-1 (32Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to 231 cells which express only VEGF165R (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) was tested (Fig.3). Increasing concentrations of GST-Ex 7+8 markedly inhibited the binding of125I-VEGF165 to HUVEC by about 85–95% (Fig.3 A) and to 231 cells by 97–98% (Fig. 3 B). However, the fusion protein did not inhibit the binding of125I-VEGF165 to PAE-KDR cells which do not express any VEGF165R (Fig. 3 C). GST protein alone even at concentrations of 20 μg/ml had no significant effect on the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to any of the cell types. Taken together, these binding studies suggested that GST-Ex 7+8 competes for 125I-VEGF165 binding by interacting directly with VEGF165R but not with KDR. These binding experiments were extended to analyze the effects of GST-Ex 7+8 on 125I-VEGF165 binding to the individual VEGF receptor species by cross-linking (Fig.4). Cross-linking of125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells resulted in the formation of labeled complexes with VEGF165R (Fig. 4,lane 3). The formation of these complexes was markedly inhibited in the presence of 15 μg/ml GST-Ex 7+8 (Fig. 4, lane 4). 125I-VEGF165 cross-linking to HUVEC resulted in the formation of labeled complexes of higher molecular mass with KDR/Flk-1 and lower molecular mass complexes with VEGF165R (35Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, lane 1). GST-Ex 7+8 markedly inhibited the formation of the 165–175-kDa labeled complexes containing VEGF165R (Fig. 4, lane 2). Unexpectedly, GST-Ex 7+8 also inhibited markedly the formation of the 240-kDa labeled complex in HUVEC containing KDR/Flk-1 (Fig. 4,lane 2). On the other hand, the fusion protein did not inhibit cross-linking of 125I-VEGF165 to KDR/Flk-1 on the PAE/KDR cells (not shown). Taken together, since (i) VEGF165 binds to KDR/Flk-1 via the amino acids encoded by exon 4 (40Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), (ii)) VEGF165 binds to VEGF165R via the amino acids encoded by exon 7, and (iii) GST-Ex 7+8 binds to VEGF165R but not to KDR (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3), these results suggested that by interfering directly with the binding of125I-VEGF165 to VEGF165R, GST-Ex 7+8 also inhibits indirectly the binding of125I-VEGF165 to KDR/Flk-1. The GST-Ex 7 fusion protein encompasses the entire 44 amino acid exon 7-encoded domain. To determine whether a core inhibitory region exists, deletions were made at the N and C termini of exon 7, and the effects on 125I-VEGF165 binding to HUVEC were measured (Fig. 5). In these experiments a fusion protein containing the exon 7-encoded domain plus the cysteine residue at position 1 of exon 8 was used as the parental construct. The cysteine residue of exon 8 was included to keep the number of cysteine residues in the VEGF portion of the fusion protein even. The GST-Ex 7 fusion protein inhibited125I-VEGF165 binding to HUVEC by 80% at 2 μg/ml fusion protein (Fig. 5). Inhibition of125I-VEGF165 binding to HUVEC and 231 cells was comparable to that of GST-Ex 7+8 (data not shown). Deletion of the first 10 (GST-Ex 7d-(1–10)) or 21 (GST-Ex 7d-(1–21)) N-terminal amino acids did not reduce the inhibitory activity of the fusion proteins. Actually, 1 μg/ml of GST-Ex 7d-(1–21) had a greater inhibition activity than the same concentration of GST-Ex 7 suggesting that there may be a region within exon 7 amino acids 1–21 that interferes with the inhibitory activity. On the other hand, deletion of the cysteine residue at position 22 in exon 7 (GST-Ex 7 d-(1–22)) resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory activity. Deletion of the 15 C-terminal amino acids (GST-Ex 7 d-(30–44)) also resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory activity (Fig. 5). These results indicated that the inhibitory core is found within amino acids 22–44 of exon 7. Moreover, it seems that the cysteine residue at position 22 in exon 7, which is Cys137 in VEGF, is crucial for maintaining a specific structure required for the inhibition. The inhibition of VEGF165 binding to KDR/Flk-1 by the GST-Ex 7+8 fusion protein as shown in Fig. 4suggested that it might also be an inhibitor of VEGF165mitogenicity since KDR/Flk-1 mediates VEGF mitogenic activity (32Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of 1–5 ng/ml VEGF165 to HUVEC resulted in a 5.5-fold increase in the proliferation rate, peaking at 2.5 ng/ml (Fig.6). When 15 μg/ml GST-Ex 7+8 was added in addition to VEGF165, HUVEC proliferation was reduced by about 60%. GST protein prepared in a similar way did not inhibit HUVEC proliferation even at 25 μg/ml indicating that the inhibitory effect was due solely to the presence of the exon 7+8-encoded domain within the fusion"
https://openalex.org/W2080147592,"To probe the molecular identity of transient outward (A-type) potassium currents, we expressed a truncated version of Kv4.2 in heart cells and neurons. The rat Kv4.2-coding sequence was truncated at a position just past the first transmembrane segment and subcloned into an adenoviral shuttle vector downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter (pE1Kv4.2ST). We hypothesized that this construct would act as a dominant-negative suppressor of currents encoded by the Kv4 family by analogy to Kv1 channels. Cotransfection of wild-type Kv4.2 with a β-galactosidase expression vector in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells produced robust transient outward currents (Ito) after two days (14.0 pA/pF at 50 mV,n = 5). Cotransfection with pE1Kv4.2ST markedly suppressed the Kv4.2 currents (0.8 pA/pF, n = 6,p < 0.02; cDNA ratio of 2:1 Kv4.2ST:wild type), but in parallel experiments, it did not alter the current density of coexpressed Kv1.4 or Kv1.5 channels. Kv4.2ST also effectively suppressed rat Kv4.3 current when coexpressed in CHO-K1 cells. We then engineered a recombinant adenovirus (AdKv4.2ST) designed to overexpress Kv4.2ST in infected cells. A-type currents in rat cerebellar granule cells were decreased two days after AdKv4.2ST infection as compared with those infected by a β-galactosidase reporter virus (116.0 pA/pFversus 281.4 pA/pF in Ad β-galactosidase cells,n = 8 each group, p < 0.001). Likewise, Ito in adult rat ventricular myocytes was suppressed by AdKv4.2ST but not by Adβ-galactosidase (8.8 pA/pFversus 21.4 pA/pF in β-galactosidase cells,n = 6 each group, p < 0.05). Expression of a GFP-Kv4.2ST fusion construct enabled imaging of subcellular protein localization by confocal microscopy. The protein was distributed throughout the surface membrane and intracellular membrane systems. We conclude that genes from the Kv4 family are the predominant contributors to the A-type currents in cerebellar granule cells and Ito in rat ventricle.

Tamkun M.M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Because different genes can produce channels with very similar phenotypic properties and overlapping pharmacologic sensitivities, the functional role of each gene often has proven difficult to assign. The conundrum is epitomized by the transient outward potassium current. This current (abbreviated Ito, 1The abbreviations used are: Ito and IA, transient outward current; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; AraC, cytosine arabinoside; β-galactosidase, E. coli lacZgene; pF, picofarad. but commonly known as the A-type current (IA) in neurons) has attracted considerable attention given its dynamic regulation in disease states including epilepsy and heart failure (3Tomita F. Bassett A.L. Myerburg R.J. Kimura S. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Tsaur M.L. Sheng M. Lowenstein D.H. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Various members of two separate potassium channel gene families have been implicated in the formation of Ito. The first was Kv1.4, a member of the Shaker family which, when expressed in oocytes, exhibits roughly appropriate kinetics (fast activation and fast inactivation) during single depolarizing voltage stimuli (7Po S. Snyders D.J. Baker R. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Po S. Roberds S. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the recovery kinetics of the heterologously expressed Kv1.4 channel are much slower than those of Ito in native heart cells, and there is no correlation between the amount of current and the message levels for Kv1.4 (9Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). More recently, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 have emerged as stronger candidates (10Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dixon J.E. Shi W. Wang H.S. McDonald C. Yu H. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). When expressed alone, these members of the Shal family exhibit plausible kinetics (although again, the match with native cells is imperfect) (12Serodio P. Vega-Saenz De Miera E. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These genes are richly expressed in ventricular myocytes and in neurons that express IA (4Tsaur M.L. Sheng M. Lowenstein D.H. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar); furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides targeting Kv4.2 suppress Ito in rat ventricular myocytes (15Fiset C. Clark R.B. Shimoni Y. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 51-64Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is a paucity of evidence at the protein level that Kv4 genes underlie Ito. The picture is further confused by the fact that many tissues express both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (9Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 11Dixon J.E. Shi W. Wang H.S. McDonald C. Yu H. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Circ.

Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which differ when expressed individually but are thought to be capable of forming heteromultimers that obscure such differences. Selective gene suppression has become an attractive method for elucidating protein function experimentally. The two most commonly used strategies to accomplish this include antisense methodologies (16Wagner R.W. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1116-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and dominant-negative constructs (17Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Both have been used to manipulate functional expression of ion channels (15Fiset C. Clark R.B. Shimoni Y. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 51-64Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Chung S. Saal D.B. Kaczmarek K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5955-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the latter has proven to be particularly useful in manipulating potassium channels due to the fact that they form multimers in the cell membrane (19Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1990; 345: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 20Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G.

Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). One dysfunctional K channel subunit (e.g. with a missense mutation in the pore region) can suffice to cripple an otherwise normal tetrameric complex; indeed, such dominant-negative interactions underlie various forms of the inherited long QT syndrome (28Kass R.S. Davies M.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 443-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The introduction of a dominant-negative ion channel construct into native cells also has been used to map the levels of specific channel families in neurons from Xenopus embryos (30Ribera A.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, such a technique generally is not applicable to mammalian systems without manipulating the germline. In the present study, we have used somatic gene transfer methods to introduce dominant-negative Kv4 constructs into various cell types. We first demonstrate that a truncated version of Kv4.2 (Kv4.2ST) acts to suppress Ito encoded either by Kv4.2 or Kv4.3 in CHO cells. For gene delivery into myocytes and neurons, which are resistant to conventional transfection methods, we use a recombinant adenovirus that overexpresses Kv4.2ST. Recombinant adenoviruses have previously been used to express functional ion channels, as well as to deliver dominant-negative constructs of other genes into primary cells of both cardiac and neuronal origin (31Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Chiamvimonvat N. Ramza B.M. Marban E. Lawrence J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Moriyoshi K. Richards L.J. Akazawa C. O'Leary D.D.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16253-16259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results support the idea thatShal potassium channels represent the major constituents of the A-type current in neuronal cells and of Ito in adult cardiac myocytes. The coding sequence for the rat Kv4.2 potassium channel gene was provided by M. Tamkun (Vanderbilt University) (34Morgan R.A. Couture L. Elroy-Stein O. Ragheb J. Moss B. Anderson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The portion of the sequence coding for the first 206 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers that contained unique restriction sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends. The product (Kv4.2ST) was cloned into pSL301 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced to confirm the absence of polymerase chain reaction-induced mutations. The Kv4.2 ST sequence was then cloned into the adenovirus shuttle vector pE1CMV (Fig. 1 B) (31Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Chiamvimonvat N. Ramza B.M. Marban E. Lawrence J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Constructs were made in both the sense and antisense orientations with respect to the promoter, designated pE1Kv4.2ST and pE1CKv4.2AS respectively. An additional vector, pE1RKv4.2AS, contains the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat as the promoter and was used to generate AdRKv4.2AS. The 4.2ST sequence was also fused in frame to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence in the vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to make the construct pEGFP-4.2ST. The full-length Kv4.2 sequence was subcloned into pREP4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and into the pEGFP-C3 backbone to make pRep4.2FL and pE-Kv4.2FL respectively. The full-length rat Kv4.3 sequence was obtained from B. Rudy (New York University Medical Center) and cloned into the expression vector pGFPIRS. This vector is a modified version of pEGFP-C3, which contains the polio virus internal ribosomal entry site, obtained from G. Ketner (Johns Hopkins School of Public Health) (34Morgan R.A. Couture L. Elroy-Stein O. Ragheb J. Moss B. Anderson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and cloned between the EGFP sequence on the 5′ side and the polycloning site on the 3′ site. This vector (pGFPIrKv4.3) produces a single transcript, encoding both the EGFP protein and the Kv4.3 protein. The human inward rectifier cDNA (Kir2.1) containing the inactivating mutation of GYG to AAA (27Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was provided by G. Tomaselli (Johns Hopkins University) and was fused to the EGFP sequence in pEGFP-C3 (pGFPKir2.1-AAA). The CMV-β galactosidase plasmid contains the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter. The mitochondrial targeted GFP (mtGFP) sequence was provided by M. Rizzuto (University of Padova) (35Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The mtGFP sequence was similarly subcloned into the shuttle vector pE1CMV to make pE1CMVmtGFP. The humanized GFP was subcloned from the vector pGreenLantern (Life Technologies, Inc.) into pE1CMV to create pE1CMVhGFP. Mammalian expression vectors containing full-length Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 sequences were supplied by E. Levitan (University of Pittsburgh) and L. Philipson (University of Chicago) (36Philipson L.H. Malayev A. Kuznetsov A. Chang C. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1153: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively. The strategy is outlined in Fig. 1 B. The various adenovirus shuttle plasmids were cotransfected with pJM17, containing the full human adenovirus serotype 5 genome (37McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.). As described previously, homologous recombination between the shuttle vector and pJM17 replaces the region of the adenovirus between map units 1.0 and 9.8 with the expression cassette containing the desired cDNA. Successful recombinations were screened either by direct visualization (AdmtGFP and AdhGFP) or by Southern blot analysis of small scale infections (Ad4.2ST, AdC4.2AS, and AdR4.2AS) followed by RNase protection assays of RNA made from infected cells as described below. AdCMVβ-Gal contains the β-galactosidase gene driven by the CMV promoter and was provided by G. Wilkinson (University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, U.K.). Cerebellar granule cells were isolated as described previously (38Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti T. Thangnipon W. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., NY1989: 211-214Google Scholar). Cells were plated on dishes that had been coated with poly-l-lysine (5 μg/ml for 10 min). If coverslips were needed they were sterilized by immersion in 95% EtOH followed by flaming in a bunsen burner. Coverslips were then placed in the dishes prior to coating with polylysine. Cells were cultured in Basal Eagle's medium with Earle's salts free of glutamine (Life Technologies Inc.) that had been supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 25 mm KCl, and 2 mml-glutamine. The medium was removed after one day and replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cytosine arabinoside. Under these culture conditions, expression of the A-type current is stable throughout the course of the experiment (39Gorter J.A. Aronica E. Hack N.J. Balazs R. Wadman W.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Adult rat ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as described previously (40Hilal-Dandan R. Khairallah P.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on laminin-coated coverslips in medium 199 with Earle's salts and l-glutamine (CellGro, Mediatech, Washington, D.C.) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 4% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO-K1 cells (CCL-61 American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (CellGro, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cells were split and plated at 30–40% confluency on coverslips in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (1 μg/well total) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 4 h of exposure, cells were washed once with normal growth medium and then incubated for 1 to 2 days in normal growth medium under normal growth conditions. Cultured rat cerebellar granule cells were coinfected with a 3:1 ratio of Ad4.2ST or Adβ-Gal:AdhGFP on day 3 in culture. The multiplicity of infection that gave the best results was in the range of 100–500. The AdhGFP allowed visual inspection of the percent infected cells. Infections were carried out in a minimal volume of culture medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37 °C. The best results were obtained by removing a coverslip of cells from the dish and placing it into a fresh dish where it was covered with 100–200 μl of infection medium. Surface tension was sufficient to hold the infection medium in place. Following the 2-h infection time the coverslip was placed back in the original culture plate and monitored for the appearance of GFP in granule cells (24–48 h.). If the cells had been coinfected with β-galactosidase, they were further processed by fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for β-galactosidase activity. Rat ventricular myocytes were similarly infected except that the multiplicities of infection used were in the range of 5 to 20 and it was not necessary to infect a single coverslip at a time as there were no surrounding cells as with neuronal culture. AdmtGFP was used to monitor infection efficiency for myocytes rather than AdhGFP. Experiments were performed at 21–23 °C. Whole cell currents were recorded with the Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1–5 kHz. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). The use of intracellular EGTA suppressed any calcium-dependent component of the transient outward current (41Zygmunt A.C. Gibbons W.R. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 424-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that might have been present in the rat ventricular myocytes; the remaining Ito thus consists entirely of the calcium-independent transient outward potassium current (also called Ito1). The bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH7.4). For comparison between groups, peak currents are normalized for cell size based on the capacitance of the cell and expressed as current density (pA/pF). To reduce experimental variability in cotransfections, cells were routinely studied between 42 and 50 h after the introduction of the transgene. Viral infections of primary cells were also studied at this time for consistency with the cotransfection and for the following practical reasons. In the case of adult cardiac myocytes, variable changes in ion channel expression with increasing time in culture were too great to allow statistical evaluation beyond 2–3 days. The cerebellar granule neurons began to exhibit cytopathic effects at time points past 72 h of infection in both control and test infections. Viral DNA was isolated as described previously (42Hitt M. Bett A.J. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 479-490Crossref Google Scholar). DNA was size-separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Nytran nylon membranes using a Turboblotter apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were prehybridized and hybridized in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Probes were labeled using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using the RPAII kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized to both sense and antisense RNA probes for the Kv4.2ST sequence. Protected fragments were separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. CHO-K1 cells (CCL-61, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) plated on glass coverslips were transfected with pGFP-Kv4.2ST or pGFP-Kv4.2ST and pE-Kv4.2FL using LipofectAMINE. After 36 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed upside down on a microscope slide over a drop of phosphate-buffered saline. The edges of the coverslip were sealed with rubber cement to prevent drying. Images were taken on a laser scanning confocal microscope (PCM 2000, Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) with a 60× objective lens (numerical aperture 1.2). Pooled data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons of means between groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance. P values less then 0.05 were deemed significant. Kv4.2ST was designed to multimerize with and cripple full-length products of the Kv4 gene family. By analogy to theShaker family, we reasoned that the truncated construct including the first transmembrane segment (S1) would contain the determinants of multimerization but would otherwise be nonfunctional. To assess the efficiency of the Kv4.2ST construct in suppressing currents expressed by Kv4 genes, we performed cotransfection experiments. When cotransfected into CHO-K1 cells, Kv4.2ST suppresses functional expression of a full-length Kv4.2 construct (Fig.2, A, B, andC). These experiments were done at a 2:1 molar ratio of pE1Kv4.2ST:pRepKv4.2FL based on preliminary experiments in which the currents were found to be much more variable at molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. Suppression of Kv4 current is specific, since cotransfection of Kv4.2ST with a Kv1.5 expression vector (also at a 2:1 molar ratio) does not affect functional expression of this channel (Fig. 2, D,E, and F). These results encouraged the production of the recombinant adenovirus containing this construct (AdKv4.2ST) for infection of neurons and cardiac myocytes, which are notoriously difficult to transfect by conventional means. Southern blot analysis of isolated viral DNA confirmed the presence of the Kv4.2ST sequence in the recombinant adenovirus (data not shown). RNase protection analysis of total RNA isolated from HEK293 cells, which had been infected with either AdKv4.2ST, AdCKv4.2AS, or AdRKv4.2AS, revealed that only sense and antisense (respectively) RNAs were expressed from these constructs in detectable amounts (Fig. 3). Based on preliminary experiments in isolated dog cardiac myocytes, AdKv4.2ST was expanded for further analysis. Cerebellar granule neurons were chosen to test the idea that the A-type current is encoded by Shal family genes (12Serodio P. Vega-Saenz De Miera E. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 39Gorter J.A. Aronica E. Hack N.J. Balazs R. Wadman W.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 43Zegarra-Moran O. Moran O. Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 98: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), because these cells are easily maintained in culture with minimal changes in A-type current density over time. Infection of cultures of granule neurons using low multiplicities of infection (range 10–50) of AdhGFP resulted primarily in infection of surrounding glial cells, as had been previously observed in other neuronal cultures (32Moriyoshi K. Richards L.J. Akazawa C. O'Leary D.D.M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Granule cells are easily distinguished from glial cells by their size and morphology. When multiplicities of infection were increased to 100–500, infection of neuronal cells could be observed at 24–48 h. To positively identify infected neurons for electrophysiologic study, AdhGFP was included in all infections and the duration of expression was calculated from the first appearance of GFP-positive neurons. Fig.4 A shows representative A-type currents elicited in an Adβ-Gal-infected control cell upon depolarization to +40 mV following prepulses to two different potentials (−90 mV, −40 mV, 500 ms). Infection with AdKv4.2ST suppresses the A-type current in the cerebellar granule neurons without affecting the maintained component (Fig. 4 B). The pooled data from 8 control and 8 test cells (Fig. 4 C) confirm that the reduction in current density by AdKv4.2ST is significant (p < 0.001). The virally mediated suppression of native A-type current in neurons is not complete at 42–50 h unlike the suppression of the expressed Kv4.2 current (Fig. 2). The remaining transient currents decay at the same rate as the control currents, suggesting that the residual current is comprised of channels that are functionally identical to those that were knocked out. Thus, the lack of complete knockout likely reflects competition between the time course of expression of the Kv4.2ST gene product and the turnover rate of the functional channel subunits. Alternatively, it is possible that other non-Kv4 family genes encode a minor fraction of the A-type current. Rat ventricular myocytes were also chosen due to the established presence of both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 mRNA in the heart and the relative ease with which these cells could be maintained for several days in primary culture (9Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 11Dixon J.E. Shi W. Wang H.S. McDonald C. Yu H. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the fully primed and prepulse-inactivated (−90 mV and −40 mV holding potentials, respectively) transient outward currents elicited by test pulses to +40 mV in a myocyte infected with Adβ-galactosidase (panel A) and in another infected with AdKv4.2ST (panel B). The pooled data in Fig. 5 C(n = 6 in each group) confirm the significant suppression of native rat cardiac Ito by infection with AdKv4.2ST. As was the case with the cerebellar granule cells, the suppression of current was substantial but not complete at 42–50 h. Nevertheless, the results indicate that Kv4 genes constitute the major contributors to Ito in heart cells and to A-type currents in cerebellar granule cells. To probe the mechanism of action of Kv4.2ST, fusion constructs were generated with EGFP so that the expressed truncated protein could be localized within living cells with confocal imaging. We first confirmed that the fusion protein GFP-Kv4.2ST acted similarly to Kv4.2ST. Fig.6, A and B, shows currents recorded in a CHO-K1 cell cotransfected with pRCCMVKv1.4 and pCMVβ-Gal (A) or pGFPKv4.2ST (B). As was the case for Kv4.2ST and Kv1.5, there is no suppression of Kv1.4 by GFP-Kv4.2 (Fig. 6 C). Nevertheless, the fusion protein could suppress Shal family currents (either Kv4.2, Fig. 6,D–F, or Kv4.3, Fig. 6, G–I). The summary data in panels F and I show comparable levels of suppression for Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (p < 0.005). Kir2.1-AAA is an unrelated inwardly rectifying potassium channel with a pore mutation designed to suppress Kir2.1 channels (27Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and was added as a control in these experiments to ensure that suppression of Kv4.2 current was not simply attributable to coexpression with another membrane protein. This control is particularly apt because GFPKir2.1-AAA does suppress the functional expression of inwardly rectifying currents encoded by wild-type Kir2.1 (44Schreur K. Johns D.C. Tomaselli G.F. O'Rourke B. Circulation. 1997; 96: I-422Google Scholar). Confocal imaging of CHO-K1 cells transfected with pGFP-Kv4.2ST (Fig.7 A) or cotransfected with pGFP-Kv4.2ST and pE-Kv4.2FL (Fig. 7 B) reveals that the fusion construct is richly concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cells. In families of Z-plane images, fluorescence intensity was also detected on the surface of the cells (not shown). These findings suggest that at least some of the suppression of functional current may be due to premature degradation of heteromeric channel complexes, and/or to effects on the processing of the mature protein prior to externalization. However, this apparently abnormal localization of a membrane protein does not seem to be restricted to the truncated version of this protein, as fusion constructs containing full-length channels also have similar localization patterns despite the fact that robust membrane currents can be readily detected in such cells (45Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W. Howe J.R. Hughes T.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not possible at this time to state unequivocally whether the suppression of current occurs as a result of premature degradation, as the result of the formation of nonfunctional tetramers in the surface membrane, or as a combination of the two effects.Figure 7GFP-Kv4.2ST is distributed in various cell membranes. A confocal image of pGFP-Kv4.2ST transfected into CHO-K1 cells (A) shows concentration of the fusion protein in the intracellular membranes. This distribution is similar in a cell that was cotransfected with pGFP-Kv4.2ST and pE-Kv4.2FL (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The use of a dominant-negative Kv4.2 ion channel construct specifically suppresses the transient outward current of rat ventricular myocytes as well as the A-type current of cerebellar granule neurons.

We show here that Kv4.2ST specifically suppresses members of the Shalfamily. In addition, this is the first experimental demonstration thatShal family members can form heteromultimers with each other. This strategy provides a unique way of determining the molecular identity of macroscopic ionic currents in native cells and may provide a useful tool in understanding the exact role these currents play in cellular physiology. The use of the adenovirus vector also allows the potential use of this strategy in vivo as well as in vitro. Whereas the introduction of dominant-negative constructs may also be achieved by transgenic approaches, developmental adaptation or possible lethal effects may complicate the interpretation of such experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2005960069,"Developmentally regulated and cell type-specific expression of distinct sulfated glycosaminoglycan structures on cell surface proteoglycans is increasingly recognized as providing information relevant to cell-cell interactions and differentiation in developing organisms. In this report, developmental regulation of both the sulfation profile of chondroitin sulfate chains and activities of chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) were evaluated in embryonic chicken brain. The results revealed that the sulfation profile and the sulfotransferase activities changed markedly with development, and these alterations were precisely coordinated. Specifically, the proportions of both chondroitin 6-sulfate to 4-sulfate and C6ST to C4ST activities progressively decreased with development. In addition, the total amounts of both chondroitin sulfate chains and the sulfotransferase activities were highest during early embryonic stages and decreased sharply as the development reached completion. The developmental expression of the C6ST gene was also found to parallel the developmental down-regulation of both the C6ST activity and the chondroitin 6-sulfate structure. These findings suggest that the developmentally regulated expression of the sulfotransferases is a predominant factor for stage-specific regulation of chondroitin sulfate structures.

Plenum Publishing, New York1981: 39-63Crossref Google Scholar). Despite the ubiquity of this family of molecules, a wide variety of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans with characteristic sulfated GAG chains exhibit tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression (3Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and have been implicated in the regulation and maintenance of cell proliferation, cytodifferentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (4Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structures of cartilage chondroitin sulfate GAGs change with normal embryonic development and growth or aging (4Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Mathews M.B. Glagov S. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Robinson H.C. Dorfman A.

In neural development, chondroitin sulfate governs developmentally significant events such as cellular adhesion, migration, and neurite outgrowth (9Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1990; 4: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,10Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the developmentally regulated and tissue-specific synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, as well as other GAGs, has yet to be clarified. Chondroitin sulfate has a linear polymer structure that possesses repetitive, sulfated disaccharide units containing glucuronic acid and GalNAc (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 491-517Google Scholar, 2Hascall V.C. Hascall G.K. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing, New York1981: 39-63Crossref Google Scholar). Since GAG structures are largely determined by the specificities of the glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases responsible for their synthesis, it is presumed that the differential expression of these enzymes is the key for the controlled synthesis of GAGs. However, few reports have systematically investigated the degree to which specific glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases are differentially expressed in normal tissues or how such expression might be regulated in a tissue-specific and development-dependent manner. The major chondroitin sulfate found in the mammalian tissues bears sulfate groups at position 4 or 6 of GalNAc residues. It was reported that the ratio of 4-sulfation/6-sulfation changed during development of chicken and human epiphyseal cartilage and rat skin (4Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Mathews M.B. Glagov S. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Robinson H.C. Dorfman A.

Considering the fact that the extracellular matrix of cartilage resembles that of the brain, it is rich in chondroitin sulfates, lecticans, and hyaluronic acid, but unlike the brain matrix, it contains abundant fibrous collagen (12Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and it is of particular interest to determine the changes in the sulfation profile of the chondroitin sulfate chains during brain development and to further elucidate the factors responsible for the specific sulfation. In this report, we present evidence that the ratio of 4-sulfation/6-sulfation in the embryonic chick brain changes with development and that relative levels of the specific sulfotransferase activities are closely coordinated with relative changing levels of the specific chondroitin sulfate structures. The results support the concept that expression of sulfotransferases is a predominant factor regulating the sulfation profile of chondroitin sulfate structures. [35S]PAPS and unlabeled PAPS were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and Sigma, respectively. Fertile White Leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from a local poultry farm and incubated at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere, until the desired developmental stage was reached according to Hamburger and Hamilton (13Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (10020) Google Scholar). Chondroitin (a chemically desulfated derivative of whale cartilage chondroitin sulfate A), five unsaturated standard disaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfate, Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc (ΔDi-0S), Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) (ΔDi-4S), Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) (ΔDi-6S), Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) (ΔDi-diSE), and Δ4,5HexA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) (ΔDi-diSD), chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4), chondro-4-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9), and chondro-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.10) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp., Japan. HITRAPTMdesalting columns were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Sweden. All other reagents and chemicals were of the highest quality available. Most chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans can be extracted from brain using physiological buffers without detergent, and approximately 70% of total chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are reportedly extracted by phosphate-buffered saline (14Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Takida Y. Kuboki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10240-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, soluble chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan fractions from brain were prepared as described previously (14Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Takida Y. Kuboki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10240-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, embryonic chick brains from various developmental stages were homogenized with a tight-fitting Potter glass homogenizer in 5 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was subjected to rehomogenization in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, both supernatant fluids were combined, concentrated, and then washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm sodium acetate using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc.). The protein concentration of the proteoglycan fractions was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The proteoglycan fractions prepared above (about 100 μg of protein each) were first digested using 5 mIU of chondroitin ABC lyase as described elsewhere (15Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and evaporated to dryness. The digests were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide according to the manufacturer's instructions (SIGNALTM labeling kit, Oxford GlycoSystems). The labeled disaccharides were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (16Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Seno N. Kitagawa H. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26745-26754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The HPLC was performed in an LC-10AS system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear gradient from 16 to 798 mm NaH2PO4 over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. Eluates were monitored using an RF-535 fluorometric detector (Shimadzu Co.) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. The identification and quantification of the resulting disaccharide units were accomplished by comparison with the standard chondroitin sulfate-derived unsaturated disaccharide labeled with 2-aminobenzamide as described elsewhere (17Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Abstracts of XIXth Japanese Carbohydrate Symposium, August 5–7, 1997. Nishinomia, Japan1997: 106Google Scholar) and by enzymatic digestion using chondro-4- and 6-sulfatases as reported elsewhere (15Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Embryonic chick brains from various developmental stages were homogenized with a tight-fitting Potter glass homogenizer in 5 volumes (w/v) of 0.15m imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were used as the enzyme source. The protein concentration of the homogenates was determined as described above. In a preliminary study, assay conditions for brain chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) were established by examining various factors such as buffers, metal ions, substrate concentrations, and inhibitors for PAPS degradation (data not shown). The assay mixture contained 120 μg of chondroitin, 10 μm PAPS (about 2.5 × 105 cpm), 24 μg of polylysine, 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2,3-dimercaptopropan-1-ol, 10 mmMgCl2, and enzymes in a total volume of 60 μl. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 2 h, and the reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected to gel filtration on a column of HITRAPTMdesalting to isolate 35S-labeled chondroitin as described previously (18Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactive peak corresponding to the35S-labeled chondroitin was pooled and evaporated to dryness. For determining the transfer of sulfate to positions 4 and 6 of GalNAc residues, one-third of each 35S-labeled chondroitin fraction was digested using 5 mIU of chondroitin ABC lyase, and the resulting unsaturated disaccharides were identified by HPLC as reported elsewhere (15Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To confirm the disaccharide structure, chondro-4-sulfatase or 6-sulfatase digestion of chondroitin ABC lyase digest was conducted with the remainder of each 35S-labeled chondroitin fraction as described elsewhere (15Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). From the incorporation into ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-6S, activities of C4ST and C6ST were determined, respectively. Under the established incubation conditions for the C4ST and the C6ST, [35S]sulfate incorporation into polymer chondroitin was proportional to the incubation time for up to 4 h. Total RNA from chick embryo tissues at various developmental stages was isolated using the QuickPrep® total RNA extraction kit (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA integrity and concentration were assessed by electrophoresis in a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%) and ethidium bromide staining. The RT-PCR reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Takara RNA LA PCR kit, Kyoto, Japan), using 1 μg of total RNA as a template. To amplify an equivalent quantity of cDNA for each sample, we determined the exact amount of cDNA of each sample required to obtain equal levels of amplification of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose transcript is always present in the tissues at the same level. The amplification reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl using the 5′ primer, 5′-ACCACTGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, and the 3′ primer, 5′-TCCACAACACGGTTGCTGTA-3′, by 20 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. Of the amplified products, 10 μl were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Using normalized cDNA input, we then performed amplification of a C6ST transcript. The experiment was performed with a serial number of cycles (25-30-35) to find the conditions for a semiquantitative amplification, since a low number of cycles resulted in no amplification and a high number of cycles resulted in an overamplification. The best results were obtained by carrying out 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s using the 5′ primer, 5′-CGAGAAGGAAAACAACTTCA-3′ (the nucleotide sequence corresponding to 321–340 of the cDNA for chick C6ST) (19Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the 3′ primer, 5′-CTCGGGCGCTGGTGAGAT-3′ (the nucleotide sequence corresponding to 769–786), which have been designed to span the intron in the C6ST gene 2K. Tsutsumi, H. Kitagawa, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. to discriminate a PCR product amplified from cDNA from, if any, one amplified from contaminating genomic DNA. PCR products were then visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. To confirm that the amplified DNAs were derived from the C6ST mRNA, the amplified fragments were gel-purified, subcloned into theSrfI site of the pCR-Script cloning vector (Stratagene), and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNAs were identical to that of the chick C6ST cDNA demonstrated by Fukutaet al. (19Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The sequencing reaction with a thermal cycler was performed with a dye terminator cycle sequencing FS ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems) using a T3 or T7 primer (Stratagene). Gel electrophoresis and analysis of the data were performed with a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). To study the changes in the amounts of the specific chondroitin sulfate chains in embryonic chick brain during development, disaccharide analysis of the chondroitin ABC lyase digest of the brain chondroitin sulfate at each developmental stage was carried out. As shown in Fig.1 A, the amounts of all unsaturated disaccharide units detected, ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-4S, ΔDi-6S, ΔDi-diSD, and ΔDi-diSE (on a per protein basis) were the highest at stage 29, the first point examined, although those of the ΔDi-diSD and the ΔDi-diSE were relatively small (0.70 and 0.20 pmol/μg of protein, respectively). Thereafter, the amount of each disaccharide unit sharply declined with development. Previous studies have indicated that the ratio of 6-sulfation/4-sulfation of GalNAc residues in chondroitin sulfate chains changes during the development of epiphyseal cartilage (4Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Robinson H.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 348-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, proportions of these disaccharide units during brain development were calculated. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the ratio of ΔDi-6S to ΔDi-4S decreased gradually. Specifically, ΔDi-6S accounted for about 60% of the total disaccharide units at stage 29, and its proportion decreased gradually with development. Similarly, ΔDi-0S accounted for about 10% of the total disaccharide units at stage 29, and its proportion reached a maximum around stage 33 then declined. In contrast, ΔDi-4S accounted for about 30% of the total disaccharide units at stage 29, and its proportion increased progressively with development. In addition, the proportion of disulfated disaccharide units, ΔDi-diSD and ΔDi-diSE, increased slightly as the development reached completion. To evaluate the key regulatory factor controlling the developmental changes in the sulfation profile, we investigated developmental profiles of the C4ST and the C6ST activities responsible for the synthesis of 4-O-sulfated GalNAc and 6-O-sulfated GalNAc, respectively. Activities of the C4ST and the C6ST were measured in the brain homogenates at various stages of embryonic development. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, the specific activities of these two enzymes were the highest at stage 29, and then sharply declined with development. Remarkably, the ratio of the C6ST activity to the C4ST activity decreased gradually with development (Fig.2 B), which correlated closely with the decreasing ratio of ΔDi-6S to ΔDi-4S as described above (see Fig. 1 B). These findings suggested that expression of sulfotransferases is a predominant factor regulating the sulfation profile of chondroitin sulfate structures. Of several sulfotransferases responsible for chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis, only C6ST cDNA has so far been cloned (19Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To directly examine the relationship between the C6ST gene expression and the C6ST activity in embryonic chick brain during development, the relative proportion of C6ST mRNA was determined in chick brain at various stages of embryonic development. Since the level of the C6ST mRNA expression is relatively low (19Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the abundance of the C6ST mRNA in the RNA samples was estimated by RT-PCR analysis. The relative gene expression levels, which were normalized as to transcription of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are shown in Fig.3. A single amplified DNA of the expected size (466 base pairs) was obtained from each RNA preparation of stages 29, 33, 35, and 40. From stage 29 to stage 40, no significant developmental change was detected in the amount of the C6ST mRNA in the brain, with the overall expression remaining at a low level. At stage 43, a detectable decrease occurred, and no transcripts were detected in the adult brain. Notably, the signal was not detected in the adult brain after 40 cycles of PCR, even when analyzed by Southern blotting (data not shown). Qualitative comparison of the results shown in Fig. 2 A with the RT-PCR analysis in Fig. 3 shows a correlation between the levels of the C6ST activity and the levels of the C6ST mRNA in the brain. In this study, we demonstrated that the sulfation profile of chondroitin sulfate chains and the ratio of the sulfotransferase activities forming the specific sulfation profile changed markedly with development in the chick embryo brain, and these alterations were precisely coordinated. The importance of the differential expression of sulfotransferases has not been fully evaluated. Several sulfotransferases responsible for GAG synthesis appear to compete for common acceptor substrates (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 491-517Google Scholar, 2Hascall V.C. Hascall G.K. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing, New York1981: 39-63Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the type of sulfotransferases expressed by a cell should influence the sulfation pattern found on the GAGs it produces. For example, the C6ST and the C4ST studied here compete for GalNAc residues in the (4GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1-) n sequence of chondroitin sulfate chains to form 6-O-sulfated GalNAc and 4-O-sulfated GalNAc, respectively. Structural analysis shows that chondroitin sulfate chains of various animal tissues have highly variable sulfation profiles, and some have exclusively 4-O-sulfated GalNAc residues, whereas most others have a hybrid structure of 4-O-sulfated and 6-O-sulfated GalNAc residues with various ratios in the repeating disaccharide region (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 491-517Google Scholar, 2Hascall V.C. Hascall G.K. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix.

Although smaller proportions of disulfated disaccharide units (ΔDi-diSDand ΔDi-diSE) may indicate the existence of multiple C6ST and C4ST isoenzymes and genes, the observations seem to suggest that the gross sulfation pattern results from the ratio of mainly C6ST and C4ST expressed by a cell. This concept is supported by the present results obtained from the examination of the developmental expression of the C4ST and the C6ST in chick embryo brain. As observed in Figs.1 B, 2 B, and 3, the developmental changing patterns of both the expression ratio of the C6ST to the C4ST and of the C6ST gene corresponded closely to the present finding that the relative amount of chondroitin 6-sulfate as compared with 4-sulfate progressively decreased with development of chicken brain. Therefore, the developmentally regulated expression of sulfotransferases is a predominant factor regulating the sulfation profile of chondroitin sulfate structures. Although the exact biological significance of the developmental changes in the sulfation profile is presently unclear, it is feasible that they affect at least some developmentally significant events such as cellular adhesion, migration, and neurite outgrowth (9Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1990; 4: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this respect, it should be noted that the structure of chondroitin sulfate chains on 6B4 proteoglycan/phosphacan changes during development of the brain (23Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia. 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the early developmental stages, substantial amounts of chondroitin 6-sulfate are found, but later, the chondroitin sulfate chains of 6B4 proteoglycan are virtually composed of only chondroitin 4-sulfate (23Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia. 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Very recently, Maeda et al. (25Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have reported that 6B4 proteoglycan binds pleiotrophin and chondroitin ABC lyase digestion of 6B4 proteoglycan decreases the binding affinity. They also showed that chondroitin 6-sulfate was a potent inhibitor of 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin binding as well as heparan sulfate, whereas chondroitin 4-sulfate was a poor inhibitor (25Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Therefore, the developmental change in the sulfation profile of chondoritin sulfate chains of 6B4 proteoglycan may regulate the binding affinity of the proteoglycan to pleiotrophin. In addition, in chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage and rat skin, there has been observed a progressive decrease in the ratio of chondroitin-6-sulfate to 4-sulfate with development, chondroitin 4-sulfate being predominant with the progress of tissue development (5Mathews M.B. Glagov S. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,6Robinson H.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 348-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Habuchi H. Kimata K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems to be a general phenomenon that immature tissues containing proliferating and differentiating cells synthesize more chondroitin 6-sulfate than adult tissues composed of quiescent mature cells. Hence, it is worth investigating whether chondroitin 6-sulfate itself plays a role in the stimulation of cell division. The carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates on the surfaces of cells are also known to undergo various changes during the malignant transformation of cells. Many of these carbohydrate structures are described as onco/fetal antigens because they are most abundant in early fetal development, and their expression is developmentally regulated (26Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 27Rademacher T.W. Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 785-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Indeed, the relative amount of chondroitin 6-sulfate as compared with 4-sulfate progressively increases with malignant transformation of human colon carcinoma cells (28Adany R. Heimer R. Caterson B. Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the present results that the expression ratio of the C6ST to the C4ST was highest during early embryonic stages, then decreased as the development reached completion, it is of particular interest to evaluate the C6ST and C4ST expression during malignant transformation of human colon carcinoma cells. Earlier studies have indicated that the sulfation of GAG chains ordinarily proceeds together with polymerization at a single Golgi site and that there appears to be close interrelationships between sulfation and polymer elongation/termination (for reviews, see Refs. 29Silbert J.E. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1991; 3: 343-351Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar and 30Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In fact, our recent findings have revealed that specific sulfate groups have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on GalNAc transfer, and consequently sulfation reactions indeed play important roles in chain elongation and termination (31Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is an additional possibility that the regulated expression of glycosyltransferases involved in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis could in part control the chain length of chondroitin sulfate. In this regard, it is of interest to note that chondroitin sulfate chains become shorter with age (7Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the serum levels of glucuronyltransferase activity involved in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis change developmentally, being markedly higher at the middle prenatal than at the late prenatal stage (33Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6583-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, although only two sulfotransferase activities (the C6ST and the C4ST) and one gene (the C6ST) have been examined in this study among the 10 or more which are thought to be required to form known chondroitin sulfate isoform structures with various sulfation profiles, it is expected that the regulated expression of other sulfotransferases and even glycosyltransferases involved in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis are equally important in establishing the cell type-specific and developmentally regulated expression of chondroitin sulfate isoforms. As the glycosyltransferase cDNAs and additional sulfotransferase cDNAs become available, it will be of considerable interest to establish the degree to which the expression of these enzymes is regulated in differentiating and developing cells. Such information will be required for understanding the control mechanism of cellular recognition events mediated by chondroitin sulfate chains during development and differentiation (3Poole A.R.

Alanine substitution mutations were created in a well conserved IGDE motif found within the BH3 domain of Bax (residues 66–69) and the resulting mutant Bax proteins were tested for ability to homodimerize with themselves and to heterodimerize with Bcl-2. Correlations were made with cell death induction by these mutants of Bax both in mammalian cells where Bax may function through several mechanisms, and in yeast where Bax may exert its lethal actions through a more limited repertoire of mechanisms perhaps related to its ability to form ion channels in intracellular membranes. Two of the mutants, Bax(D68A) and Bax(E69A), retained the ability to homodimerize but failed to interact with Bcl-2 as determined by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation analysis using transfected mammalian cells. The Bax(E69A) protein exhibited a lethal phenotype in yeast, which could be specifically suppressed by co-expression of Bcl-2, despite its failure to dimerize with Bcl-2. Both the Bax(D68A) and Bax(E69A) proteins induced apoptosis when overexpressed in human 293 cells, despite an inability to bind to Bcl-2. Moreover, co-expression of Bcl-2 with Bax(D68A) and Bax(E69A) rescued mammalian cells from apoptosis. In contrast, a mutant of Bax lacking the IGDE motif, Bax(ΔIGDE), was incapable of either homodimerizing with itself or heterodimerizing with Bcl-2 and was inactive at promoting cell death in either yeast or mammalian cells. Although failing to interact with Bcl-2, the Bax(D68A) and Bax(E69A) mutants retained the ability to bind to Bid, a putative Bax-activating member of the Bcl-2 family, and collaborated with Bid in inducing apoptosis. When taken together with previous observations, these findings indicate that (i) Bax can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells irrespective of heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and (ii) Bcl-2 can rescue both mammalian cells and yeast from the lethal effects of Bax without heterodimerizing with it. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that BH3-dependent homodimerization of Bax or interactions with Bax activators such as Bid may either assist or be required for the cell death-inducing mechanism of this protein.

Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role as regulators of programmed cell death and apoptosis (1Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar, 2Yang E.

Many Bcl-2 family proteins including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak can physically interact with each other, forming a complex network of homo- and heterodimers (1Reed J.C.

The BH3 domain corresponds to the second amphipathic α-helix in these proteins, as predicted from the three-dimensional structure of Bcl-XL (13Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P.

Certain mutations that affect residues lining this pocket have been shown to abrogate their ability to dimerize with Bax (4Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bik, Hrk, and Bid, contain only a BH3 domain (10Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Deletion of the BH3 domains from these proteins uniformly abolishes their functions as inducers of cell death and antagonists of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Moreover, overexpression of fragments of the pro-apoptotic protein Bak which include only the BH3 domain but not the other BH domains has been shown to be sufficient for inducing apoptosis in mammalian cells (8Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).In addition to providing insights into mechanism of dimerization, the three-dimensional structure of Bcl-XL has also revealed striking overall similarity to the pore-forming domains of certain bacterial toxins (13Muchmore S.W.

Consistent with structural predictions, recombinant Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax proteins have been shown to form ion-conducting channels in liposomes and planar bilayersin vitro (17Minn A.J. Velez P.

Although the role of homo- and heterodimerization in pore formation remains to be explored, it seems likely that a minimum of two molecules is required to create an ion channel, based on structural considerations and comparisons with other α-helical-type channel proteins (18Schendel S.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar).Despite the advances that have been made in understanding the structural aspects of dimerization among Bcl-2 family proteins, the functional significance of many of these protein-protein interactions remains controversial. For example, mutagenesis studies of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL initially suggested that heterodimerization with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was critical for their cell survival activities (4Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 9Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Subsequently, however, alanine substitution mutants of Bcl-XL were reported that failed to dimerize with Bax but which retained the ability to promote cell survival (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Whether such heterodimerization-defective mutants of Bcl-XL could prevent cell death specifically induced by overexpression of Bax was not addressed, raising questions about whether heterodimerization might nevertheless be required for the mutual antagonism displayed by anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/Bcl-XL) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) Bcl-2 family proteins.The role of homo- and heterodimerization in Bax- and Bak-induced apoptosis has also generated controversy. For example, deletion of the BH3 domain from the Bax or Bak proteins as well as removal of four amino acids from within the BH3 of Bax comprising a well conserved IGDE motif was reported to abolish Bax/Bak-mediated cell death in mammalian cells (8Chittenden T.

These same BH3 domain mutations also abrogated the ability of Bax and Bak to induce cell death in yeast and negated homo- and heterodimerization (7Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

However, when tested in another mammalian cell line, Bax(ΔBH3) was reported to accelerate apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs as effectively as wild-type Bax protein and to abrogate the cytoprotective effects of Bcl-XL overexpression, despite its inability to dimerize with either Bax or Bcl-XL (24Simonian P.L.

The findings derived from studies of these mutants indicate that Bax can promote cell death independently of heterodimerization with Bcl-2. Furthermore, evidence is presented that Bcl-2 can rescue both yeast and mammalian cells from cell death induced by overexpression of Bax, without binding to this pro-apoptotic protein. The implications of these findings with regards to mechanisms of Bcl-2 and Bax function are discussed.DISCUSSIONHow Bax promotes cell death in mammalian cells and yeast is controversial. At least two potentially independent mechanisms can be envisioned. First, the BH3 domain of Bax can bind to Bcl-2 and related anti-apoptotic proteins, thus potentially inactivating them. This mechanism is analogous to how the subgroup of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins which contain only BH3 domains (e.g. Bik, Hrk) presumably functions (10Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 11Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Second, Bax may form cytotoxic channels for ions or other molecules in the intracellular membranes where it resides (19Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.-J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). We have speculated that the lethal phenotype displayed by some pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bak in budding and fission yeast is a manifestation of this channel activity, particularly since yeast contain no identifiable Bcl-2 homologs (15Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Consistent with these ideas, it has been shown that expression of a fragment of Bak consisting essentially only of its BH3 domain tethered to a TM domain is sufficient for inducing apoptosis in mammalian cells in which BH3-binding anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are found, whereas such BH3 only mutants of Bak which lack the predicted pore-forming fifth and sixth α-helices are inactive in yeast (8Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 23Ink B. Zornig M. Baum B. Hajibagheri N. James C. Chittenden T. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the relative contributions of these two mechanisms for the pro-apoptotic functions of Bax and Bak remain to be clarified but cellular context seems likely to play a large role.Based on the mutants of Bax characterized here, we surmise that BH3-dependent heterodimerization with Bcl-2 is not required for the pro-apoptotic function of Bax in mammalian cells. This was specifically shown by the ability of the Bax(D68A) and Bax(E69A) mutants to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in 293T cells, without forming heterodimers with Bcl-2. Although it is difficult to exclude the possibility that these mutants of Bax retain the ability to heterodimerize with other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family that may be present in mammalian cells, these mutants also do not interact with Bcl-XL (data not presented). Thus, Bax apparently need not heterodimerize with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL to promote apoptosis in mammalian cells. Moreover, the observation that Bcl-2 can protect human cells from cell death induced by overexpression of the Bax(D68A) and Bax(E69A) mutants implies that it is unnecessary for Bcl-2 to dimerize with Bax for negating apoptosis induced by overexpression of this protein. Similar results have been obtained by Simonian et al. (24Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Andrews D.W. Leber B. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32073-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using a double alanine substitution mutant of Bax in which Asp-68 and Glu-69 were simultaneously converted to alanine, showing a failure of this protein to bind Bcl-XL while still retaining its ability to accelerate cell death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and to negate the cytoprotective effects of Bcl-XL. However, those and other studies (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) did not explore whether apoptosis induced specifically by overexpression of Bax could also be inhibited by Bcl-XLthrough a heterodimerization-independent mechanism. Another report by Tao et al. (31Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) similarly found that mutants of Bcl-XL with reduced ability to heterodimerize with Bax remained active as suppressors of Bax-induced cell death in yeast, also supporting the idea of heterodimerization-independent antagonism of Bax. However, those Bcl-XL mutants were only partially defective in Bax-binding, thus limiting interpretation of the results (31Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Previously we showed that deletion of the IGDE motif in the BH3 domain of Bax or removal of the entire BH3 domain prevented these proteins from homodimerizing and from inducing cell death in yeast and mammalian cells (7Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although some other studies have explored the effects of BH3 domain mutations on the ability of Bax and Bak to interact with Bcl-XL or to bind the wild-type Bax protein (8Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 24Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nunez G. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32073-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), they have not addressed the issue of whether these mutant Bax proteins could still homodimerize with themselves and whether this related to their function as death-inducing molecules. None of the alanine-substitution mutants of the IGDE motif within Bax BH3 domain interfered with homodimerization, as determined by yeast two-hybrid assays. In human 293T cells, these homodimerization-competent mutants of Bax also retained the ability to induce apoptosis, implying that homodimerization and cell death may be correlated. In addition, the Bax(Bcl-2/BH3) protein, in which the BH3 domain from Bcl-2 was substituted for that of Bax, failed to homodimerize and was inactive at inducing cell death in yeast, again supporting the idea that homodimerization may be correlated with Bax bioactivity. Unfortunately, this chimeric Bax(Bcl-2/BH3) protein was unstable in mammalian cells, precluding testing in that context. However, one of the mutants, Bax(D68A), lost its cell death activity in yeast, and yet remained capable of homodimerizing with itself. Thus, if homodimerization is required for the function of Bax, it evidently can be insufficient. Why the Bax(D68A) mutant was fully active in mammalian cells but impaired in its function in yeast remains to be determined, but presumably can be attributed to the greater complexity of Bcl-2/Bax family protein regulation and function in mammalian cells, where a variety of dimerizing homologs and other interacting proteins as well as post-translational modifications can occur that are not found in yeast (3Kroemer G. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 21Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar).It has been shown that Bcl-2 can prevent Bax-channel formation in synthetic lipid membranes in vitro (19Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.-J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms by which Bcl-2 might interfere with Bax channel formation can be envisioned. For example, BH3-dependent heterodimerization of Bcl-2 with Bax could prevent Bax from undergoing the conformational changes necessary for integration of its α5- and α6-helices into membranes, which represents the first step in channel formation. To the extent that Bax-mediated killing of yeast is a surrogate assay for Bax-channel activity, our data with the Bax(E68A) mutant which fails to dimerize with Bcl-2 discount this mechanism, since Bcl-2 was still able to rescue yeast from Bax(E69A)-induced cell death. Alternatively, or in addition, once Bax has integrated into membranes with its fifth and sixth α-helices penetrating perpendicularly through the lipid bilayer, Bcl-2 could possibly then interfere with the assembly of two or more Bax molecules in the membrane during a second step of channel formation where pairs of α-helices come together to form a ring which creates an aqueous lumen for transport of ions of other molecules. It should be noted that protein-protein interactions of the type suggested above involving the membrane-penetrating α5- and α6-helices may not be detectable by routine co-immunoprecipitation assays and most likely would not be discerned by yeast two-hybrid methods.The Bid protein is unique among the BH3-only subgroup of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in that it binds not only to anti-apoptotic members of the family such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but also interacts with Bax (12Wang K. Yin W.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Like other BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins, however, Bid is incapable of homodimerizing with itself. Preliminary mutagenesis studies of the BH3 domain of Bid suggest that binding to Bax rather than to Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL correlates with its pro-apoptotic activity in mammalian cells (12Wang K. Yin W.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). If confirmed by further analysis, this observation suggests that some BH3-dependent interactions with Bax may enhance its lethal function, we presume by somehow promoting Bax channel formation since the binding of the BH3 domain of Bid to Bax should preclude Bax from dimerizing with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and acting as a trans-dominant inhibitor of these anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (16Diaz J.-L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By analogy, the BH3-dependent homodimerization of Bax with itself may similarly play a role in the function of this protein as a promoter of cell death. Thus, we favor the notion that BH3-dependent homodimerization may facilitate or even be required for channel formation by Bax, inasmuch as removal of this domain from Bax (and Bak) abolishes its cytotoxic function in yeast (15Zha H."

Expression of either protein alone results in barely active or non-active channels, making it difficult to assess the individual contribution of each subunit to the channel complex. The residue Phe137, located within the H5 region of GIRK1, is critical to the synergy between GIRK1 and GIRK4 (Chan, K. W., Sui, J. L., Vivaudou, M., and Logothetis, D. E. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 14193–14198). By modifying this residue or the matching residue of GIRK4, Ser143, we have been able to generate mutant proteins that produced large inwardly rectifying, G-protein-modulated currents when expressed alone inXenopus oocytes. The enhanced activity of the heterologous expression of each of two active mutants, GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T), was not caused by association with an endogenous oocyte channel subunit, and these mutants did not display apparent differences in the ability to localize to the cell surface compared with their wild-type counterparts. When these functional mutant channels were compared individually with wild-type heteromeric channels, they responded with only small differences to a number of maneuvers involving coexpression with muscarinic receptors, G-protein βγ subunits, wild-type or mutated G-protein α subunits, and active protomers of pertussis toxin. These experiments, which confirmed the crucial, though not exclusive, role of Gβγ in regulating channel activity, demonstrated that GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T), and by extrapolation their wild-type counterparts, interact in a qualitatively similar way with G-protein subunits. These findings suggest that functionally important sites of interaction with G-proteins are likely to be located within the homologous regions of GIRK1 and GIRK4 rather than within the divergent terminal regions.

The best studied member of this family of channels is the cardiac KAChchannel, which is responsible for the negative chronotropic effect of acetylcholine (ACh) released by the vagus nerve. The binding of ACh to muscarinic type 2 (m2) receptors coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-proteins triggers the separation of the Gα and Gβγ subunits and activation of the KACh channel by Gβγ (1Logothetis D.E.

Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) characterized by cytoplasmic COOH and NH2 termini, flanking two putative transmembrane helices linked by a hydrophilic loop that is thought to line the channel lumen. Other members of the GIRK family include the brain GIRK2 and GIRK3 (6Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 353: 37-42Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 8Kofuji P. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which are expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Heterologous expression of GIRK1 with GIRK4 gives rise to channels indistinguishable from native KACh channels on the basis of ensemble membrane currents and single-channel properties as well as receptor and G-protein regulation (4Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of GIRK4 alone produced unnatural channels having lower activity, briefer openings, and faster activation kinetics (4Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A.

Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Expression of GIRK1 alone produces little or no channel activity, depending on the expression system. Evidence (9Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) suggests that any detectable activity results from association of GIRK1 with other subunits, such as with GIRK5 endogenously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It therefore appears that homomeric GIRK1 channels are not functional. The presence of a Phe at position 137 of GIRK1, within the presumed pore region H5, is a unique feature of GIRK1 among the remaining subfamily members and is essential to its synergistic coupling with GIRK4 (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phe137 also appears to repress the activity of GIRK1 homomers as evidenced by the high activity of the single-point mutant GIRK1(F137S), whereas the mutation at the matching residue in GIRK4, S143F, renders GIRK4 inactive, as evidenced by its inability to produce enhanced currents upon association with GIRK1 (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As further evidence of the importance of this position, we have also found that a Thr substitution of Ser143 of GIRK4 can give rise to highly active homomeric channels. We use here GIRK4(S143T) as well as the mutant GIRK1(F137S) to investigate the individual properties of each subunit of the GIRK channels, with particular attention to their regulation by G-protein subunits. A preliminary report of some of the results presented here has been published in abstract form (11Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 11Google Scholar).

Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification using T7/SP6 as flanking primers and complementary oligonucleotide primers incorporating the desired mutation. Polymerase chain reactions using Vent DNA polymerase were performed for only 20 cycles to avoid errors. Constructs were subcloned back into pGEMHE, and positive clones were confirmed by manual sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham). PTX-S1, the catalytic subunit of pertussis toxin which is responsible for the ADP-ribosylation of Gαi/o subunits (809 base pairs), was amplified with full-length PTX cDNA as a template (13Nicosia A.

Rappuoli) using standard polymerase chain reaction and was subcloned into pGEMHE. One positive clone was verified by sequencing. Requests for the PTX-S1 clone should be addressed to Dr. Eitan Reuveny. All constructs were linearized with NheI and cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the “message machine” kit (Ambion). RNAs were electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels, and concentrations were estimated from two dilutions using RNA marker (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a standard. Xenopus oocytes were isolated and microinjected as described previously (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, we injected the following approximate cRNA quantities: channel subunits, 2 ng/species; m2 receptor, 1.5 ng; Gα and Gβ subunits, 4 ng; Gγ subunit, 2 ng; PTX-S1, 1 ng. Injected oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 19 °C. Whole-oocyte currents were then measured by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Microelectrodes had a resistance between 0.3 and 1 megohms when filled with a 3 m KCl solution. Oocytes were superfused constantly with a high potassium solution having (in mm): 91 KCl, 1 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.3 niflumic acid (unless otherwise indicated), 5 KOH/HEPES, pH 7.4). To block or activate currents, the oocyte chamber was perfused with solutions of the same composition with 3 mm BaCl2 or 5 μm ACh, respectively. Typically oocytes were held at 0 mV (EK), and currents were monitored constantly by 300-ms pulses to a command potential of −80 mV every 2 s. Periodically, a similar protocol was applied but with a command potential from −100 to +100 mV with 10-mV increments. Current amplitudes were measured at the end of the 300-ms pulse. In such manner, control currents were evaluated 2–5 min after impaling the oocytes just before application of ACh; ACh-activated currents were evaluated at the peak of the response to ACh; and Ba2+-insensitive currents were evaluated once steady-state inhibition was achieved, 1–3 min after application of 3 mm Ba2+. Basal current is the difference between control and Ba2+-insensitive currents, and ACh-induced (or ACh-sensitive) current the difference between ACh-activated and control currents. For each species injected, at least three oocytes were tested. Thus, experiments involving multiple conditions required many hours of continuous recording, periods long enough for expression levels to vary significantly. Although not all experiments could be done on the same batch, we did ensure that the data were reproducible over at least three batches of oocytes, and we verified that interbatch variability did not affect our results. Error bars in the figures represent standard error of the mean. Single-channel activity was recorded on devitellinized oocytes under the cell-attached mode of standard patch-clamp methods, as described previously (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E.

The pipette solution (96 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was similar to that in the bath (96 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). 100 μm gadolinium was also included in the pipette solution to suppress endogenous stretch-activated channels. Recordings were performed at a holding membrane potential of −80 mV. For confocal fluorescence microscopy, Xenopus oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature overnight. Fixed oocytes were embedded in 3% agarose; 50-μm sections were cut, mounted, and viewed under a confocal microscope (Leica TCS 4D). To compare relative surface expression of each channel, images of all sections were recorded using equal parameters such as laser intensity, pinhole, and offset. Under our conditions, oocytes injected with cRNA for the wild-type GIRK1 or GIRK4 expressed basal and ACh-sensitive currents below 1 μA at −80 mV which were somewhat larger than currents recorded from control oocytes (Fig. 1). As expected (4Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), coexpression of the two wild-type subunits gave rise to robust inwardly rectifying currents, much larger than the sum of those obtained from expression of individual subunits, consistent with the idea of formation of heteromeric channels having larger activity than homomeric channels. Using the same quantity of cRNA (2 ng), the single-point mutants GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T) produced currents of a magnitude comparable to that of the wild-type heteromer (Fig. 1 B). Barring any participation from an endogenous protein (see below), these mutants would form competent homomeric channels able to couple to muscarinic receptors. The properties of the active mutant channels were compared with those of the GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromer because it is difficult to compare them with their wild-type parents, which carried small currents and, in the case of GIRK1, may be tainted by interaction with the oocyte endogenous GIRK5 protein (9Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Current-voltage relationships were examined by measuring the currents elicited by ACh over a wide voltage range (Fig. 1 C). GIRK4(S143T) showed weaker rectification than GIRK1(F137S) which, like GIRK1-GIRK4, did not conduct any detectable outward currents under our conditions. This is shown here for receptor-induced currents in the absence of coexpressed G-protein subunits. Agonist-independent currents produced by coexpression of G-protein subunits had similar current-voltage relations (data not shown), suggesting that the regions involved in rectification are insensitive to any agonist-dependent conformational movement. There is now ample evidence (15Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 16Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) showing that rectification of inward rectifier K+ channels arises from internal block of the pore by magnesium and polyamine ions and that this block depends on the charges of two amino acids located in the M2 transmembrane segment and the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic end of the channel. These residues are Asp172 and Glu224 in the strong rectifier IRK1 (20Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The matching residues in GIRK1 are Asp173 and Ser225 and, in GIRK4, Asn179 and Glu231, in both cases a negative and a neutral residue. One would therefore expect the homomeric GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T) to have a reduced affinity for internal cations. Given the high concentrations of polyamines in Xenopus oocytes (15Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 16Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), this reduction would have to be significant to translate into detectable outward currents under two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings. Our observation that GIRK4(S143T) conducts small outward currents in oocytes, whereas GIRK1(F137S) and the heteromer GIRK1-GIRK4 do not, suggests that, first, the presence of a negative charge at positions 173/179 may be a stronger determinant of rectification than that at positions 225/231, and second, the strong rectification phenotype of GIRK1 may be dominant in the wild-type heteromer. Kofuji et al. (21Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) identified residue Phe137 of GIRK1 as an important determinant of activation kinetics but did not report current enhancement with expression of the GIRK1(F137S) mutant. In our hands, both mutants (GIRK1(F137S) and GIRK4(S143T)) produced large currents that reached a stationary level within milliseconds in response to steps from 0 to −80 mV (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with Kofuji and colleagues, these responses appeared faster than that of the GIRK1-GIRK4 currents that do not reach a steady-state level within the 300-ms step. The significance of these kinetic differences is unclear since the mechanisms governing activation kinetics in these channels remain unknown. Xenopus oocytes harbor an endogenous subunit, GIRK5, which can associate with GIRK1 producing the currents observed in oocytes injected with GIRK1 cRNA alone (9Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Could the observed activity of the GIRK P-region mutants arise from association with GIRK5? Let us consider GIRK4(S143T) first. Fig.2 compares single-channel activity of GIRK4, GIRK1-GIRK4, and GIRK4(S143T) expressed in Xenopusoocytes with their corresponding amplitude histograms. GIRK4 yielded low levels of inwardly rectifying K+ currents with poorly resolved, short lived unitary events (γ = 15–30 pS; τ = 0.31 ± 0.02 ms, n = 7). Co-expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 gave severalfold enhanced levels of activity with longer lived, well resolved single-channel characteristics (γ = 34.6 ± 0.8 pS,n = 10; τ = 2.6 ± 0.3 ms, n = 12). Expression of GIRK1(S143T) alone also resulted in enhanced levels of activity with distinct single-channel characteristics (γ = 27.3 ± 0.8 pS, n = 4; τ = 2.1 ± 0.4 ms,n = 5). It is highly unlikely that the enhanced activity and the unique single-channel characteristics of GIRK4(S143T) were the result of its association with the endogenous oocyte GIRK5 (or XIR) subunit. On one hand, increasing amounts of GIRK4(S143T) over relatively constant endogenous GIRK5 levels gave rise to increasing current levels with equivalent single-channel properties (data not shown). On the other hand, coexpression of GIRK4(S143T) with GIRK4, which may be functionally analogous to GIRK5 in its ability to produce enhanced currents in association with GIRK1 (9Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), did not potentiate its activity (data not shown). Moreover, stable expression of GIRK4(S143T) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not seem to express endogenous GIRK channels, yielded high levels of inwardly rectifying currents with distinct single-channel properties from similarly stably transfected cells with GIRK4 (data not shown). The unitary characteristics of the GIRK4(S143T) channel were not as long lived as those obtained from Xenopus oocytes and thus were difficult to characterize. GIRK1(F137S), on the other hand, has been shown to associate with GIRK4 to form high activity channels (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If the GIRK1(F137S) activity were caused by its association with the endogenous oocyte GIRK5 subunit and if subunits associated more or less randomly in all possible combinations, one would expect less current when there is an excess of exogenous GIRK1(F137S) over a relatively constant background of endogenous GIRK5. As shown by Fig.3 A, this is not the case. As more GIRK1(F137S) RNA is used, more current is measured. The relation appears linear at high doses of RNA and less so at the lowest doses used, perhaps because of association with GIRK5. In contrast, currents seemed to decrease with an increasing amount of GIRK1 cRNA. Similar results were obtained in three other batches of oocytes (3–15 oocytes tested for each RNA species injected/given batch). Moreover, similar results were obtained when various concentrations of RNA (but not the entire range) from both GIRK1 and GIRK1(F137S) were tested in the same oocyte batch. As a more direct test of whether GIRK1(F137S) activity reflected its association with oocyte endogenous GIRK5 subunits, we compared single-channel activities from oocytes injected with GIRK1(F137S) mutants alone or together with exogenous GIRK5. Fig. 3 Bshows, as we have reported previously (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), expression of GIRK1(F137S) alone resulted in unique single-channel conductance (γ = 15.4 ± 0.9 pS, n = 6) with complex kinetics. In contrast, coinjection of GIRK1(F137S) with GIRK5 showed an additional distinct channel conductance (γ = 39.3 ± 0.92 pS, n = 9), also with complex kinetics (Fig. 3 C). Similar experiments of coinjection of GIRK1(F137S) with GIRK4 resulted also in channel activity displaying a distinct conductance (γ = 37.9 ± 0.94, n = 15), in addition to that seen in oocytes injected with GIRK1(F137S) alone. These results provided direct evidence that expression of GIRK1(F137S) alone results in channel activity with unitary characteristics distinct from those resulting from association of GIRK1(F137S) with GIRK5 (or GIRK4). Thus, it is unlikely that the GIRK1(F137S) activity results from heteromerization with endogenous GIRK5. Recently, it has been appreciated that GIRK1 subunits are not targeted efficiently to the cell surface, unlike GIRK4, which is abundantly localized to the plasma membrane (22Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Chan K.W. Sui J.-L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Sui J.-L. Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Coexpression of GIRK4 with GIRK1 appears to correct the targeting defect of GIRK1. Do point mutants at the 137/143 position of GIRK1 and GIRK4, respectively, exhibit enhanced activity by altering the subcellular localization of the channel subunits? To answer this question, we fused the GFP (green fluorescent protein) to the COOH-terminal ends of both wild-type channels and their corresponding point mutants. Uninjected oocytes gave very weak fluorescence background (Fig.4). Cell membranes of oocytes injected with GIRK1-GFP RNA showed strong cytoplasmic fluorescence and a weak signal to the cell surface. The weak membrane localization of GIRK1-GFP may mean that some GIRK1-GFP is targeted to the membrane upon association with endogenous GIRK5. However, it is also possible that some GIRK1 is targeted to the cell surface, independently of other factors, albeit quite inefficiently. Expression of GIRK1(F137S)-GFP did not result in an increased cell surface signal. GIRK4-GFP gave a strong signal at the plasma membrane, as reported previously (23Chan K.W. Sui J.-L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GIRK4(S143F) point mutant that was shown previously to be functionally silent and unable to cause current enhancement upon association with GIRK1 (10Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) exhibited a similar fluorescence signal at the cell surface. These results suggest that point mutations at this critical P region position alter the functional state of the channel rather than its subcellular localization. The regulation of the mutant homomers was compared with wild-type heteromers by studying their response to muscarinic stimulation in different conditions expected to perturb the receptor-G-protein signaling cascade. These conditions were: 1) control, where oocytes were injected with the m2 receptor cRNA in addition to the desired channel protein cRNA(s); control oocytes were coinjected with 2) Gαi2, the α subunit cRNA of the G-protein Gi2; 3) Gβ2γ2, the G-protein β2γ2 subunits; 4) Gαi2(Q205L), a form of Gαi2 rendered constitutively active by the Q205L mutation, which depresses its GTPase activity; and 5) PTX-S1, the active protomer of pertussis toxin, which uncouples G-proteins and muscarinic receptor (25Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar). In different ways, these conditions had drastic effects on the basal and receptor-stimulated activity of the wild-type GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromer (Figs. 5 A and 6 A).Figure 6Average amplitude of basal activity and ACh responses of wild-type heteromeric and mutant homomeric channels in the presence of different G-protein subunits. For every batch of oocytes, basal and ACh-induced currents were obtained from a number of experiments as in Fig. 4. To reduce errors arising from batch-to-batch variability in level of expression, these values were normalized to the total current obtained in the presence of ACh under control conditions (the amplitude of total ACh current was on average 12.4, 12.0, and 4.2 μA for GIRK1-GIRK4, GIRK4(S143T), and GIRK1(F137S), respectively). The average of these normalized currents is shown here.Numbers indicate the numbers of batches tested in each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Compared with control, Gαi2 nearly abolished basal activity while enhancing ACh responses 2-fold. Gβ2coexpressed with Gγ2 raised agonist-independent channel activity severalfold (as was first reported for KAch with purified Gβ2 complexed with Gγ5 or Gγ7; see Ref. 26Wickman K.D. Iniquez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), but the magnitude of the ACh-induced current was only slightly less than in control conditions. Gαi2(Q205L) reduced both basal and ACh-induced activity to 50 and 40% of their control values. Injection of the PTX-S1 cRNA encoding the active protomer of PTX almost completely abolished activation by ACh but only partially inhibited basal activity, in agreement with our previous data using incubation of oocytes with purified PTX proteins (4Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were performed with the GIRK4(S143T) and GIRK1(F137S) channels as an assay to bring forth functional differences and highlight the relative contribution of each GIRK subunit to those interactions. Experimental data are illustrated in Fig. 5, B and C, and results are summarized in Fig. 6,B and C. At the limited resolution afforded by the technique of bath superfusion for agonist application, there were no striking differences in activation and deactivation kinetics between wild-type and each of the mutant channels (Fig. 5). In control or with Gαi2 and Gβ2γ2, ACh activation of each channel was fast, and deactivation appeared biphasic with a fast initial phase followed by a slow return to control levels. In our hands, ACh-activated currents remained steady for several minutes with no apparent desensitization. When currents were large enough to judge, both activation and deactivation kinetics of wild-type and mutant channels were considerably slower in the presence of PTX-S1 and Gαi2(Q205L). In the latter condition, this could reflect the lower turnover rate of Gαi2(Q205L) from the activated, GTP-bound state to the inactive, receptor-activable, GDP-bound state. An additional feature of the records of Fig. 5 is the rundown of currents observed in control conditions during the first few minutes of recording. Rundown was not caused by KCl loading of the oocytes via the recording electrode as it was not accompanied by a shift in the K+ reversal potential. This phenomenon, which we did not investigate further, was seen with all three channels (some oocytes did not show it; e.g. control oocyte of Fig. 5 B). In terms of amplitude, as shown in Fig. 6, coexpressed G-protein subunits and PTX-S1 had comparable effects on basal and agonist-induced currents recorded from oocytes expressing either GIRK1-GIRK4, GIRK4(S143T), or GIRK1(F137S). Yet, some differences exist. Fig. 6reveals that exogenous Gβ2γ2 enhanced agonist-independent activity of GIRK4(S143T) 11-fold but only 4-fold for GIRK1(F137S). Conversely, with Gβ2γ2, GIRK1(F137S) current was increased 230% by ACh, whereas this figure was about 50% for GIRK4(S143T), suggesting that GIRK1(F137S) may be more sensitive to receptor-released Gβγ and less sensitive to exogenous Gβγ than GIRK4(S143T). This could mean that GIRK1(F137S) is able to couple more intimately to receptors and might be more insulated from exogenous effectors. Still, the data do not demonstrate fundamental mechanistic differences in the behaviors of the GIRK1 and GIRK4 mutants. Let us consider, as a basis for discussion, that all G-protein effects are mediated by changes in the concentration of Gβγ subunits. According to this hypothesis, basal activity would arise from a background of free Gβγ dimers, and receptor-induced activation would result from the recruitment of those Gβγ subunits inactivated at rest because they are bound within the GαGDPβγ complex. In support of this hypothesis, exogenous Gβ2γ2 strongly increased basal activity, PTX-S1 (which antagonizes interactions between receptor and Gαβγ) logically suppressed almost all receptor-mediated activation, and exogenous Gαi2 (which, in its GDP-bound form, will tend to associate with endogenous Gβγ dimers and thus drive the equilibrium toward less free Gβγ and more GαGDPβγ available for receptor activation) did lower basal and raise receptor-induced activity. A reduction in basal activity by coexpressed Gαi2 was also reported by Reuveny et al. (27Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguezlluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), who, however, did not test for ACh responses under these conditions. In contrast, in similar experiments but with GIRK1 alone and smaller currents, Lim et al. (28Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) detected no effect of overexpressed Gαi2 on basal or muscarinic receptor-dependent current. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. A partial inhibitory action of PTX-S1 on basal activity (4, this study), at first puzzling, would also fit the “Gβγ only” paradigm. PTX is known to block G-protein-receptor coupling and therefore G-protein subunit activation by ADP-ribosylation of the Gα subunit. Because its substrate is the heterotrimeric Gαβγ protein (29Neer E.J. Lock J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PTX will tend to trap Gβγ dimers within the nonactive Gαβγ complex. Thus PTX will not only affect the amount of Gβγ released upon receptor stimulation but also the basal concentration of free Gβγ. In our case, the suppression of receptor responses suggests that almost all PTX-sensitive α subunits were inactivated by PTX-S1. The concomitant reduction in available Gβγ would be partial, proportional to the fraction of G-proteins that are PTX-sensitive, and could thus explain the observed incomplete inhibition of basal activity. The evidence is therefore strong in favor of diffusible Gβγ being the primary channel regulator. However, some observations suggest that Gβγ may not be the only regulator. The mutation Q205L in Gαi2 is cognate to the mutation Q227L in Gαs which drastically reduces its GTPase rate without affecting GDP dissociation and, as a consequence, changes the fractional occupancy by GTP from about 5 to 80% (30Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of Gαi2(Q205L) cRNA should therefore produce a large increase in GTP-bound Gαi2 and a moderate, but still significant, increase in GDP-bound Gαi2. Because the mutation does not appear to influence the ability of the protein to interact with Gβγ and receptor (30Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutant, like wild-type, Gαi2 will be able to sequester Gβγ but to a lesser extent and should therefore have similar, if smaller, effects on basal and receptor-dependent activity. Gαi2(Q205L) did reduce basal activity as expected; but unlike Gαi2, it did not potentiate receptor-dependent activation and instead reduced it to below control levels. In contrast, equivalent experiments by Lim et al. (28Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with Gαs(Q227L) and β2-adrenergic receptors showed an increase in receptor-dependent activity but no effect on basal activity. These results do not readily point to a precise mechanism, although they suggest that specific Gα subunits could have different modulatory roles, unrelated to their ability to interact with Gβγ. Indeed certain G-protein αGTP subunits can antagonize channel activation by Gβγ directly (31Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Vorobiov D. Gilman A.G. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dascal N. Nature. 1996; 380: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas GαGDP subunits have been shown to bind to GIRK1 (32Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and are proposed to participate in the tight link between receptor and channel (33Slesinger P.A. Reuveny E. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) implied by the “membrane-delimited” pathway of the signaling cascade (34Soejima M. Noma A. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1984; 400: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting that sizable ACh responses could still be recorded from oocytes that had been injected with Gβ2γ2 cRNA. This suggests that either there was not enough Gβ2γ2 to saturate the channel or that receptor-induced Gβγ somehow had privileged access to the channel by virtue of, for instance, such a tight link between receptor and channel. The availability of functional mutants like GIRK4(S143T) and GIRK1(F137S) allows the study of properties of the individual subunits of heteromeric G-protein-gated channels and therefore of the contribution of each constituent subunit to the properties of the assembled channel. It also provides a simpler system for the study of channel regulation by G-proteins and receptors."

In contrast to the white adipocyte, the brown adipocyte is characterized by abundant mitochondria and high level expression of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes. Previous studies in transgenic mice have shown that the brown adipose-enriched expression of a key β-oxidation enzyme, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD), requires cis-acting elements located within the proximal promoter region of the MCAD gene. The levels of mRNA encoding MCAD and several other β-oxidation cycle enzymes were coordinately induced during differentiation of brown adipocytes in culture. Expression of transgenes comprised of MCAD gene promoter fragments fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporters in differentiating brown adipocytes revealed that a known nuclear receptor response element (NRRE-1) was required for the transcriptional induction of the MCAD gene during brown adipocyte differentiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and antibody recognition studies identified distinct brown adipocyte differentiation stage-specific, NRRE-1-protein complexes; the orphan nuclear receptors, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors I and II, were identified as major the NRRE-1 binding proteins in the pre-adipocyte, whereas the estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) bound NRRE-1 in extracts prepared from differentiated brown adipocytes. DNA binding studies performed with a series of NRRE-1 mutant probes indicated that ERRα was capable of binding two distinct sites within NRRE-1, each of which conform to the known ERRα monomeric binding consensus.

These results identify a new class of ERRα target genes and implicate ERRα and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor in the control of a pivotal metabolic pathway during brown adipocyte differentiation. In contrast to the white adipocyte, which functions mainly as a lipid storage cell, the brown adipocyte is a specialized thermogenic cell characterized by the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP). 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; MCAD, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; NRRE, nuclear receptor response element; ERRα, estrogen-related receptor α; BAT, brown adipose tissue; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; RXR, retinoid X receptor; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; MCAD, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; NRRE, nuclear receptor response element; ERRα, estrogen-related receptor α; BAT, brown adipose tissue; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; RXR, retinoid X receptor; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. UCP functions to disrupt the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane resulting in the “uncoupling” of oxidative phosphorylation and dissipation of energy as heat. Evidence is emerging that in addition to thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a pivotal role in mammalian whole body energy homeostasis and control of body weight (1Lowell B.S.-B.

Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Fatty acid β-oxidation provides the reducing equivalents for the mitochondrial uncoupling reaction. Thus, flux through the β-oxidation cycle is one important determinant of the rate of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in a given tissue. The majority of cellular fatty acid oxidation occurs in the mitochondria via a four-step cycle catalyzed by nuclear-encoded enzymes (5Beinert H. Boyer P.D. Lardy H.J. Myrbock K. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1963: 447-476Google Scholar). The expression of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes is very high in BAT and other tissues with high oxidative energy demands, such as heart. Accordingly, in contrast to the white adipocyte, the brown adipocyte has abundant mitochondria and a high capacity for fatty acid oxidation.Little is known about the brown adipocyte differentiation program or about the molecular regulatory factors that distinguish BAT from white adipose tissue. Recently, several factors involved in the general adipocyte program have been elucidated. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor superfamily, plays a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation. In the presence of activators of PPARγ, ectopic overexpression of this nuclear receptor has been shown to trigger the adipocyte program in a variety of cells, including non-adipocytes (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1995; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3092) Google Scholar, 7Hu E. Tonotonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors have also been shown to be critical components of the adipogenic differentiation program (8Wang N. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 9Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These factors, however, are common to the brown and white adipocyte and, thus, are unlikely to account for the biochemical and structural differences between the two cell types.To understand the molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway in BAT and as an initial step toward the elucidation of the factors involved in the brown adipocyte differentiation program, we have begun to dissect the regulatory pathway controlling expression of genes encoding mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes in BAT. To this end, we have focused on the nuclear gene encoding, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) (2,3-oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.99.3), a pivotal enzyme in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation cycle. These studies revealed that a complex nuclear receptor response element (NRRE-1), located in the proximal region of the human MCAD gene promoter, is required for high level transcription of a reporter gene in BAT and heart in adult transgenic mice (10Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.H. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Studies performedin vitro have shown that NRRE-1 is a pleiotropic element capable of conferring transcriptional activation via several nuclear receptors including the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and PPARα (11Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) or repression by the orphan receptors chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors I and II (COUP-TF I and II; Ref. 12Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the endogenous nuclear receptors that interact with NRRE-1 in the brown adipocyte in vivo have not been identified.In this report we demonstrate that NRRE-1 is necessary for the transcriptional induction of the MCAD gene during brown adipocyte differentiation in culture and describe the identification of two endogenous nuclear receptors that bind NRRE-1. NRRE-1 is shown to interact with COUP-TF I and II in the pre-brown adipocyte, whereas the orphan receptor estrogen-related receptor α or ERRα binds NRRE-1 in the differentiated brown adipocyte. Moreover, we show that the expression of ERRα during brown adipocyte differentiation and among mouse tissues parallels MCAD expression and the known tissue-specific differences in β-oxidation rates. These results implicate members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in a pivotal brown adipocyte metabolic gene regulatory program and identify a potential role for ERRα in the control of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.RESULTSThe Expression of Nuclear Genes Encoding Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation Enzymes Is Induced during Brown Adipocyte Differentiation—To examine the expression of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation during brown adipocyte differentiation, levels of mRNAs encoding enzymes catalyzing the first (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and third (3-hydroxy long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) steps of the mitochondrial β-oxidation cycle were delineated by RNA blot analysis. Expression of long chain fatty-acyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes the thioesterification of free fatty acids following cellular import was also analyzed. For these experiments, primary pre-brown adipocytes were cultured following isolation from the interscapular brown fat pad of 3–4-week-old C57Bl/6xSJL mice. The pre-adipocytes were grown to confluency and induced to differentiate using an established protocol described previously (see Ref. 18Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Gelly C. Fox N. Schrementi J. Raimbault S. Klaus S. Forest C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and “Materials and Methods”). Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent pre-adipocytes and differentiated brown adipocytes. The differentiated cells exhibited the morphological characteristics typical of brown adipocytes including the appearance of intracellular, multilocular lipid droplets and abundant, large mitochondria. The levels of mRNA encoding long chain fatty-acyl-CoA synthetase and the β-oxidation cycle enzymes was markedly higher in the differentiated brown adipocytes compared with that of the pre-adipocytes (Fig. 1). Expression of PPARγ, a known marker for adipocyte differentiation (19Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), was also induced confirming that the adipocyte program was activated in this cell culture system.Transcriptional Activation of the MCAD Gene during Brown Adipocyte Differentiation Requires a Nuclear Receptor Response ElementWe have shown previously that a 560-base pair human MCAD promoter fragment fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter (MCADCAT.371) is expressed at high levels in BAT in parallel with the endogenous MCAD gene in adult transgenic mice (10Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.H. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of a transgene (MCADCATΔNRRE-1) that differs only in a 54-base pair deletion of a region containing a known nuclear receptor response element (NRRE-1) is not BAT-enriched (10Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.H. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether the induction of MCAD gene expression during brown adipocyte differentiation occurs at the level of transcription and to define the role of NRRE-1 in this regulation, transgene expression was characterized during differentiation of pre-brown adipocytes isolated from MCADCAT.371 and MCADCATΔNRRE-1 mice. Transgene expression was determined by measurement of CAT activity in lysates prepared from the cultured cells at different time points following a switch to differentiation media (see “Materials and Methods”). Day 0 represents the point at which the pre-adipocytes reached confluency. By day 4 greater than 75% of the cells exhibited the mature brown adipocyte phenotype as judged by the morphological characteristics described under “Materials and Methods” and gene markers shown in Fig. 1. CAT activity in the MCADCAT.371 cells increased markedly (12–13 fold) upon differentiation (Fig.2). This dramatic induction of CAT activity corresponded with the appearance of immunodetectable endogenous MCAD protein (Fig. 2). In contrast, expression of the MCADCATΔNRRE-1 transgene, which lacks NRRE-1, was unchanged during differentiation of the cultured brown adipocytes (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the induction of MCAD gene expression during brown adipocyte differentiation occurs at the level of transcription and requires the nuclear receptor response element, NRRE-1.Figure 2Induction of MCADCAT.371 transgene expression during brown adipocyte differentiation. Primary brown adipocytes were isolated from mice transgenic for MCADCAT.371 or MCADCATΔNRRE-1, as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in the schematic at the bottom, NRRE-1 was deleted in the MCADCATΔNRRE-1 construct (the numbers are relative to the transcription start site = +1). The pre-brown adipocytes reached confluency on day 0. By day 4, greater than 75% of the cells were differentiated using the criteria described under “Materials and Methods” and by the gene markers shown in Fig. 1. CAT activity, normalized to levels at day 0, are shown for MCADCAT.371 and MCADCATΔNRRE-1. The values represent mean (± S.E.) CAT activity from pooled cells from at least three independent experiments. The inset contains a representative Western blot analysis (5 μg of total protein/lane) performed with an anti-MCAD antibody using the protein extract samples used to determine CAT activities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Brown Adipocyte Differentiation Stage-specific NRRE-1 Binding ActivitiesElectrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed to begin to characterize the transcription factors involved in the induction of MCAD gene transcription during brown adipocyte differentiation. For these experiments, an NRRE-1 probe was incubated with nuclear protein extracts isolated from pre- and post-brown adipocytes. As shown in Fig.3 A, distinct NRRE-1 binding patterns were obtained with the two types of nuclear extracts. Two complexes (pI and pII) of similar but distinct mobilities formed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from pre-brown adipocytes. When the EMSA were performed with extracts prepared from the differentiated brown adipocytes, neither complex pI or pII was observed; rather two new NRRE-1-protein complexes formed (dI and dII; Fig. 3 A). dI was a faint, low mobility complex, and complex dII was a prominent complex migrating slightly faster than pI and pII. We have shown previously that NRRE-1-protein complexes of identical mobilities to that of dI and dII also form with nuclear protein extracts prepared from adult mouse heart and the brown adipocyte cell line HIB-1B (Ref.10Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.H. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and data not shown). Competition experiments performed with a molar excess of specific (NRRE-1) or an unrelated, size-matched, double-stranded oligonucleotide confirmed that all four complexes represented specific NRRE-1/protein interactions (Fig. 3 B). These data identify brown adipocyte differentiation stage-specific NRRE-1 binding activities and suggest that distinct transcription factors interact with NRRE-1 during different stages of brown adipocyte differentiation.Figure 3NRRE-1 interacts with pre- and post-brown adipocyte nuclear proteins in a cell differentiation stage-specific pattern. A, the results of EMSA performed with an NRRE-1 probe and nuclear proteins isolated from pre- and post-brown adipocytes.

B, results of EMSA competition studies with the NRRE-1 probe and nuclear protein extracts prepared from pre- and post-differentiated brown adipocytes. A 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled, unrelated size-matched double-stranded oligonucleotide (NS) or 10-, 50-, or 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled NRRE-1 probe (ramp) were added to the incubation as denoted at the top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Orphan Nuclear Receptors, COUP-TF and ERRα, Bind NRRE-1 in a Brown Adipocyte Differentiation Stage-specific MannerAntibody recognition studies were performed to identify the proteins bound to NRRE-1 in the complexes shown Fig. 3. A panel of antibodies raised against various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were used in these studies. The initial studies focused on the protein-DNA complexes (pI and pII) formed with the pre-adipocyte nuclear protein extracts. Antibodies to RXRα, PPARα, PPARγ, thyroid receptor α, and the orphan receptor, ERRα, did not recognize proteins in complex pI or pII (Fig. 4 and data not shown). However, an anti-COUP-TF antibody that recognizes both COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II isoforms (MP33; Ref. 20Butler A.J. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4143-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) abolished the formation of complexes pI and pII (Fig. 4, lane 4). Addition of a COUP-TF II-specific antibody (MP31) prevented the formation of complex pI but not complex pII. Accordingly, complex pI and pII contain COUP-TF I and II or closely related proteins. These data are consistent with the results of our previous characterization of NRRE-1 demonstrating that COUP-TF I, overproduced in bacteria, binds NRRE-1 (12Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that overexpression of COUP-TF I in mammalian cell lines in culture represses transcription of an MCAD promoter-reporter construct via NRRE-1 (12Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4Identification of COUP-TF and ERRα in NRRE-1-brown adipocyte nuclear protein complexes by antibody recognition experiments. The autoradiographs depicted above represent EMSA antibody recognition studies performed with an NRRE-1 probe and anti-ERRα or anti-COUP-TF (MP31 and MP33) antibodies (Ab). MP33 recognizes COUP-TF I and II, and MP31 is specific for COUP-TF II. Preimmune (PI) serum was used to serve as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The antibody EMSA studies were repeated with nuclear protein extracts prepared from differentiated brown adipocytes. Initial studies focused on the prominent NRRE-1-protein complex dII shown in Fig. 3. Previous EMSA and cell cotransfection studies have demonstrated that RXRα/PPARα heterodimers bind NRRE-1 to activate transcription from heterologous and homologous promoters (11Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These results together with the known role of PPARγ in the adipocyte differentiation program suggested that complex dII may contain PPAR/RXR heterodimers bound to NRRE-1. Surprisingly, however, complex dII was not recognized by anti-RXRα, anti-PPARα, or anti-PPARγ antibodies (data not shown). The anti-COUP antibodies, MP31 and MP33, also failed to influence the formation or mobility of complex dII (Fig. 4, lane 8). However, an antibody to the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα abolished the formation of complex dII (Fig. 4, lane 9). Taken together with the results shown above, these data strongly suggest that the known transcriptional repressors COUP-TF I and II bind NRRE-1 to silence MCAD gene expression in the pre-brown adipocyte but that during brown adipocyte differentiation the orphan receptor ERRα becomes the predominant NRRE-1 binding protein.Regarding the faint complex dI, none of the antibodies used above, including the anti-COUP-TF antibodies, affected its formation or mobility (data not shown). However, we have shown previously that NRRE-1-protein complexes with mobilities identical to that of dI formed with nuclear extracts prepared from adult mouse heart or HIB-1B cells were recognized by a separate anti-COUP-TF antiserum raised to COUP-TF I purified from HeLa cells (21Wang L. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This antibody, which also prevented the formation of complex dI (data not shown), has been shown to recognize at least two other higher molecular weight proteins in addition to COUP-TF I (21Wang L. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that complex dI does not contain COUP-TF I or COUP-TF II but may contain a structurally related protein.The MCAD ERRα Recognition Site Requires Two Receptor Binding Half-site Sequences Arranged as an Imperfect Everted RepeatTo confirm that ERRα binds NRRE-1, EMSA were performed with recombinant ERRα protein produced in an in vitro coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation reaction. NRRE-1 formed a single prominent complex with the recombinant ERRα but not with unprogrammed lysate (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and3). The mobility of the NRRE-1-recombinant ERRα complex was identical to that of the endogenous complex (complex dII) formed with post-BAT nuclear protein extract (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and3). Addition of anti-ERRα antibody prevented the formation of the recombinant ERRα·NRRE-1 complex demonstrating the presence of ERRα (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). These results confirm that NRRE-1 contains an ERRα recognition site. Moreover, the similar mobilities of complex dII and the NRRE-1-recombinant ERRα complex suggests that complex dII contains only ERRα.NRRE-1 is a novel, pleiotropic element composed of three potential nuclear receptor binding half-site sequences (shown in Fig.5 B). We have shown previously (12Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the unique arrangement of the hexameric receptor binding half-sites within NRRE-1 dictates three potential receptor dimer binding elements; an everted imperfect repeat separated by 13 bases (ER-13, sites 1 and 3), an ER-8 (sites 1 and 2), and an imperfect direct repeat (DR-O, sites 2 and 3). To define the ERRα binding site requirements within NRRE-1, EMSA competition studies were performed. Recombinant ERRα protein was used for these studies. As expected, a molar excess of unlabeled NRRE-1 prevented formation of the NRRE-1·ERRα complex, whereas an identical molar excess of a nonspecific, size-matched probe had no effect on its formation (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1–3). Previous studies by others (22Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ERRα binds with high affinity to the extended half-site sequence, 5′-TCAAGGTCA-3′, present in the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) consensus binding site. A probe containing the SF-1 site was also efficient at preventing the ERRα·NRRE-1 complex formation (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). To define the NRRE-1 binding sites necessary for ERRα binding, competition studies were performed with mutated NRRE-1 oligonucleotide fragments containing G to C substitutions at the invariant second position within each of the three potential receptor binding half-sites (sequences are shown in Fig. 5 B). Although the NRRE-1 site 2 mutant (M2) was capable of competing with NRRE-1, the site 1 (M1) and site 3 (M3) mutants did not prevent complex formation (Fig. 5 C, lanes 5–7). These results suggest that ERRα interacts with sites 1 and 3 within NRRE-1. Finally, to determine whether NRRE-1 sites 1 and 3 were required for the interaction of NRRE-1 with endogenous ERRα, nuclear protein extracts prepared from differentiated brown adipocytes were incubated with radiolabeled NRRE-1, M1, or M3 probes. The ERRα·NRRE-1 complex did not form with the M1 probe and was markedly diminished with the M3 probe (Fig. 5 A, lanes 12–14). Taken together, these data indicate that ERRα binds NRRE-1 sites 1 and 3, possibly as a dimer. Of note, we have shown previously that recombinant COUP-TF I homodimers bind NRRE-1 at sites 1 and 3 (12Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that this complex co-migrates with complex pII (data not shown).Expression of ERRα Parallels Expression of the MCAD Gene during BAT Differentiation and among Murine TissuesThe results shown above implicate ERRα in the control of nuclear genes encoding MCAD and other mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes during brown adipocyte differentiation. To determine whether the nuclear expression of ERRα parallels its NRRE-1 binding activity and MCAD expression during differentiation of the brown adipocyte, Western blot studies were performed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from pre- and post-adipocytes. Steady-state nuclear levels of ERRα were markedly induced during the transition from pre- to post-brown adipocyte (Fig.6 A). The induction of ERRα expression during brown adipocyte differentiation paralleled MCAD protein levels (Fig. 6 A), the transcriptional activity of the MCADCAT.371 transgene (Fig. 2), and NRRE-1 binding activities (Fig.3). In contrast, COUP-TF was expressed in a reciprocal pattern during adipocyte differentiation as predicted by NRRE-1 binding activity (Fig.3) and the known role of COUP-TF as a transcriptional repressor of the MCAD gene (12Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6Expression patterns of ERRα and COUP-TF compared with MCAD.

https://openalex.org/W2029383449,"BIN1 is a putative tumor suppressor that was identified through its interaction with the MYC oncoprotein. To begin to identify elements of BIN1 whose alteration may contribute to malignancy, we cloned and characterized the human BIN1 gene and promoter. Nineteen exons were identified in a region of >54 kilobases, six of which were alternately spliced in a cell type-specific manner. One alternately spliced exon encodes part of the MYC-binding domain, suggesting that splicing controls the MYC-binding capacity of BIN1 polypeptides. Four other alternately spliced exons encode amphiphysin-related sequences that were included in brain-specific BIN1 species, also termed amphiphysin isoforms or amphiphysin II. The 5′-flanking region of BIN1 is GC-rich and lacks a TATA box but directs transcriptional initiation from a single site. A ∼0.9-kilobase fragment from this region was sufficient for basal transcription and transactivation by MyoD, which may account for the high levels of BIN1 observed in skeletal muscle. This study lays the foundation for genetic and epigenetic investigations into the role of BIN1 in normal and neoplastic cell regulation.

The identification of tumor suppressor genes in solid tumors is a major goal of cancer research. BIN1 is a novel MYC-interacting protein that has features of a tumor suppressor in certain carcinomas including those of the breast, liver, cervix, and prostate (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). BIN1 is related to amphiphysin, a neuronal protein that is a paraneoplastic autoimmune antigen associated with breast and lung cancer (2David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Dropcho E.J. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and to RVS167, a negative regulator of the cell cycle in yeast (4Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although widely expressed in normal cells, BIN1 is functionally deleted in ∼50% of carcinoma cell lines and primary breast carcinomas examined (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The human BIN1 gene is located at chromosome 2q14 (5Negorev D. Reithman H. Wechsler-Reya R. Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Simon D. Genomics. 1996; 33: 329-331Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), within a mid-2q region that is deleted in ∼42% of metastatic prostate cancers (6Cher M.L. Bova G.S.

We have hypothesized that BIN1 is a tumor suppressor whose loss contributes to growth deregulation in cancer cells. As a prerequisite to examining this hypothesis, the exon organization, exon-intron boundaries, splice patterns, and promoter of the human BIN1 gene were defined. Genomic clones were isolated from a WI-38 diploid fibroblast λFIX phage library (a gift of L. Showe) using a BIN1 cDNA probe (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat.

The six phage inserts designated in Fig. 1 were subcloned in pBS+ (Stratagene) and analyzed by extensive restriction mapping and Southern analysis with BIN1 cDNA probes (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K.

Large scale sequencing of genomic DNA that hybridized to BIN1 cDNA probes, comprising ∼20 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; bp, base pair(s). of the ≥54-kb locus, was determined using an automated DNA sequencer. The sequence data were assembled manually with assistance from MacVector and AssembLIGN software. Exons and other gene features were identified and/or confirmed by visual inspection or computer-aided comparison of BIN1 cDNAs and expressed sequence tags in GenBankTM, using SIM and ClustalW (pairwise or multiple sequence alignments), TBLASTN (DNA data base comparisons), MatInspector, and TESS (promoter binding site identification), accessed through the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Center Home Page on the World Wide Web. The GenBankTM accession number for BIN1 cDNA is U68485 and for BIN1 genomic sequences are U83999–U84004. The substrate for RT-PCR was 2 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA isolated as described (7Prendergast G.C. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Murine RNAs were a gift of L. Benjamin (Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem). Human RNAs were isolated from WI-38 fibroblasts, HeLa cells, or Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells that were cultured as described (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). RNA and 50 pmol of oligo(dT) (Pharmacia) were added to diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water (final volume 11 μl), heated 4 min at 70 °C, and quenched on ice. RT reactions (20 μl) were prepared by mixing 4 μl of 5 × buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), 1 μl of 25 mm dNTPs, 2 μl 0.1 m dithiothreotol, 1 unit of RNase inhibitor, and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Life Technologies, Inc.). This mixture was incubated 1 h at 42 °C, heated to 94 °C for 5 min, and diluted to 100 μl with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. 10 μl of the diluted reaction was used as substrate for 30 cycles of PCR (50 μl) (45 s 94 °C, 45 s 55 °C, 1 min 72 °C) with 0.5 unit of Taqpolymerase (Pharmacia) in 1 × buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2. Separate PCR reactions were performed to generate 5′ (N terminus; exons 3–7), midsection (exons 6–11), and 3′ (C terminus; exons 11–16) segments of the BIN1 coding region. For amplifying products from human BIN1 message (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the 5′- and 3′-primer pairs used were as follows: For the 5′ (N terminus) product, AAGGATCTCCGGACCTACCT (cT7/ext) and CACATTCATCTCCTCAAACACC (ptx7α); for the midsection product, TGAAGCCAAAATTGCCAAGGC (dT3/ext) and TGGCTGAGATGGGGACTTG (5′-ATG99); and for the 3′ (C terminus) product, GGAGAATTCGCGATGCCTGCAAAAGGGAACAAGAGC (99Fsp) and GGACTCGAGTCATGGGACCCTCTCAGTGAAGTTC (99SH3anti). For amplifying products from murine BIN1 message (8Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the 5′- and 3′-primer pairs used were as follows: mNTsen1 (5′-CAGTGCGTCCAGAATTTC) and mNTanti1 (5′-AACACCTTCTGGGCTTTG); mMIDsen1 (5′-AAGCCCAGAAGGTGTTCGAG) and m5′-ATG99 (5′-TGGCTGAGATGGGGACTT); and mCTsen1 (5′-CTGAGATCAGAGTGAACCATG) and mCTanti1 (5′-CACCCGCTCTGTAAAATTC). Products were fractionated on agarose gels, blotted and hybridized, or isolated and subcloned for DNA sequencing. 3 pmol of the oligonucleotide primer ACAGCGGAGCCAACTGAC (PEprimer#2) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP was annealed to 10 μg of WI-38 total cytoplasmic RNA for 12 h at 58 °C in hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mNaCl, 80% formamide). The annealed RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 20 μl of RT reaction buffer (see above) plus 50 μg/ml actinomycin D (BMB). The reaction mixture was incubated 1 h at 42 °C and stopped by the addition of sequencing gel loading buffer. A standard [α-35S]dATP DNA sequencing reaction was performed with the same primer using clone p31.2 as the template (see Fig. 1). The primer extension and sequencing products were cofractionated on a 12% DNA sequencing gel and autoradiographed for 15 min (extension reaction) or overnight (sequencing reaction). pGL-Bgl was generated by subcloning a 886 BglII fragment including proximal 5′-flanking sequences from p31.2 into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-basic (Promega). The hosts for transfection, C2C12 cells or 10T1/2 cells (a gift of D. Goldhamer), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells (4 × 104/60-mm dish) were transfected (9Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of pGL-Bgl or pGL2-basic, 4.5 μg of pSK+ (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector. For MyoD activation, a murine MyoD expression construct under control of the β-actin promoter (a gift of D. Goldhamer, University of Pennsylvania) was substituted for pSK+. Cells were harvested and processed for luciferase activity two days posttransfection using a commercial kit (Promega). A physical map of the human BIN1 gene was constructed from a set of phage clones isolated from a WI-38 diploid fibroblast genomic library (see Fig. 1). To identify exons and exon-intron boundaries, the DNA sequence determined from six genomic segments (GenBankTM accession numbers U83999–U84004) was compared with BIN1 cDNA sequences from several sources, including the original BIN1 clone, RT-PCR products from human RNAs, and the DNA data base (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat.

Commun. 1997; 236: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). With the exception of exon 1, all exons were located within a ∼38-kb contig. An additional noncontiguous clone contained exon 1 and 5′-flanking sequences, with the latter extending ∼3 kb upstream of the RNA cap site (see below). Given the structure of this clone, the size of intron 1 would be inferred to be at least 17 kb. Thus, we concluded that the human BIN1 gene spanned a minimum of 54 kb. The DNA sequence of each exon and proximal introns are shown in Fig.2. Based on the characteristics they encode, the BIN1 exons can be grouped into four sets, termed the BAR (BIN1/amphiphysin/RVS167-related), unique, brain-specific, and protein-protein interaction sets, respectively. Exons 1–8 encode the BAR domain of BIN1 (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this group, exon 1 included a different 5′-UTR and N-terminal coding sequence (MAEMGSKG) compared with the original BIN1 cDNA (MLWNV) (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The genomic sequence was judged to accurately represent the 5′-end of the BIN1 mRNA, because (i) expressed sequence tag and cDNA sequences identical to the genomic but not the 5′ BIN1 cDNA sequence were present in the DNA data base; (ii) cDNAs whose structure matched the original cDNA clone could not be identified by RT-PCR in any tissue; and (iii) the 5′-end of the cDNA was found to contain an inversion of 64 bp derived from the middle of the cDNA (previously missed because the inversion fortuitously contained a translation initiation site). Exons 9–11 encode a unique region of BIN1 that is functionally undefined and unrelated to amphiphysin and RVS167. The unique-1 (U1) and unique-2 (U2) regions are encoded by exons 9 and 11, respectively, and separated by a nuclear localization-like motif encoded by exon 10. Exons 12A–12D encode amphiphysin-related sequences that were not found in the original BIN1 cDNA (see Fig. 2 B). These exons are spliced into larger isoforms of BIN1 message detected in brain and muscle, alternately termed amphiphysin isoforms or amphiphysin II (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar,10Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.-C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J.

Commun. 1997; 236: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (see below). Exons 13–16 encode the C-terminal region of BIN1 implicated in protein-protein interactions. Exons 13–14 and 15–16 encode the Myc-binding domain and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, respectively, the latter of which is also a feature of amphiphysin and RVS167 (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To examine patterns of BIN1 splicing, RT-PCR was performed using RNAs isolated from three human cell lines, WI-38 diploid fibroblasts, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma (a muscle tumor line). The observations in human cells were extended using RNAs isolated from a set of normal murine tissues. All cells and tissues examined were previously shown to express BIN1 RNA by Northern analysis (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers derived from BIN1 sequences were used for RT-PCR of fragments spanning exons 3–7 (5′-end), 7–11 (midsection), and 11–16 (3′-end). For analysis of murine RNAs, oligonucleotide primer sequences were derived from the sequence of SH3P9, a murine BIN1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U60884; and Ref. 8Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Products from these reactions were fractionated on agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized to a BIN1 cDNA probe or subcloned and sequenced. Amplification of the 5′-end of BIN1 yielded a single product in all cell lines examined, indicating that this region was not subjected to alternate splicing in these cells. In contrast, amplification of the central and 3′ regions revealed several alternate splicing events. In the central region, two products of similar abundance were observed in WI-38 fibroblasts that differed in the presence or absence of exon 10 sequences. Messages including exon 10 sequences were not detected in BIN1 messages from any of the other tissues or cell lines examined, suggesting that this splice form was relatively uncommon and thus regulated. Amplification of the 3′-end revealed additional splice forms. Two products of similar abundance were detected in all cell types that differed in the presence of exon 13 sequences, which encodes part of the Myc-binding domain (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). 2K.Elliott, D. Sakamuro, W. Du, and G. C. Prendergast, submitted for publication. The coordinate appearance of each species suggested that exon 13 was alternately spliced but in an unregulated fashion. Additional species that included sequences derived from exons 12A–12D were detected in murine brain (E9.5 RNA also included one of these species). Interestingly, whereas exon 12A–12D sequences were not detected in any other normal murine tissues, exon 12A was included in RNA species in each of the established human cell lines. It was unclear whether the difference in exon 12A splicing reflected tissue-specific regulation, cell line establishment, or neoplastic transformation. Nevertheless, taken together with the brain-specific events, this observation suggested that splicing of exons 12A–12D was uncommon in most tissues and thus may be regulated. To determine which combinations of exons appeared in various BIN1 RNAs, we performed RT-PCR using exon 9 and 16 primers (which span all the alternately spliced exons) and subcloned and sequenced the products. We confined this analysis to RNAs isolated from WI-38 and HeLa cells, where exons 10, 12A, and 13 are alternately spliced, to focus on the events in proliferating rather than postmitotic cells. The results, which are summarized in Fig.3 B, showed that seven of the eight RNA species theoretically possible in these cell lines were in fact generated (the one that was not detected was the +12A−13 species). We concluded that exons 10, 12A–12D, and 13 of BIN1 were alternately spliced and that splicing of exons 10 and 12A–12D splicing was likely to be regulated. Definition of the BIN1 promoter was of interest for two reasons. First, previous work suggested that epigenetic mechanisms might underlie the loss of BIN1 expression in breast tumor cells (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, characterization of the BIN1 promoter would permit an examination of tumor DNA for alterations in DNA methylation or transcription factor interactions that might account for loss of expression. Second, we have observed previously that BIN1 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and murine C2C12 myoblasts (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 14Wechsler-Reya R. Elliott K. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we predicted that the BIN1 promoter might be activated by MyoD, a master regulator of muscle cell differentiation (15Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P.-F. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 242: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To identify the BIN1 promoter, it was first necessary to pinpoint the site(s) of transcription initiation. To this end, primer extension analysis was performed on RNA from WI-38 diploid fibroblasts. By comparing the genomic sequence to that of a murine BIN1 cDNA (8Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which has a long 5′-UTR, a primer that was likely to hybridize within 100 nucleotides of the RNA cap site was chosen. RT-mediated primer extension yielded a 33-nucleotide product (see Fig.4). Together with the DNA sequence of the 5′-flanking region generated by this primer, we were able to map the 5′-end of BIN1 RNA in WI-38 cells to the guanine residue designated +1 in Fig. 5.Figure 5Structure of the 5′-flanking region. The DNA sequence of the 886-bp BglII-BglII promoter fragment noted in Fig. 1 is presented. The RNA cap site is indicated by +1; exon 1 is shown in uppercase letters. Single underlining indicates the antisense sequence of the oligonucleotide used for the primer extension experiment. Double underlining indicates a potential binding site for TATA-binding protein (TBP) at −79 identified by MatInspector (13Quandt K. Frech K. Haras H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar), and a single E box consensus binding site for MyoD at −237 identified by visual inspection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of the genomic sequence upstream of the RNA cap site indicated that the 5′-flanking region was GC-rich and lacked a TATA box but contained a consensus binding site for TATA-binding protein at −79 (see Fig. 5). Supporting the possibility that MyoD may regulate BIN1, a consensus recognition site for MyoD was located at −238. Consistent with a possible promoter function, computer search algorithms identified consensus sites for several other transcription factors in this region (data not shown). Finally, among the 694 nucleotides upstream of exon 1, ∼18% were composed of CpG dinucleotides, indicating the presence of a CpG island typical of many TATA-less promoters. These observations suggested that the 5′-end of theBIN1 gene that we cloned might contain a functional promoter. The transcriptional potential of the 5′-flanking region was tested in a transient transfection assay. An 886-bp BglII restriction fragment was cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-basic, allowing transcription to be initiated at the BIN1 cap site. The resulting plasmid, pGL2-Bgl, was transfected into C2C12 myoblasts, which express high levels of endogenous BIN1 RNA (14Wechsler-Reya R. Elliott K. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 C, within two days after transfection, pGL2-Bgl exhibited ∼100-fold greater activity that the control plasmid pGL2-basic (see Fig. 6 A). To determine whether pGL2-Bgl included sequences that were sufficient for regulated expression, the plasmid was introduced with or without a MyoD expression vector into 10T1/2 fibroblasts (which do not express MyoD but differentiate into myoblasts in response to it). As a positive control for MyoD responsiveness, a second set of transfections used a luciferase reporter driven by a mutated ornithine carboxylase promoter (ODCΔSmut-luc) containing a MyoD E box response element. 3J. Cleveland, unpublished results. We observed that the activity of both reporters was increased up to ∼7-fold of the basal level by MyoD cotransfection (see Fig. 6 B). The effect was dose-dependent, because higher ratios of MyoD:reporter plasmids increased reporter activity. We concluded that the 5′-flanking sequences of the BIN1 gene constituted a promoter sufficient for directing transcription in myoblasts. We have characterized the structure and some of the regulatory features of the human BIN1 gene. Nineteen exons were identified within a ≥54-kb region of DNA previously mapped to chromosome 2q14 (5Negorev D. Reithman H. Wechsler-Reya R. Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Simon D. Genomics. 1996; 33: 329-331Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The primary BIN1 transcript was found to be extensively spliced, resulting in at least seven different species in proliferating cells and an even larger number in postmitotic cells of the brain. Characterization of the BIN1 promoter defined a region sufficient to direct inducible transcription in muscle cells where BIN1 is highly expressed. Thus, BIN1 is subjected to tissue-specific regulation at the levels of transcription and splicing. Exons 10 and 13 were two of the three exons found to be alternately spliced in proliferating cells. Exon 10 splicing was relatively uncommon, because it appeared only in messages from WI-38 in addition to skeletal muscle (the source of the original BIN1 cDNA). Exon 10 encodes a basic amino acid-rich region that closely resembles a nuclear localization signal. However, this region may not act as an nuclear localization signal, because we have observed recently that its presence is neither necessary nor sufficient for nuclear localization (14Wechsler-Reya R. Elliott K. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wechsler-Reya R. Elliott K. Herlyn M. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3258-3263PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, exon 10 splicing probably has other implications. Exon 13 splicing was ubiquitous but apparently unregulated, because an approximately similar quantity of +13 and −13 RNA species were detected in all cells examined. Since this exon encodes a significant part of the Myc-binding domain, it is likely that its alternate splicing affects the MYC-interacting potential of BIN1. An interesting possibility implied by our results is that, taken together, there may be two classes of BIN1 polypeptides that exist in cells, one that can interact with MYC and one that cannot. Four exons identified in this study, 12A–12D, were not included in the original BIN1 cDNA but were detected by RT-PCR in a subset of messages in the brain. The existence of brain-specific exons was suggested previously by Northern analysis, which revealed a larger message(s) in the brain in addition to the ubiquitously expressed smaller species (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Our findings confirmed those of others who have recently identified exon 12A–12D sequences in brain and muscle cDNA species, alternately termed amphiphysin isoforms or amphiphysin-II (10Butler M.H.

Commun. 1997; 236: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another cDNA species identified by these workers imply the presence of an additional 93-bp brain-specific exon in intron 6 (which is unrelated to amphiphysin or RVS167); however for unknown reasons we were unable to confirm its presence in the expected location either by RT-PCR or direct DNA sequencing. Exons 12A–12D encode sequences related to amphiphysin, so their introduction would be expected to increase the amphiphysin-like character of BIN1. Alternate splicing of exon 12A–12D in a subset of brain messages may therefore provide a mechanism to augment or vary certain amphiphysin functions in neurons while retaining BIN1 functions in the same cell. Interestingly, we found that exon 12A was spliced into a subset of messages in the human cell lines WI-38, HeLa, and Rh-30, but not into messages in normal nonneuronal tissues. The significance of exon 12A splicing in these cells is unclear. However, since we did not detect the +12A−13 isoform in cells, an interesting possibility is that +12A and −13 isoforms are functionally redundant (that is, they each lack the ability to interact with and inhibit the oncogenic properties of MYC). If so, the appearance of +12 isoforms in WI-38 and HeLa cells may reflect an aberrant splicing event that relieves MYC inhibition by BIN1 (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) thereby promoting immortalization or establishment. In general, the extensive splicing we have documented in BIN1 opens the possibility that splice site mutations or altered splicing via epigenetic mechanisms may be germane to tumorigenesis. Two important goals of future work will be to (i) assess the activities of different splice forms of BIN1 for MYC interaction, cell localization, and inhibition of neoplastic cell growth, and (ii) determine whether there are altered splice patterns in tumor cells that could compromise the growth inhibitory activity of BIN1. The BIN1 promoter is characterized by a high CpG content but otherwise exhibits the features of a housekeeping promoter. We showed that the muscle determination factor MyoD can up-regulate the BIN1 promoter and identified an E box site that might mediate MyoD-induced activation. Transcriptional activation by MyoD and/or other helix-loop-helix proteins may contribute to the strong up-regulation of BIN1 levels in differentiated neurons and muscle cells (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 10Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.-C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because the BIN1 promoter is rich in CpG residues, it is highly susceptible to the alterations in CpG methylation status, which are common in cancer cells and form the basis for loss of some tumor suppressors such as p16INK4 in lung cancers (17Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms by which promoter activity might be altered in cancer cells include genetic mutations or epigenetic changes in the activity of transcriptional regulatory factors. The stage is now set to determine the basis for the frequent loss of BIN1 expression in certain solid tumors such as breast carcinoma (1Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We thank R. Buccafusca and X. Gong for technical assistance. For providing reagents, we are grateful to L.

https://openalex.org/W2030394100,"The antimicrobial activity of various naturally occurring microbicidal peptides was reported to result from their interaction with microbial membrane. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of the hemolytic peptide dermaseptin S4 (DS4) and the nonhemolytic peptide dermaseptin S3 (DS3) toward human erythrocytes infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both DS4 and DS3 inhibited the parasite's ability to incorporate [3H]hypoxanthine. However, while DS4 was toxic toward both the parasite and the host erythrocyte, DS3 was toxic only toward the intraerythrocytic parasite. To gain insight into the mechanism of this selective cytotoxicity, we labeled the peptides with fluorescent probes and investigated their organization in solution and in membranes. In Plasmodium-infected cells, rhodamine-labeled peptides interacted directly with the intracellular parasite, in contrast to noninfected cells, where the peptides remained bound to the erythrocyte plasma membrane. Binding experiments to phospholipid membranes revealed that DS3 and DS4 had similar binding characteristics. Membrane permeation studies indicated that the peptides were equally potent in permeating phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles, whereas DS4 was more permeative with phosphatidylcholine vesicles. In aqueous solutions, DS4 was found to be in a higher aggregation state. Nevertheless, both DS3 and DS4 spontaneously dissociated to monomers upon interaction with vesicles, albeit with different kinetics. In light of these results, we propose a mechanism by which dermaseptins permeate cells and affect intraerythrocytic parasites.

To gain insight into the mechanism of this selective cytotoxicity, we labeled the peptides with fluorescent probes and investigated their organization in solution and in membranes. In Plasmodium-infected cells, rhodamine-labeled peptides interacted directly with the intracellular parasite, in contrast to noninfected cells, where the peptides remained bound to the erythrocyte plasma membrane. Binding experiments to phospholipid membranes revealed that DS3 and DS4 had similar binding characteristics. Membrane permeation studies indicated that the peptides were equally potent in permeating phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles, whereas DS4 was more permeative with phosphatidylcholine vesicles. In aqueous solutions, DS4 was found to be in a higher aggregation state. Nevertheless, both DS3 and DS4 spontaneously dissociated to monomers upon interaction with vesicles, albeit with different kinetics. In light of these results, we propose a mechanism by which dermaseptins permeate cells and affect intraerythrocytic parasites. Antimicrobial peptides are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 2Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 4: 277-304Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These natural antibiotics have been the subject of many studies in recent years due to their involvement in host defense mechanisms and for their potential use in therapeutics. They are now believed to be an essential defense component of invertebrates and vertebrates, including humans, destined to control cell proliferation and invading pathogens. Although the precise mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides is not fully understood, most of such peptides known to date are believed to permeate the target cell by destabilizing its plasma membrane via either a “barrel stave” mechanism (3Fox R.O.

These studies showed that despite a large heterogeneity in primary and secondary structures, antimicrobial peptides are active against a large spectrum of microorganisms, yet most of them are generally nontoxic toward mammalian cells. The molecular basis for this selectivity is still ill defined. Dermaseptins are a family of structurally and functionally related peptides, isolated from the skin of tree frogs belonging to thePhyllomedusa genus (9Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore-Samour D. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8824-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 10Mor A. Nicolas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). They are linear polycationic peptides, composed of 28–34 amino acids that are structured in amphipathic α-helix in apolar solvents (12Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulated data, using phospholipid liposomes (13Hernandez C. Mor A. Dagger F. Nicolas P. Hernandez A. Benedetti E.L. Dunia I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 414-424PubMed Google Scholar, 14Strahilevitz J. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10951-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or live cells (6Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) suggested that the antimicrobial action of these peptides is mediated by interaction of the amphipathic α-helix with the plasma membrane phospholipids. All dermaseptin peptides were shown to have a cytolytic activity in vitro against various pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, yeast, and filamentous fungi). Combination of five members (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5) resulted in some cases in a 100-fold increase in the antibiotic activity over the activity of the peptides separately (15Mor A. Hani K. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31635-31641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular basis for the selective cytotoxicity of different dermaseptins. For this purpose, we compared the interactions of the hemolytic peptide dermaseptin S4 (DS4) 1The abbreviations used are: DS4, dermaseptin S4; DS3, dermaseptin 3; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; diS-C2–5, diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; RBC, red blood cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIC, differential interference contrast mode. and the nonhemolytic peptide dermaseptin S3 (DS3) with infected erythrocytes and with model phospholipid membranes. The peptides were labeled selectively at their N-terminal amino acids with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl (NBD) to facilitate binding experiments and to serve as an energy transfer donor or with rhodamine to serve as energy transfer acceptor. The selective cell permeation properties of DS3 and DS4 are discussed with respect to their organization in solution and after binding to membranes. Fmoc-amino acids were from Milligen. HMP-linked polyamide/Kieselguhr resin and Fmoc-amino acid pentafluorophenyl and 3-hydroxy-2,3-dehydro-4-oxobenzotriazine esters were from Milligen/Bioresearch. Other reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Sigma. Calcein was purchased from Hach Chemical Co. (Loveland, CO). l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (type IVS) was obtained from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine spinal cord (sodium salt, grade I), were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, United Kingdom). Diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C2–5), NBD-F(4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole), and tetramethyl rhodamine were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using double glass-distilled water. The peptides were synthesized by a solid phase method, applying the Fmoc active ester chemistry on a Milligen 9050 Pepsynthesizer. After removal of the Fmoc from the N-terminal amino acid, the peptide was cleaved from the resin with a mixture of 85:5:5:5 trifluoroacetic acid:p-cresol:H2O:thioanisole (10 mg of resin-bound peptide in a 1-ml mixture). The trifluoroacetic acid was then evaporated, and the peptide was precipitated with ether followed by washing with ether (4 times). The crude peptide was extracted from the resin with 40% acetonitrile in water and was purified to chromatographic homogeneity in the range of 95 to >99% by reverse phase HPLC on a semipreparative C18 column using a linear gradient of 30–80% acetonitrile in water (both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 40 min. The purified peptide was subjected to amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry to confirm its composition. Labeling of the peptide at its N-terminal amino acid with fluorescent probes was performed on resin-bound peptide as described previously (16Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20–30 mg of resin-bound peptide (∼6 mmol) were treated with piperidine in dry dimethylformamide to remove the Fmoc protecting group of the N-terminal amino acid of the linked peptide. The resin-bound peptide was then reacted with (i) 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole in dry dimethylformamide or (ii) tetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (3–4 eq) in dry dimethylformamide containing 5% (v/v) diisopropylethylamine. After 24 h, the resin-bound peptides were washed thoroughly with methylene chloride, and then the peptides were cleaved from the corresponding resins, precipitated with ether, extracted, and purified as described above. Peptides were kept as lyophilized powder at −80 °C. Prior to being tested, fresh solutions were prepared in water, vortexed, sonicated, centrifuged, and then diluted in the required medium. Samples for one-dimensional NMR experiments were prepared by dissolving 2 mg of lyophilized S3 or S4 in 0.5 ml containing 90% H2O and 10% D2O. NMR experiments were carried out at 600.13 MHz on a Bruker DMX-600 AVANCE spectrometer at room temperature. The carrier frequency was set on the water resonance signal, and it was presaturated during the relaxation delay of 1.5 s. For both samples, 16,384 data points were collected, with a spectral width of 8 kHz. Data processing was performed using Bruker's XWINNMR software, and all spectra were calibrated versus tetramethylsilane. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonication of PC or PC/PS (1:1, w/w) as described previously (17Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shai Y. Hadari Y.R. Finkels A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22346-22354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid concentrations of the resulting preparations were determined by phosphorous analysis (19Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used to visualize the morphology of the vesicles as follows. A drop of vesicles was deposited on a carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Examination of the grids demonstrated that the vesicles were unilamellar with an average diameter of 20–50 nm (20Papahadjopoulos D. Miller N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 135: 624-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). NBD-labeled peptides (0.2 μm) were added to 2 ml of PBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.3) containing PC or PS/PC SUV (360 μm), to establish a lipid/peptide ratio (1:1800) in which most of the peptide will be bound to lipids. After a 15-min incubation, the emission spectrum of NBD-labeled peptide in the presence of lipid vesicles (either PC or PS/PC) was recorded (in three separate experiments) using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter, with the excitation wavelength set at 467 nm (10-nm slit). Binding determinations were performed as described previously (15Mor A. Hani K. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31635-31641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PC or PS/PC SUVs were added gradually to 0.2 μm of NBD-labeled dermaseptins at room temperature. Fluorescence intensities were measured as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratios on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B Spectrofluorimeter, with the excitation set at 467 nm, using a 10-nm slit, and the emission was set at 530 nm, using a 5-nm slit, in three separate experiments. The extent of the lipids' contribution to any given signal was determined using readings obtained when unlabeled peptides were titrated with lipid vesicles and was subtracted as background from the recorded fluorescence intensities. Fluorescence spectra were obtained at room temperature in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter, with the excitation monochromator set at 467 nm (to minimize the excitation of tetramethylrhodamine) and with a 5-nm slit width. Measurements were performed in a 1-cm path length glass cuvette and a final reaction volume of 2 ml. In a typical experiment, donor (NBD-labeled) peptide at a final concentration of 0.2 μmwas added to a dispersion of PC or PS/PC SUV (360 μm) in PBS buffer, followed by addition of the acceptor (Rho-labeled) peptide in several sequential doses. Fluorescence spectra were obtained before and after the addition of the acceptor peptide. Changes in the fluorescence intensity of the donor (due to processes other than energy transfer to the acceptor) were determined by substituting unlabeled peptide for the acceptor and by measuring the emission spectrum of the acceptor alone in the presence of vesicles. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was determined by measuring the decrease in the quantum yield of the donor as a result of the addition of acceptor. E was determined experimentally from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of the donor in the presence (Ida) and in the absence (Id) of the acceptor at the donor's emission wavelength, after correcting for membrane light scattering and the contribution of acceptor emission. The correction for light scattering was made by subtracting the signal obtained when unlabeled analogues were added to vesicles containing the donor molecule. Correction for the contribution of acceptor emission was made by subtracting the signal produced by the acceptor-labeled analogue alone. The percentage of transfer efficiency (E) is defined as follows: E = (1 −Ida/Id) × 100. Membrane destabilization, which results in the collapse of diffusion potential, was detected fluorimetrically, as described previously (21Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.H. Hoffmann J.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 22Loew L.M. Rosenberg I. Bridge M. Gitler C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A liposome suspension, prepared in “K+ buffer” (50 mmK2SO4/25 mm HEPES-sulfate, pH 6.8), was added to an isotonic K+-free buffer (50 mmNa2SO4/25 mm of HEPES-sulfate, pH 6.8), and the dye diS-C2–5 was then added. The subsequent addition of valinomycin created a negative diffusion potential inside the vesicles by a selective efflux of K+ ions, which resulted in a quenching of the dye's fluorescence. Peptide-induced membrane permeability for all of the ions in the solution caused a dissipation of the diffusion potential, as monitored by an increase in fluorescence. Fluorescence was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths at 620 and 670 nm, respectively. The percentage of fluorescence recovery (Ft) was defined as Ft= ((It − Io)/(If −Io)) × 100%, where It represents fluorescence observed after the addition of a peptide at time t,Io is fluorescence after the addition of valinomycin, andIf is total fluorescence prior to the addition of valinomycin. Fresh heparinized human blood was rinsed three times in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.3) by centrifugation for 5 min at 900 × g; alternatively, whole blood was used. For the hemoglobin release assay, 2 × 108 RBC/ml were treated at room temperature in Eppendorf tubes by adding a 50-μl cell suspension to 200 μl of PBS containing various peptide concentrations. Treated suspensions were either analyzed immediately or incubated for various periods of time. Hemolytic activity was assessed as a function of hemoglobin leakage in the suspension as monitored by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 541 nm after centrifugation at 900 × g. Control cells were treated with distilled water or with PBS for 100% hemolysis and base-line values, respectively. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated taking into account the absorbance measured again for each sample after lysis with distilled water. For cell binding experiments, a 50-μl suspension containing 1 × 107RBC were added at room temperature to 200 μl of PBS containing various peptide concentrations in Eppendorf tubes. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC as detailed above. The amount of peptide present in the supernatant (free peptide) was calculated using standard curves of known concentrations for each peptide. To investigate the reversibility of the peptides binding, the pellets were washed (3 times) in PBS and then incubated in 250 μl of PBS under various conditions of time and temperature, including in the presence of fresh 1 × 107 RBC. The cytotoxicity toward Plasmodium falciparum in its erythrocytic stage was evaluated using the microtest method of Desjardin (23Desjardin R.E. Canfield C.j. Haines J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar), which is based on the measure of incorporated radiolabeled hypoxanthine by the parasite in presence of increasing drug concentrations. The method was modified as follows. The infection rate prior to the drug addition was 0.5% (determined by counting an aliquot on RAL-stained smears), and the parasites' exposure to hypoxanthine was 48 h. The parasites tested were isolated from patients who contracted the palludism in Nigeria and adapted to continuous culture as described (24Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Three parasite strains were tested; two strains (H and NF54) are characteristically sensitive to chloroquine (25Mirovski P. Gay F. Bustos D. Mazier D. Gentilini M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hygiene. 1990; 84: 511-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the third is a chloroquine-resistant strain (Ibrahim). The assay was performed in sterilized 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc F96, Denmark). Serial 2-fold dilutions of chloroquine or peptide (34.0–0.06 μm) were performed in complete culture medium (RPMI 1640, 35 mmHEPES, 2 g/liter glucose, 2.1 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 10 mg/liter gentamicine, and 10% decomplemented AB serum). To the 50-μl drug dilutions, 200 μl of culture medium containing 9 μl of parasite suspension (50% hematocrite) and 1.6 μCi of [3H]hypoxanthine (Amersham, France) were added. For positive growth controls, cells were cultured in drug-free medium. After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C, the content from each well was transferred to a paper filter using a cell collector (Skatron Instruments, Norway). Radioactivity was counted in scintillation liquid (Beckman LS 1701). Visual information on peptide interactions with RBC was obtained using a computer-assisted image analysis system (Oncor, UK), coupled to a cooled low level CCD camera (Photometrics) and an epiillumination inverted Axiovert microscope (Zeiss). Red fluorescence images were acquired with a band pass filter BP 546/12 nm, a chromatic beam splitter FT580, and a long wave pass filter LP 590 nm. An adaptable cell culture chamber was used to realize experiments. Cells (2 × 108 RBC/ml in PBS) deposited in the culture chamber 5 min prior to the peptide addition were allowed to settle at the bottom and form a carpet, and then the peptide was added in a drop at the center. Images were acquired with a plan-apochromat 100/1.4 oil immersion objective (Zeiss). Transmitted light images were realized in differential interference contrast mode (DIC). Images were digitized in a 512 × 512 array, and fluorescence or transmission intensity levels were primary coded on 16 bits. Images were then exported in 8 bits TIFF format. NIH Image 1.61 (by Wayne Rasband, NIH) and Photoshop 3.0 (Adobe) programs were used to make the printed outputs on a Kodak Colorease sublimation laser printer. Toward understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the selective cytotoxicity of dermaseptins, various labeled and unlabeled versions of DS3 and DS4 (the peptides and their designations are listed in Table I) were investigated at three different levels: peptide interaction with target cells (erythrocytes and intraerythrocytic parasites), peptide-peptide interaction in solution, and peptide interaction with model phospholipid membranes (the hypothetical primary target).Table IPrimary structure of the dermaseptin peptides and their fluorescently labeled analogsDesignationAmino acid sequenceDS3 (X = H)X-ALWKNMLKGIGKLAGKAALGAVKKLVGAESNBD-DS3 (X = NBD)Rho-DS3 (X = rhodamine)DS4 (X = H)X-ALWMTLLKKVLKAAAKAALNAVLVGANANBD-DS4 (X = NBD)Rho-DS4 (X = rhodamine) Open table in a new tab Incubation of washed erythrocytes (without serum) for 1 h in the presence of DS4 resulted in hemoglobin release corresponding to 50% cell lysis at the peptide concentration of 0.5 μm and 100% lysis at 1 μm (Fig. 1 A). Ten-fold higher concentrations were needed to induce the same effect (not shown) when unwashed blood (with serum) was used, indicating that a significant amount of the peptide was captured by serum components. Further information on the nature of the interaction of DS4 with erythrocytes was obtained from microscopical studies. In experiments using a microscope linked to a video camera, cells were allowed to settle at the bottom of the reaction chamber before the peptide was added. The addition of the peptide (labeled or unlabeled) resulted in instantaneous hemolysis; i.e. within 5 s from peptide addition, the voluminous round cells collapsed and turned into flat ghosts. The ghosts were labeled exclusively at their periphery, where peptide aggregates were clearly observable (Fig. 1 B). HPLC analysis of the posthemolysis supernatant indicated that DS4 binding to RBC was of a linear nature over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 2), since only traces of free peptide could be detected at 250 μg/ml (not shown). To investigate the reversibility of the binding, the pellets were washed and reincubated in 250 μl of PBS and then analyzed in HPLC. No trace of free peptide could be detected after overnight incubation at 37 °C, indicating that DS4 remains cell-bound and does not diffuse out back to the aqueous solution. Interestingly, incubation of the washed pellets (pretreated with 10 μm DS4) in the presence of fresh RBC induced instant hemolysis, and full hemolytic activity was recovered within 1 h of incubation (not shown). Moreover, such secondary hemolysis was observed after several repeats of the following cycle: hemolysis, wash, and the addition of fresh RBC. Fig. 1 A shows that DS3 also induced hemolysis of washed erythrocytes. However, the DS3-induced hemolysis was 100-fold less efficient than DS4 (50% hemolysis at 50 μm). Evidence for the peptide interaction with erythrocytes at nonhemolytic concentration was obtained from HPLC analysis of the supernatant after treatment with DS3 under the same conditions as for DS4. Fig. 2 shows that DS3 bound to RBC almost to the same extent as DS4 yet did not induce massive hemolysis (2.6% hemoglobin released at 10 μm). There was no evidence for peptide degradation products. Confirmation for peptide binding to the red cells was obtained from visualization of Rho-DS3-treated RBC (Fig. 1 C). Observation under a fluorescence microscope revealed that intact cells were not labeled. This suggested that only those cells that bound the peptide were permeabilized. However, lysis of the cells upon water addition, revealed that in reality, most if not all cells interacted with Rho-DS3, but the bound peptide could not be visualized in hemoglobin-containing cells, most probably because the fluorescence emitted by rhodamine at 541 nm is absorbed by hemoglobin. Once the hemoglobin was released, the fluorescence became immediately visible. Taken together, these experiments indicated that although DS3 binds to erythrocytes, cell permeabilization occurs only when a critical concentration is achieved, in contradiction to DS4, where low peptide concentrations induced massive hemolysis. To investigate the interaction of the dermaseptins with cells whose plasma membrane is not “a priori” accessible, we investigated the peptides interaction with P. falciparum in its erythrocytic stage. Within seconds after the addition of Rho-DS3 (10 μm), fluorescence videomicroscopy analysis indicated that in infected cells the peptides accumulated within the parasite, and the erythrocyte plasma membrane was generally only faintly labeled or not labeled at all (Fig. 3). Rapid accumulation within the parasite was also observed with Rho-DS4 (10 μm) (Fig. 3, a and b). This sharply contrasted with the labeling patterns of noninfected cells, where DS3 and DS4 labeled the erythrocytes plasma membrane only (Fig. 1,panels B and C-4). To investigate the fate of the interaction between the antimicrobial peptides and the intraerythrocytic parasite, we assessed the viability of the parasite by measuring the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporated after 48 h of culture. Both DS3 and DS4 affected the viability of the malaria parasite, since hypoxanthine incorporation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4) using either the chloroquine-sensitive strains, strain H (IC50 0.8 and 2.2 μm, respectively) and strain NF54 (IC50 0.26 and 0.27 μm, respectively), or the chloroquine-resistant strain Ibrahim (IC50 1.5 and 2.0 μm, respectively). In these cultures, DS3 was cytotoxic only for the malaria parasite, since no hemolysis could be detected up to 34.0 μm, whereas DS4 became toxic also for erythrocytes at high peptide concentrations (hemolysis was observed at concentrations higher than 8.5 μm). The aggregational properties of DS3 and DS4 in aqueous solution were determined using rhodamine-labeled peptides. This detection is based on the self-quenching of rhodamine fluorescence when several rhodamine labeled peptides are in close proximity, i.e. in an aggregated state. An increase in fluorescence should occur when the aggregated rhodamine-labeled peptide is dissociated, a process that should take place when the peptide is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes. The results summarized in Fig.5 indicate these properties. Theblack columns represent the fluorescence of Rho-DS3 (0.520 μm) and Rho-DS4 (0.529 μm) in solution. Although the concentrations of Rho-DS3 and Rho-DS4 were nearly equal, Rho-DS4 was less fluorescent (<50%), indicating its higher aggregation state. The addition of proteinase K caused dequenching of fluorescence to Rho-DS3 and Rho-DS4, indicating that proteolysis disrupts the aggregation state. Expectedly, when the peptides were cleaved by proteinase K they exhibited very similar levels of fluorescence. Moreover, to understand the nature of the aggregation state, the dose-dependent fluorescence values of the peptides were recorded at 575 nm (characteristic of rhodamine emission peak). Panel A of Fig. 5 depicts two such plots of fluorescence versus concentration of Rho-DS3 and Rho-DS4. The linear nature of the Rho-DS3 plot suggests that Rho-DS3 does not change its state beyond 0.1 μm, whereas the plot for Rho-DS4 deviates from linearity around 0.1 μm, indicating its change in aggregational state at this concentration range. Combining both results, it can be concluded that (i) both DS3 and DS4 are aggregated in aqueous solutions; (ii) the aggregational state of DS4 is higher than that of DS3; and (iii) once DS3 forms an aggregate at very low concentration, it does not change its aggregational state, whereas DS4 changes its aggregational state with increasing concentrations. One-dimensional proton NMR analysis of the peptides provided further support to the conclusions drawn from the fluorescence studies concerning the higher aggregation state of DS4. The recorded NMR spectra (not shown) presented the amide and the aromatic regions of the spectrum. Straightforward comparison of the two traces immediately revealed a difference in their spectral appearances: the spectrum of DS3 exhibited sharp well resolved resonances, while the spectrum obtained for DS4 consisted of several broad overlapped lines lacking fine multiplet structures (26W"

An understanding of the molecular interactions that trigger these events is important for therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking Aβ plaque formation at the earliest stages. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans may play a fundamental role since they are invariably associated with Aβ and other amyloid deposits at all stages. However, the nature of the Aβ-heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding has been difficult to elucidate because of the strong tendency of Aβ to self-aggregate. Affinity co-electrophoresis can measure the binding of proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycans to proteins without altering the physical state of the protein during the assay. We used affinity co-electrophoresis to study the interaction between Aβ and the glycosaminoglycan heparin and found that the aggregation state of Aβ governs its heparin-binding properties: heparin binds to fibrillar but not nonfibrillar Aβ. The amyloid binding dye, Congo red, inhibited the interaction in a specific and dose-dependent manner. The “Dutch” mutant AβE22Q peptide formed fibrils more readily than wild type Aβ and it also attained a heparin-binding state more readily, but, once formed, mutant and wild type fibrils bound heparin with similar affinities. The heparin-binding ability of aggregated AβE22Q was reversible with incubation in a solvent that promotes α-helical conformation, further suggesting that conformation of the peptide is important. Studies with another human amyloidogenic protein, amylin, suggested that its heparin-binding properties were also dependent on aggregation state. These results demonstrate the dependence of the Aβ-heparin interaction on the conformation and aggregation state of Aβ rather than primary sequence alone, and suggest methods of interfering with this association.

In most cases, Aβ is also deposited in the walls of parenchymal and meningeal blood vessels. In these two types of deposits, Aβ exists largely in a fibrillar form consisting of 40 or 42 amino acid monomers aggregated into insoluble filamentous polymers. Aβ, which is derived by endoproteolysis from the β-amyloid precursor protein (1Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Greschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B.

However, several other plaque-associated proteins have been described, including α1-antichymotrypsin (6Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H.

Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar), serum amyloid P component (9Coria F. Castano E. Prelli F. Larrondo-Lillo M. van Duinen S. Shelanski M.L. Frangione B. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar), and complement factors (10Eikelenboom P. Stam F.C. Acta Neuropathol. 1982; 57: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The order in which these various proteinaceous components are added to the senile plaques is not well understood, but some clues can be obtained from the composition of another type of Aβ deposit found in AD brains. “Diffuse” plaques are composed of Aβ in a particulate but not fibrillar form and do not react with the classic amyloid-staining dyes, Congo red and thioflavin S. Because the brains of young (<30 year old) Down's syndrome patients almost exclusively contain diffuse plaques, these deposits are believed to be the precursors of the compacted amyloid plaques, which invariably develop in older (>30–40 year old) Down's syndrome subjects (11Mann D.M.A. Brown A.

Pathol. 1990; 137: 1253-1270PubMed Google Scholar) have detected immunohistochemically the presence of a specific HSPG, perlecan, in the compacted plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid of Alzheimer's disease brain. In addition, diffuse plaques in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but not in the cerebellum, were shown to contain perlecan (13Snow A.D. Mar H. Nochlin D. Sekiguchi R.T. Kimata K. Koike Y. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 1253-1270PubMed Google Scholar, 14Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R.T. Nochlin D. Kalaria R.N. Kimata K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 337-347PubMed Google Scholar). Because compacted plaques are rarely found in the cerebellum even in end stage AD brains (15Joachim C.L. Morris J.H. Selkoe D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 309-319PubMed Google Scholar), it is postulated that HSPGs such as perlecan could play a role in the transition of diffuse Aβ deposits into compacted amyloid. The finding that cortical diffuse plaques in Down's syndrome brain are also perlecan-immunoreactive (13Snow A.D. Mar H. Nochlin D. Sekiguchi R.T. Kimata K. Koike Y. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 1253-1270PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with this hypothesis. HSPGs may play a general role in the formation and stabilization of many types of amyloid, since they have also been identified in association with amyloid deposits in virtually all other human amyloid diseases (for review, see Ref. 16Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In AD cerebrovasculature, Aβ amyloid deposits have been ultrastructurally localized to the vascular basement membrane region of capillaries, arterioles, and small arteries (17Yamaguchi H. Yamazaki T. Lemere C.A. Frosch M.P. Selkoe D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 249-259PubMed Google Scholar), where perlecan is a prominent constituent. In addition, one of the diseases linked genetically to β-amyloid precursor protein (Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis, Dutch-type (HCHWA-D)) causes a particularly severe deposition of Aβ in meningocerebral blood vessels (18Luyendijk W.

Previous attempts to characterize the binding between HSPGs and Aβ (20Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J.

Biophys. 1995; 320: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have been hindered by the unique difficulties of working with synthetic Aβ, a highly hydrophobic 40–42-amino acid peptide that readily precipitates into insoluble aggregates in vitro. Affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE) is an advantageous method to characterize the binding of proteins to proteoglycans or their glycosaminoglycan side chains (24Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). Each component is freely mobile within a highly porous native agarose gel, and no coupling of either component to any matrix, resin, or solid support is required, so all of the potential binding surfaces remain available. Importantly, Aβ has less opportunity to aggregate during the experiment than in many other types of binding assays. In this paper, we use ACE to characterize the binding of Aβ peptides to heparin (a glycosaminoglycan that is frequently used as a model for tissue heparan sulfates) at physiological pH and ionic strength. Both wild type Aβ and the HCHWA-D disease-causing mutant form were studied. We show that the heparin-Aβ interaction is critically dependent on the secondary structure and aggregation state of Aβ and is potently inhibited by the amyloid-binding dye Congo red. Aβ containing the HCHWA-D mutation binds heparin more readily than wild type peptide due to its increased tendency to form fibrils, not because of a greater affinity for heparin. Finally, we demonstrate that another amyloid-forming subunit, human amylin, also binds to heparin, whereas the nontoxic and non-amyloidogenic rat isoform of amylin does not. Wild type Aβ1–40 peptide was synthesized and HPLC-purified by Dr. D. Teplow (Biopolymer Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital). Aβ1–40 containing the E22Q “Dutch” mutation (AβE22Q) was made by Dr. D. Chin (University of Missouri, Columbia) and aliquots were HPLC-purified by Dr. D. Walsh (Biopolymer Facility, Brigham and Women's Hospital). Human and rat amylin peptides were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA) or Bachem (Torrance, CA). The amino acid sequence of wild type human Aβ1–40 is DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV (see,e.g. Ref. 1Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Greschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar); in mutant AβE22Q, Glu22 (underlined) is changed to Gln (19Levy E. Carman M.D. Fernandez-Madrid I.J. Power M.D. Lieberburg I. van Duinen S.G. Bots G.T.A.M. Luyendijk W. Frangione B. Science. 1990; 248: 1124-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). For amylin and nonfibrillar Aβ preparations, lyophilized peptides were freshly resuspended in water (initially at 1 mm) and used immediately. Alternatively, fibrillar Aβ was formed by resuspending the lyophilized peptide in water to 1 mm, then adding artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2 in 1.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) to achieve a final concentration of 100 μm Aβ peptide and rocking it for 2 days at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in ACE electrophoresis running buffer (50 mm NaMOPSO in 125 mm acetate buffer, pH 7.0; Ref. 24Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and sonicated before use. A similar protocol using an ultrafiltrate of CSF showed Aβ1–40 fibril formation after 48 h at room temperature (26Wisniewski T. Castaño E. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 34: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Duplicate aliquots of each peptide preparation were collected and the peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis, performed by M. Condron (Brigham and Women's Hospital Biopolymer Laboratory). Simultaneously, aliquots of each peptide preparation were applied to a 200-mesh copper-Formvar/carbon grid (EM Sciences, Gibbstown, NJ), negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and observed with a JEOL JEM 100CX-II electron microscope at 60 kV. Congo red birefringence was determined by the protocol of Castañoet al. (27Castaño E.M. Prelli F. Wisniewski T. Golabek A. Kumar R.A. Soto C. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Tyramine was added to the reducing ends of unbleached heparin molecules (Grade I, porcine intestinal mucosa, Sigma) via a reductive amidation reaction (28San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This method adds ≤1 tyramine per heparin molecule and does not disturb the chemistry of the heparin along its chain length. The tyramine moiety was iodinated by the IODOGEN method (Pierce), and the heparin was then size-fractionated by gel filtration. The low molecular weight (LMW) fraction (≤ 6 kDa) was used to minimize the number of potential binding sites per heparin molecule. Unlabeled LMW-heparin was from Sigma. Horizontal 1% (w/v) agarose gels were cast with two combs essentially as described (24Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar), producing a set of nine rectangular wells and a perpendicularly oriented slot (Fig. 1). Serial dilutions of each peptide preparation were prepared in ACE electrophoresis running buffer (see above) and mixed with an equal volume of molten 2% agarose, cast into the nine wells, and allowed to set. The slot was loaded with125I-LMW-heparin, which was subjected to electrophoresis through the protein-containing zones. After drying the gels, the positions of bands were measured using a PhosphorImager 400A and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue showed that Aβ itself did not noticeably migrate from its original position during the electrophoresis times used (not shown). From positions of labeled bands, a retardation coefficient,R, was calculated (R = (M o − M)/M o, where M o is the mobility of free heparin andM is heparin's observed mobility through a protein (i.e. Aβ)-containing zone; Ref. 24Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Values were fit to the equation R = R ∞/(1 + (K d /[protein]) n ) (25Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). In general, better fits were obtained with n = 2, suggesting either positive cooperativity in binding, or perhaps the fact that some Aβ fibrils are lost on the walls of tubes and pipette tips in the process of making serial dilutions, causing Aβ concentrations to be somewhat overestimated at the highest dilutions. Protein concentrations are given in units of molarity of monomer, and were determined by amino acid analysis. Values for K d were calculated using these units of molarity; a calculation based on the molarity of polymerized fibrils would yield a much lower K d (see “Discussion”). Preparations of fibrillar or nonfibrillar Aβ were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with125I-LMW-heparin in ACE electrophoresis buffer. In some cases, serial dilutions of Congo red or of unlabeled LMW-heparin were included; these solutions were made fresh for each experiment. The mixtures were then transferred to nitrocellulose by vacuum filtration through a dot-blot apparatus, followed by one rinse with phosphate-buffered saline. The filter was dried and the bound radioactivity retained on the filter was counted directly in a γ counter (Cobra II AutoGamma, Packard Instruments). Background radioactivity in control wells containing 125I-LMW-heparin tracer alone were subtracted from the values for Aβ-containing wells before analysis. Values from six control wells containing only Aβ and heparin tracer were averaged to provide a value for maximum Aβ-heparin binding. ACE experiments to measure the binding of Aβ to heparin were initially attempted using aliquots of lyophilized wild type Aβ1–40that were freshly resuspended in water, diluted, and assayed immediately. Samples were incorporated into the nine lanes of a 1% agarose gel, and 125I-LMW-heparin was subjected to electrophoresis through those lanes (Fig.1 A). At neutral pH, the mobility of Aβ is much less than that of heparin (data not shown), so we expected a complex of heparin and Aβ to have a mobility significantly less than that of free heparin. Assuming this is the case, any binding of Aβ to heparin should have been revealed as a series of electrophoretic bands that were progressively retarded with increasing Aβ concentration (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, no effect of Aβ on heparin mobility was seen at peptide concentrations up to 243 μm (Fig.2 A). These data indicate that either Aβ and heparin do not bind under the conditions of the assay, or that binding could not be detected because the mobility of the Aβ-heparin complex is not sufficiently different from that of heparin alone. To test the latter possibility, we reversed the roles of heparin and peptide in the experiment (25Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). In this case, heparin was cast into the nine parallel lanes, and125I-Aβ introduced into a single slot perpendicular to the lanes. Because heparin is more mobile than Aβ, the peptide-containing slot was placed between the heparin lanes and the anode (Fig. 1 C). In this experiment, any binding of heparin to Aβ should have been revealed as a series of electrophoretic bands whose mobility was progressively increased by increasing heparin concentrations. However, as shown in Fig. 2 B, no change in the mobility of 125I-Aβ was seen at heparin concentrations up to 10 mg/ml (>1.5 mm). As before, the only way we could have failed to detect actual binding of heparin and Aβ in this experiment is if the mobility of the heparin-peptide complex was not significantly different from that of the labeled species, in this case Aβ. However, it is not possible for the mobility of the heparin-Aβ complex to be indistinguishable from both that of free Aβ and that of free heparin, as Aβ and heparin have mobilities that are very different from each other. Thus, the negative results in Fig. 2, A and B, together indicate that freshly resuspended Aβ and heparin do not bind each other (K d ≥ 0.25 mm). Because the close association of heparan sulfate with Aβ deposits in AD brain still suggested an important interaction between the two molecules, we next considered the possibility that the secondary structure of polymerized fibrillar Aβ creates a heparin-binding epitope. To aggregate Aβ into fibrils, aliquots of lyophilized Aβ1–40 were resuspended initially in water and then diluted into artificial CSF and rocked for 48 h at room temperature. Electron microscopy of the pelleted precipitate confirmed the formation of straight, unbranched filaments approximately 10 nm in diameter (Fig. 2 D), similar to the structure and dimensions of Aβ fibrils purified from Alzheimer's plaques (29Narang H.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1980; 39: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Merz P.A. Wisniewski H.M. Somerville R.A. Bobin S.A. Masters C.L. Iqbal K. Acta Neuropathol. 1983; 60: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after staining with Congo red, Aβ fibrils showed birefringence under polarized light (not shown). In contrast, electron microscopy of the freshly resuspended nonfibrillar Aβ preparation demonstrated large amorphous clumps (Fig. 2 C), indicating the presence of aggregated but not fibrillar Aβ. Upon reaction with Congo red, the nonfibrillar Aβ was not birefringent (not shown). Increasing concentrations of the Aβ fibrils were then loaded into the lanes of an ACE gel and tested for heparin binding. In sharp contrast to what was observed with the freshly resuspended peptide, low micromolar concentrations of fibrillar Aβ completely retarded the mobility of the heparin tracer (Fig. 2 E). To confirm that the retardation was due to a specific binding interaction and not to nonspecific physical blockage of the heparin by a dense network of fibrils, we demonstrated that the binding of125I-LMW-heparin to Aβ fibrils could be completely competed away by excess unlabeled LMW-heparin (Fig. 2 F). Several independently aggregated fibril preparations showed electrophoretic retardation profiles very similar to that shown in Fig.2 E. To measure binding affinity, we calculated retardation coefficients, R, from each of several ACE gels. The results from five experiments were fit to the equation R =R ∞/(1 + (K d /[protein])2) (25Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar, 31Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which yielded an average K d of 1.31 ± 0.10 μm (Fig. 3; this value is expressed in units of molarity of Aβ monomer (see “Experimental Procedures”)). As an independent test of the results obtained by ACE, a solution-phase binding assay was also used. Increasing concentrations of fibrillar or nonfibrillar Aβ were incubated with 125I-LMW-heparin in solution, after which the mixtures were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum filtration and counted to measure the retained (protein-bound) heparin. Again, fibrillar but not non-fibrillar Aβ bound heparin with a low micromolar affinity (not shown). Congo red is a histochemical dye used for the detection of amyloids of all types in tissue sections. The binding of Congo red to Aβ has been postulated to depend in part on fibrillar Aβ structure (32Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). We tested whether Congo red could inhibit the binding of heparin to fibrillar Aβ. Equal aliquots of fibrillar Aβ1–40 were incubated with increasing concentrations of Congo red, and then loaded into the lanes of an ACE gel. Compared with the control lanes of Congo red alone (Fig. 4 A, lane 7) and fibrils alone (lane 8), a dose-dependent inhibition of heparin binding to the fibrils was observed (lanes 1–6). We also used the solution-phase binding assay (above) to confirm the interaction of Congo red with fibrillar Aβ. In the ACE gels, an inhibition of heparin-protein binding is most readily visualized when the protein concentration in the lanes containing no inhibitor is high enough to completely retard the migration of heparin (see,e.g., Fig. 4 A, lane 8). However, using the solution-phase binding assay, we were able to test a range of Aβ concentrations to show that the IC50 for Congo red inhibition of heparin binding increases with increasing protein concentration (Fig. 4 B). When similar concentrations of Aβ were compared in the two assays, ACE gels showed a higher IC50 for Congo red than the solution-phase assay (Fig. 4,A versus B, middle trace). This may be due to the migration of the negatively charged Congo red out of the well during ACE electrophoresis, decreasing the total amount of drug in the lane. HPLC-purified Aβ1–40containing the E22Q (HCHWA-D) substitution was either freshly resuspended from a lyophilized aliquot or aggregated into fibrils as described above. Serial dilutions of each preparation were loaded into the lanes of ACE gels and tested for binding to125I-LMW-heparin. The freshly resuspended peptide did not bind to heparin up to peptide concentrations of 15.2 μm(Fig. 5 A, lane 1), whereas 5.7 μm fibrillar AβE22Q almost completely retarded the mobility of heparin (Fig. 5 B,lane 4). From autoradiograms of ACE gels such as that in Fig. 5 Bretardation coefficients were calculated and plotted against peptide concentration (Fig. 5 C). Values of K d were calculated as described above, and results from several independent preparations of fibrillar AβE22Q yielded an average K d of 3.45 ± 0.08 μm. This is in the low micromolar range, similar to the value measured for heparin binding to wild type Aβ fibrils prepared by the same method. In contrast, when Aβ was subjected to a milder aggregation protocol, we observed a distinct difference in the heparin-binding behavior of wild type and mutant peptides. In this case, each peptide was neutralized, incubated for 48 h at 4 °C at a concentration of 1 mm in water and then lyophilized. Immediately after resuspension in water, the wild type Aβ remained in a non-heparin binding state (data not shown). However, after identical treatment, the mutant peptide was able to bind heparin (Fig.6 A) and showed an affinity similar to that of preformed AβE22Q fibrils. We interpreted this result as indicating that water-aggregated AβE22Q adopted a structure similar to that of wild type Aβ that had been aggregated in artificial CSF (i.e.fibrils with substantial β-pleated sheet conformation). Further evidence for the presence of this conformation came from the fact that the interaction of heparin with the treated AβE22Q was blocked by Congo red in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6 B). In addition, the ability of these AβE22Qsamples to bind heparin was reversed by overnight incubation in (1,1,1,3,3,3)-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) for 72 h and lyophilization (Fig. 6 C). HFIP is a solvent that is thought to promote or stabilize α-helices (33Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T.M. Zagorski M. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and that can also reverse the neurotoxicity of fibrillar Aβ in cell cultures (34Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of heparan sulfate has been demonstrated immunohistochemically in amyloid deposits from most human amyloidotic diseases (for review, see Ref.16Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). One well known example is the islet amyloid of type II diabetes (35Young I.D. Ailles L. Narindrasorasak S. Tan R. Kisilevsky R. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1992; 116: 951-954PubMed Google Scholar). In this disease, the 37-residue amyloid subunit protein, called amylin, is the major constituent of the extracellular amyloid deposits that surround pancreatic islet cells. In vitro, the human isoform of amylin readily forms fibrils that are toxic to cultured islet cells (3"
https://openalex.org/W2068168873,"The G-protein-coupled calcium receptor plays a key role in extracellular calcium homeostasis. To examine the role of the membrane-spanning domains and the ∼200-residue cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the calcium receptor in cell-surface expression and signal transduction, we transfected HEK-293 cells with a series of truncation and carboxyl-terminal missense mutants and analyzed expression by immunoblotting, glycosidase digestion, intact cell immunoassay, and extracellular calcium-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay. Two truncation mutants terminating at residues 706 and 802 within the second and third intracellular loops, respectively, were not properly glycosylated, failed to reach the cell-surface, and showed no calcium response, indicating that mutant receptors with the full extracellular domain but only three or five transmembrane domains are improperly folded and/or processed. Truncation mutants terminating at residues 888 and 903 within the carboxyl terminus were equivalent to the wild type in all assays, whereas mutants truncated at residues 865 and 874 showed no response to calcium, despite only ∼25% reduction in cell-surface expression. Mutants with a full-length carboxyl terminus but with residues between positions 874 and 888 replaced with alanines showed either no (Ala875, Ala876, and Ala879) or significantly reduced (Ala881–Ala883) calcium response at levels of cell-surface expression equivalent to those of the wild-type receptor. These results indicate that deletion of the majority of the carboxyl terminus is compatible with normal processing, cell-surface expression, and signal transduction of the receptor. The truncation and alanine substitution mutants identify a small region between residues 874 and 888 critical for normal signal transduction by the receptor. The G-protein-coupled calcium receptor plays a key role in extracellular calcium homeostasis. To examine the role of the membrane-spanning domains and the ∼200-residue cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the calcium receptor in cell-surface expression and signal transduction, we transfected HEK-293 cells with a series of truncation and carboxyl-terminal missense mutants and analyzed expression by immunoblotting, glycosidase digestion, intact cell immunoassay, and extracellular calcium-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay. Two truncation mutants terminating at residues 706 and 802 within the second and third intracellular loops, respectively, were not properly glycosylated, failed to reach the cell-surface, and showed no calcium response, indicating that mutant receptors with the full extracellular domain but only three or five transmembrane domains are improperly folded and/or processed. Truncation mutants terminating at residues 888 and 903 within the carboxyl terminus were equivalent to the wild type in all assays, whereas mutants truncated at residues 865 and 874 showed no response to calcium, despite only ∼25% reduction in cell-surface expression. Mutants with a full-length carboxyl terminus but with residues between positions 874 and 888 replaced with alanines showed either no (Ala875, Ala876, and Ala879) or significantly reduced (Ala881–Ala883) calcium response at levels of cell-surface expression equivalent to those of the wild-type receptor. These results indicate that deletion of the majority of the carboxyl terminus is compatible with normal processing, cell-surface expression, and signal transduction of the receptor. The truncation and alanine substitution mutants identify a small region between residues 874 and 888 critical for normal signal transduction by the receptor.

Extracellular calcium ion (Ca2+ o ) activates the CaR, leading to activation of phospholipase C-β via the Gq subfamily of G-proteins; this increases phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, which in turn causes release of calcium from intracellular stores (1Brown E.M.

CaR activation by Ca2+ o is thought to control the rate of parathyroid hormone secretion from parathyroid cells and the rate of calcium reabsorption by the kidney (2Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman C.E.

Thus, the CaR plays a critical role in the regulation of extracellular calcium homeostasis. Although the CaR shares the GPCR-defining seven-transmembrane domain motif, it shows no sequence homology to GPCRs other than a unique subfamily composed of the metabotropic glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptors (1Brown E.M.

Unlike other members of the GPCR superfamily for which extensive mutagenesis studies have helped define regions and residues important for receptor synthesis and cell-surface expression, for ligand binding, and for G-protein coupling, relatively little is known about the structure-function relationships of the CaR. Several naturally occurring point mutations have been identified in the human CaR (hCaR) in subjects with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia and familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH) (2Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Chou Y.H. Riccardi D. Hebert S.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A limited number of these putatively activating (autosomal dominant hypocalcemia) and inactivating (FBHH) mutations that occur primarily in the ECD have been expressed and tested for function in cell transfection studies (8Bai M.

Given the unique sequence and predicted topology of the hCaR and the dearth of naturally occurring mutations involving the transmembrane domains and the carboxyl terminus of the receptor, we sought to define the importance of these regions in receptor biosynthesis, cell-surface expression, and signal transduction. For this purpose, we created a series of mutants that truncate or alter the receptor sequence within the second and third intracellular loops and within the carboxyl-terminal tail. Our results indicate that all seven transmembrane helices may be necessary for proper folding, processing, and cell-surface expression of the hCaR and define a membrane-proximal portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail that contains residues critical for cell-surface expression and signal transduction. The entire coding region of the hCaR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a pituitary Marathon cDNA library (Promega, Madison, WI) using specific primers (nucleotides −14 to 6 (5′-sense primer) and nucleotides 3256–3277 (3′-antisense primer) of the hCaR cDNA) (4Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol.

The PCR-amplified product was cloned into the pCR3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as a HindIII-XhoI fragment and sequenced completely by automated DNA sequencing using a Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI Prizm-377 DNA sequencer, and some regions were also confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase 2.1 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The DNA sequence showed no differences from the published sequence of the hCaR cloned from a parathyroid cDNA library (4Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the hCaR cDNA was performed using restriction fragment replacement “cassette mutagenesis” (11Lo K.M. Jones S.S. Hackett N.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For cassette mutagenesis, a 3.3-kilobase hCaR coding fragment was cut out from the pCR3.1 expression vector and recloned as a HindIII-XbaI fragment in the pBluescript KS II+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) lacking NsiI, SphI, andXbaI restriction enzyme sites. Truncation mutant hCaRs are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Truncation mutants are designated by a “T” followed by the codon number corresponding to the first mutant stop codon. T706 was prepared by replacing a 356-base pairNsiI-SphI restriction fragment of the hCaR with a synthetic duplex constructed by PCR mutagenesis that substituted sequences coding for 128 amino acid residues with two stop codons at amino acids 706 and 707. T802 was generated by replacing the sameNsiI-SphI restriction fragment with a synthetic duplex containing stop codons at amino acids 802 and 803. T888 and T903 were prepared by replacing a 605-base pairSmaI-XhoI restriction fragment encoding carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 886–1078 with two separate PCR-generated duplexes with stop codons introduced at amino acids 888 and 889 for T888 or at amino acids 903 and 904 for T903. Site-specific mutants were prepared by replacing a 224-base pairSphI-XbaI restriction fragment encoding amino acids 770–886. For the Ala875–Ala879 mutant, codons for Ser875, Thr876, and His879 were replaced with codons for alanine. All the changes were included in the 3′-primer with the XbaI site at the end. For the Ala881–Ala883 mutant, codons for Phe881, Lys882, and Val883 were changed to codons for alanine. The changes were included in the 3′-primer with XbaI site at the end. All these 3′-mutant primers were used separately with the 5′-primer containing wild-type receptor nucleotide sequence with the SphI site to PCR-amplify the 224-base pair SphI-XbaI fragment of the hCaR. The PCR fragments were gel-purified, digested withSphI and XbaI, and ligated with theSphI-XbaI-digested hCaR/pBluescript KS II+ DNA. All cloned synthetic sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prizm-377 DNA sequencer. A clone for each mutant with correct DNA sequence was transferred into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1 as aHindIII-XhoI restriction fragment. Receptor cDNAs in pCR3.1 were prepared with a QIAGEN maxi-plasmid DNA preparation kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and were introduced into HEK-293 cells by the LipofectAMINE transfection method (Life Technologies Inc.). The quality and quantity of plasmid DNA were electrophoretically assessed on 0.8% agarose gel after measuring absorbance at 260 nm. For transfection, a given amount of the plasmid DNA was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) and mixed with diluted LipofectAMINE, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE complex was further diluted in serum-free DMEM and added to 80–90% confluent HEK-293 cells plated on 24-well plates using 0.5 or 1 μg of DNA/well (for phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay), on 24-well plates using 0.5 or 2 μg of DNA (for intact cell enzyme-linked immunoassay), and in 75-mm flasks using 5 or 10 μg of DNA (for immunoblot analysis and intact cell enzyme-linked immunoassay). After 4–5 h of incubation, an equal volume of DMEM + 20% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids Inc.) was added, and the media were replaced 24 h after transfection with fresh DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. Membrane protein extraction for immunoblotting, intact cell enzyme-linked immunoassay, or PI hydrolysis assay was performed 48 h after transfection. Confluent cells in 75-mm flasks were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached with 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS at 37 °C. The detached cells were pelleted and suspended in buffer A containing 5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. The cells were forced through a 22-gauge needle five to eight times, and the lysate was spun in a TLA-100 centrifuge at 55,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to collect the crude membrane pellet. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 with freshly added protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride). For cleavage with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), membrane preparations in buffer B (20 μl) were mixed with 1 μl of 10% SDS. Samples were incubated with 0.4 units of PNGase F (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 37 °C. For cleavage with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), membrane preparations (15 μl) were mixed with 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8). Samples were incubated with 0.5 milliunits of Endo-H (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C. The protein content of each sample was determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 5–20 μg of protein/lane was separated on 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gel were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with 0.1 μg/ml protein A-purified monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody ADD (raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 214–235 of the hCaR protein). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:5000. The hCaR protein was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Corp.). To compare cell-surface expression of receptors in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, 48 h after transfection, confluent transfected HEK-293 cells on 24-well plates were detached with 1 mm EDTA in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody 7F8 (raised against the purified extracellular domain of hCaR) 2P. K. Goldsmith and A. M. Spiegel, manuscript in preparation. at 4 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, cells were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation (1000 rpm, 4 °C) and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGγ (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, peroxidase substrate was added to each sample, and the color reaction was followed for 5–10 min; absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a Thermomax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was assayed as described (13Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kifor O. Congo D. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1990; 5: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 3.0 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol (NEN Life Science Products) in DMEM for 16–24 h, followed by a 30-min preincubation with PI buffer (120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm LiCl in 25 mm PIPES (pH 7.2)). After removal of PI buffer, cells were incubated for an additional 30 min with different concentrations of Ca2+ o in PI buffer. The reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of acid methanol (167 μl of HCl in 120 ml of methanol). Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns. The mean EC50 for each wild-type and mutant receptor in response to [Ca2+] o was calculated from EC50values from all individual experiments and expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparison of EC50 values was performed using analysis of variance to determine significance. Six truncation mutant constructs of the hCaR (T706, T802, T865, T874, T888, and T903) were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sites of the six truncation mutants are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The wild-type hCaR cDNA and each of the mutant constructs were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, and expression was assessed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody (ADD) raised against a peptide epitope from the extracellular domain of the receptor that was not disrupted by the truncations (Fig.2). Membrane preparations of cells transfected with vector containing the wild-type hCaR cDNA showed two major bands of ∼150 and 130 kDa and a higher molecular mass band (>197-kDa marker) that may represent dimeric forms and/or aggregates of the receptor as previously reported (8Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots done with ADD of membranes from HEK-293 cells transfected with vector lacking receptor cDNA showed no immunoreactivity (data not shown, but see Ref. 13Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative intensity of the 150- and 130-kDa bands and the appearance of a smaller band beneath the 115-kDa marker varied between different immunoblot experiments. Unlike the wild-type receptor, the T706 and T802 mutants each showed a single major band between the 89- and 98-kDa marker bands on immunoblots, whereas the carboxyl-terminal tail truncation mutants T865, T874, T888, and T903 each showed two major bands between the 89- and 115-kDa marker bands. Higher molecular mass immunoreactivity was seen for each of the mutants as well. As expected, each truncation mutant showed a reduction in molecular size compared with the wild-type hCaR that was, in general, proportionate to the differences in length generated by truncations. The T865, T874, and T888 mutants, however, all showed comparable migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, whereas T903 ran at a slightly higher molecular mass. The two shortest carboxyl-terminal tail truncation mutants, T865 and T874, showed relatively fainter bands compared with the wild-type hCaR when equal quantities of membranes were loaded on each lane in three different immunoblot experiments; this may indicate a lower level of synthesis and expression of these mutant receptors. The wild-type hCaR has been shown to undergoN-glycosylation (8Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the truncation mutants undergo this post-translational modification, a series of deglycosylation experiments were conducted. The enzyme PNGase F cleavesN-linked carbohydrates (both intermediate high mannose forms and fully processed forms) from glycoproteins (15Barsomian G.D. Johnson T.L. Borowski M. Denman J. Ollington J.F. Hirani S. McNeilly D.S. Rasmussen J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6967-6972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Endo-H cleaves only high mannose forms (16Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27720-27727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Membrane preparations of cells transfected with wild-type and truncation mutant receptors were treated with PNGase F and Endo-H, and immunoblotting was performed to visualize the products of digestion. As shown in Fig.3, PNGase F treatment of membranes from HEK-293 cells transfected with the wild-type hCaR cDNA causes the disappearance of the 150-kDa band and a reduction in size of the 130-kDa band. In contrast, Endo-H digestion causes a minimal alteration of the 150-kDa band while, like PNGase F, reducing the size of the 130-kDa band. Unlike for the wild-type hCaR, in membranes expressing the T706 and T802 mutants, both PNGase F and Endo-H digestion reduced the size of the expressed band. The products of digestion corresponded roughly to the sizes predicted, 75 and 85 kDa, respectively, based on primary amino acid length (Fig. 3). For membranes expressing the carboxyl-terminal tail truncation mutants T865, T874, T888, and T903, which displayed a doublet pattern of immunoreactivity (Fig. 2), digestion with PNGase F caused a decrease in the size of both bands, but Endo-H digestion reduced only the size of the lower band (Fig.4). A series of faster migrating bands seen after PNGase F digestion of T865, T874, and T888 may reflect incomplete digestion (Fig. 4).Figure 4Enzymatic deglycosylation studies with PNGase F and Endo-H to analyze processing patterns of carboxyl-terminal tail truncation mutant hCaRs. 10 μg of crude membrane extracts of cells transfected with wild-type hCaR cDNA (WT) or 20 μg of crude membrane extracts of cells transfected with four carboxyl-terminal tail truncation mutant receptors was incubated without (− untreated) or with PNGase F (+ PNGase F) for 2 h or Endo-H (+ Endo H) for 1 h at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction mixtures were stopped and analyzed by immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of the extracellular N-terminal domain of the hCaR should not be disrupted in any of the truncation mutants we made. We therefore took advantage of a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the native receptor expressed on intact cells to quantitate cell-surface expression of the mutant receptors (Fig. 5). The T706 and T802 mutants failed to show any significant cell-surface expression (absorbance values no different from that for the vector control). The absorbance values for the T865 and T874 mutants were lower than that for the wild-type hCaR, indicating a lower level of expression of these mutants at the cell surface. In contrast, cell-surface expression of the T888 mutant was comparable to that of the wild-type hCaR and that of the T903 mutant was consistently higher than that of the wild-type hCaR using equal amounts of DNA for transfection. The CaR responds to increases in [Ca2+] o in the millimolar range by activating Gq family proteins to stimulate phospholipase C-β activity with resultant PI hydrolysis. We (13Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (17Pearce S.H. Williamson C. Kifor O. Bai M. Coulthard M.G. Davies M. Lewis-Barned N. McCredie D. Powell H. Kendall-Taylor P. Brown E.M. Thakker R.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) have used this assay in transfected HEK-293 cells to measure signal transduction by expressed wild-type and mutant CaRs. Two intracellular loop truncation mutants (T706 and T803) showed greatly attenuated or absolutely no PI response even at 20 mmCa2+ o (data not shown). Likewise, the two shortest carboxyl-terminal tail truncation mutants (T865 and T874) showed no detectable PI hydrolysis response to [Ca2+] o (Fig. 6). In contrast, the T888 and T903 mutants both showed PI hydrolysis responses to [Ca2+] o similar to that of the wild-type hCaR. Both mutants showed similar dose-response curves with EC50values of 3.7 ± 0.18 and 3.0 ± 0.53, respectively (Fig. 6). Since the T888 mutant behaved comparably to the wild-type hCaR, whereas the T874 mutant showed no PI hydrolysis response to [Ca2+] o , we sought to evaluate the role of the 14 amino acid residues between T874 and T888 (TableI). We generated two site-directed mutants in which alanine residues were substituted for residues 875, 876, and 879 (Ala875–Ala879 mutant; residues 877 and 878 are already alanines in the wild-type receptor) and for residues 881, 882, and 883 (Ala881–Ala883mutant; residues 884, 885, and 887 are alanines in the wild-type receptor) in the context of the full-length receptor. Because we sought to study the signaling properties of these receptors at similar expression levels, we first determined the levels of cell-surface expression for each mutant receptor after transfecting HEK-293 cells with varying amounts of plasmid DNA (0.5–2 μg). Results of the enzyme-linked immunoassay showed that cell-surface expression differed among the mutant and wild-type receptors when the same amount of plasmid DNA was used for transfection (Fig.7). Similar levels of expression were achieved by transfecting HEK-293 cells with half the amount of wild-type hCaR cDNA compared with mutant cDNA as shown in Fig.7. Next, we compared the [Ca2+] o response of the alanine mutant receptors under conditions in which cell-surface expression was equivalent to that of the wild-type hCaR using the PI hydrolysis assay (Fig. 8). The Ala875–Ala879 mutant under transfection conditions in which cell-surface expression was equivalent to that of the wild-type hCaR showed no dose-dependent stimulation up to 20 mm Ca2+ o . The Ala881–Ala883 mutant showed a 60–70% decrease in maximal response compared with the wild-type receptor and a right-shifted concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+] o response with an EC50 value of 3.8 ± 0.8.Table IAmino acid sequence of the proximal carboxyl-terminal t"

To examine the involvement of glucocorticoids and thecis-acting insulin response sequence (IRS, −416/−407) in the genetically obese db/db mouse model, we generated crosses between C57BL/KsJ-db/+ mice and transgenic mice that express −460 or −2000 base pairs of the rat PEPCK gene promoter containing an intact or mutated IRS, linked to a reporter gene. Transgenic mice expressing the intact PEPCK(460)-CRP (C-reactive protein) transgene bred to near homozygosity at thedb locus were obese, hyperinsulinemic, and developed fasting hyperglycemia (389 ± 26 mg/100 ml) between 4 and 10 weeks of age. Levels of CRP reporter gene expression were increased 2-fold despite severe hyperinsulinemia compared with non-diabetic non-obese transgenic mice. Reporter gene expression was also increased 2-fold in transgenic obese diabetic db/db mice bearing a mutation in the IRS, −2000(IRS)-hGx, compared with non-obese non-diabetic transgenic 2000(IRS)-hGx mice. Treatment of obese diabeticdb/db transgenic mice with the glucocorticoid receptor blocker RU 486 decreased plasma glucose by 50% and reduced PEPCK, GLUT2, glucose-6-phosphatase, tyrosine aminotransferase, CRP, and hGx reporter gene expression to levels similar to those of non-obese normoglycemic transgenic mice. Taken together, these results establish that −460 bp of 5′-flanking sequence is sufficient to mediate the induction of PEPCK gene transcription in genetically obesedb/db mice during the development of hyperglycemia. The results further demonstrate that the mechanism underlying increased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in thedb/db mouse requires the action of glucocorticoids and occurs independently of factors acting through the PEPCK IRS (−416/−407) promoter binding site.

Hyperglycemia develops via mechanisms that are not understood completely; however, a classic defect involves the inability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production. Most isotopic studies in man and rodents suggest that increased gluconeogenesis is a major source of increased glucose production in type II diabetes (NIDDM) (3Consoli A. Nurjhan N. Capani F. Gerich J. Diabetes. 1991; 38: 550-557Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Consoli A. Nurjhan N. Reilly J.J. Bier D.M. Gerich J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 2038-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); however, with rare exceptions, the primary mechanisms for increased gluconeogenesis at the molecular level are unknown (5Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1980; 30: 148-162Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 6Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 7Gidh-Jain M. Takeda J. Xu L.Z. Lange A.J.

Gluconeogenesis is controlled from seconds to minutes by the delivery of substrates and by hormone-mediated changes in the activity of several key gluconeogenic enzymes. In the long term, usually involving hours to days, gluconeogenesis is regulated by the synthesis rate of gluconeogenic enzymes at the level of gene expression. In the liver, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate and is considered the major rate-controlling enzyme in the pathway of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, lactate, and alanine (8Hanson R.W. Garber A.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1972; 25: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Normally, insulin rapidly and substantially inhibits transcription of the PEPCK gene in liver and in rat hepatoma cells. However, in several animal models of obesity and NIDDM, gluconeogenesis and PEPCK mRNA are increased by 2–3-fold over non-diabetic animals, despite circulating insulin levels that may be 4–10-fold greater than non-diabetic controls (9Shafrir E.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 735-740PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a defect(s) in insulin regulation of gene expression. In addition to abnormalities in insulin receptor signaling, defects (genetic or acquired) in regulatory proteins that control gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of type II diabetes. We found previously that deleting the glucocorticoid response unit (GRU; see Refs. 12Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and 13Mitchell J. Noisin E. Hall R. O'Brien R.M. Imai E. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar), located between bases −455 and −349 upstream from the transcription start site of the PEPCK gene promoter in transgenic mice, prevented reporter gene induction in mice made diabetic with streptozotocin (14Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12952-12957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a mutation in the cAMP regulatory element, located between positions −93 and −86, had no effect on the diabetic response of the PEPCK promoter (21McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22371-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GRU (Fig. 1) is ≅100 bp and consists of two glucocorticoid receptor binding sites GR1 and GR2, located between positions −395 and −349, flanking two accessory factor elements termed AF1 and AF2. AF1 (−455 to −431) is a retinoic acid response element, whereas the AF2 site (−420 to −403) contains the insulin response sequence (IRS, −416 to −407) believed to mediate the negative effects of insulin on the PEPCK promoter (15O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although the protein(s) that mediate the effects of insulin have not been identified, it is suggested that insulin may inhibit PEPCK gene transcription by altering the binding and/or activation of a putative insulin response factor(s) that occupies the IRS (16Lucas P.C. O'Brien R.M. Mitchell J.A. Davis C.M. Imai E. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Yamasaki T. Noisin E.L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30419-30428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a defect in the expression, binding, and/or phosphorylation of nuclear proteins acting through the IRS might be expected to impair the ability of insulin to suppress PEPCK gene transcription, thereby leading to increased gluconeogenesis and NIDDM. In an attempt to explore the role of glucocorticoids and the IRS binding site to increased PEPCK gene transcription in a model of type II diabetes, we generated a cross between transgenic mice expressing 2.0 or 0.46 kb of PEPCK regulatory sequences containing a mutated or intact IRS into the C57BL/KsJ-db/+ mouse. Our results indicate that increased PEPCK reporter gene transcription parallels the onset of hyperglycemia in the genetically obesedb/db mouse, despite severe hyperinsulinemia. The overexpression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes is driven by glucocorticoids and is independent of the cis-acting IRS sequence of the PEPCK promoter. ATP, CTP, GTP, yeast tRNA, proteinase K, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and GeneScreen Plus were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. RNase-free DNase I (1000 units) was obtained from Promega. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. The following segments of DNA were used as hybridization probes. PEPCK corresponded to a 1.1-kb PstI-PstI fragment from the 3′-end of PEPCK cDNA. The C-reactive protein gene (CRP) corresponded to a 6.2-kb genomic fragment containing the entire rabbit CRP gene. Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and corresponded to a 0.43-kbBamHI-BamHI fragment of human cDNA. β-Actin corresponded to a 1.4-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of mouse cDNA. hGx probe was a 640-bp SmaI-SmaI fragment from the genomic human growth hormone gene. GLUT2 was a 1.7-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of the 3′-end of rat cDNA (provided by Christopher B. Newgard, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase) probe was a 1.1-kbXbaI-PstI fragment of human cDNA (provided by Dr. Janice Yang Chou, Genetics Branch, NICHD, National Institutes of Health). c-fos probe was aHindIII-BamHI 2.2-kb fragment from rat cDNA (provided by Tom Curran, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, NJ). 18 S ribosomal cDNA was a 5.8-kb HindIII-HindIII digest from rat cDNA. Anti-insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and insulin receptor β subunit (IR-β) were obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). PI3-kinase (p85) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Two transgenic mouse lines were used to study the effects of obesity and diabetes on expression from the PEPCK promoter. The first utilized homozygous transgenic C57B6/SJL mice (a hybrid of C57BLK × SJL) containing sequences from −460 to +73 bp of the rat cytosolic PEPCK gene ligated to the rabbit CRP gene, PEPCK(460)-CRP, obtained from previously established transgenic lines (Dr. D. Samols, Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University). The production and characterization of PEPCK(460)-CRP transgenic mice have been described in detail previously (18Lin C.S. Xia D. Yun J.S Wagner T. Magnuson T. Mold C. Samols D. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 521-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgene expression in this model is directed by the −460 bp of the 5′-regulatory region of the PEPCK promoter and has been found to contain all of the necessary elements for developmental, hormonal (including diabetes), and dietary control in the liver in a manner similar to the endogenous PEPCK gene promoter (14Friedman J.E.

The second line of transgenic mice, termed PEPCK(IRS)-hGx, utilized a −2000-bpSacI-BglII 5′-flanking region of the rat cytosolic form of the PEPCK promoter containing a block mutation in the IRS (−416/−406). The larger −2000 promoter regulatory region was chosen to study regulation of reporter gene expression in adipose tissue that requires elements outside of −460 for tissue-specific expression (21McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22371-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Short M.K.

Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1396-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The PEPCK promoter was ligated to hGx. The hGx reporter gene contains a 2.2-kb BamHI-EcoRV sequence with a frameshift mutation in exon 5 of hGx, affecting the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acids, resulting in a mutated hGx gene that does not produce active growth hormone (24Idzera R. Behringer R.R. Theisen M. Huggenvik J.I. McKnight G.S. Binster R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5154-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, and present results). Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analysis, using a random primed 32P-labeled 2.2-kbBamHI-EcoRV hGx gene fragment to probe samples of DNA isolated from mouse tails (25Laird P.W. Ziderveld A. Liners K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Founder transgenic mice were bred to non-transgenic B6/SJL mice to generate male and female heterozygous mice. Heterozygous male and females from each line were bred to homozygosity and propagated up to 8–10 generations. Three transgenic lines carrying an intact IRS, PEPCK(−2000)-hGx, and three lines carrying a mutation in the IRS of the PEPCK promoter, PEPCK(IRS)-hGx, were studied. Basal reporter gene expression was similar in livers of mice carrying the intact PEPCK promoter compared with mice with a mutation in the IRS. hGx mRNA expression was characterized by Northern blot analysis in all six lines in response to feeding a high carbohydrate diet (decreased expression) or following a high protein diet (increased expression). There were no significant differences in response to dietary carbohydrate or protein in three lines of mice carrying the PEPCK(IRS)-hGx gene compared with induction and suppression of hGx in transgenic mice expressing the intact promoter. 2P. Lechner, J. E. Friedman, and R. W. Hanson, manuscript in preparation. To study the effects of obesity and type II diabetes on promoter function, mice homozygous for the autosomal recessive db gene containing either intact or mutated promoter were produced using the breeding procedure outlined previously for outcrossingdb/db mice (26Leiter E.H. Prochazka M. Schultz L.D. J. Immunol. 1987; 10: 3224-3229Google Scholar). Because the recessivedb mutation produces sterility in homozygotes, it was propagated by mating db/+ heterozygotes with homozygous transgenic mice. Based on the average basal level of expression and results from dietary manipulation, a representative transgenic line containing the intact promoter or a mutation in the IRS was chosen for breeding the PEPCK transgene onto the db/dbbackground. Female C57BL/KsJ-m/−db/+ anddb/db mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories at 4 weeks of age and housed within the Case Western Reserve University animal resource facility. To produce homozygousdb/db mice with the desired transgene,db/+ breeder females were mated with homozygous transgenic PEPCK(460)-CRP or PEPCK(IRS)-hGx males, and the F1 offspring were mated with known db/+ mice. Because the reporter gene is expressed in heterozygous transgenic mice, all F1 offspring expressed the reporter gene; however, only one out of four contained thedb/+ locus. By test-crossing selected F1 offspring with breeder db/+ mice and observing the appearance of obesity and diabetes in the F2 generation, we identified transgenic mice carrying the db/+ locus. The compound db/+ transgenic offspring were back-crossed with known db/+ breeder mice up to five generations. Offspring were screened for the presence of the PEPCK transgene using DNA obtained from tail biopsies. DNA was extracted and Southern blotting performed using a random primed32P-labeled probe for identifying either CRP or hGX. Mice had free access to standard rat chow. Body weight was measured weekly beginning at 4 weeks of age, and fed and fasting plasma glucose were measured in venous blood from tail vein or the retro-orbital sinus as standard parameters for characterizing the appearance of the obese-diabetic phenotype. Age- and sex-matched transgenic non-obese littermates (designated as +/? at the db locus) were used as controls. RU 486 (also known as RU 38486 and mifepristone) was kindly supplied by Dr. D. Martini of Roussel Uclaf (Paris). RU 486 was dissolved at a concentration of 25 μg/μl in 100% ethanol and an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl. We studied a series of dosages of 10, 25, and 30 μg/g body weight in 12-week-old maledb/+, db/db, and transgenic mice. Mice were given food and water ad libitum before receiving an intraperitoneal injection of the vehicle or RU 486 at 4:30 p.m. and a second injection at 8:00 a.m. Vehicle- and RU 486-treated mice were killed by cervical dislocation at 12:30 p.m., and 0.5 ml of blood was withdrawn immediately from the abdominal aorta for insulin and corticosterone assay. Preliminary experiments showed that a dose of RU 486 at 25 μg/g of body weight had no effect on food intake overnight in db/db mice and showed a maximal effect on lowering blood glucose (data not shown). The liver was removed and 200 mg frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated from frozen mouse liver by the guanidine thiocynanate-phenol method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis total RNA samples (20 μg) were size fractionated in 0.9% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After washing with 2 × SSC, the filter was dried and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C in Church buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.7% SDS, 0.25 mol/liter Na2HPO4, pH 8.0). Membranes were hybridized with probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of ≈109 cpm/μg DNA using a random primed labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). After hybridization, the filters were washed with 2 × SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature; and 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Membranes were placed in contact with X-AR05 film (Eastman Kodak), and the image intensity of the autoradiogram was determined using a Sci-Scan 5000 laser densitometer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Levels of specific transcripts were estimated by quantitating probe-specific signals. Hybridization to β-actin or 18 S RNA was used to correct for differences in RNA content/loading. Mice were anesthetized with chloralose (40 mg/kg), and the liver was removed, minced coarsely, and homogenized immediately in a 10 × volume of solubilization buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 34 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a Polytron PTA 20S generator at maximum speed for 30 s. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 65,000 rpm at 4 °C in a model Ti-70 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc.) for 60 min to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was used for analysis. Protein was measured using the Bradford procedure (Pierce Biochemical). For IR-β, IRS-1, and PI3-kinase, 40 μg of protein was treated with Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, heated in a boiling water bath for 4 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7% Tris-acrylamide gel using a Bio-Rad mini-protein gel apparatus at 100 volts for 1 h. Proteins were electrotransferred from the gel to nitrocellulose at 90 V (constant) for 1 h using a mini-transfer apparatus. Nonspecific protein binding to the filter was blocked using 5% milk, 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20. The polyvinylidene difluoride filter was incubated with antibodies to IR-β (1.5 μg/ml), IRS-1 (1.5 μg/ml), or PI3-kinase (0.75 μg/ml) diluted in blocking buffer for 4 h at 22 °C, followed by extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris + Tween 20). At the end of the final wash, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h at 22 °C and washed again before exposing the membranes to enhanced chemiluminesence reagent (Amersham). Autoradiography was carried out using Kodak X-AR x-ray film. The specific band intensities were quantitated by optical densitometry using a Digiscan scanner (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for integrating the autoradiographic signals. Blood glucose levels were determined in samples using an Accu-Check II glucose monitor (Boehringer) and a glucose-oxidase assay kit (Sigma). The plasma immunoreactive insulin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco, Inc., St. Louis) using rat insulin as standard. The circulating level of rabbit CRP in transgenic mice was determined in blood samples collected by retro-orbital bleeding and a radial immunodiffusion assay in agarose, as described previously (18Lin C.S. Xia D. Yun J.S Wagner T. Magnuson T. Mold C. Samols D. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 521-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a goat anti-rabbit CRP antiserum specific for native rabbit CRP. This method is sensitive to levels as low as 1–2 μg/ml and does not detect murine CRP. Plasma levels of corticosterone were assayed using using a rat corticosterone radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Glycerol was measured in deproteinized plasma samples by enzymatic determination using glycerol kinase-coupled with glycerophosphate dehydrogenase according to the conditions supplied by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). All data are presented as means ± S.E. Specific mRNA levels were calculated by expressing the effects of perturbations as a percentage of readings in paired samples from non-treated or vehicle-treated control samples in the same Northern blot or transcription assay after correction for loading differences with signal from β-actin or ribosomal mRNA. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance between treatments or groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. We introduced two separate PEPCK promoter-reporter genes from transgenic C57B6/SJL mice into the C57BL/KsJ-db strain, the background strain in which the db gene interacts to produce diabetes, obesity, and hyperinsulinemia. Data presented in TableI show the effects of the experimental cross on the development of obesity and diabetes in the PEPCK(460)-CRP,db/db mice. After five successive back-crosses between transgenic db/+ mice with breeder db/+ mice, more than 100 progeny were produced from which a group of 10 male transgenic db/db and 8 male transgenic +/? mice were obtained for analysis. The transgenic PEPCK(460)-CRP,db/db mice demonstrated a developmental pattern of diabetes similar to that of C57BL/KsJ-db/dbmice (9Shafrir E. Shafrir E. Renold A.E. Frontiers in Diabetes Research: Lessons Learned from Animal Diabetes. 2nd Ed. John Libbey and Co., 1988: 304-315Google Scholar, 28Roesler W.J. Khandelwal R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 92: 99-106Google Scholar). At four weeks of age, PEPCK(460)-CRP,db/db mice were significantly heavier (p < 0.01) and had a 12-fold greater insulin level than their lean transgenic PEPCK(460)-CRP, +/? littermates. However, plasma glucose and CRP (from the PEPCK promoter) were similar in transgenic PEPCK(460)-CRP, db/db and PEPCK(460)-CRP, +/? mice, suggesting that higher plasma insulin levels in PEPCK(460)-CRP, db/db mice did not suppress PEPCK or CRP gene expression but were still capable of preventing hyperglycemia. At 10 weeks of age, hyperinsulinemia increased further by 1.75-fold (p < 0.01) in transgenic PEPCK(460)-CRP,db/db mice compared with 4-week-old PEPCK(460)-CRP, db/db mice. Fasting plasma glucose increased 2.8-fold (p < 0.01) above levels at 4 four weeks, and the levels of plasma CRP increased by 1.7-fold (p < 0.01), suggesting a transition to a state of hepatic insulin resistance and a failure of hyperinsulinemia to suppress expression from the PEPCK promoter.Table IIntroduction of PEPCK(460)-CRP transgene into C57BL/KsJ-db/+ mice: effect of maturation on body weight, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and CRP levels in transgenic miceGenotypeAgeBody weightInsulinGlucoseCRPnweeksgng/mlmg/dlμg/mlPEPCK-CRP, +/?

https://openalex.org/W2072208461,"Dystrophin, the protein disrupted in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, is one of several related proteins that are key components of the submembrane cytoskeleton. Three dystrophin-related proteins (utrophin, dystrophin-related protein-2 (DRP2), and dystrobrevin) have been described. Here, we identify a human gene on chromosome 2p22–23 that encodes a novel protein, β-dystrobrevin, with significant homology to the other known dystrobrevin (now termed α-dystrobrevin). Sequence alignments including this second dystrobrevin strongly support the concept that two distinct subfamilies exist within the dystrophin family, one composed of dystrophin, utrophin, and DRP2 and the other composed of α- and β-dystrobrevin. The possibility that members of each subfamily form distinct protein complexes was examined by immunopurifying dystrobrevins and dystrophin. A β-dystrobrevin antibody recognized a protein of the predicted size (71 kDa) that copurified with the dystrophin short form, Dp71. Thus, like α-dystrobrevin, β-dystrobrevin is likely to associate directly with dystrophin. α- and β-dystrobrevins failed to copurify with each other, however. These results suggest that members of the dystrobrevin subfamily form heterotypic associations with dystrophin and raise the possibility that pairing of a particular dystrobrevin with dystrophin may be regulated, thereby providing a mechanism for assembly of distinct submembrane protein complexes. Dystrophin, the protein disrupted in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, is one of several related proteins that are key components of the submembrane cytoskeleton.

These results suggest that members of the dystrobrevin subfamily form heterotypic associations with dystrophin and raise the possibility that pairing of a particular dystrobrevin with dystrophin may be regulated, thereby providing a mechanism for assembly of distinct submembrane protein complexes. Positional cloning of the gene altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulted in the description of dystrophin, a key component of the membrane skeleton (reviewed in Ref. 1Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar and 2Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Kunkel L.M. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Dystrophin is a large protein of 427 kDa with an NH2-terminal actin binding domain, a central rod region composed of spectrin-like repeats, and cysteine-rich (CR) 1The abbreviations used are: CR, cysteine-rich; CT, carboxyl-terminal; Ab, polyclonal antibody; CRCT, cysteine-rich COOH-terminal region of dystrophin; DAP, dystrophin-associated protein; DRP, dystrophin-related protein; DUR, dystrobrevin-unique region; EST, expressed sequence tag; mAb, monoclonal antibody; contig, group of overlapping clones; kb, kilobases; vr, variable regions. and carboxyl-terminal (CT) domains. In skeletal muscle, dystrophin binds cortical actin via its NH2-terminal region (3Winder S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and several spectrin-like repeats (4Rybakaova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The CR and CT domains of dystrophin bind a complex of membrane proteins collectively termed the dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) (reviewed in Ref. 5Tinsley J.M. Blake D.E. Zuellig R.A. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8307-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Several DAPs are transmembrane glycoproteins, including β-dystroglycan, which binds directly to dystrophin and α-dystroglycan, an extracellular laminin binding protein. Thus, as a whole, the dystrophin glycoprotein complex is thought to link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, thereby stabilizing the sarcolemma during repeated cycles of muscle contraction and relaxation. Consistent with this structural role, mutations in dystrophin and in certain DAPs are the primary defects leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and limb girdle muscular dystrophies, respectively (1Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 6Bonnemann C.G. McNally E.M. Kunkel L.M. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1996; 8: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dystrophin is only one member of a growing family of related proteins. In part, the complexity of this family results from the production of several products from the dystrophin gene. The use of alternative promoters within the dystrophin gene yields proteins that lack the amino-terminal actin binding domain and many or all of the spectrin-like repeats (2Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Kunkel L.M. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One form, Dp71, is composed of only the CR and CT domains. Additional complexity stems from the finding that several proteins related to dystrophin are encoded by separate genes. Of these, utrophin is most closely related to dystrophin. The basic domain structure of utrophin is quite similar to dystrophin, although it has two fewer spectrin-like repeats (reviewed in Ref.7), and it is thought to bind a similar complex of proteins (8Matsumura K. Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 360: 588-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In contrast to dystrophin, which is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, utrophin is broadly distributed and thus may serve a function similar to that of dystrophin in nonmuscle cell types (9Kramarcy N.R. Vidal A. Froehner S.C. Sealock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2870-2876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Khurana T.S. Watkins S.C. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Dystrophin-related protein-2 (DRP-2) is closely related to dystrophin and utrophin but is encoded by a separate gene and contains only two spectrin-like repeats in addition to the CR and CT domains (11Roberts R.G. Freeman T.C. Kendall E. Vetrie D.L. Dixon A.K. Shaw-Smith C. Bone Q. Bobrow M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A fourth, more distant member of the dystrophin family is dystrobrevin, first described as a tyrosine-phosphorylated 87-kDa protein inTorpedo electric organ (12Carr C. Fischbach G.D. Cohen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Torpedodystrobrevin is composed of CR and CT domains with modest homology to dystrophin and a unique COOH-terminal tail containing putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites. It has no spectrin-like repeats. Several forms of dystrobrevin, generated by alternative splicing, have been identified in mammalian tissues (14Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Khurana T.S. Cohen J.B. Kunkel L.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Three variable regions within the coding sequence undergo tissue-specific splicing, generating forms that are specifically expressed in muscle. In addition, splicing produces a form of dystrobrevin that lacks the unique tail. Dystrobrevin is found in dystrophin preparations and probably interacts directly with dystrophin (17Suzuki A. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 2Sadoulet-Puccio, H. M., Rajala, M. and Kunkel, L. M., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., in press. Thus, dystrobrevin is not only a dystrophin-related protein but also a dystrophin-associated protein. The function of dystrophin, utrophin, and their associated proteins is probably not limited to the structural role proposed for the dystrophin complex in skeletal muscle. Dystrophin expressed in the central nervous system is highly concentrated at the postsynaptic membrane (18Lidov H.G. Byers T.J. Watkins S.C. Kunkel L.M. Nature. 1990; 348: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), where its loss is associated with altered synaptic transmission (19Fitzgerald K.M. Cibis G.W. Giambrone S.A. Harris D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and, in some cases, nonprogressive cognitive impairment (1Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). At the neuromuscular synapse, utrophin is colocalized with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the crests of the postjunctional folds (20Bewick G.S. Nicholson L.V. Young C. O'Donnell E. Slater C.R. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas dystrophin is most concentrated in the bottoms of the folds along with sodium channels (20Bewick G.S. Nicholson L.V. Young C. O'Donnell E. Slater C.R. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Byers T.J. Kunkel L.M. Watkins S.C. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, even within this single synapse, dystrophin and utrophin are likely to serve quite different roles. Possible functions for these complexes at this synapse include involvement in agrin-induced clustering and anchoring of acetylcholine receptors (23Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S.

Neurosci. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 28Sharp A.A. Caldwell J.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6775-6783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the postsynaptic membrane. However, mice lacking both utrophin and dystrophin show surprisingly subtle abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction (29Grady R.M. Teng H. Nichol M.C. Cunningham J.C. Wilkinson R.S. Sanes J.S. Cell. 1997; 90: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar,30Deconinck A.E. Rafael J.A. Skinner J.A. Brown S.C. Potter A.C. Metzinger L. Watt D.J. Dickson G.

Thus, although each dystrophin-related protein may be involved in the assembly of a particular membrane specialization, definitive tests for this proposal have yet to be done. The function of dystrophin and related proteins likely depends on the proteins associated with them. One group of DAPs, the syntrophins, are a multigene family composed of three closely related isoforms (α1, β1, and β2) (31Yang B. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6040-6044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Adams M.E. Butler M.H. Dwyer T.M. Peters M.F. Murnane A.A. Froehner S.C.

S. A. 1994; 91: 4446-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Syntrophins are thought to be modular adaptor proteins that bind directly to dystrophin family members and in turn recruit signaling proteins such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (34Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In an attempt to expand the repertoire of the dystrophin-related protein complex, we sought to identify new members of the dystrophin family that bind syntrophins. Using the syntrophin binding motif identified in dystrophin and dystrobrevin (see Ref. 35Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Peters M.F. Gee S.H. Froehner S.C. Bennett V. Cytoskeletal Regulation of Membrane Function. Rockefeller University Press, New York1997: 197-207Google Scholar) as a probe to search sequence data bases, we discovered a new dystrophin-related protein, β-dystrobrevin. The same protein was discovered independently by data base searches with the entire α-dystrobrevin sequence. Sequence comparisons with the previously identified α-dystrobrevin support the idea that the dystrobrevins comprise a distinct subfamily within the dystrophin family. Since β-dystrobrevin, like α-dystrobrevin, associates with dystrophin, we propose a model in which dystrobrevin subfamily members form heterotypic associations with dystrophin subfamily members. Both strands of the clones containing the sequences reported in expressed sequence tags (ESTs) R15062 (clone 29483), R38788 (clone 24544), H16100 (clone 48688), H26850 (clone 158283), and H42052 (clone 182424) (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) were sequenced and found to encode most of β-dystrobrevin, lacking only the 5′ coding region. The remaining coding region was obtained by amplification of adapter-ligated human liver cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the Expand high fidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Boehringer Mannheim). Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into Bluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and multiple clones were sequenced. A human adult brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened with a 650-base pair probe generated by polymerase chain reaction of EST R15062 with the primer pair 5′-CAGAAGCAGGAAACGTGACTC and 5′-CTCCTCTGCTAACCTCTGTC. Three overlapping clones corresponding to the 5′ coding region were sequenced. All sequences were determined using a model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, automated DNA sequencing facility or the MRRC Automated Sequencing Core Facility. Sequences were analyzed with the aid of a DNAStar Lasergene computer software package (Madison, WI). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was done according to standard protocols (36Lichter P.

Three genomic phage clones covering the first coding exon and flanking introns (HGL2, HGL10, HGL19) and two genomic phages covering the region homologous to exon 18 in α-dystrobrevin (39Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Feener C.A. Schaid D.J. Thibodeau S.N. Michels V.M. Kunkel L.M. Neurogenetics. 1997; 1: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the flanking introns (HGL9, HGL18) were isolated from a human genomic library. Phage DNA was isolated by a cesium gradient and treated with RNase. DNA from phage clones HGL2, HGL10, and HGL19 were pooled as were phages HGL9 and HGL18. 1 μg of phage DNA pool was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP by nick translation, as described previously (36Lichter P.

Kunkel L.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Slides were examined on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Visual inspection of the slides through a triple band-pass filter (Omega, Brattleboro, VT) allowed detection of the DNA hybridization signal over the 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstained nuclei. Yeast artificial chromosome analysis was done for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene by screening a pooled human yeast artificial chromosome array (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL). Primer pairs from the first coding exon and its upstream intron (forward primer 5′-AGTTAGAAGTAAGTCAGCCCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGCACGCATTTCTATGAACAGC-3′), giving a 400-base pair product and from exon 18 and its downstream intron (forward primer 5′-CACCACATACATCGCCCACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGAGGAGACAAAGCCCAAAGGACA-3′), giving a 330-base pair product, were used. Polymerase chain reactions were performed with a 0.01 volume of [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dGTP to label the product, which was visualized by being run on an 8% acrylamide gel and exposed to film. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed according to the manufacturer's protocol using a random primed 32P-labeled probe containing the entire coding region of β-dystrobrevin. To prepare polyclonal antibodies (Abs), synthetic dystrobrevin peptides with a terminal cysteine were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits according to standard methods (Covance Inc., Denver, PA). Ab βDB344 was prepared against the peptide DTMVSHMSSGVPTPTKSVLDSPS-COOH corresponding to amino acids 344–366 of β-dystrobrevin, which are highly divergent from α-dystrobrevin. Ab αDB2 was prepared against a peptide corresponding to the unique COOH-terminal 10 residues of α-dystrobrevin-2 (COOH-GVSYVPYCRS) (14Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J.

Since this region is identical between the human α- and β-dystrobrevins, Ab DB433 is likely to recognize products of both dystrobrevin genes. Antibodies were affinity purified from serum using peptide coupled to Affi-Gel 10 or 15 (Bio-Rad). All other antibodies have been previously described. The syntrophin monoclonal antibody (mAb) SYN1351 (40Froehner S.C. Murnane A.A. Tobler M. Peng H.B. Sealock R. J.

To identify new syntrophin binding proteins, we searched protein data bases with a sequence corresponding to the consensus syntrophin binding motif (reviewed in Ref. 35Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Peters M.F. Gee S.H. Froehner S.C. Bennett V. Cytoskeletal Regulation of Membrane Function. Rockefeller University Press, New York1997: 197-207Google Scholar). Of the many ESTs identified, several encode a protein that is homologous to, but distinct from, known dystrophin-related proteins. Subcloning and complete sequencing of these ESTs confirmed that they encode a protein homologous to the carboxyl-terminal half of dystrobrevin. The additional sequence 5′ of the EST was obtained by both 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends and isolation of additional clones from a human brain cDNA library (Fig.1 A). The combined cDNAs (2.4 kilobase pairs) contain an 1,881-nucleotide open reading frame with the position of the first ATG closely corresponding to that of the first ATG in the previously described dystrobrevin (Fig. 1 B) (13Wagner K.R.

Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and, if utilized, would produce a protein lacking the first 11 amino acids. However, it seems likely that the sequence upstream of the second ATG is translated, since the protein sequence is highly conserved with the previously described dystrobrevins (see below) (13Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol.

The encoded protein of 627 amino acids (Fig.1 B) has a calculated molecular mass of 71,362.5 Da and a predicted isoelectric point of 7.88. The entire amino acid sequence is 68% identical with human dystrobrevin but much less related to dystrophin and utrophin (see below). Thus, we have named this newly identified protein β-dystrobrevin and suggest that the previously identified dystrobrevin (14Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Khurana T.S. Cohen J.B. Kunkel L.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) be called α-dystrobrevin. α- and β-dystrobrevins have highly similar NH2-terminal regions, with conservation extending throughout their sequences. The most noticeable differences occur in the COOH-terminal truncations. The largest of the dystrobrevin proteins is α-dystrobrevin-1, which is composed of 557 amino acids homologous to the CRCT region of dystrophin plus an additional 188 amino acids with no homology to other proteins. This dystrobrevin-unique region (DUR) contains sites for tyrosine phosphorylation near the COOH terminus (13Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a feature consistent with the observation thatTorpedo dystrobrevin is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (13Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In α-dystrobrevin-2, the entire DUR is removed by alternative splicing (14Blake D.J.

Cohen J.B. Kunkel L.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). β-Dystrobrevin contains only the proximal half of the DUR, and as a consequence, lacks the tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The work of several laboratories has defined a core region of approximately 16 amino acids as the site in dystrobrevin that binds syntrophins (Refs. 17Suzuki A. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J.

Cytoskeletal Regulation of Membrane Function. Rockefeller University Press, New York1997: 197-207Google Scholar). The sequence of this motif is identical in all mammalian dystrobrevins (α-dystrobrevins from human and mouse and the human β-dystrobrevin described here) and in Torpedo dystrobrevin (13Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol.

Genet. 1996; 5: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 5 A). Thus, it seems likely that each of the dystrobrevins binds syntrophins. In comparison with the full-length β-dystrobrevin coding sequence, several classes of ESTs could be identified, based on small in-frame deletions in the coding region. These variable regions in β-dystrobrevin clones were compared with the previously described variable regions (vr1–vr3) in α-dystrobrevin (Fig. 2 A). In α-dystrobrevin, vr1 denotes alternative splicing of exon 9, which encodes three amino acids. The corresponding three amino acids are absent from all β-dystrobrevin clones examined. Additional β-dystrobrevin clones were identified that corresponded to α-dystrobrevin splice forms in which vr2 and vr3 are absent. Finally, a previously undescribed variable region (vr4) was identified in multiple β-dystrobrevin clones in the region encoding the DUR. Each of the variable regions in β-dystrobrevin corresponds precisely to exon boundaries in the α-dystrobrevin gene (Fig. 2, Aand B). This suggests that the multiple β-dystrobrevin coding regions identified at vr2, vr3, and vr4 are generated by alternative splicing similar to α-dystrobrevin. In vr1 and part of vr3, it is unclear if the region corresponding to exons 9 or 11A in α-dystrobrevin is deleted from the β-dystrobrevin gene or if this form is expressed at low levels. Further characterization of the β-dystrobrevin gene will be required to determine if additional β-dystrobrevin coding regions exist. Northern blot analysis with a hybridization probe corresponding to the coding region of β-dystrobrevin revealed that all tissues examined express detectable β-dystrobrevin transcripts (Fig. 3). A major transcript of ∼2.5 kb is highly expressed in brain, kidney, and pancreas. In addition, low levels of additional transcripts of 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, and 7.0 kb were found in skeletal muscle. Heart and placenta expressed additional β-dystrobrevin transcripts of 2.0 and 1.4 kb, respectively. The β-dystrobrevin gene was localized to chromosome 2p22–23 by two independent methods.

In gel mobility shift assays, COUP-TF bound as an apparent dimer to ERE and ERE half-sites. COUP-TF bound to an ERE half-site with high affinity,K d = 1.24 nm. In contrast, ER did not bind a single ERE half-site.

Direct interaction of COUP-TF with ER was indicated by GST “pull-down” and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The nature of the ER ligand influenced COUP-TF-ERE half-site binding. When ER was liganded by the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), COUP-TF-half-site interaction decreased.

Co-transfection of ER-expressing MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with an expression vector for COUP-TFI resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of E2-induced expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of three tandem copies of EREc38. The ability of COUP-TF to bind specifically to EREs and half-sites, to interact with ER, and to inhibit E2-induced gene expression suggests COUP-TF regulates ER action by both direct DNA binding competition and through protein-protein interactions.

The physiological sequelae of estrogen action involve a passive diffusion of ligands, e.g. estradiol (E2), into cells and the binding of E2 with high affinity and specificity to ER in the nucleus of target cells. Ligand binding initiates a series of steps forming an “activated,” homodimeric E2·ER complex that binds with high affinity to specific DNA sequences, estrogen response elements (ERE). Analysis of the 5′-regulatory regions of numerous estrogen-responsive genes revealed a 13-bp palindromic ERE consensus sequence: 5′-GGTCAnnnTGACC-3′ (EREc, where n = any nucleotide in the center spacer region). EREc is the minimal ERE that conferred estrogen responsiveness to reporter genes analyzed by transfection assay (2Klein-Hitpass L. Schorpp M. Wagner U. Ryffel G.U. Cell. 1986; 46: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 3Berry M. Nunez A.M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of the ER DNA binding domain when bound to DNA showed that ER contacts both the 5′-C and A in the more extended palindrome 5′-CAGGTCAnnn-TGACCTG-3′ (4Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), indicating that a longer inverted repeat (IR) may stabilize ER binding. Most estrogen-responsive genes identified to date contain one or more imperfect EREs or multiple copies of the ERE half-site rather than EREc (5Kato S. Sasaki J.H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The latter genes are also regulated by class II nuclear receptors,e.g. thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and orphan receptors, e.g. estrogen-related receptor (ERR), that bind to direct and inverted repeats (DR and IR) of the ERE half-site 5′-AGGTCA-3′ (6Glass C.K.

Recent studies demonstrated that ER also binds various spaced DR and IR of the ERE half-site motif, albeit with significantly lower affinity when compared with ER binding to EREc (5Kato S.

Once bound to an ERE, the precise mechanism of transcriptional activation, or repression, by the ER is unknown. ER-mediated effects on transcription are thought to involve interaction between the DNA-bound ER and transcription factors, coactivator proteins, e.g. ERAP160; RIP140, SPT6; SRC-1; TIF1, TIF2, or components of the TATA binding complex including TFIIB and TATA-box binding protein (reviewed in Ref. 9Horwitz K. Jackson T. Bain D. Richer J. Takimoto G. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Two distinct ER regions are involved in these interactions as follows: an N-terminal, ligand-independent activation function 1 (AF-1), and a C-terminal, ligand-dependent AF-2 (10Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 11Tora L. White J. Bron C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The total and relative activity of each AF varies with the promoter and cell type, indicating that the function of each AF is mediated by interaction with cell-specific proteins (12Baniahmad C.

In sum, our results indicate a critical role for sequences flanking the ERE and the relative helix orientation of the EREs on ER binding affinity. We also showed that the ER ligand modulates ERE binding parameters in vitro and that the purity of the ER preparation influences the affinity of ERE binding. Highly purified ER binds to EREs with significantly lower affinity than partially purified ER, i.e. for E2-ER K d = 1.74versus 0.24 nm (25Anolik J.H. Klinge C.M. Brolly C.L. Bambara R.A. Hilf R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The latter result implies that proteins present in a partially purified preparation of bovine uterine ER facilitate high affinity binding of ER to EREs. Here we identified COUP-TF as a constituent of the partially purified bovine uterine ER·ERE binding complex. COUP-TF is an orphan nuclear receptor that binds to DR or IR of the ERE half-site as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with RXR (26Qiu Y. Krishnan V. Piereira F.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have examined the ability of COUP-TF to bind full and half-site EREs in vitro and to modulate the expression of an estrogen-responsive reporter gene in transiently transfected ER expression MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1073-1081PubMed Google Scholar) by double digestion with KpnI andSacI and cloned directly into the upstream multiple cloning site in pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega). This places the ERE 83 nucleotides upstream of the SV40 promotor. The constructs containing EREc38 are called pGL3–1EREc38, 2EREc38, and 3EREc38 with the number indicating the number of tandem copies of EREc38. ER was partially purified from calf uterus by heparin-agarose (Affi-Gel heparin, Bio-Rad) and ERE-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (30Klinge C.M. Bambara R.A. Zain S. Hilf R. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2852-2859PubMed Google Scholar, 31Peale Jr., F.V. Ishibe Y. Klinge C.M. Zain S. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8671-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ER was liganded with either 17β-[2,3,6,7-3H]estradiol ([3H]E2, 84.1 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA), or [ring-3H]tamoxifen aziridine ([3H]TAz, 23 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). ER concentration was determined by adsorption to hydroxyapatite (32Pavlik E.J. Coulson P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1976; 7: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All receptor concentrations refer to dimeric ER (i.e. with two molecules of bound ligand). De-salted, ammonium sulfate-precipitated, calf uterine high speed cytosol (30Klinge C.M. Bambara R.A. Zain S. Hilf R. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2852-2859PubMed Google Scholar) was loaded onto a Yellow 86 affinity column (Sigma). Fractions were eluted in TDP buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) containing increasing [KCl]. ER and estrogen receptor related factor (ERAF) activities were monitored by hydroxyapatite (32Pavlik E.J. Coulson P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1976; 7: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and by gel mobility shift assays measuring binding to EREc38 (ER and ERAF) versus 1/2EREc38 (ERAF only). The post-Yellow-86 preparation, containing both ER and ERAF, was incubated with ERE-Sepharose and eluted with a linear KCl gradient (31Peale Jr., F.V. Ishibe Y. Klinge C.M. Zain S. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8671-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Partially purified ERAF (COUP-TF) was diluted to 111 mm KCl (final) with TDP buffer containing 40% glycerol. The pRSV-COUP-TFI plasmid, encoding recombinant human COUP-TFI, was a gift of Dr. Sophia Y. Tsai of Baylor University (33Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 34Feng J.Q. Chen D. Cooney A.J. Tsai M.-J. Harris M.A. Tsai S.Y. Feng M. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28364-28373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). COUP-TFI was transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a positive control, a plasmid encoding luciferase was transcribed and translated in parallel with COUP-TFI. The relative amount of the translated COUP-TFI protein was determined by [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol from NEN Life Science Products) incorporation into proteins analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by treatment of the fixed gel with En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions for fluorography. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY.) for 8–24 h. Plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from transformed JM109 Escherichia coli by the Mega Prep procedure from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). ERE-containing plasmid DNA (pGEM7Zf(+), as described above (18Klinge C.M. Peale Jr., F.V. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. Zain S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1073-1081PubMed Google Scholar), was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the ERE-containing oligomers were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The exact nucleotide sequence of the EcoRI-BamHI oligomer containing EREc38, inserted in the inverse orientation from that in Table I, is 5′-AATTCGGTACCCCTGAATGTGTTATTTTAGCTC-AGGTCACTCTGACCTGGGGT-TCGAAATCGATAAGCTT-3′ and for 1/2EREc38: 5′-AATTC-GGTACCCCTGAATGTGTTATTTTAGCTCGAAATGCTCTGACCTGGGGTTCGAAATCGATAAGCTTG-3′ where two imperfect half-sites are in bold, the perfect half-site is underlined, and the plasmid DNA sequence is written in italics. ERE-containing oligomers were fill-in labeled with [32P]dATP (800 Ci/mmol from NEN Life Science Products) using Klenow large fragment DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through either a G-50 Sephadex spin column in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) or a Centri-Spin 20 column (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). The sizes of the ERE oligomers used were 77 and 115 bp for one or two tandem (head-to-tail) copies of EREc38, respectively; 77 bp for either 1/2EREc38 or 1/2ERE3′c38; 106 bp for 1/2EREc; and 43 bp for the AT-rich region. Labeled oligomer (25,000 cpm) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with partially or ERE-Sepharose affinity purified [3H]E2-ER or [3H]TAz-ER (concentrations given in figure legends), 5 μg of poly(d[I·C]) (Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX), 40 μg of purified bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs)/reaction volume, with or without various amounts of antibodies (see figure legends) in a total reaction volume of 70 μl. Forty-μl aliquots, 79 mm KCl final, of the preincubated ER-ERE mixture were loaded on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (where 1 × TBE = 0.1 m Tris, 83.1 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2.25 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried under vacuum and autoradiographed on Kodak X-Omat film with an intensifying screen (Lightning Plus from DuPont). The amount of ER·ERE complex formed, and that of free ERE, was determined by excision of the corresponding regions from the dried gels into scintillation vials containing 3 ml of EcoScint A (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and the radioactivity was counted. The fraction of total 32P-ERE in the ER·ERE complex was calculated as follows: F(t) = (cpm in the ER·ERE complex)/(total cpm in the lane), where the (total cpm in the lane) = (cpm in free ERE) + (cpm in the ER·ERE complex) (35Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H222 monoclonal antibody (MAb) to ER was a gift of Abbott. H222 was diluted 1:10 in TE and 1.0 μl was added to selected samples in each experiment to confirm the identity of ER protein in the retarded ER·ERE complexes. Monoclonal (mouse) anti-ER antibodies AER304, AER314, AER308, AER315, AER303, AER310, AER311, AER317, and AER320 (36Abbondanza C. deFalco A. Nigro V. Medici N. Armetta I. Molinari A.M. Moncharmont B.

The following antibodies were gifts of Dr. Abdulmaged M. Traish of Boston University: ER-specific polyclonal antibodies AT2A, AT3A, and AT3B recognize the DNA-binding domain of the human ER and show no reactivity to glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor, or androgen receptor (38Traish A. Kim N. Wotiz H.H. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MAbs 33 and 213, and MAbs NMT-1 and NMT-2 react specifically with ER (39Traish A. Ettinger R. Kim N.

Traish A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1903-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Polyclonal RAR and RXR antibody RARγIIIB were raised against a region just N-terminal to the first zinc finger and recognized all forms of RAR and RXR, but not any of the steroid receptors. 2A. Traish, unpublished observations.Polyclonal antibody R1AB was raised against a polypeptide encompassing amino acids 63–77 (TQSSSSEEIVPSPPS) to RARα. Polyclonal antibody γNTB (also called rNTAB) was raised against an oligopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence encompassing residues between 55 and 68 (STPSPATIETQSSS) of RARα. R1AB and rNTAB recognized RARα, but not ER, progesterone receptor, or glucocorticoid receptor (48Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19599-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum to RXR was a gift from Dr. Pierre Chambon of the Université Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France. MAb to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor was a gift from Dr. Michel Dauça of the Université de Nancy I in France. MAb to TRα and TRβ were purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO. MAb 9A7γ to vitamin D receptor was a gift of Dr. Mark R. Haussler of the University of Arizona. Polyclonal antisera to COUP-TF were kindly provided by Drs. Sophia Y. Tsai of Baylor University (43Wang L.-H. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Geattie W.G. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and Janet E. Mertz of the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Mertz also provided the polyclonal antiserum to hERRα1. Polyclonal antiserum raised against a GST-hERR-1 fusion protein was a gift of Dr. Christine T.

Purified polyclonal antibody to c-Jun (Ab-2) was a gift of Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). Immunoprecipitation reactions were accomplished by incubation of partially purified ER with the designated antibody for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Aliquots (10 μl) of a 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose or Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added, depending on the source of primary antibody, and the incubation was continued for an additional hour at RT. The Sepharose resin was pelleted by sedimentation in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant used in gel mobility shift assay. When3H-liganded ER was used, the bound 3H-ligand was extracted with scintillation fluid and counted. Proteins present at various stages of ER purification were analyzed on either 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Protein molecular weight standards (Mark12 and MultiMark from Novex, San Diego, CA., or Kaleidoscope standard from Bio-Rad) were electrophoresed in parallel with experimental samples in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS at 135 V for 1.5 h, and the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol for several hours. Silver staining was performed using the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blotting, two identical 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels were electrophoresed as above. One gel was silver-stained and proteins in the other SDS-PAGE gel were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose (Pharmacia, Dublin, CA) or polyvinylidene difluoride (NEN Life Science Products) membranes. The transfer was monitored by transfer of the prestained protein markers and staining with 0.5% Ponceau S (Sigma) solution. Following the transfer, the membranes were incubated in a 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween (Sigma) for 3 h at RT to saturate the nonspecific binding sites. In general, the membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody in the 5% milk/TBS-Tween for 1–2 h at RT and washed three times with a large volume of TBS-Tween for a total of 30 min. The membrane was then incubated with a 1:3000–1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibody in 5% milk/TBS-Tween. After rinsing, the interacting proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) for horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and Western-Star (TROPIX, Bedford, MA) for alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies on Reflection (DuPont) or BIOMAX ML (Kodak) film for 10 s to 30 min prior to processing. Plasmids directing the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) ER, COUP-TFI, and ERRα1 were kindly provided by Dr. Janet E. Mertz of the University of Wisconsin. GST fusion proteins and GST expressed from pGEX-2TK were purified from E. coli BL-21 cells according to protocols supplied by Pharmacia. The concentrations of the glutathione-Sepharose-purified fusion proteins were determined by DC assay (Bio-Rad), and [3H]E2 binding to GST-ER was measured by hydroxyapatite assay (32Pavlik E.J. Coulson P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1976; 7: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Proteins were monitored by separation on 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with an anti-GST antibody (Pharmacia).

The conserved tripeptide, HPD, present in all J domains has been shown to be important for the interaction between yeast and bacterial DnaJ/Hsp70 protein pairs. We have characterized mutations in the HPD motif of the synaptic vesicle protein cysteine-string protein (Csp). Mutation of the histidine (H43Q) or aspartic acid (D45A) residues of this motif reduced the ability of Csp to stimulate the ATPase activity of mammalian Hsc70. The H43Q and D45A mutant proteins were not able to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 to any significant extent. The mutant proteins were characterized by competition assays, tryptic digestion analysis, and direct binding analysis from which it was seen that these proteins were defective in binding to Hsc70. Thus, the HPD motif of Csp is required for binding to Hsc70. We also analyzed the interaction between Csp and a model substrate protein, denatured firefly luciferase. Both Csp1 and the C-terminally truncated isoform Csp2 were able to prevent aggregation of heat-denatured luciferase, and they also cooperated with Hsc70 to prevent aggregation. In addition, complexes of Csp1 or Csp2 with Hsc70 and luciferase were isolated, confirming that these proteins interact and that Csps can bind directly to denatured proteins. Csp1 and Csp2 isoforms must differ in some aspect other than interaction with Hsc70 and substrate protein. These results show that both Csp1 and Csp2 can bind a partially unfolded protein and act as chaperones. This suggests that Csps may have a general chaperone function in regulated exocytosis.

Csps consist of an N-terminal “J” domain which is involved in the interaction with chaperone proteins of the Hsp70 family (13Braun J.E.A. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may serve to anchor the protein to synaptic vesicle and other regulated secretory vesicle membranes. The exact role of Csps is unknown. We previously cloned two Csp variant proteins from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (5Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the same two isoforms have been identified from human cDNAs (6Coppola T. Gundersen C.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Csp1 is homologous to other identified mammalian Csps (3Mastrogiacomo A. Gundersen C.B. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Braun J.E.A. Scheller R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1362-1369Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Csp2 is identical to Csp1, except for a 31-amino acid C-terminal deletion. Csp1 is present on the large dense-core granules of chromaffin cells (9Chamberlain L.H. Henry J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19514-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), pancreatic zymogen granules (4Braun J.E.A. Scheller R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1362-1369Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and secretory granules of the neurohypophysis (10Pupier S. Leveque C. Marqueze B. Kataoka M. Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicating Csp1 in dense-core granule exocytosis, in addition to neurotransmitter release. Csp2 could not be detected in chromaffin cells by Western blotting suggesting that this protein is only expressed at low levels. Csp2 was, however, detected in a spleen homogenate (5Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, Csp2 has recently been shown to be enriched in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum of adult rats (16Kwon O.-J. Kim C. Kim H. Chin H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2599Google Scholar). The Csp J domain is homologous to the archetypal J domain of the bacterial protein DnaJ. DnaJ interacts with the chaperone protein DnaK (the Escherichia coli equivalent of Hsp70), and these proteins, together with the nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE, function in a number of cellular processes, such as protein folding reactions (both under stress and normal conditions) and replication of bacteriophage λ (17Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). DnaK is an ATPase, and this activity is stimulated by DnaJ, whereas GrpE acts to exchange ADP bound by DnaK for ATP (18Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). A number of eukaryotic proteins have J domains, and these proteins are collectively referred to as DnaJ-like proteins. These DnaJ-like proteins can interact with the chaperone protein Hsp70 and its homologues, which are the equivalent of the bacterial DnaK protein, although their interactions have been much less extensively characterized than those of the bacterial protein. In a manner analogous to the prokaryotic system, DnaJ-like proteins can stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70s. The conserved tripeptide, HPD, present in all J domains, has been shown to be important in the interaction between DnaJ and DnaK (19Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and between the yeast DnaJ/Hsp70 protein pairs Ydj1/Ssa1 (20Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and Sec63/Kar2p (21Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Since there is believed to be specificity of interaction between specific DnaJ-like proteins and Hsp70 proteins, it would be important to determine the extent to which the HPD motif is required in all such interactions such as those involving mammalian homologues. In addition to interacting with each other, DnaJ and DnaK/Hsp70 also interact with substrate proteins which may be in a native or unfolded conformation. The actions of DnaJ/DnaK in mediating correct folding of nascent polypeptides and refolding of denatured proteins is well documented (for review see Ref. 17Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). However, these proteins also interact with native proteins. For example, Hsc70 (the constitutively expressed mammalian Hsp70) and auxillin (a DnaJ-like protein) interact with clathrin and catalyze the disassembly of this protein from coated vesicles (an essential reaction in synaptic vesicle recycling) (22Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, the bacterial proteins DnaJ and DnaK interact with the λP replication protein and in an ATP-dependent reaction release this protein from the preprimosomal complex assembled at theoriλ site. This is an essential reaction in the replication of bacteriophage λ DNA (23Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6632-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of Csps with native or denatured protein substrates has not been examined. We and others (13Braun J.E.A. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25989-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have previously shown that Csp interacts with Hsc70 and can stimulate the ATPase activity of the chaperone protein severalfold. Both Csp1 and Csp2 can stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 to a similar extent (14Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). There are important questions that arise concerning the interaction between Csps and Hsc70 and the ability of Csps to act as molecular chaperones by interacting with denatured protein substrates. First, is the conserved HPD motif in Csps required for Csp activation of Hsc70 ATPase activity? Second, is the HPD motif required for binding of Csp to Hsc70? Third, can Csps interact as chaperones with denatured protein substrates? Fourth, do the Csp1 and Csp2 isoforms differ in their interaction with denatured protein substrates? Analysis of these questions is necessary to establish the extent to which the secretory vesicle Csps function in a chaperone cycle with Hsc70 and their similarity or otherwise to the well characterized bacterial DnaJ/DnaK proteins. In addition, understanding of these protein-protein interactions and assessment of the ability of Csps themselves to act as chaperones may help to understand the function of Csps in exocytosis. Ni2+-NTA agarose, pQE30 expression vector, and E. coli M15 cells were obtained from Qiagen (Surrey, UK). Supercompetent XL1 blue cells and QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit were purchased from Stratagene (Cambridge, UK). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Enhanced chemiluminescence antibody-binding detection kit was obtained from Amersham Corp. (Slough, UK). Firefly luciferase IgG was purchased from Europa Ltd. (UK). Firefly luciferase, Hsc70 antiserum, and all other chemicals were of an analytical grade from Sigma (Poole, UK). The buffer referred to in this paper as buffer A consists of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.8. Buffer B consists of 25 mmTris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. The coding sequences of Csp1 and Csp2 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from bovine adrenal chromaffin cell cDNA and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen) as described previously (5Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Csp1-pQE30 construct was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange system (Stratagene). The sense and antisense primers used for mutation of amino acid H43Q were 5′-CTACCGGAAGCT(G/A)GCCTTGAAATACCA(C/G)CCTGACAAGAAC and 5′-GTTCTTGTCAGG(G/C)TGGTATTTCAAGGC(C/T)AGCTTCCGGTAG, respectively. The sense and antisense primers used for mutation of amino acid D45A were 5′-CTACCGGAAGCT(G/A)GCCTTGAAATACCACCCTG(A/C)CAAGAACCCTG and 5′-CAGGGTTCTTG(T/G)CAGGGTGGTATTTCAAGGC(C/T)AGCTTCCGGTAG, respectively. The G → A mutation (sense primers) was included to introduce anNheI restriction site to allow screening of mutant constructs. This mutation was conservative and, therefore, did not alter the amino acid sequence of Csp1. The DNA was also sequenced to confirm mutagenesis. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mm) was added to a 1-liter culture of E. coliM15 cells containing the cloned csp1 and csp2sequences (at A 600 = 0.7–0.9) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h with shaking at 230 rpm, inducing expression of the recombinant proteins. The induced cells were washed and resuspended in 20 ml of breaking buffer (100 mm HEPES, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A, pH 7). The cells were stored at −80 °C overnight and thawed the following morning. 1 mg/ml lysozyme was added, and the cells left on ice for 30 min. Following ultrasonication, 2 μg/ml DNase was added, and the cells were left on ice for 15 min. Centrifugation at 100,000 × g removed cell debris, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA agarose column and washed with 50 mm imidazole buffer (50 mm imidazole, 20 mm HEPES, 200 mmKCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% v/v glycerol, pH 7) to remove unbound protein. MgATP was added to this buffer to remove any bacterial DnaK bound to the recombinant Csps. His6-tagged Csps were eluted by application of a gradient of 50–500 mmimidazole, and peak fractions containing the recombinant protein were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All chromatography was performed at 4 °C using a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. Hsc70 was purified from bovine brain based on the protocol of Schlossmann et al. (26Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The final purified fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions containing Hsc70 were combined. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 4 mm to the purified Hsc70 and mixed at 4 °C for 15 min to restore nucleotide dependence. The purified Hsc70 was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 25 mm KCl, 10 mmNH2SO4, 0.8 mm DTT, pH 7.0, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. ATPase assays were performed in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7. Assays were performed at 37 °C for 1 h, and activity was determined by assaying the release of inorganic phosphate using the spectrophotometric method of Lanzetta et al. (27Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) with modifications (28Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Corrections were made for non-enzymic breakdown of ATP by running duplicate assays on ice and subtracting these from the values obtained at 37 °C. Samples were read at OD660, and their values were compared with a calibration curve using KH2PO4 as a standard. Tryptic digests were performed as described previously (29Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4 μg of purified Hsc70 was digested with 0.12 μg of trypsin at 25 °C for 30 min. The digestion was performed in buffer A with 2 mm MgCl2. The digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and compared with non-digested Hsc70. Luciferase (1 μm) was added to tubes containing Csp1 (4 μm), Csp2 (4 μm), or Hsc70 (2 μm) in buffer A with 2 mm MgATP. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then transferred to a 42 °C water bath for 10 min. Centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 10 min (4 °C) pelleted aggregated luciferase, which was resuspended in SDS-dissociation buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Aggregated luciferase was quantified by densitometry. To examine further the effects of Csp1 and Csp2 on luciferase aggregation, luciferase (1 μm) was incubated with various concentrations of the Csps (1, 2, 5, 10, 15 μm), and aggregation of luciferase was determined as above. In addition, luciferase (1 μm) aggregation was analyzed in the presence of 6 μm mutant proteins, H43Q and D45A. This analysis was based on the protocol of Minamiet al. (30Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Csp and Csp mutants (4 μm) were added to Hsc70 (2 μm) or luciferase (1 μm) or both of the proteins (in buffer A with 2 mm MgATP). The proteins were left at room temperature for 5 min and then incubated at 42 °C for 10 min to cause denaturation of luciferase. Following centrifugation to remove large aggregates, the supernatants (100 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose beads and left on ice for 30 min. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed sequentially in 500 μl of buffer B (25 mmTris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) and 500 μl of buffer B + 50 mm imidazole. The Csps bound to the Ni2+-NTA beads were eluted with 500 μl of buffer B + 500 mmimidazole, and the eluted proteins were precipitated with an equal volume of methanol at −80 °C and pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The pelleted Csp (and associated protein) was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-dissociation buffer and separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining or by transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting with specific antisera raised against Hsc70 (Sigma, UK) or luciferase (Europa Ltd., UK). Antibody binding was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Int.). One of the aims of this work was to determine the importance of the HPD motif of the J domain of Csp for interaction with Hsc70. Other work had suggested that the conserved HPD motif of J domains is important in the interaction between bacterial and yeast DnaJ/Hsp70 homologues. We were interested in whether or not this motif was also involved in the interaction of the synaptic vesicle protein, Csp with Hsc70. To test this, site-directed mutants were generated which were mutated in one of two residues (histidine or aspartic acid) of the conserved HPD motif, and these mutations are depicted in Fig.1 A. The histidine residue was mutated to glutamine (H43Q) the identical mutation which was used in other studies on DnaJ and Ydj1 (19Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and, in addition, the aspartic acid residue was also mutated to alanine, a small non-charged amino acid (D45A). Before an analysis of the mutant proteins could be made, it was necessary to characterize further the Csp/Hsc70 interaction. Fig.1 B shows that maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 by Csp1 was obtained when Csp1 was present at a 2-fold molar excess. The maximal stimulation of Hsc70s' ATPase activity by Csp1 varied slightly between different experiments, but the maximum achieved was a 14-fold increase. The inset of Fig. 1 B shows a Hill plot from the dose-response data. The slope of the fitted line (n H) was calculated to be 1.1, suggesting that the interaction between the two proteins is non-cooperative. The ability of the site-directed mutants proteins, D45A and H43Q, to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 was compared with wild type Csp1. Fig. 1 C shows that both mutant proteins are clearly defective in enhancing Hsc70's ATPase activity. The reduced ability of the mutant proteins to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 indicated that these proteins either had a lower affinity for binding to Hsc70 or that they could still bind but following binding were not able to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70. To address this question competition assays were performed with mutant protein present at a 5-fold molar excess above wild type Csp. If H43Q and D45A are able to bind to Hsc70 but not activate the ATPase activity, then they should compete with the ATPase stimulation by Csp1. Fig. 2 shows that H43Q and D45A were clearly defective in binding to Hsc70 as they did not compete with wild type Csp to any significant extent. Fig. 2 also further emphasizes the almost complete lack of ATPase-stimulating activity of H43Q and D45A. Partial tryptic digestion has been used previously to analyze the conformation of DnaK under different conditions (29Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar protocol was used in this study to examine the effects of ATP and Csp1 on the sensitivity of Hsc70 to tryptic digestion. Fig.3 A demonstrates that the presence of ATP had no significant effect on the sensitivity of Hsc70 to tryptic digestion. However, the presence of Csp1 caused substantially more digestion of Hsc70 (arrowhead), and this was enhanced when ATP, but not ATPγS was present, suggesting that interaction of Csp1 with Hsc70 to stimulate ATP hydrolysis increases the sensitivity of Hsc70 to tryptic digestion, presumably by a Csp1-induced change in the conformation of Hsc70. By having characterized the tryptic digestion pattern of Hsc70 in the presence of different nucleotides and Csp1, this assay was utilized to analyze further the effects of H43Q and D45A on Hsc70. Fig.3 B shows that Csp1 again had a marked effect on the sensitivity of Hsc70 to tryptic digestion, and this was enhanced in the presence of ATP. In contrast, neither H43Q nor D45A significantly affected the tryptic digestion pattern of Hsc70 in the presence or absence of ATP. This suggests that the mutant proteins cannot cause the conformational change in Hsc70 which results in greater sensitivity to tryptic digestion. This finding is in agreement with the results of the competition experiments, suggesting that the mutants are defective in binding to Hsc70. By having defined the region of Csp required for binding to Hsc70, we proceeded to analyze the interaction of Csp with substrate proteins. Heat-denatured firefly luciferase is often used as a model substrate for chaperone proteins, and this protein was used in the present study. As an initial approach to examining these interactions, the ability of denatured luciferase to enhance the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in the absence and presence of Csp1 was examined. It was found that Csp1 caused a far greater stimulation of Hsc70 than denatured luciferase and that a combination of Csp1 and luciferase did not produce any significant increase in Hsc70 ATP hydrolyzing activity above that for Csp1 alone, confirming that Csp1 interacts with Hsc70 at a different site from substrate proteins (Fig.4). When luciferase is heat-denatured, normally hidden hydrophobic surfaces of the protein are revealed and hydrophobic interactions causes the protein to aggregate. Chaperone proteins are effective in preventing this aggregation (e.g. Ref. 31Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Aggregated and soluble luciferase were separated by centrifugation, and the extent of aggregation was assayed by centrifugation and quantification of aggregated luciferase by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. Fig.5 A shows that while low concentrations of Csp1, Csp2, or Hsc70 alone had little effect on the aggregation of luciferase, Csps and Hsc70 were effective at preventing aggregation when present in combination. Interestingly, Csp1 appeared to be slightly better at this function than Csp2, despite the fact that the two proteins had identical ATPase stimulating activity (Ref. 14Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and data not shown). At higher concentrations, Csp1 and Csp2 were able to act as molecular chaperones in the absence of Hsc70 by significantly reducing luciferase aggregation (Fig. 5 B), and again Csp1 appeared to be slightly more active on a molar basis in this assay. The mutant proteins H43Q and D45A were also effective at preventing aggregation of denatured luciferase at the single concentration tested (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, bovine serum albumin had very little effect on luciferase aggregation, confirming that the ability to prevent aggregation is not a general property of all proteins. If Csps interact with Hsc70 and substrate proteins then it should be possible to isolate complexes of these proteins. Csp was incubated with either luciferase, Hsc70, or both at 42 °C for 10 min, and His6-tagged Csp was isolated by incubation with Ni2+-NTA agarose. Proteins bound to Csp were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fig.6 A shows that denatured luciferase and Hsc70 each bound to both Csp1 and Csp2 and also that all three proteins could be isolated in a complex. Thearrowheads indicate dimer forms of Csp1 and Csp2, the formation of which is well documented (5Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Chamberlain L.H. Henry J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19514-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Neither luciferase nor Hsc70 bound to Ni2+-NTA agarose in the absence of Csps (Fig. 6 B). In addition, it was found that formation of a complex containing Csp, Hsc70, and luciferase was independent of the presence of ATP (Fig. 6 B). Complex formation was also analyzed between the mutant proteins H43Q and D45A and Hsc70 and denatured luciferase. Fig. 6 C shows that H43Q and D45A bound denatured luciferase to a similar extent as wild type Csp1; however, the mutant proteins were defective in binding Hsc70, consistent with their lack of effect on Hsc70 proteolysis (Fig. 3 B). The results presented here show that the HPD motif of Csps is important for interaction with Hsc70 and in addition demonstrate that Csp1 and Csp2 can themselves bind denatured protein substrates. The ability of Csps to prevent aggregation of a denatured model protein shows that they can act as chaperones. Mutation of the histidine residue of the HPD motif to glutamine inE. coli DnaJ and the yeast DnaJ-like protein, Ydj1, abolishes the ability of these proteins to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK and Ssa1, respectively (19Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both DnaJ and Ydj1 mutant proteins are still able to interact with their Hsp70 partner proteins but with greatly reduced affinity (20Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study it was found that the identical mutation in Csp1 reduced the ATPase stimulating activity. Competition assays, tryptic digestion analyses, and direct binding analyses suggested that this was due to the H43Q mutation extensively reducing the affinity of binding of Csp to Hsc70. The effect of mutations on the aspartic acid residue (D) of the HPD motif of DnaJ-like proteins has not been studied previously in any detail. It was found that the D45A mutation virtually abolished the ATPase stimulating activity, and this protein did not bind to Hsc70. This finding, in addition to the results with the H43Q mutant protein, implies that the HPD motif of Csp is important for binding to Hsc70. However, we are not able to determine if this motif is also required for ATPase activation or if this activity is conferred by a separate region of the J domain. The importance of the HPD motif in DnaJ/Hsp70 interactions is further highlighted as it occurs on a loop region (33Szyperski T. Pellecchia M. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11343-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.-U. McColl D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and does not have an obvious structural role in the J domain. However, it is also possible that other non-conserved regions of the J domain confer specificity to DnaJ/Hsp70 pairing. Indeed, J domains from the cytosolic DnaJ-like protein, Sis1p, and the mitochondrial protein, Mdj1p, were not functional when substituted into the endoplasmic reticulum DnaJ-like protein Sec63 (36Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was suggested that these hybrid proteins could not interact with Kar2p (an endoplasmic reticulum Hsp70 homologue) and that other non-conserved residues outside the HPD motif are involved in the interaction between Sec63 and Kar2p and other DnaJ/Hsp70 protein pairs. Partial digestion of DnaK with trypsin reveals that the bacterial protein undergoes a conformational change in the presence of ATP or DnaJ (19Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar protocol we have shown that Hsc70 is more susceptible to tryptic digestion in the presence of Csp1, suggesting that binding of Csp to Hsc70 causes a conformational change in the chaperone protein. The digestion of Hsc70 is further enhanced when both Csp and hydrolyzable ATP are present, implying that binding of Csp1 to Hsc70 converts Hsc70 into a more “open” conformation and that this is enhanced in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP. The Csp-mediated stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 may be important in enhancing the conformational change of Hsc70 or it may simply allow Csp to cycle on and off Hsc70 resulting in a conformational change in more Hsc70 molecules per unit time than in the absence of ATP. The conformational change of Hsc70 induced by Csp could be important to allow binding to substrate proteins (17Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the C-terminal region of DnaJ is involved in binding to substrate proteins (37Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.-U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Since Csp1 and Csp2 differ in the C terminus, their binding to denatured firefly luciferase was examined. We demonstrated that both Csp1 and Csp2 can function as molecular chaperones by preventing the aggregation of denatured luciferase. Since both isoforms are functional in this assay, this suggests that the C-terminal 31 amino acids of Csp are not essential for substrate interaction. Aggregation was almost completely inhibited at a 15-fold molar excess of Csp above luciferase. In comparison, a 50% reduction in aggregation of denatured luciferase was produced in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of E. coli DnaJ (38Schroder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Csps also cooperated with Hsc70 to prevent aggregation. Complexes containing Csp, Hsc70, and luciferase were isolated both in the presence and absence of hydrolyzable ATP. These are likely to be ternary complexes since luciferase did not compete with Csp for Hsc70 ATPase activation implying distinct binding sites, but the presence of binary complexes cannot be excluded. It has been suggested that stimulation of Hsc70 ATP hydrolysis by DnaJ converts Hsc70 into a conformation that can bind to substrate protein (39Rassow J. Von Ahsen O. Bomer U. Pfanner N. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 129-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, in this work we found that complex formation is independent of ATP (Fig.6 B). This is in contrast to other work (40Cheetham M.E. Jackson A.P. Anderton B.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) which showed that in the presence of ATP, Hsj1a and Hsj1b (DnaJ-like proteins) stimulated release of the substrate protein carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin from Hsc70. These different results may be due to the choice of model substrate proteins used. However, the stability of the complex between Csp, Hsc70, and luciferase suggests that other protein factors, such as the Hop protein (41Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), may be required for the full chaperone cycle in vivo. It was reported that the ability of bacterial DnaJ to bind to denatured protein substrates was dependent on a zinc finger domain (37Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.-U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, Csp does not have a recognizable zinc finger domain, yet can bind directly to a substrate protein. It may be that some other region of Csp can substitute for a zinc finger domain in specifying substrate interaction or that Csp has a non-consensus zinc-binding site. Since Csp1 and Csp2 are both functional as molecular chaperones, the question arises as to the function of the C-terminal 31 amino acids of Csp1. One possibility is that the C terminus of Csps may determine the spectrum of possible substrate interactions in the synapse. This question is clearly important in light of the finding that Csp1 and Csp2 show distinct developmental and adult profiles of expression in rat brain (16Kwon O.-J. Kim C. Kim H. Chin H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2599Google Scholar). The finding that Csp can bind to an unfolded protein substrate has implications for the function of Csp in regulated exocytosis. Csp may interact with synaptic proteins that are in a partially unfolded or an energetically unfavorable conformation. This could be a potentially important interaction in exocytosis as it is well established that the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic membranes involve numerous protein-protein interactions. For example, it has been proposed that the actions of the synaptic proteinsN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins is to modify the conformation of SNARE proteins on the vesicle or target membrane to allow them to interact (42Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 335-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The interaction of Csp with unfolded proteins may explain why there has been little success in identifying proteins that bind Csp (14Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These data suggest two new possibilities for Csp function in exocytosis as follows: first, Csp interacts with the unfolded conformational state of a particular protein, and second, Csp is a general secretory vesicle chaperone, functioning by binding to multiple vesicle proteins in their unfolded conformations. Finally, it is also possible that Csp may have a more specific function in regulated exocytosis, in addition to the proposed general chaperone role. Further work will be required to resolve this issue. We are grateful to Dr. Michael Cheetham (Department of Ophthalmology, University College, London, UK) for critical reading of this paper."

Gα and Gβγ have also been implicated in cell growth and differentiation, perhaps due to their association with cytoskeletal components. In this report Gβγ is shown to modulate the cytoskeleton by regulation of microtubule assembly. Specificity among βγ species exists, as β1γ2 stimulates microtubule assembly, and β1γ1 is without any effect. Furthermore, a mutant β1γ2, β1γ2(C68S), which does not undergo prenylation and subsequent carboxyl-terminal processing on the γ subunit, does not stimulate the formation of microtubules. β immunoreactivity was detected exclusively in the microtubule fraction after assembly in the presence of β1γ2, suggesting a preferential association with microtubules rather than soluble tubulin. Crude microtubule fractions from ovine brain contain Gβγ, and electron microscopy reveals a specific association with microtubules. The decoration of microtubules by Gβγ appears to be strikingly similar to the periodic pattern observed for microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting a similar site of activation of microtubule assembly by both agents. It is suggested that reformation of the cytoskeleton represents an additional cellular process mediated by Gβγ. α and βγ subunits of G proteins are thought to transduce signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effector molecules.

G proteins play important roles in signal transduction by transferring signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effector molecules. Although receptor-G protein-effector complexes can reconstitute hormone-sensitive signaling systems in vitro, it is likely that the regulation of receptor-G protein signaling is substantially more complex in the cell. Many studies have implicated the participation of the cytoskeleton in neurotransmitter signaling pathways (1Rasenick M.M. Stein P. Bitensky M.

Although G proteins are likely to be membrane-bound when coupled to receptors, recent results from several laboratories suggest their association with several subcellular compartments. InCaenorhabditis elegans embryos, Gβ is required for proper spindle orientation and transiently associates with the region of asters (the array of microtubules emanating from the centrosomes) just before and during cell division (8Zwaal R.R.

Astral localization of Goα and Gβ has also been observed in mammalian cells (9Lin C.-T. Wu H.-C. Cheng H.-F. Chang J.T. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 770-778PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Gβγ, microtubules, and phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-biphosphate may participate in synaptic vesicle recycling by regulating the GTPase activity of dynamin 1 (10Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27979-27982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a link between microtubules and G protein signaling. Association of the signal-transducing G proteins, Gs, Gi1, and Gq, with the synaptic membrane tubulin has been observed previously (2Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol.

Tubulin appears to activate G proteins directly, and complexes between tubulin and Gαhave been isolated from plasma membranes. While some interaction between tubulin and Gβγ has been observed previously, the role of such interaction remains unclear. Modification of microtubule cytoskeleton by Gβγ might provide an explanation for the association of Gβγ with the mitotic spindle and its role in cell growth and differentiation. The present study was undertaken to explore the role of Gβγ in microtubule assembly and dynamics.

The tubulin preparation made by two assembly-disassembly cycles (microtubule proteins) contains microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). These MAPs were removed by phosphocellulose chromatography (13Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.-Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Drs. T. Kosaza and A. G Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. β1γ1 (transducin βγ), purified from bovine retina, was a generous gift from Drs Nick Skiba and Heidi E. Hamm of Northwestern University or Yee-Kin Ho of University of Illinois, Chicago. Mutant β1γ2(C68S) was generously provided by Drs. John Hepler and A. G Gilman. Fresh ovine brains were obtained from a local abbatoir and homogenized in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2) containing 0.1 mm GTP, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. This initial pellet (P1), the crude membrane preparation, was resuspended in Hepes buffer (0.1 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and saved for immunoblotting. Tubuluin from the initial supernatant (S1, cytosolic fraction) was allowed to assemble at 37 °C in PEM buffer containing 30% glycerol and 0.5 mm GTP for 60 min (12Shelanski M. Gaskin F. Cantor C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). Suspended microtubules were divided into two tubes, and both were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 37 °C. The resulting pellet (P2) represented the crude microtubule preparation. One crude microtubule pellet was fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 1 h, embedded in LR white (medium grade, Ernest F. Fullam Inc.), and subjected to thin sectioning. The other crude microtubule pellet was resuspended in PEM buffer, depolymerized on ice, and examined for the presence of Gβγ. PC-tubulin in PEM buffer and 1 mm GTP was incubated with or without β1γ2 (0.05 mg/ml) or β1γ1 (0.1 mg/ml) at 0 °C for 10 min followed by assembly at 37 °C for 45 min to 1 h. Assembly was quantitated by centrifuging the polymer at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 37 °C, and pellets and supernatants were separated. Pellets were resuspended in cold PEM buffer and protein concentrations were determined both in pellets and supernatant fractions. Protein was estimated by Coomassie Blue binding according to the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. All βγ combinations were exchanged in PEM buffer through a rapid spin column (Bio-Gel P6DG) before testing its effect on microtubule assembly. Alternately, to avoid reduction in protein concentration by gel filtration, a buffer control was performed in preparations where βγ concentrations were low. Samples for electrophoresis were dissolved in 3% SDS Laemmli sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% acrylamide and 0.133% bisacrylamide) electrophoresis. For Western blotting, samples after electrophoresis, were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in 3% BSA in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature followed by an overnight incubation with anti-Gβ antibody. Detection of antibody binding was with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce, Rockford IL). The membrane was washed with 0.02% Tween 20 in TBS, and the substrate solutions were added for color development. For electron microscopic analysis, about 15 μl of the sample, after polymerization, were removed and placed on a carbon-coated nickel grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences Inc.). After 10–15 s, the grids were rinsed with 10 drops of 2% uranyl acetate for negative staining, blotted dry with a filter paper, and viewed in a JEOL 100S electron microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy, microtubules were fixed by adding 0.5% glutaraldehyde in warm PEM buffer. After 15 min at room temperature, 15-μl aliquots were removed and placed on carbon coated nickel grids. After 15–20 s, the grids were rinsed with 10 drops of warm PEM buffer and placed into wells of a grid box containing 0.1% BSA in TBS (17–20 μl). Subsequently the grids were transferred into 5% normal goat serum (NGS) in BSA-TBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The grids were then subjected to overnight incubation at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-Gβ diluted in 1% NGS-BSA-TBS. Following this, grids were transferred into a drilled grid box immersed in BSA-TBS in a square Petri dish. The grid box was then suspended in a beaker containing BSA-TBS and subjected to gentle agitation with three buffer changes at 10-min intervals. This was followed by a subsequent incubation (3 h) with a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5 dilution) conjugated with 10-nm colloidal gold (Amersham Corp.). Grids were washed as before and were counterstained with 2% uranyl acetate and viewed, blind to experimental conditions, in a JEOL 100S electron microscope. For thin sectioning, pellets were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 1 h and kept overnight in PEM buffer at 4 °C. They were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 10 min, dehydrated in alcohol and embedded in LR white. Thin sections were cut according to standard procedures, placed on Formvar-coated nickel grids, and subjected to immunocytochemistry using polyclonal anti-Gβ antibody and colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody as described above. Several species of G protein β and γ subunits have been shown to exist (16Simon M. Strathman M. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar), and they appear to show preferences for various forms of Gα as well as for specific receptors (17Cerione R.A. Gierschik P.

Coexpression of both subunits are required to detect the activity of the complex and functional properties of the complex are dependent on contributions from both proteins (21Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robinshaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although transducin βγ primarily consists of β1 and γ1 isotypes, βγ subunits purified from bovine brain are heterogenous in composition. The effect of different combinations of βγ on microtubule assembly was tested. Tubulin purified free of microtubule-associated proteins was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of β1γ2 or β1γ1 (transducin βγ). Assembly was monitored by negative staining electron microscopy and measuring protein in polymers collected by centrifugation. Under these buffer conditions, tubulin does not assemble well unless glycerol (25–30% by volume) is present in the buffer. However, microtubule assembly was stimulated markedly, when β1γ2 was present at ∼1:20 molar ratio with tubulin (Figs.1, 2, and 3). In contrast, β1γ1 had no effect on microtubule assembly. Electron microscopic analysis indicated very few microtubules formed by tubulin alone or in the presence of β1γ1 (Fig. 1). In the presence of β1γ2, however, robust microtubule polymerization occurred. To quantify this response, eight random fields were examined by electron microscopy on a total of five grids from three separate experiments. The result is shown in Fig.2. In a field of 5 μm in an average grid, 1–4 microtubules were found in the control samples (mean = 1.7) or samples incubated with β1γ1 (mean = 2.7), while 49–65 (mean = 54.7) isolated microtubules were detected in samples incubated with β1γ2. Protein estimation in the pellets also indicated a 71% increase in the presence of β1γ2 (Fig.3 A). No detectable change in pellet protein concentration (compared with controls) was observed in the presence of β1γ1. The maximal extent to which added β1γ2 if incorporated into the microtubule pellet could increase the pellet protein is calculated to be 13%. This suggests that the increase in pellet protein seen in Fig. 1 is indicative of β1γ2-induced enhancement of microtubule assembly. SDS-PAGE of the samples further confirmed the increase in tubulin concentration in the pellet formed in the presence of β1γ2 (Fig. 3 B). This result clearly indicates that β1γ2 promotes microtubule assembly, perhaps by reducing the critical concentration of tubulin required for assembly. In the presence of β1γ2, PC-tubulin, at a concentration as low as 0.8 mg/ml, assembled readily into microtubules (15–20 microtubules/5-μm field in a grid).Figure 2Electron microscopic analysis of microtubule numbers; effect of various Gβγ. Microtubule assembly was performed in the presence or absence of β1γ1, β1γ2, or β1γ2(C68S). From three separate experiments, five grids were analyzed for each polymer. Microtubule numbers were counted from eight random fields and plotted as shown. Tubulin concentrations in those experiments ranged from 1.2 to 2.0 mg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Effect of β1γ2 or β1γ1 on the polymer mass. Tubulin polymers assembled in the presence or absence of β1γ2 or β1γ1 (a portion of the samples from Fig. 1) were pelleted by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 37 °C, and pellets and supernatants were separated. Pellets were resuspended in cold PEM buffer. Assembly was quantitated by estimating the protein in resuspended pellets and supernatants and plotted as indicated (A). B, tubulin staining on resuspended pellets when subjected to SDS-PAGE. One of three similar experiments is shown. β1γ2 increased polymer mass by 50–70%, while no significant change in polymer mass was observed in presence of β1γ1. Note that both microtubules and tubulin aggregates appear in the pellets, rendering polymer mass in the pellets underestimated for microtubule formation. Since microtubule assembly follows a nucleation-elongation phenomenon requiring a critical tubulin concentration for assembly, protein estimates in the pellet do not accurately reflect microtubule assembly, particularly when rate and extent of assembly is suboptimal. When assembly proceeds efficiently, the correlation is much higher.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding that β1γ2 stimulated microtubule assembly, while β1γ1 was ineffective, suggests that the γ subunit is the determining factor for the observed difference. One major difference between γ1 and γ2 is the modification at the carboxyl terminus of γ; while γ1 is farnesylated, γ2 is geranylgeranylated (22Fukuda Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 23Lai R.K. Perez-Sala D. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 5868-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of γ1 and γ2 are substantially different. Thus, differential effect of β1γ1 and β1γ2 in microtubule assembly might be attributed to the γ subunit and the type of isoprenoid moiety attached to it. Although prenylation and/or further carboxyl-terminal processing of Gγ is not required for assembly of βγ complexes, such modifications are indispensable for the function of βγ. High affinity interactions of βγ with either G protein α subunits or effector molecules require that the γ subunit be prenylated (21Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robinshaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9067-9073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Yasuda H.

To examine the role of the γ subunit carboxyl-terminal processing, a mutant β1γ2, β1γ2(C68S), which cannot undergo prenylation and further carboxyl-terminal processing was used. This mutant βγ was inactive in all functional assays (21Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robinshaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, β1γ2(C68S) did not stimulate microtubule assembly. Analysis of microtubules from electron microscopic data (Fig. 2) indicated no significant difference from control (3 ± 1.0versus 1.66 ± 0.49 per 5-μm field in an average grid). However, larger tubulin aggregates were seen frequently in samples assembled from β1γ2(C68S) (Fig. 1). β1γ2(C68S) did not alter total polymer mass over controls as determined by protein estimation in the pellet (data not shown). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of pellet and supernatant fractions indicate β immunoreactivity in microtubule pellets after assembly in the presence of β1γ2 (Fig. 4), suggesting a preferential association with microtubules rather than soluble tubulin. However, the microtubule and tubulin aggregates formed in the presence of β1γ1 or β1γ2(C68S) did not bind these βγ species, as all β immunoreactivity remained in the supernatant (Fig. 4). To rule out the possibility that the observed association of β1γ2 to microtubules is not due to aggregation and subsequent precipitation of the less soluble geranylgeranylated β1γ2, β1γ2 and β1γ2(C68S) were subjected to similar incubation and centrifugation conditions as in Fig. 4, except that tubulin was excluded from the samples. Greater than 90% of the β1γ2 or β1γ2(C68S) remained in the supernatant fractions, confirming that the precipitation of β1γ2 in the microtubule pellet is due to its specific interaction with microtubules. Even though significant microtubule formation occurred at subcritical tubulin concentrations in the presence of β1γ2, it was necessary to determine if β1γ1 or β1γ2(C68S) inhibited microtubule assembly (as opposed to failing to promote assembly). To address this issue, microtubule assembly was induced by adding 30% glycerol to the incubation buffer, which reduces the critical concentration for assembly of purified tubulin (12Shelanski M. Gaskin F. Cantor C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar, 28Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5183-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Utracentrifugation studies and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated normal microtubule formation. Addition of β1γ2(C68S) or β1γ1 did not alter the level of assembly as detected by protein assays of the pellets as well as by electron microscopic observation. Since the degree of microtubule assembly was similar with all βγ species in the presence of glycerol, association of Gβγwith microtubules was tested under this condition. Consistent with the data in Fig. 4, only β1γ2 was associated with microtubules. The other two βγ species (β1γ1 and β1γ2C68S) remained exclusively in the supernatant fractions (data not shown). The results in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 suggest that the functional interactions of βγ subunit of G proteins with tubulin/microtubule systems require a similar structural specificity of βγ to those which determine Gβγ interactions with Gα or effector molecules such as phospholipases or ion channels. In this context, tubulin/microtubules may represent a new class of effector system for βγ subunits of G proteins. As a corollary to this, βγ subunits might represent a new class of microtubule associated protein. It is noteworthy that the major microtubule-associated protein (MAP) of sea urchins and several other echinoderms is a 77-kDa protein (EMAP) with no sequence homology with any other identified MAPs. However, EMAP exhibits a significant homology with β subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (29Li Q. Suprenant K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31777-31784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suggestion that Gβγ might be behaving as a MAP for the promotion of microtubule polymerization elicited the question whether the binding of Gβγ to microtubules resembled that seen with MAPs. A polyclonal antibody directed against the β subunit was used to determine the nature of association of β/βγ with microtubules assembled in the presence of β1γ2. β subunits were detected upon short projections which extended laterally from microtubules at regular intervals (Fig. 5). In addition, the β subunit was bound to some of the oligomeric structures. Similar structures, consisting of high molecular weight MAPs and tubulin, are frequently found in microtubule preparations and are suggested to be intermediate structures for microtubule formation (30Purich D.L. Kristofferson D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1984; 36: 133-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The decoration of microtubules by Gβ appears to be strikingly similar to that observed by MAPs (31Murphy D.B. Borisy G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2696-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), suggesting perhaps, a similar site of activation of microtubule assembly by both agents. To assess the binding of βγ to microtubules in situ, β immunoreactivity was tested in crude microtubule fractions prepared from ovine brain homogenate. As shown in Fig.6 A, βγ was detected clearly in the crude microtubule preparation. In addition, βγ was detected in the unpolymerized cytosolic fraction (S2), although in lesser amount. Since particulate structures were removed prior to microtubule polymerization, the βγ associated with microtubules was present in the cytosol. The bulk of this βγ was able to associate with the crude microtubule fraction during the polymerization step (Fig. 6 A). Gβ immunoreactivity in the S2 fraction may represent βγ species that do not bind to microtubules. Alternately, one or several MAP(s) may compete with β1γ2 for microtubule binding, releasing some β1γ2 into the S2 fraction. This is supported by the observed association of βγ with the crude microtubule pellet. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the β subunit is detected laterally on microtubule walls as a short projection. Note that the periodic association of Gβγ seen when Gβγ-induced microtubule polymerizatin (Fig. 5) was not observed. Further, βγ was not detected in the two cycle purified microtubule fraction (microtubule protein), suggesting the loss of association of βγ with microtubules during the purification cycle. In addition to regulating effector molecules, βγ subunits may play a role in macromolecular assembly (32Neer E.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). They enhance the association of α subunits with receptors. βγ binding to the pleckstrin homology domains of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK), permits the translocation of βARK from cytosol to membrane and facilitates its association with target receptors (33Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaws G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pitcher J. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The observed stimulation of microtubule assembly by β1γ2 further supports its role in the macromolecular organization of the cell. Although the assembly properties of βγ subunits are partly attributable to the WD-40 repeating units (a 40–43-amino acid tandem repeat usually punctuated with tryptophan-aspartate) present in the β subunit of the βγ complex (32Neer E.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), prenylation of γ subunits may play a crucial role in mediating the association between βγ and other proteins (35Marshal C.J.

Furthermore, it appears from this study that prenylation of the γ subunit is critical for the interaction of βγ with tubulin for stimulation of microtubule assembly. In mammalian cells, Gβ immunoreactivity appears consistently associated with both microtubules in mitotic spindles and with the plasma membrane (9Lin C.-T. Wu H.-C. Cheng H.-F. Chang J.T. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 770-778PubMed Google Scholar). Spindle morphogenesis is associated with changes in the level of microtubule polymers and microtubule dynamics, and these two processes are tightly coupled (37Zhai Y. Kronebusch P.J. Simon P.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of Gβγ with microtubules in mitotic cells might represent a vehicle for coordination of mitotic centers by extracellular signals. It is also noteworthy, in this regard, that Gβ has been shown essential for Dictyosteliumdevelopment (38Lilly P. Wu L. Welker D.L. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and oocyte maturation in starfish (39Jaffe L.A. Gallo C.J. Lee R.H.Y.-K.H. Jones T.L.Z. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although several suggestions have been made, the target for β/βγ action is unknown. More recently, in C. elegans embryos, Gβ was shown to be localized to the region of asters just before and during cell division and to be required for proper orientation of the early cell division axis (8Zwaal R.R.

Gβ, which was found in cell membranes, from the two-cell stage onwards appeared to be concentrated at the contact between cells. Should βγ become activated subsequent to cell-cell contact, the resulting regulation of microtubule assembly and dynamics could orchestrate certain developmental programs. In addition to βγ, G protein α subunits have been suggested to be associated with several subcellular compartments including microtubules (9Lin C.-T. Wu H.-C. Cheng H.-F. Chang J.T. Lab.

The family of tubulin proteins (α, β, and γ) which binds and hydrolyzes GTP, but fails to show G protein consensus motifs, may be included in a broad spectrum of a GTPase superfamily (42Saga C.R.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10957-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, Gα has been shown to activate tubulin GTPase and inhibit microtubule assembly in a GTP-dependent fashion. 2S. Roychowdhury and M. M. Rasenick, unpublished observation. Inhibition and stimulation of microtubule assembly by activated Gα and Gβγ, in a concerted manner, might lead to microtubule reorganization in vivo. Such a process could induce localized changes in cell shape and might represent an important element in hormone or neurotransmitter signaling. Cellular microtubules exhibit a highly dynamic behavior and are involved in multiple functions including chromosome movement in cell division, the organelle transport within the cell, and the maintenance of cell morphology (44Dustin P Microtubules. Springer-Verlag, New York1984Crossref Google Scholar, 45Avila J. Microtubule Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar, 46Timasheff S.N. Grisham L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 565-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In general, the biological function of microtubules are based on the ability of tubulin to polymerize and depolymerize. Although results from different laboratories suggest the involvement of Ca2+, cAMP, Mg2+, GTP, and several MAPs in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, precise spatial and temporal control of the process is unknown. The data presented here point toward G proteins as a physiological regulator for microtubule assembly and dynamics. These data further suggest a role for membrane-associated βγ, perhaps as a focal point for microtubule-membrane interaction. Extracellular signals to G protein-coupled receptors could modify a variety of microtubule-dependent events, using G proteins themselves as a second messenger. Regulation of microtubule assembly by Gβγ may provide an alternative pathway by which G proteins function in cellular signaling. We thank A. G. Gilman, T. Kozasa, J. Hepler, H. Hamm, N. Skiba, and D.

To characterize the molecular interactions involved in eIF5 function, we have used 32P-labeled recombinant rat eIF5 as a probe in filter overlay assay to identify eIF5-interacting proteins in crude initiation factor preparations. We observed that eIF5 specifically interacted with the β subunit of initiation factor eIF2. No other initiation factors including the γ subunit of eIF2 tested positive in this assay. Furthermore, both yeast and mammalian eIF5 bind to the β subunit of either mammalian or yeast eIF2. Binding analysis with human eIF2β deletion mutants expressed inEscherichia coli identified a 22-amino acid domain, between amino acids 68 and 89, as the primary eIF5-binding region of eIF2β. These results along with our earlier observations that (a) eIF5 neither binds nor hydrolyzes free GTP or GTP bound as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex, and (b) eIF5 forms a specific complex with eIF2 suggests that the specific interaction between eIF5 and the β subunit of eIF2 may be critical for the hydrolysis of GTP during translation initiation.

Initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells occurs by a sequence of partial reactions requiring the participation of a large number of specific proteins called eukaryotic (translation) initiation factors (eIFs). 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; GST, glutathione S-transferase. An obligatory intermediate step in this overall initiation reaction is the binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAf) as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to a 40 S ribosomal subunit, followed by positioning of the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) at the initiation AUG codon of the mRNA to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). A 60 S subunit then joins the 40 S initiation complex to form the 80 S initiation complex (80 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAf) that is active in peptidyl transfer (for a review, see Refs. 1Maitra U. Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 869-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B.

The subunit joining reaction specifically requires the participation of eIF5, an initiation factor that we have purified and characterized from mammalian cells (4Raychaudhuri P. Chaudhuri A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5754-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed characterization of the eIF5-catalyzed reaction has shown that eIF5 first interacts with the 40 S initiation complex in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits to promote the hydrolysis of ribosome-bound GTP (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of GTP causes the release of eIF2 and guanine nucleotide (as an eIF2·GDP complex) from the 40 S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S complex (40 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAf) to form the 80 S initiation complex that is active in subsequent peptidyl transfer reaction (8Chakrabarti A.

The mammalian cDNA (rat and human) and the S. cerevisiaegene encoding eIF5 of calculated M r = 48,926 and 45,346, respectively, have been cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli (12Das K. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3058-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Chaudhuri J. Das K. Maitra U.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the derived amino acid sequences of mammalian (rat and human) and yeast eIF5 proteins is the presence of sequence motifs that have weak homology to characteristic domains present in proteins of the GTPase superfamily (16Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar) which includes the α subunit of G-proteins, H-Ras and Rab 3A, yeast proteins, CDC42 and SEC4, as well as translation initiation and elongation factors, IF2 and EF1A (formerly called EFTu), EF2 (formerly called EFG), and EF1α. However, unlike these proteins, eIF5 neither binds nor hydrolyzes free GTP or GTP bound to eIF2 as a Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF5 mediates hydrolysis of GTP only when the nucleotide is bound to eIF2 on the 40 S initiation complex containing bound Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The key question therefore is whether interaction of eIF5 with one or more components of the 40 S initiation complex is required for GTP hydrolysis during translation initiation. In the work presented in this paper, we have used32P-labeled mammalian eIF5 as a probe in filter overlay (“far Western”) assays to demonstrate that eIF5 specifically and directly interacts with the β subunit of eIF2. Similar interaction between yeast eIF5 and yeast eIF2 β was also observed. By systematic deletion analysis, the region of the β subunit of eIF2 involved in binding eIF5 was characterized. The implications of this specific interaction between eIF5 and the β subunit of eIF2 in the eIF5-mediated hydrolysis of GTP during translation initiation are discussed. Purified eIF2 and eIF5 from rabbit reticulocyte lysates as well as recombinant rat eIF5 were isolated as described (6Chevesich J. Chaudhuri J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20659-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chaudhuri J. Das K. Maitra U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12964-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast eIF5 and yeast eIF2 were purified from S. cerevisiae strain, BJ926 as described by Chakravarti et al. (7Chakravarti D. Maiti T. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5754-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IgG antibodies specific for each of the subunits of rabbit eIF2 were isolated from specific rabbit antisera raised against purified rabbit eIF2 (17Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12964-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by affinity purification using each of the subunits of eIF2 blotted onto aminophenyl thioether paper (Schleicher and Schuell) as an antigen as described (18Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for the β subunit of yeast eIF2 were a kind gift of Dr. Thomas Donahue of Indiana University. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described (18Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-GST antibodies made in mouse were a kind gift from Charles Weaver of our institution. The human cDNA corresponding to the γ subunit of eIF2 (eIF2γ-cDNA) was cloned by immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA expression library in phage ZAPII (Stratagene) using affinity purified polyclonal anti-eIF2γ antibodies as probe. The 1.511-kilobase pair cDNA insert present in the recombinant phage was isolated by in vivo excision as a subclone in the plasmid pBlueScript-SK(+) (19.Das, K., (1995) Molecular Cloning and Expression of Mammalian Translation Initiation Factors Involved in the Binding and Hydrolysis of GTP. Ph.D. thesis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.Google Scholar). This cDNA insert contained nucleotide sequences that corresponded to the complete open reading frame of the γ subunit of eIF2 (nucleotide + 1 to +1417) as well as a 12-nucleotide long 5′-untranslated region and part of the 3′-untranslated region (19.Das, K., (1995) Molecular Cloning and Expression of Mammalian Translation Initiation Factors Involved in the Binding and Hydrolysis of GTP. Ph.D. thesis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame with a calculatedM r of 51,167 matched completely with that reported by Gaspar et al. (20Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M. Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3415-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using primers bearing the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of eIF2γ-coding sequences that were flanked by NdeI and EcoRI sites, the eIF2γ-open reading frame was PCR-amplified, and the PCR product was digested withNdeI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pRSET-B vector (Invitrogen) to generate the construct pRSET-eIF2γ (designated pRSET-2γ). For expression of the β subunit of human eIF2, the open reading frame of human eIF2β cDNA (21Pathak V. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of HeLa poly(A)+ RNA using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the eIF2β-cDNA (21Pathak V. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The N-terminal primer had BamHI-NdeI sites at the 5′ end, and the C-terminal primer had an EcoRI overhang. The 1002-base pair long PCR product was sequenced to ensure error-free DNA synthesis and cloned individually into the (a)NdeI/EcoRI sites of pET-5a plasmid (Novagen) and (b) BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate the expression plasmids, pET-5a-eIF2β (designated pET-2β) and pGEX-2T-eIF2β (designated pGEX-2β), respectively. Deletion mutants of eIF2β were generated by one-stage PCR amplification of eIF2β cDNA sequences using pET-2β as the template. The appropriate sense strand oligonucleotide primers used for this reaction had BamHI-NdeI overhangs, thereby introducing an in-frame methionine codon at the N-terminal end, and the antisense oligonucleotide primer corresponding to the C-terminal end of eIF2β introduced a translation stop codon followed by an EcoRI restriction site. ABamHI/EcoRI restriction fragment of each PCR-amplified eIF2β deletion mutant was inserted at the same restriction sites of the vector pGEX-2T. The resulting constructs expressed deleted eIF2β mutants as GST fusion proteins. The mutant β construct, β (K2 → A2) in which the polylysine stretch 79KKKKKKTKK87, designatedK2, present in wild-type β was substituted with a polyalanine stretch 79AAAAAATAA87, was generated by a three-fragment ligation as follows. The strategy was to generate a NotI site (G↓CGGCCGC) at the position of the polylysine stretch, flanked by GC-rich sequences encoding the amino acid residue alanine whose codons are GCC or GCG. Fragment 1 consisted of a PCR product corresponding to the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1–80) of eIF2β in which a NotI site was introduced at the 3′ end. The sense strand primer had anNdeI site, whereas the antisense primer used was 5′-GGCGGCCGCGGCGGCGGCTTGATTAAAGAAG-3′ (the underlined sequence represents the NotI site). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and NotI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragment 2 consisted of a PCR product corresponding to the remainder of eIF2β (amino acid residues 81–333) in which a NotI site was introduced at the 5′ end of the PCR fragment. The N-terminal primer used for the PCR was 5′-GGCGGCCGCCACTGCCGCCATATTTGATATT-3′, and the C-terminal primer had a downstream EcoRI site. This PCR product was digested with NotI and EcoRI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Purified fragments 1 and 2 were then ligated into pET-5a that had been cut with NdeI andEcoRI. Similar three-fragment ligation strategy was used to construct the mutant β fragments β (K1 → A1) and β (K3 → A3) in which the polylysine stretches K1(14KKKKKKKK21) and K3(124KKKKKK129) present in wild-type β were substituted with polyalanine stretches A1(14AAAAAAAA21) and A3(124AAAAAA129), respectively. For β (K1 → A1), the N-terminal fragment was generated by annealing complementary strands of oligonucleotides corresponding to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of eIF2β, and the NotI site was generated at the position of K1, whereas for β (K3 → A3) the N-terminal fragment of 127 amino acids was PCR-amplified and the NotI site was generated at the position of K3. For construction of mutant β (K2 → A2 and K3 → A3), where both the polylysine stretchesK2 and K3 in eIF2β were substituted with polyalanine stretches A2 and A3, the construct pET-5a-eIF2β (K3 → A3) was digested withAflII and EcoRI. The enzyme AflII cuts the recombinant vector at a unique restriction site between the two polylysine stretches K2 and K3 in eIF2β, whereas EcoRI cuts it at a site immediately following the C terminus of eIF2β. The AflII-EcoRI fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and ligated into the gel-purified vector fragment obtained by digesting pET-5a-eIF2β (K2 → A2) with AflII and EcoRI. All constructs were sequenced using U.S. Biochemical Corp. kit to ensure error-free DNA synthesis. The pET5a-eIF2β series of plasmids containing either the wild-type or mutant eIF2β coding sequence and pRSET-eIF2γ plasmid containing the coding sequence of eIF2γ were transformed individually into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, whereas the pGEX-2T-eIF2β series of plasmids in which the coding sequence of wild-type or mutant eIF2β was fused at its N terminus to GST were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). In each case, a single ampicillin-resistant colony was grown to mid-logarithmic phase in 3 ml of 2YT medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), induced with 1 mm IPTG, and grown for an additional 2–3 h. The cells were centrifuged and bacterial pellets suspended directly in 1 × Laemmli buffer and boiled for 4 min at 100 °C, and the proteins in the boiled extract were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (15%) gel electrophoresis. The GST or GST-eIF2β fusion protein was isolated by inducing E. coli DH5α cells harboring either the pGEX-2T or pGEX-2T-eIF2β plasmids as described above. The harvested cells were suspended (at approximatelyA 600 = 1.0) in buffer A (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml)) and sonicated 10 times for 20 s each with cooling on ice between bursts. Following addition of Triton X to 1% final concentration, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The lysate containing either GST or GST fusion protein was incubated with pre-equilibrated glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) in buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer. The amount of protein present in the washed beads containing either GST or GST-eIF2β fusion protein was measured by Bio-Rad method. The beads were stored in small aliquots at −70 °C until use. Recombinant rat eIF5 (20 μg) was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol) and casein kinase II in a reaction mixture similar to that described previously for phosphorylation of rabbit reticulocyte eIF5 (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).32P-Labeled eIF5 was isolated by subjecting the reaction mixture to phosphocellulose chromatography as described (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar procedures were used to prepare 32P-labeled yeast eIF5. It should be noted that eIF5 phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II retains full in vitro activity (18Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF5 binding proteins were identified by an adaptation of the procedure previously used by Bregman et al. (23Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. Protein samples were subjected to electrophoretic separation in 0.1% SDS, 15% polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane blot was first rinsed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mmNaCl (TBS) and then placed in TBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk (Blotto) and shaken gently for about 1 h. The blot was then incubated with 32P-labeled eIF5 (∼106 cpm of radioactivity in 20 ml of fresh Blotto) for about 12 h at 4 °C, after which it was washed for 15 min with 20 ml of Blotto containing 0.05% Tween 20. This washing step was repeated once more. Finally, the blot was washed twice with 20 ml of TBS, air-dried, and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak BIOMAX-MR/X-OMAT films at −70 °C to visualize the binding of 32P-labeled eIF5 to proteins. A typical binding reaction mixture consisted of 200 μl of buffer A, 20 μl of a 30% suspension of GSH beads containing about 4 μg of bound protein, and 4 μl of purified 32P-labeled eIF5 (50 ng of protein containing about 50,000 cpm of radioactivity). The reaction mixture was gently mixed in a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged to separate the unbound proteins from the bound proteins. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min and then resuspended in 20 μl of 1% SDS-gel loading buffer. Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 3 min and separated on 0.1% SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. To identify eIF5-interacting protein(s), partially purified initiation factor preparations obtained from rabbit reticulocyte lysates as well as a crude cell-free HeLa cell extract were subjected to far Western blot analysis using32P-labeled eIF5 as probe (as explained under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1,panel A, shows that in partially purified initiation factor preparations obtained from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (lanes a and b), as well as in HeLa cell extract (lane c), a single major polypeptide band that migrated with an apparentM r of about 54,000 specifically interacted with32P-labeled eIF5. When similar far Western blot analysis was carried out with purified initiation factors,32P-labeled eIF5 probe detected the 54-kDa polypeptide only in purified eIF2 and in eIF2·eIF2B preparations (Fig. 1, panel B). Other initiation factors, e.g. eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF6, did not test positive in this interaction assay (only the data for the multi-subunit protein eIF3 is shown in Fig. 1,panel B). To identify the subunit of eIF2 that specifically interacted with eIF5, we carried out immunoblot analysis of purified eIF2 and eIF2·eIF2B preparations using total anti-eIF2 antibodies as probes (Fig. 1,panel C). Comparison of the relative mobilities of the three immunoreactive polypeptides of eIF2 (Fig. 1, panel C) with that of the eIF5-interacting polypeptide in purified eIF2 and eIF2·eIF2B preparations (panel B) suggested that the eIF5-interacting 54-kDa polypeptide may be the β subunit of eIF2. It should be noted that in this gel system, while the γ subunit of eIF2 of calculated M r = 51,800 (19.Das, K., (1995) Molecular Cloning and Expression of Mammalian Translation Initiation Factors Involved in the Binding and Hydrolysis of GTP.

Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) migrated with an apparentM r of about 54,000 (17Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12964-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirmation that the eIF5-interacting protein was indeed the β subunit of eIF2 was derived from the following observations. First, the open reading frame of human eIF2 β-cDNA (21Pathak V. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the E. coli expression plasmid, pET-5a under the control of T7 RNA polymerase promoter. When E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, harboring the pET5a-eIF2β (pET-2β) expression plasmid induced with IPTG and proteins in induced cell lysates, were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-eIF2β antibodies as probes, the synthesis of eIF2β was easily observed (Fig. 2,panel A, lane c). The same polypeptide interacted with32P-labeled eIF5 when these induced cell lysates were subjected to far Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, panel B, lane c) which comigrated with the same mobility as the eIF5-reacting band of eIF2 (Fig. 2, panel B, lane a). In contrast, no eIF5-interacting polypeptide was detected in E. coli cell lysates that did not synthesize the β subunit of eIF2 (Fig. 2, compare lane b of panel A with lane bof panel B). It should be noted here that bacterially expressed eIF2β undergoes proteolytic degradation. The lower molecular weight eIF5-reacting band in panel B (lane c) is very likely an N-terminal fragment of eIF2β which is weakly detected in immunoblot analysis (panel A, lane c) as the anti-eIF2 antibodies recognize the N terminus of eIF2β very poorly. Additionally, when lysates of E. coli cells overexpressing the γ subunit of eIF2 were subjected to far Western blot analysis, 32P-labeled eIF5 probe did not detect any eIF5-interacting polypeptide band (Fig. 2, compare lane d(panel A) with lane d (panel B)). These results demonstrate that eIF5 specifically interacted with the β subunit of eIF2. The interaction of eIF5 with the non-denatured form of eIF2β was explored by cloning the coding region of eIF2β-cDNA into the pGEX-2T expression vector so as to express eIF2β as a GST-eIF2β fusion protein in E. coli DH5α cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The GST-eIF2β fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and tested for its ability to bind 32P-labeled eIF5. Fig. 2, panel C, shows that eIF5 was specifically retained on beads coupled to GST-eIF2β but was not bound to GSH-Sepharose beads linked to GST alone. Thus, eIF5 forms a specific complex even with the non-denatured form of β subunit of eIF2. It is now well established that the basic mechanism of translation initiation is highly conserved from the unicellular yeast to mammals. If the interaction between eIF5 and the β subunit of eIF2 plays an essential role in the function of eIF5 in mammalian translation initiation, such an interaction should also occur in the yeast system. To determine whether yeast eIF5 and yeast eIF2β subunit interact with each other, we performed far Western blot analysis of a purified yeast eIF2 preparation using 32P-labeled yeast eIF5 as probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.3, panel A, (lane c), shows that 32P-labeled eIF5 interacted with a single polypeptide band in the purified yeast eIF2 preparation. This eIF5-interacting polypeptide migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as the β subunit of yeast eIF2 as determined by Western blot analysis of purified yeast eIF2 using anti-yeast eIF2β antibodies as probe (Fig. 3, panel A, lane b). The position of the α (M r = 34,700), β (M r = 31,600), and γ (M r = 57,900) subunits of yeast eIF2 are shown in Fig. 3, panel A (lane a). Furthermore, in agreement with the functional homology between mammalian and yeast eIF5 in vivo (24Maiti T. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18333-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in vitro (15Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Maiti T. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18333-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we observed that 32P-labeled rat eIF5 also bound yeast eIF2β (Fig. 3, panel B) and32P-labeled yeast eIF5 bound mammalian eIF2β (Fig. 3,panel C). These results suggest that the interaction domains of eIF5 and the β subunit of eIF2 are conserved through evolution. To map the region of human eIF2β involved in the binding of eIF5, appropriate PCR primers were used to amplify shorter fragments of the human eIF2β coding sequence. The wild-type eIF2β coding region as well as the PCR-amplified eIF2β cDNA fragments were cloned into the inducible tac promoter-based pGEX-2T expression vector. Since anti-eIF2β antibodies do not recognize the N-terminal region of eIF2β (presumably because the polyclonal antibodies were primarily directed against the C-terminal region of eIF2β), we tagged truncated eIF2β fragments to GST to enable easy detection in immunoblots with anti-GST antibodies as probe. The pGEX-2T expression plasmids were introduced into E. coli DH5α cells, and the cell extracts of IPTG-induced bacteria were then monitored for expression of GST-fused wild-type and truncated eIF2β by Western blot analysis using anti-GST antibodies as probe (Fig.4, panel B). Initially, the effects of the N-terminal truncations of eIF2β on its ability to interact with eIF5 were examined. Fig. 4, panel B, shows the expression pattern of wild-type eIF2β as well as the two N-terminal truncated eIF2β polypeptides, GST-β-(27–333) and GST-β-(154–333). All three fusion proteins were partially purified through glutathione-Sepharose columns, and during the purification process these proteins underwent extensive degradation. Deletion mutants of eIF2β showed anomalous migration similar to the wild-type protein. When these expressed polypeptides were examined for their ability to bind 32P-labeled eIF5 by far Western blot analysis, the binding ability of the mutant GST-β-(27–333) was found to be comparable to that of the wild-type GST-eIF2β (Fig. 4,panel C). In contrast, when amino acids 1–153 were deleted from eIF2β, GST-β-(154–333) failed to interact with eIF5. These results suggested that the region between amino acids 27 and 154 of eIF2β is involved in the binding of eIF5. As expected, GST alone did not bind 32P-labeled eIF5 (Fig. 4,panel C). To delimit further the eIF5-interacting region, we carried out a combination of C-terminal and N-terminal deletions of eIF2β as shown in Fig. 4, panel A. When E. coli cell lysates containing equivalent amounts of truncated eIF2β polypeptides fused to GST (Fig. 4, panel B) were examined for their ability to bind 32P-labeled eIF5 (Fig. 4, panel C) the following results were obtained. Deletion of 163 amino acids from the C terminus of eIF2β did not affect the ability of the resultant mutant GST-β-(1–170) fusion protein to bind 32P-labeled eIF5. Further deletion of amino acids 1–26 from β-(1–170) did not affect the binding ability of the fusion protein β-(27–170) to32P-labeled eIF5. However, in the context of β-(1–170), when amino acids 1–87 were deleted, the resulting GST-β-(88–170) fusion protein interacted very weakly with eIF5 compared with GST-β-(1–170). The GST-β-(27–123) fusion protein was also recognized by eIF5 quite efficiently although slightly less than β-(27–170), whereas the GST-β-(88–123) fusion protein did not interact with eIF5. Taken together, these results suggested that the region of eIF2β encompassing amino acids 27–87 is sufficient for conferring major eIF5-binding properties to eIF2β. This was confirmed by showing that GST-β-(27–89) bound 32P-labeled eIF5 very efficiently. The eIF5-binding region of eIF2β was further delimited by showing that the deletion mutant GST-β-(68–95) bound32P-labeled eIF5 quite efficiently. Thus, the eIF5-binding region of eIF2β is a 22-amino acid stretch that lies between amino acids 68 and 89, whereas the region between amino acids 124 and 170 also had low eIF5 binding activity. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of human eIF2β with those from other species showed the presence of three highly conserved stretches of six to eight lysine residues, designated K1 (amino acids 14–21), K2(amino acids 79–87), and K3 (amino acids 124–129) in the N-terminal region of eIF2β (Fig. 5). The minimal eIF5-binding region (amino acids 68–89) of eIF2β contains the conserved polylysine stretch K2, whereas the region comprising amino acids 124–170 which exhibits low eIF5 binding activity contains the conserved polylysine stretchK3 (Fig. 5). To investigate the role of these lysine-rich domains of eIF2β in eIF5 binding, we substituted each polylysine stretch with a polyalanine stretch of the same length as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.6, left panel, shows that all the mutant proteins were expressed in comparable amounts. Substitution of the polylysine stretch K2 of eIF2β with a polyalanine stretch A2 in the mutant β (K2 → A2) reduced by about 4-fold (from that for wild-type eIF2β) the binding affinity of 32P-labeled eIF5 (Fig. 6, right panel, compare lane a with lane c) as determined by densitometric scanning (not shown). In contrast, the mutants β (K1 → A1) and β (K3 → A3) in which the polylysine stretches K1 and K3 have been replaced by polyalanine stretches A1 and A3, respectively, showed no significant change in their ability to bind32P-labeled eIF5 (Fig. 6, right panel,lanes b and d). Furthermore, when both the polylysine stretches K2 and K3 were replaced with the polyalanine stretches A2 andA3, the resulting β mutant β (K2 → A2,K3 → A3) had similar reduced binding ability to32P-labeled eIF5 as β (K2 → A2) (Fig. 6,right panel, lane e). These results suggest that the polylysine stretch K2, which lies in the minimal eIF5-binding region comprising amino acids 68–89 of eIF2β, is required for optimal eIF5 binding.Figure 6Effect of substitution of conserved polylysine stretches with polyalanine stretches in eIF2β on its eIF5 binding property. Crude extracts of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells expressing equivalent levels of wild-type and mutant eIF2β proteins were boiled in 1 × Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of sample were loaded onto two separate gels run simultaneously and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. One blot was analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-eIF2 antibodies as probes (left panel), and the other blot was subjected to far Western analysis using 32P-labeled eIF5 as probe (right panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GTP/GDP cycle involved in eukaryotic translation initiation resembles many aspects of prokaryotic translation initiation (1Maitra U.

Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). An important feature of these GTP-binding proteins is that they all possess intrinsic GTPase activity which is often stimulated by their interaction either with an appropriate acceptor or a separate protein molecule. For example, in both prokaryotic translation initiation and elongation, the GTP-bound form of IF2 and EF1A mediates the transfer of fMet-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNAs, respectively, to ribosomes with the concomitant hydrolysis of GTP (1Maitra U. Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 869-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been observed that both IF2 and EF1A have very low intrinsic GTPase activities that are activated when the GTP-bound form of the proteins interact with 50 S ribosomal subunits that act as effectors of GTPase activity (25Fasano O. De Vendittis E.D. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3145-3150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, in eukaryotic translation initiation, eIF2·GTP is directly involved in transferring Met-tRNAf to a 40 S ribosomal subunit to form the 40 S initiation complex. However, hydrolysis of GTP is not activated by the interaction of the 60 S ribosomal subunit with the 40 S initiation complex. Rather, prior to the joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, eIF5 interacts with the 40 S initiation complex in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits to promote GTP hydrolysis (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Peterson D.T. Safer B. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7730-7735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The key question, therefore, concerning the role of eIF5 in translation initiation is the mechanism by which the interaction of this factor with the 40 S initiation complex causes the hydrolysis of bound GTP. Previous results on the properties of mammalian eIF5 (8Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that eIF5, by itself, does not hydrolyze either free GTP or GTP bound to the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex in the absence of 40 S ribosomal subunit. These results suggest that eIF5 does not directly interact with GTP to catalyze its hydrolysis. Rather, it is likely that the interaction of eIF5 with the 40 S initiation complex causes a conformational change in the 40 S subunit-bound eIF2 which then acts as a GTPase catalyzing the hydrolysis of bound GTP. In this sense, eIF5 acts as a GTPase-activating protein, and both this initiation factor and possibly 40 S ribosomal subunit act as effectors in GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by eIF2 during translation initiation. According to this hypothesis, protein-protein interaction between eIF5 and the 40 S subunit bound-eIF2 may be critical for the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex. Such an interaction between eIF2 and eIF5 has been directly demonstrated (13Chaudhuri J. Das K. Maitra U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Experiments presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that interaction of eIF5 with eIF2 occurs through the β subunit of eIF2. This observation was somewhat unexpected in view of the recent demonstration that the γ subunits of both mammalian and yeast eIF2 contain consensus GTP-binding domains (19.Das, K., (1995) Molecular Cloning and Expression of Mammalian Translation Initiation Factors Involved in the Binding and Hydrolysis of GTP. Ph.D. thesis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.Google Scholar, 20Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M. Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 506-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this subunit of eIF2 is presumably involved in guanine nucleotide binding although this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In proteins of the GTPase superfamily, the subunit that binds GTP also possesses the latent GTPase activity that is activated by its interaction with an effector molecule (16Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). We, therefore, expected eIF5, the effector protein to interact directly with the γ subunit of eIF2. It is likely, however, that interaction of eIF5 with the β subunit of eIF2 induces a conformational change in the eIF2 molecule resulting in the activation of the latent GTPase activity of the γ subunit which in conjunction with the 40 S ribosomal subunit can then act as a GTPase hydrolyzing the bound GTP. Further work is clearly necessary to understand the mechanism of eIF5-mediated hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex. We have characterized a 22-amino acid region in the human eIF2β (amino acids 68–89) which appears necessary and sufficient for interaction with eIF5 although the region encompassing amino acids 124–170 also has some weak eIF5 binding activity and may, in fact, be required for optimal binding of eIF5 to eIF2β. Experiments presented in this paper also demonstrate that the polylysine stretchK2, 79KKKKKKTKK87, present in the primary eIF5-binding region of eIF2β is critical for binding eIF5. The polylysine stretch K3, present in the secondary eIF5-binding region was, however, found to be non-essential for binding. In agreement with these results, the polylysine stretchK2 has been found to be conserved in all species of eIF2β so far examined, and the polylysine stretch K3 is absent in wheat eIF2β (28Metz A.M. Browning K.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Further mutational analysis in the eIF5-binding region of eIF2β is clearly necessary to identify the critical amino acid residues involved in the interaction of eIF5 with eIF2β. It will also be important to carry out systematic deletion and point mutations in eIF5 and use the mutant proteins both for their ability to bind eIF2β as well as in mediating the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex. These studies will then allow us to correlate the binding of eIF5 to eIF2 (through the β subunit) with the function of eIF5 in GTP hydrolysis during translation initiation. These studies are currently underway in our laboratory. Finally, scanning the available sequence data base for eIF2β and eIF5 from a wide variety of eukaryotic species revealed a high degree of sequence conservation between the N-terminal region of eIF5 and the C-terminal region of eIF2β (Fig. 7). This sequence conservation spanned over a stretch of about 95 amino acid residues. The significance of this sequence conservation between the two proteins which have distinct functions in translation initiation is not completely clear. However, it is tempting to speculate that this conserved region in each protein may be involved in binding to a common component of the translation initiation machinery, perhaps the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Additionally, we also observed that eIF5 from different species has a conserved zinc finger motif of the type Cys-X 2-Cys-X 19-Cys-X 2-Cys (Fig. 7). The presence of a similar zinc finger motif in yeast eIF2β has been implicated in ribosomal start site selection during the scanning process in which eIF2 plays an important role (29Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Valavicius B.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The significance of the presence of such a sequence motif in both mammalian and yeast eIF5 is currently unknown. We are indebted to Dr. Charles Rubin and Dr. Jayanta Chaudhuri for many stimulating discussions during the course of this study and the preparation of this manuscript."

Both experimental evidence and theoretical approaches support the involvement of electrostatic interactions in the association of triple-helices to form fibrils and in the binding of various molecules to collagen (19Hulmes D.J.S.

Kühn K. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 293-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, Glu is preferentially found in the X position, whereas Arg and Lys are preferentially found in the Yposition. It has been suggested that these positional preferences may be related to ion pair formation (14Salem G. Traub W. FEBS Lett. 1975; 51: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Traub W.

In this report, a host-guest peptide set is used to assess the contributions of single charged residues and ion-pairs to triple-helix stability. Peptides with glycine as every third residue and a high content of imino acids have been shown to form stable triple-helices (2Brodsky B. Ramshaw J.A.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 23Sakakibara S. Inouye K. Shudo K. Kishida Y. Kobayashi Y. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biopolymers. 1996; 40: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that peptides with one guest Gly-X-Y triplet introduced into a host structure of Gly-Pro-Hyp units form a stable triple-helix in which the stability varies with the guest triplet (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The four ionizable residues commonly found in collagens, Glu, Asp, Lys, and Arg, were introduced into the X and Y positions of a guest triplet individually or in oppositely charged pairs. The thermal stability of the triple-helix was found to depend strongly on the identity of the residue in the Y position but shows only a weak dependence on the specific residue in the X position. Ion-pairs do not appear to contribute a stabilizing effect in general but appear to be important when there is a basic residue in the X position and an Asp residue in the Y position. Peptides were purchased from SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA) or were synthesized in house on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using the standard FastMoc method onN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl-RINK resin. Side chain protection was tert-butyl for Hyp, tert-butyl ester for Asp and Glu, benzyloxycarbonyl for Lys, and pentamethylchroman-sulfonyl for Arg. Acetylation was performed with acetic anhydride and triethylamine in dimethylformide. Peptides were purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C-18 column eluted with a binary gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 0–40% (v/v) water/acetonitrile to >90% purity. Identity and purity of the peptides were confirmed by amino acid analysis using a Waters high pressure liquid chromatography system with ninhydrin detection and by laser desorption mass spectrometry. Peptides were dried in vacuoover P2O5 for at least 48 h before weighing. Samples for circular dichroism (CD) 2The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; T m , melting temperature. spectroscopy were prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and pH measurements were made at 20 °C. Peptides were dissolved in either 100 mmacetic acid (pH 2.7), phosphate buffer adjusted to the same ionic strength with NaCl (pH 7.0) or in 100 mm NaOH (pH 12.2). CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv Model 62DS spectropolarimeter with a Hewlett-Packard Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller. Samples were equilibrated at 4 °C for at least 48 h before measuring, and data were recorded in 1-mm path length cells. CD spectra were collected at 2 °C from 260 to 210 nm at 1 nm intervals with a 3 s recording time at each point. For melting curves, the ellipticity was monitored at 225 nm, and the sample temperature was raised from 2 to 70 °C in increments of 0.3 °C over a time span of 15 h. For (POG)10, renaturation curves were recorded upon cooling with the same rate in temperature change. T m values evaluated from de- and renaturation curves varied by less than 0.5 °C, and final ellipticities after cooling differed form the starting value by less than 20% indicating nearly complete reversibility. A decrease of the heating rate by a factor of two, as measured for two host guest peptides, resulted in a decrease of 1–2 °C in Tm suggesting that the chosen conditions represent near equilibrium unfolding. 3N. K. Shah, personal communication. Melting curves were analyzed assuming a two-state, trimer ↔ monomer transition model. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation on similar triple-helical peptides supports a two-state model (26Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the first derivative of all melting curves showed a single gaussian-shaped minimum. All but 2 of the 16 peptides in this study fit a two-state model well (see “Results”). For the two-state model, the folding of three chains to the triple-helix conformation can be described by (27Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)3u↔nEquation 1 where u and n denote the unfolded (monomeric) and folded (trimeric) state, respectively. Thus the equilibrium constant K isK=cncu3=F3c02(1−F)3Equation 2 where c 0 = c u + 3c n is the total peptide concentration andF = 3c n /c 0 is the fraction of folded peptide. F was determined asF = [θ − θ U (T)]/[θ N (T) − θ U (T)] where θ is the observed ellipticity and θ N and θ U are the ellipticities for the native and unfolded forms, respectively, corrected for their temperature dependence by linear extrapolation of the baselines observed at high and low temperatures (27Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The melting temperature was taken as the midpoint of the transition curve (F = 0.5). The standard enthalpy, ΔH 0 (van't Hoff), was calculated by fitting the transition curve to (27Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)K=expΔH0RTTTm−1−ln(0.75c02)Equation 3 The standard entropy, ΔS 0, was calculated accordingly asΔS0=ΔH0Tm−Rln(0.75c02)Equation 4 The standard (Gibb's) free energy, ΔG 0, was calculated for T = 298 K as ΔG 0 = ΔH 0 −TΔS 0. From repeated experiments on independently prepared samples, the error in the determination of ΔH 0 and thus the other derived thermodynamic parameters is estimated to be less than 10%. Host-guest peptides of the form Ac(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-X-Y-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH2have been shown to provide a useful template to evaluate the contribution of individual Gly-X-Y triplets to triple-helix properties (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The N and C termini are blocked with acetyl and amide groups, respectively, ensuring that the only ionizable groups would be those introduced in the Gly-X-Yguest triplet. In this study, the contributions of the four ionizable residues Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg to triple-helix stability were investigated by inclusion in the guest triplet of host-guest peptides. In the first set of peptides, these residues were placed in theX position with Hyp in the Y position. In a second set, these residues were introduced in the Y position of the guest triplet with Pro in the X position. Furthermore, pairs of oppositely charged residues were introduced asX and Y in the Gly-X-Yguest triplet, generating a set of another 8 peptides. Ionizable residues were introduced into the Xposition of the guest triplet, with a Hyp in the Y position, generating peptides containing Gly-Glu-Hyp, Gly-Asp-Hyp, Gly-Lys-Hyp, and Gly-Arg-Hyp. At low temperature, CD spectra showed the characteristic shape of the triple-helix conformation, with a maximum near 225 nm. Monitoring the ellipticity at 225 nm with increasing temperature results in a sharp transition in all cases (Fig.1), which has been previously shown to represent a trimer to monomer transition (26Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The melting temperatures of the 4 peptides varied slightly, ranging from T m = 40.1 °C to 42.9 °C (Table I). The small variation in the melting temperature indicates that the identity of the ionizable residue in the X position has only a small influence on stability.Table IThermodynamic parameters of Gly-X-Hyp and Gly-Pro-Y host-guest peptidespHPeptide guestT mΔH 0ΔS 0ΔG 0Peptide guestT mΔH 0ΔS 0ΔG 0°CkJ/molkJ/mol KkJ/mol°CkJ/molkJ/mol KkJ/mol7.4GAO39.9−420−1.2−60GPA38.3−360−1.00−54.42.7GDO37.6−540−1.6−61GPD33.1−590−1.8−557.040.1−520−1.5−6430.1−550−2.0−5612.238.0−560−1.6−6230.1−770−1.7−482.7GEO39.7−470−1.4−62GPE41.9−570−1.7−707.042.9−590−1.8−7339.7−630−1.9−6912.240.9−670−2.0−7438.5−640−1.9−672.7GKO40.4−510−1.5−64GPK1-aFitting of transition curves to Equation 3 shows significant deviations indicating a different unfolding process than the assumed two-state model.

Open table in a new tab CD melting curves were recorded at 225 nm at peptide concentrations of 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid (pH 2.7), 0.1 mphosphate buffered saline (pH 7.0) and 0.1 n NaOH (pH 12.2). Corresponding values for peptides containing Gly-Ala-Hyp and Gly-Pro-Ala are included for comparison (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of ionization, the thermal stabilities of these peptides were determined at pH 2.7, 7.0, and 12.2 (Table I). Conclusions about ionization effects cannot be drawn for peptides containing Arg as this residue is not in a fully uncharged form even at pH 12.2. All Gly-X-Hyp peptides had a higherT m at neutral, rather than acidic or basic pH. Ionization may increase stability, but additional factors must play a role since the melting temperatures for the Gly-Glu-Hyp and Gly-Asp-Hyp peptides are higher at pH 7.0 than at pH 12.2 even though Glu and Asp are ionized both at neutral and basic pH. Thermodynamic analyses were carried out to calculate the enthalpy change ΔH 0 assuming a two-state model. The Gly-X-Hyp peptides, where X is a charged residue, exhibit a greater enthalpic and smaller entropic contribution compared with Gly-Pro-Hyp and Gly-Ala-Hyp (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Table I). This is consistent with the proposal that polar residues in the X position of the guest triplet increase the hydrogen bonding potential and the order of the surrounding solvent network. Asp, Glu, Arg, and Lys residues were introduced into the Y position of the guest triplet, with Pro in the X position. These 4 peptides gave characteristic triple-helical CD spectra, and show melting temperatures between 30.1 °C (Gly-Pro-Asp) and 44.5 °C (Gly-Pro-Arg) at pH 7.0 (Fig.2; Table I). Except for Gly-Pro-Arg, each Gly-Pro-Y peptide is less stable than the corresponding Gly-X-Hyp peptide. With a range of ΔT m = 14.4 °C, the melting temperatures for the Gly-Pro-Ypeptides show a significantly greater variation than observed for the set of Gly-X-Hyp peptides (ΔT m = 1.6 °C). Thermodynamic analyses show that peptides containing Gly-Pro-Glu and Gly-Pro-Asp have very favorable enthalpic contributions to stability with a correspondingly unfavorable entropy value (Table I). The Gly-Pro-Lys and Gly-Pro-Arg peptides do not fit the two-state model well, despite repeated purification and melts. Nevertheless, enthalpy values were estimated from the closest fitting parameters. The approximate enthalpy of Gly-Pro-Lys and Gly-Pro-Arg is much less favorable than that observed for Gly-Pro-Glu and Gly-Pro-Asp, suggesting some differences in interactions (Table I). Comparison of the thermal stability of each Gly-Pro-Y peptide at pH 2.7, 7.0, and 12.2 suggests that ionization results in destabilization forY = Glu, Asp, and Lys, whereas the effect of ionization cannot be estimated for Y = Arg. Peptides were synthesized with Gly-X-Y guest triplets containing oppositely charged residues in positions X and Y, providing the eight combinations Gly-Asp-Lys, Gly-Asp-Arg, Gly-Glu-Lys, Gly-Glu-Arg, Gly-Lys-Asp, Gly-Lys-Glu, Gly-Arg-Asp, and Gly-Arg-Glu. Thermal stability measurements were carried out to investigate whether the presence of oppositely charged residues in adjacent positions modulates the contribution of individual residues. At low temperature, the 8 peptides formed stable triple-helices as indicated by positive maxima at 225 nm in the CD spectra. All peptides showed sharp transition curves, and at pH 7.0, the T m was within the range of 30.9 °C (Gly-Asp-Lys) to 40.4 °C (Gly-Glu-Arg) (Table II).Table IIThermodynamic parameters of Gly-X-Y host-guest peptides containing oppositely charged residuespHPeptide guestT mΔH 0ΔS 0ΔG 0Peptide guestT mΔH 0ΔS 0ΔG 0°CkJ/molkJ/mol KkJ/mol°CkJ/molkJ/mol KkJ/mol7.4GPO44.5−350−1.0−60GAA29.3−450−1.4−462.7GDK26.5−600−1.9−42GKD30.5−770−2.4−537.030.9−520−1.6−4935.8−720−2.2−6412.229.9−490−1.5−4730.2−720−2.3−522.7GDR33.4−550−1.7−54GRD28.8−720−2.3−497.037.1−580−1.7−6235.0−720−2.2−6312.234.4−460−1.3−5331.9−630−1.9−542.7GEK29.5−490−1.5−46GKE36.5−620−1.9−627.035.0−590−1.8−5835.3−630−1.9−6012.733.1−530−1.6−5331.6−680−2.1−542.7GER37.3−530−1.6−60GRE35.0−630−1.9−607.040.4−520−1.5−6433.8−680−2.1−5912.239.1−510−1.5−6232.2−710−2.2−56CD melting curves were recorded at 225 nm at peptide concentrations of 1 mg/ml. Corresponding values for peptides containing Gly-Pro-Hyp and Gly-Ala-Ala are included for comparison (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab CD melting curves were recorded at 225 nm at peptide concentrations of 1 mg/ml.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Comparison of the data indicates that a change in one residue can influence stability. For example, Gly-Glu-Lys is more stable than Gly-Asp-Lys (ΔT m = 4 °C). Reversal of the identity of the residues in the X and Y positions also affects the melting temperature. For instance, theT m of the peptide with the guest triplet Gly-Glu-Arg is more stable by 6 °C than that containing Gly-Arg-Glu. For two reversed pairs (Gly-Glu-Arg/Gly-Arg-Glu, Gly-Asp-Arg/Gly-Arg-Asp), the peptides with acidic residues in the X position and basic residue in the Y position were more stable, whereas Gly-Lys-Asp was found to be more stable than Gly-Asp-Lys. The stability of the Gly-Lys-Glu-containing peptide is essentially the same as that of the corresponding peptide with reversed charge distribution. To investigate the effect of the ionization state, the thermal stabilities were compared at pH 2.7, 7.0, and 12.2 (Table II). All peptides except Gly-Lys-Glu and Gly-Arg-Glu were most stable at pH 7.0, the pH range in which residues in both the X andY positions are ionized. The maximal stability at neutral pH is consistent with the formation of stabilizing ion-pairs. The thermodynamic parameters calculated for these peptides are summarized in Table II. The enthalpy was a stabilizing feature at all pH values, whereas the entropy was unfavorable compared with the host peptide containing only Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets. This investigation uses host-guest peptides to determine the propensity of ionizable residues for the triple-helix conformation in the different positions of the Gly-X-Y repeating unit. Previous studies have used host-guest peptides as well as leucine zipper peptide models to study the effect of ionizable residues in the coiled-coil α-helix (28O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.D. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 29Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1995; 268: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which, besides the triple-helix, is the other basic protein conformation of fibrous proteins consisting of supercoiled helical subunits (30Brodsky B. Gierasch L.M. King J. Protein Folding. American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington1990: 55-62Google Scholar, 31Cohen C. Parry D.A.D.

Interpretation of the results on the coiled-coil α-helix requires consideration of interactions of charged side chains with the intrinsic helix dipole, as well as the potential of oppositely charged ionizable residues to form internal ion-pairs if in appropriate positions (33Shoemaker K.R. Kim P.S. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1987; 326: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Merutka G. Stellwagen E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Scholtz J.M. Qian H. Robbins V.H. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9668-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In contrast to the α-helix, in the triple-helix no net dipole results from the peptide backbone as the amide and carbonyl groups are perpendicular to the triple-helix axis and are distributed in a symmetrical fashion (36Wada A. Adv. Biophys. 1976; 9: 1-63Google Scholar). In the absence of interactions with an intrinsic dipole, ionizable residues in the triple-helix can participate in ion-pair formation or in hydrogen bonding to unsatisfied backbone carbonyl groups (37Vitagliano L. Nemethy G. Zagari A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7354-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The polar side chains may also participate in the highly ordered hydration network that has been found for the collagen triple-helix (12Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 893-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The comparison of the four Gly-X-Hyp host-guest peptides with previous studies indicates that ionizable residues in theX position are only marginally less favorable than proline in that position and somewhat more stable than X=Ala (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The favorable enthalpy values for these Gly-X-Hyp peptides relative to Gly-Pro-Hyp and Gly-Ala-Hyp suggest participation of the side chains in hydrogen bonding. Model building shows that Lys, Arg, and Glu side chains can form hydrogen bonds with available backbone carbonyl groups within the same chain or with neighboring chains, whereas the shorter side chain of Asp cannot (Fig. 4). The polar groups of all four side chains are fully accessible to solvent. The insensitivity of thermal stability to the identity of the residue in the X position suggests that either solvent exposure or backbone hydrogen bonding results in favorable enthalpic stabilization. The less favorable entropy values for the Gly-X-Hyp set relative to Gly-Pro-Hyp and Gly-Ala-Hyp is consistent with increased conformational constraints on the more flexible ionizable side chains in the triple-helical state or increased order of hydration. The charged forms of these peptides are more stabilizing than the uncharged forms. The lack of any destabilizing effect of having the same charges in the X positions of three chains in the same molecule must result from favorable side chain orientation in the triple-helix, pointing outward in near optimal directions for minimizing charge repulsion (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Schematics showing the steric positions of ionizable residues in the collagen triple-helix. A, a cross-section of the 72 triple-helix, as found in the triple-helix crystal structure (8Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), illustrates the more solvent-exposed character of residues in position X of a GXY triplet when compared with position Y. As a result of the one-residue axial stagger of the individual chains within the triple-helix, the Y residue in chain A is at the same axial level and sterically close to residue X of chain B.B, a single chain of a GPE-containing peptide depicts the ability of the glutamic acid side chain to form an intrachain hydrogen bond to an unsatisfied carbonyl group (←), which may be in part the basis for the stabilizing nature of Glu in the Y position.C, the shorter side chain of the Asp residue, shown in a single chain of a GPD-containing peptide, is not able to undergo a corresponding interaction ( ) with the peptide backbone.D, two staggered GKD-containing peptide chains of the triple-helix show that the basic residue in the X position is at the same axial level and sufficiently close to allow electrostatic interactions with the Asp residue in the Yposition of neighboring chains (↑). This ion-pair interaction is the likely basis for the favorable contributions to triple-helix stability observed for peptides containing GRD and GKD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The broad range of thermal stability observed when the ionizable residues are in the Y position contrasts with the narrow range noticed for the X position (Fig. 3). The peptide containing Arg has the highest melting temperature, followed in order by Glu, Lys, and Asp, and the 14 °C spread indicates a strong dependence on the identity of the residue. The most stable peptide containing Gly-Pro-Arg is as stable as the host peptide containing Gly-Pro-Hyp. A detailed investigation of a series of peptides containing Gly-Pro-Arg, Gly-Pro-Lys, Gly-Pro-homoArg, and the inclusion of multiple differently spaced Gly-Pro-Arg triplets indicates that the high stability relates to the guanidinium group of Arg and its interaction with the peptide backbone (38Yang W. Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The least stable guest triplet, Gly-Pro-Asp, has a considerably lowerT m than Gly-Pro-Ala (Fig. 3). All polar groups in the Y position are substantially accessible to solvent (9Jones E.Y. Miller A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and factors that may influence the relative stability of the 4 peptides in the Gly-Pro-Y set include the number of hydrogen bonding sites to solvent or backbone carbonyls, relative side chain flexibility, and steric interactions of the side chain in the triple-helix. Arg has many potential hydrogen bonding sites and can hydrogen bond with backbone carbonyls (37Vitagliano L. Nemethy G. Zagari A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7354-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which may account in part for its high stability. Modeling suggests the low stability of Asp may relate to the inability of its shorter side chain to form hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyls, in contrast with the side chains of Arg, Lys, and Glu. In addition, unfavorable steric interactions with the neighboring chain lead to restricted rotation for the shorter Asp side chain. It is difficult to correlate possible stabilizing features of the Gly-Pro-Y peptide group with thermodynamic parameters as the transition curves of two of its members, Gly-Pro-Lys and Gly-Pro-Arg, do not fit well to the function expected for a two-state model, suggesting a more complex unfolding process. In contrast to observations on the X position, the charged form of ionizable residues appears to be slightly destabilizing in theY position, suggesting charge repulsion between the three residues as a result of Y residues being less solvent accessible (9Jones E.Y. Miller A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and sterically closer to the neighboring chain (10Bansal M. Ramachandran G.N. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Gly-X-Y triplets with oppositely charged residues in the X and Y positions comprise about 8% of the triplets in fibril forming collagens. The large majority of such triplets have the acidic residue in the X position and the basic residue in the Y position (13Hofmann H. Fietzek P.P. Kühn K. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 293-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Doyle B.B. Hukins D.W.L. Hulmes D.J.S. Miller A. Rattew C.J. Woodhead-Galloway J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the host-guest peptides containing Gly-Glu-Arg, Gly-Asp-Arg, Gly-Glu-Lys, and Gly-Asp-Lys model the commonly found triplets of the form Gly-(acidic)-(basic). At neutral pH, these host-guest peptides are more stable by 3–5 °C than at acidic pH (Table I). Of the four host-guest peptides, which include the less frequently observed triplets Gly-X +-Y −, only the 2 peptides with a basic residue in the X position and Asp in the Y position show a substantial stability increase at neutral pH, a feature not seen when Glu is in the Yposition. Model building has shown that for all pairs of oppositely charged residues in Gly-X-Y positions the Xresidue of one chain is at the same axial height and sterically near the Y residue of a neighboring chain (14Salem G. Traub W. FEBS Lett. 1975; 51: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Traub W. Fietzek P.P. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The increased stability of Gly-X −-Y + and Gly-X +-Y − peptides relative to Gly-Ala-Ala (Fig. 3) and the occurrence of maximal stability at neutral pH for six out of the eight peptides in this set could be solely due to the stabilizing nature of the individual basic and acidic residues, but an additional contribution could also result from ion-pair formation. Several analyses were carried out on the stability data of peptides with oppositely charged pairs in one triplet to evaluate whether such charge pairs stabilize the triple-helix. As a first approach, the increase in stability at neutral versusacidic pH of Gly-X −-Y +and Gly-X +-Y − peptides was compared with that observed for the individual charged components in separate peptides.ΔG0(GXYpH7)−ΔG0(GXYpH3)=[ΔG0(GXOpH7)−ΔG0(GXOpH3)] +[ΔG0(GPYpH7)−ΔG0(GPYpH3)]Equation 5 andTm(GXYpH7)−Tm(GXYpH3)=[Tm(GXOpH7)−Tm(GXOpH3)] +[Tm(GPYpH7)−Tm(GPYpH3)].Equation 6 Both T m and ΔG 0 as measures of stability are closely correlated for this set of peptides, but due to the uncertainties in the evaluation of ΔG 0 for Gly-Pro-Arg and Gly-Pro-Lys (see above), the application of T m values leads to more consistent results. The stability of the Gly-Glu-Lys-containing peptide, for example, indicates that the pH related changes (ΔΔG 0= −11.8 kJ/mol, ΔT m = 5.5 °C) can be explained almost completely by the favorable effects of neutral pH relative to pH 3 on the individual Glu residue in the X position of Gly-Glu-Hyp (ΔΔG 0 = −11.3 kJ/mol; ΔT m = 3.2 °C) and on the individual Lys in theY position of Gly-Pro-Lys (ΔΔG 0 = −1.3 kJ/mol, ΔT m = −0.3 °C) (Tables I andII). Such analyses for all 8 peptides indicates nearly no ion-pair stabilization except for the 2 peptides containing Gly-Lys-Asp and Gly-Arg-Asp. A second approach is to compare the effect of the reversal of charged residues in Gly-X-Y pairs on stability with that expected on the basis of the relative stabilities of individual residue components in GXO and GPY triplets. One illustration is shown in Equation 7.Tm(GER)−Tm(GRE)=[Tm(GEO)−Tm(GRO)] +[Tm(GPR)−Tm(GPE)]Equation 7 Such calculations show that the relative stabilities of Gly-Glu-Arg versus Gly-Arg-Glu and Gly-Glu-Lysversus Gly-Lys-Glu were close to those expected on the basis of individual residue stabilities. In contrast, Gly-Lys-Asp was much more energetically favorable than expected compared with Gly-Asp-Lys, as was Gly-Arg-Asp over Gly-Asp-Arg. Consideration of the pH dependence of individual components, and analysis of the additivity of individual residues in the Xand Y positions both indicate that ion-pair contribution to stability is rather weak for all Gly-X-Y charged pairs except Gly-Arg-Asp and Gly-Lys-Asp where the contribution is substantial. Recent studies suggest that the contribution of salt bridges on the surface of proteins to stability is small. The high dielectric constant of the solvent, the energetic cost of desolvating charges, and the unfavorable entropic result of constraining side chain positions to form a salt bridge have been suggested as possible reasons (29Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1995; 268: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 40Waldburger C.D. Schildbach J.F. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 2: 122-128Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Both the X and Y positions where charged residues may occur in the triple-helix are highly accessible to solvent (Fig. 4 A), so that ion-pairs in the triple-helix would be located on the protein surface. The data on 6 of the 8 triple-helix host-guest peptides suggest weak energetic contributions when oppositely charged residues are adjacent in Gly-X-Y triplets and sterically close in neighboring chains. These include the double-charged triplets most commonly found in collagens, namely Gly-Glu-Arg and Gly-Glu-Lys. This relatively frequent occurrence is unlikely to be related to triple-helix stability but probably relates to higher level interactions, such as fibril formation and ligand binding. However, our data indicate significant stabilization for Gly-(basic)-Asp triplets. The inability of Asp to form hydrogen bonds to carbonyl groups and its steric hindrance in the Y position may create a situation where ion-pair formation has a greater stabilizing effect than in the other cases (Fig. 4). Although triplets with acidic residues in theY position are relatively rare, in most of them this position is occupied by Asp. The highly soluble, stable host-guest triple-helical peptides are a valuable means for evaluating basic principles for the sequence dependent nature of triple-helix stability in collagen and other proteins. The position-dependent differences observed for the ionizable residues highlight the inherent nonequivalence of theX and Y positions in the triple-helix and suggest that changes in the X position have a relatively minor effect on stability in contrast to changes in the Yposition, as it was also observed for hydrophobic residues (11Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The surprising observation that Gly-(basic)-Asp triplets form stabilizing ion-pairs, whereas Gly-(basic)-Glu and Gly-(basic)-(acidic) triplets do not, indicates the need to look for interactions relating toX and Y residues within one triplet as well as extending host-guest peptide studies to include adjacent triplets. We thank Drs. Naina K. Shah and Wei Yang for experimental guidance in the early stages of this project and for helpful discussions. We also appreciate the productive meetings and talks with Dr. Jean Baum."

Each mutant protein was structurally and enzymatically characterized. Glu441 contributes to substrate binding, and a carboxylate side chain at position 441 is essential for catalysis. The most intriguing results are the suicidal mechanism-based reaction intermediates observed when R1 E441Q is incubated with protein R2 and natural substrates (CDP and GDP). In a consecutive reaction sequence, we observe at least three clearly discernible steps: (i) a rapid decay (k 1 ≥ 1.2 s−1) of the catalytically essential tyrosyl radical of protein R2 concomitant with formation of an early transient radical intermediate species, (ii) a slower decay (k 2 = 0.03 s−1) of the early intermediate concomitant with formation of another intermediate with a triplet EPR signal, and (iii) decay (k 3 = 0.004 s−1) of the latter concomitant with formation of a characteristic substrate degradation product. The characteristics of the triplet EPR signal are compatible with a substrate radical intermediate (most likely localized at the 3′-position of the ribose moiety of the substrate nucleotide) postulated to occur in the wild type reaction mechanism as well."
https://openalex.org/W2054850803,"Aggregation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) stimulates its uptake by macrophages. We have now shown by electron microscopic and chemical experiments that aggregated LDL (produced by vortexing (VxLDL) or treatment with phospholipase C) induced and became sequestered in large amounts within surface-connected compartments (SCC) of human monocyte-derived macrophages. This occurred through a process different from phagocytosis. Formation of SCC and accumulation of aggregated LDL in SCC are cell-mediated processes that were temperature-dependent (10 × greater cell association at 37 °C than at 4 °C) and blocked by cytochalasin D but not by nocodazole. Because of the surface connections of SCC, trypsin could release aggregated LDL from SCC. Degradation of125I-VxLDL through the SCC pathway showed delayed and a lower rate of degradation (10–55%) compared with nonaggregated125I-acetylated LDL that did not enter SCC. However, similar to 125I-acetylated LDL degradation,125I-VxLDL degradation occurred through a chloroquine-sensitive pathway. Uptake of VxLDL into SCC was not mediated by the LDL receptor. Methylation of LDL prevents its binding to the LDL receptor. However, methylated LDL still entered SCC after it was aggregated by vortexing. On the other hand, degradation of125I-VxLDL was substantially decreased by methylation of LDL and by cholesterol enrichment of macrophages, which decreases macrophage LDL receptor expression. The results suggest that whereas uptake of aggregated LDL into SCC occurs independently of the LDL receptor, movement of aggregated LDL from SCC to lysosomes may depend in part on LDL receptor function. Sequestration into SCC is a novel endocytosis pathway for uptake of aggregated LDL that allows the macrophage to store large amounts of this lipoprotein before it is further processed.

Sequestration into SCC is a novel endocytosis pathway for uptake of aggregated LDL that allows the macrophage to store large amounts of this lipoprotein before it is further processed. Previously, we reported that human monocyte-macrophages display an unusual mode of endocytosis in which they sequester cholesterol crystals into an extensive labyrinth of cytoplasmic compartments (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These compartments remain connected to the surface of the macrophage and to the extracellular space. Thus, this endocytotic process is different from phagocytosis, where particles are taken into the macrophage within vacuoles that form from pinched-off regions of the plasma membrane and do not maintain any connection to the extracellular space (2Silverstein S.C. Greenberg S. DiVirgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, New York1989: 703-720Google Scholar). Besides cholesterol crystals, we observed that acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) 1The abbreviations used are: AcLDL, acetylated low density lipoprotein; VxLDL, vortexed LDL; SCC, surface-connected compartments; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. could induce and enter SCC of human monocyte-macrophages (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, we subsequently discovered that this occurred only for some lots of AcLDL and not with other lots. AcLDL that entered these compartments was aggregated in linear strands. We suspected that some aggregation of AcLDL occurred during its storage and that this aggregated AcLDL could have been responsible for the formation of the macrophage SCC. Other investigators have shown that aggregation of lipoproteins enhances their uptake by macrophages. Oxidation and thiolation of LDL or treatment of LDL with sialidase, phospholipase C, or sphingomyelinase plus lipoprotein lipase (in the presence of cultured smooth muscle cells) and other treatments cause LDL to aggregate and to show enhanced degradation by macrophages (3Hoff H.F.

Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that aggregation of normal LDL by vortexing converted LDL to a form that was readily taken up by mouse peritoneal macrophages through an LDL receptor-dependent mechanism. The endocytotic pathway for uptake of the vortexed low density lipoprotein (VxLDL) was not described, but it was suggested that this LDL entered the macrophages by phagocytosis. In the present study, we examined whether aggregated LDL has the capacity to induce and accumulate within monocyte-macrophage SCC. Not only did aggregated LDL induce and accumulate within SCC, this occurred by a mechanism that did not depend on the classical LDL receptor. Human LDL was prepared as described previously (12Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was obtained from PerImmune (Rockville, MD). AcLDL was prepared as described by Basu et al. (13Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L.

(14Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled LDL and AcLDL with specific activities that ranged 70–200 μCi/mg of protein were obtained from Biomedical Technologies (Stoughton, MA). Lipoproteins that were not to be aggregated by vortexing were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min to remove any spontaneously formed aggregates from these lipoprotein preparations. To prepare aggregated lipoproteins, 40 μl of LDL or methylated LDL (5 mg/ml for unlabeled and 1–3 mg/ml for labeled lipoproteins) was placed into a 0.5-ml silicone-coated polypropylene tube and vortexed (VWR vortex mixer) at the maximal speed for 1 min. LDL aggregated with phospholipase C treatment was prepared as described previously (7Suits A.G. Chait A. Aviram M. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cell association and degradation of lipoproteins by human monocyte-derived macrophages was performed according to the methods of Goldstein et al. (15Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) using 125I-VxLDL and 125I-AcLDL. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured as described previously except that 2 × 106 monocytes/well were initially seeded into 12-well (22-mm diameter) culture plates (Plastek C, MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) (12Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-week-old monocyte-macrophage cultures were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C with 125I-labeled lipoproteins added to RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Lipoprotein degradation was quantified by measurement of trichloroacetic acid-soluble organic iodide radioactivity in supernatants of media samples that were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. Values obtained in the absence of cells were <5% those values obtained with cells. These control values were subtracted. Cell-associated 125I-lipoproteins were determined by rinsing macrophages 5 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.35% bovine serum albumin (3 quick rinses and two 10-min incubations on ice). After a final rinse with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+, macrophages were dissolved overnight in 0.1 n NaOH. Aliquots of NaOH-solubilized cell samples were assayed for 125I radioactivity. Values of125I radioactivity determined for wells incubated with125I-lipoproteins but without macrophages were subtracted. These values were <1% those of the cell-associated125I-lipoproteins. Macrophage protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

For Experiment I in Table II, passaged normal human skin fibroblasts (GM09503, National Institute of General Medical Sciences Cell Repository, NIH, Camden, NJ) were seeded into 6-well (35-mm diameter) Plastek C culture plates at a density of 105 cells/well. These cultures were maintained 3 days with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and then for another 2 days with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (PerImmune) before incubations with125I-lipoproteins were carried out.Table IIRole of LDL receptor in metabolism of 125 I-VxLDLConditionCell-associated125I-lipoproteinDegraded 125I-lipoproteinμg/mg cell proteinExperiment I Monocyte-macrophagesnormal 125I-LDL 5 h0.1 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.0methylated 125I-LDL 5 h0.3 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.0normal 125I-VxLDL 5 h6.4 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1methylated125I-VxLDL 5 h9.8 ± 0.70.3 ± 0.0methylated 125I-VxLDL + cytochalasin D 5 h2.0 ± 0.40.0 ± 0.0 Fibroblastsnormal125I-LDL0.3 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.0methylated125I-LDL0.1 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.0Experiment II Monocyte-macrophages−AcLDL 2 day/125I-VxLDL 5 h9.6 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.2+AcLDL 2 day/125I-VxLDL 5 h8.6 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.1Two-week-old monocyte-macrophage or passaged skin fibroblast cultures were incubated for 5 h with 20 μg/ml 125I-lipoproteins as indicated.

Then cells were rinsed and assayed for cell-associated 125I-lipoprotein and cell protein. Organic125I-radioactivities in soluble and trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions of media were also measured. Monocyte-macrophages were rinsed and incubated with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and 125I-labeled lipoproteins containing 4 μg/ml cytochalasin D (Calbiochem) to demonstrate the actin dependence of cell association. Chloroquine and cytochalasin D sensitivity of degradation of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was determined with pulse-chase experiments. Monocyte-macrophages were incubated with 125I-VxLDL in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 for 5 h, rinsed, and then incubated in RPMI 1640 without or with 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma) or 4 μg/ml cytochalasin D. For cytochalasin D controls, macrophages were incubated with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 2 μl of Me2SO, the solvent for cytochalasin D. Unesterified and esterified cholesterol contents of macrophages were determined enzymatically according to the fluorometric method of Gamble et al. (17Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these assays, macrophages were harvested by scraping into distilled water and processed as described previously (12Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular and intracellular membranes were differentiated with ruthenium red according to the method of Luft (18Luft J.H. Anat. Rec. 1971; 171: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Monocyte-macrophage cultures were ruthenium red-stained and prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All data are presented as means ± S.E. The means were determined from 3 culture wells for each data point. No standard error is shown when it was smaller than the height of the graphic symbol. Ruthenium red is an electron dense membrane stain. Because ruthenium red does not penetrate membranes of aldehyde-fixed cells, it stains only membranes in continuity with the extracellular space. Electron microscopic examination of macrophages incubated with VxLDL showed accumulation of lipoprotein particles within ruthenium red-outlined SCC not within phagocytic vacuoles (Fig.1). As we reported previously (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), SCC were tortuous interconnecting membranous compartments. VxLDL also accumulated in some ruthenium red negative membranous compartments that had the same appearance as SCC. These ruthenium red negative membranous compartments most likely are SCC that were not open to the extracellular space at the time of fixation of the macrophages. The lipoprotein particles in all SCC were often larger than native LDL (which is about 22 nm) and often resembled beads on a string. The increased size of LDL particles can be explained by fusion of LDL particles induced by vortexing (19Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. Mims M.P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL that aggregated by treatment with phospholipase C also induced and accumulated within SCC (Fig.1 c). The aggregates produced by phospholipase C were more rounded rather than linear as was VxLDL. No macrophage SCC were induced by LDL that had not been vortexed or by AcLDL centrifuged to remove any spontaneously formed aggregates. Because VxLDL entered SCC and centrifuged AcLDL did not enter these compartments, it was possible to compare the metabolism of AcLDL and VxLDL as they were processed by two different endocytosis pathways. The time courses of the metabolism of 125I-VxLDL and 125I-AcLDL were compared. Cell association of 125I-VxLDL and125I-AcLDL both began to reach a plateau by 2 h. However, the cell association of 125I-VxLDL was greater than 5-times that of 125I-AcLDL by this time (Fig.2 a). Cell association of nonvortexed LDL was small compared with that of 125I-AcLDL and 125I-VxLDL. Though cell association of 125I-VxLDL was high compared with 125I-AcLDL, degradation of 125I-VxLDL was less (about one-half at 4 h) than the degradation of AcLDL (Fig.2 b). Degradation of 125I-VxLDL compared with125I-AcLDL could even be lower than this. In another experiment not shown, although 125I-VxLDL cell association was 4 times that of 125I-AcLDL by 3 h, degradation of the 125I-VxLDL was only about one-fifth that of125I-AcLDL and was not significantly different from the degradation of nonvortexed 125I-LDL. Part of the difference in the amounts of degradation of125I-VxLDL and 125I-AcLDL could be explained by differences in their initial rates of degradation.125I-AcLDL showed a linear increase in its degradation during incubation with the macrophages. In contrast, there was a delay in degradation of 125I-VxLDL. Its maximal rate of degradation was not reached until 1 h after its addition to macrophage cultures. However, even when comparing their maximal rates of degradation (rather than their absolute amounts of degradation),125I-VxLDL was degraded at <55% the rate of degradation of 125I-AcLDL. Uptake into SCC was an active cell-mediated process that was dependent on temperature and actin microfilament function. Cell association of 125I-VxLDL was 10 times greater at 37 °C compared with 4 °C and 5 times greater at 37 °C compared with 20 °C (Fig. 3). Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin microfilament function (20Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar), inhibited cell association of 125I-VxLDL by 72 ± 3.5% (n = 3 experiments) during 5 h of incubation with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL (see Fig.4 for results of one experiment). Nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule function, did not inhibit cell association (data not shown). Electron microscopy showed that cytochalasin D blocked formation of SCC induced by VxLDL similar to what we have observed for compartments induced by cholesterol crystals (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence and cytochalasin D sensitivity of125I-VxLDL cell association showed that most cell association occurred through an active cell-mediated process and was not due to nonspecific sticking of lipoprotein aggregates to the culture dish.Figure 4Inhibition of cell association of125I-VxLDL by cytochalasin D and release of cell-associated125I-VxLDL by trypsin. First, 2-week-old monocyte-macrophage cultures were incubated 1 (a), 3 (b), or 5 h (c) with 50 μg/ml125I-VxLDL in the absence and presence of 4 μg/ml cytochalasin D. These cultures were rinsed, harvested, and analyzed for their content of protein and cell-associated 125I-VxLDL. Other duplicate sets of cultures incubated with 50 μg/ml125I-VxLDL were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml RPMI 1640 containing either 25 μl of DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+ or DPBS plus Ca2+, Mg2+, and 50 μg/ml trypsin. Then, these cultures were rinsed, and their contents of cell-associated125I-VxLDL were determined. Note that the scales of they axes for a, b, and c are different.cyto.

Incubation of macrophages for 5 h with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL showed an average (of three experiments) cell association of 19.9 ± 1.3 μg 125I-VxLDL/mg of cell protein, 67 ± 2% of which could be released by trypsin. There was a progressive decrease with time in the percentage of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL that could be released by trypsin (Fig. 4). 86, 70, and 64% cell-associated125I-VxLDL could be released after 1-, 3-, and 5 h-incubations with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL, respectively. Between 5 and 24 h, there was no further decrease in the percent of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL that could be released by trypsin. Cell association of 125I-LDL that had been aggregated with phospholipase C was less than that of125I-VxLDL. However, similar to 125I-VxLDL, most cell association of phospholipase C-treated 125I-LDL was inhibited by cytochalasin D and could be released by trypsin (Fig.6).Figure 6Release of cell-associated phospholipase C-treated 125I-LDL by trypsin. Two-week-old monocyte-macrophage cultures were incubated for 3 h with 50 μg/ml 125I-LDL that had been aggregated with phospholipase C (PlLDL) (7Suits A.G. Chait A. Aviram M. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl.

D, cytochalasin D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) About one-third of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL could not be released with trypsin. However, this trypsin-resistant cell-associated125I-VxLDL did accumulate within macrophages by an actin-dependent process. This was shown by incubating macrophages for 5 h with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL in the presence of cytochalasin D and then exposing the macrophages to trypsin. In this case, release of cell-associated125I-VxLDL was almost complete, being 4 ± 0% that of the amount found with macrophages not treated with cytochalasin D or trypsin. The occurrence of some trypsin-resistant cell-associated125I-VxLDL could be explained by the electron microscopic findings of some VxLDL having accumulated within ruthenium red negative SCC that lacked connections to the cell surface (see electron microscopy results above), incomplete release by trypsin of VxLDL from open SCC, and some uptake of VxLDL into non-SCC endocytic compartments. However, at a minimum, one-third VxLDL was taken up into SCC (i.e. one-third of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was both cytochalasin d-inhibitable and trypsin-releasable). Degradation of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was incomplete. When macrophages were incubated with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL for 5 h and then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium without VxLDL for 1 and 2 days, only 38.2 ± 7.1% (n = 5 experiments) and 39.0 ± 9.6% (n = 3 experiments), respectively, cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was subsequently degraded. Two-thirds of the degradation of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL could be accounted for by the degradation of the pool of125I-VxLDL that was trypsin-releasable (i.e. was within SCC or associated with macrophage cell surfaces). This was shown by incubating monocyte-macrophages with 50 μg/ml125I-VxLDL for 5 h to produce a large pool of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL. Then, the macrophages were treated without or with trypsin for 30 min as described in Fig. 4 to remove 125I-VxLDL from SCC. The amount of125I-VxLDL degraded during a subsequent 24-h incubation in RPMI 1640 medium was determined for those macrophages with125I-VxLDL accumulated in SCC and for those macrophages that had their 125I-VxLDL removed by trypsin treatment. Trypsin treatment removed 66 ± 1% cell-associated125I-VxLDL, and this decreased subsequent125I-VxLDL degradation during the chase period by a similar amount at 64 ± 1%. Degradation of 125I-VxLDL occurred in lysosomes. When macrophages were first incubated 5 h with 125I-VxLDL and then chased 1 day in RPMI 1640 medium with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine, degradation of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was inhibited >90% (Table I). Chloroquine inhibition of 125I-VxLDL degradation resulted in a 2-fold increase in loss of nondegraded (i.e. trichloroacetic acid-insoluble) 125I-VxLDL from the macrophages during the chase period. However, most (≅80%) of the 125I-VxLDL that chloroquine blocked from being degraded remained associated with the macrophages. This was shown by the observation that cell-associated125I-VxLDL was increased for macrophages incubated with chloroquine compared with cell-associated 125I-VxLDL for macrophages incubated without chloroquine (Table I).Table IEffect of chloroquine on degradation of 125 I-VxLDLConditionCell-associated125I-VxLDLTCA-soluble organic 125I in mediumTCA-insoluble organic 125I in mediumCell-associated 125I-VxLDL plus organic 125I in mediumμg/mg cell protein125I-VxLDL 5 h16.6 ± 2.1125I-VxLDL 5 h/RPMI 1640 without chloroquine 1 day8.9 ± 0.26.2 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.116.3 ± 0.1 with chloroquine 1 day13.3 ± 1.00.6 ± 0.02.5 ± 0.216.4 ± 1.2Two-week-old monocyte-macrophage cultures were incubated with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL for 5 h, and then the amount of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was determined.

Then media were collected from these cultures for determination of TCA-soluble and insoluble organic 125I, and macrophages were harvested for determination of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL. Open table in a new tab Two-week-old monocyte-macrophage cultures were incubated with 50 μg/ml 125I-VxLDL for 5 h, and then the amount of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL was determined. Other duplicate sets of cultures were rinsed and incubated without 125I-VxLDL for 24 h with or without 100 μm chloroquine. Then media were collected from these cultures for determination of TCA-soluble and insoluble organic 125I, and macrophages were harvested for determination of cell-associated 125I-VxLDL. Above, it was shown that cytochalasin D blocked uptake into SCC. We also determined whether cytochalasin D blocked subsequent degradation of 125I-VxLDL that was already accumulated in SCC. Macrophages were first incubated 5 h with 50 μg/ml125I-VxLDL and then chased 1 day in RPMI 1640 medium without or with cytochalasin D. During the chase period 5.5 ± 0.2 μg/mg of cell protein of 125I-VxLDL was degraded without cytochalasin D, but only 0.9 ± 0.1 μg/mg of cell protein of125I-VxLDL was degraded with cytochalasin D. Thus, transport of 125I-VxLDL from SCC to lysosomes was also an actin-dependent process. Cell-association of 125I-VxLDL was not mediated through the classical LDL receptor, but some of its degradation may have been. Reductive methylation of LDL is known to prevent its binding to the macrophage LDL receptor (21Shechter I. Fogelman A.M. Haberland M.E. Seager J. Hokom M. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, methylated 125I-VxLDL became cell-associated with monocyte-macrophages through a cytochalasin d-inhibitable process that could not have been mediated by the LDL receptor (Experiment I in Table II). Also, a one-day incubation of monocyte-macrophages with RPMI 1640 medium containing 200 μg/ml methylated VxLDL caused the total cholesterol content of the macrophages to increase from 83 ± 2 to 260 ± 9 nmol/mg of cell protein. Eighty-eight percent of the increase in cholesterol content could be inhibited by cytochalasin D. Moreover, electron microscopy showed that methylated VxLDL induced and entered SCC similar to that shown for VxLDL in Fig. 1. On the other hand, although cell association of methylated125I-VxLDL was even greater than that of125I-VxLDL, degradation of methylated125I-VxLDL was only 25% compared with normal125I-VxLDL. This suggested that up to 75% degradation of125I-VxLDL may have been mediated through the LDL-receptor. Dissociation of 125I-VxLDL degradation mediated by the LDL receptor and 125I-VxLDL cell association was confirmed another way. The LDL receptor in human monocyte-macrophages is down-regulated by cholesterol enrichment (22Koo C. Wernette-Hammond M.E. Garcia Z. Malloy M.J. Uauy R. East C. Bilheimer D.W. Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Incubation of monocyte-macrophages with 50 μg/ml AcLDL for 2 days increased macrophage cholesterol content about 2-fold (from 94 ± 2 to 205 ± 7 nmol/mg of cell protein). Cholesterol enrichment of the macrophages decreased 125I-VxLDL degradation by 85% but only decreased 125I-VxLDL cell association by 10% (Experiment II in Table II). We have shown that LDL aggregated by vortexing or treatment with phospholipase C (and vortexed AcLDL) 2W.-Y. Zhang, P. M. Gaynor, and H. S. Kruth, unpublished data. induced and accumulated within SCC of human monocyte-derived macrophages. Uptake of aggregated LDL into SCC is a novel endocytosis pathway for this lipoprotein. Native nonaggregated LDL did not induce nor enter these compartments. Uptake into SCC was temperature- and actin-dependent. VxLDL that accumulated in SCC was degraded slowly compared with AcLDL. Though cell association of VxLDL was an active cell-mediated process, nevertheless cell-associated VxLDL could be released from macrophages by trypsin. This confirmed the electron microscopic finding that VxLDL had accumulated within SCC rather than within phagocytic vacuoles. Accumulation of aggregated lipoproteins in SCC may have been overlooked in previous studies. Often, cells are treated with protease to remove cell surface-associated lipoproteins that are considered to represent lipoproteins not actively taken up by the cells but rather specifically and nonspecifically bound to cell surfaces (8Heinecke J.W. Suits A.G. Aviram M. Chait A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Morganelli P.M. Rogers R.A. Kitzmiller T.J. Bergeron A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 714-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our study shows that at least for human monocyte-macrophages, protease-releasable lipoproteins can actively accumulate within SCC. Previously, uptake of aggregated lipoproteins has been attributed to the process of phagocytosis. This was because uptake of aggregated lipoproteins was inhibited by cytochalasins and phagocytosis is an actin-dependent process that is inhibitable by cytochalasins (20Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Actin dependence does not necessarily mean that phagocytosis is the uptake pathway. This is because, besides phagocytosis, other endocytotic pathways of macrophages such as sequestration into SCC and macropinocytosis are also actin-dependent (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was not used in many previous studies to confirm that aggregated lipoproteins entered macrophages by direct phagocytosis. Not only did cytochalasin D inhibit uptake of VxLDL into SCC, cytochalasin D also inhibited subsequent degradation of SCC-bound VxLDL. Thus, it remains possible that VxLDL first entered SCC but then was transported from SCC into the cell cytoplasm by phagocytosis. However, we were not able to visualize by electron microscopy transport of VxLDL out of SCC, possibly because this process was slow and limited. Uptake into SCC is a process different from phagocytosis. Phagocytosis involves uptake of material into vacuoles that form from pinched-off regions of the plasma membrane (2Silverstein S.C. Greenberg S. DiVirgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, New York1989: 703-720Google Scholar). SCC form in part through invaginations of the plasma membrane that do not pinch off from the plasma membrane (1Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The formed SCC can be delineated with the electron-dense stain ruthenium red that distinguishes intra- from extracellular membranes by staining only the latter. Hoff et al. (25Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Chisolm G.M.I. Cole T.B. Quehenberger O. Esterbauer H. Jurgens G. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 538-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hoff H.F. Cole T.B. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 254-265PubMed Google Scholar) showed rapid degradation of aggregates of 4-hydroxynonenal-modified LDL taken up by mouse peritoneal macrophages through phagocytosis (verified by electron microscopy). On the other hand, these investigators reported that VxLDL showed delayed processing (i.e. degradation) by macrophages (Ref. 27Hoff H.F. Zyromski N. Armstrong D. O'Neil J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1919-1929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; also shown in Ref. 23Morganelli P.M. Rogers R.A. Kitzmiller T.J. Bergeron A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 714-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delayed processing of VxLDL was not due to a diminished capacity of lysosomal enzymes to degrade VxLDL (also shown in Ref. 28Lougheed M. Zhang H.F. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14519-14525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They speculated that poor processing of VxLDL could have been due to the nature of the intracellular pathway taken by the VxLDL. Uptake of VxLDL into SCC is an intracellular pathway showing slow degradation that could explain these earlier findings. Human monocyte-macrophages are capable of directly phagocytosing 0.5–3-μm latex beads. 2W.-Y. Zhang, P. M. Gaynor, and H. S. Kruth, unpublished data. So what property of VxLDL targets this aggregate to SCC rather than to phagocytic vacuoles? VxLDL is multivalent with respect to its apolipoprotein B component, and valency of a ligand may target receptors to different endocytosis pathways. Tabas and co-workers (29Myers J.N. Tabas I. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,30Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X.-X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) described a unique endocytotic pathway for β very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in mouse peritoneal macrophages in which multi-valency of ligand was a factor determining the route of endocytosis. In this pathway, large β-VLDL enter mouse peritoneal macrophages through surface-connected tubules. Surface-connected tubules are plasma membrane invaginations that do not terminate in a labyrinth of interconnected compartments as do SCC. In contrast to the uptake of VxLDL into SCC in the present study, uptake of β-VLDL into surface-connected tubules is not inhibited by cytochalasin D. Also, uptake into these tubules occurs through the LDL receptor that binds the multivalent apolipoprotein E component of β-VLDL (30Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X.-X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, uptake of β-VLDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages through the surface-connected tubule pathway and uptake of VxLDL by human monocyte-macrophages through the SCC pathway appear to be different but possibly related endocytic pathways. It is possible that the specific macrophage uptake pathway taken by particles depends on the nature of the receptor that binds the particles. The receptor that mediated cell association of VxLDL was not the classical LDL receptor. Methylation of LDL, which prevents binding of LDL to the LDL receptor (21Shechter I. Fogelman A.M. Haberland M.E. Seager J. Hokom M. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not block macrophage cell association of methylated 125I-VxLDL, cholesterol accumulation by macrophages incubated with methylated VxLDL, or accumulation of methylated VxLDL within SCC. Similar to what Khooet al. (11Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found with mouse peritoneal macrophages, we observed that the LDL receptor did mediate much of the degradation of125I-VxLDL. Macrophage degradation of125I-VxLDL was partially inhibited by methylation of LDL and by macrophage cholesterol enrichment, a treatment previously shown to down-regulate the LDL receptor in macrophages (22Koo C. Wernette-Hammond M.E. Garcia Z. Malloy M.J. Uauy R. East C. Bilheimer D.W. Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results suggest that whereas uptake into SCC occurs independently of the LDL receptor, subsequent movement from SCC to lysosomes may depend in part on LDL receptor function. It is conceivable that vortexing of LDL reveals a binding domain in LDL that is normally masked. Such a domain could then mediate LDL binding to some other receptor capable of uptake into SCC. In this regard, Gianturco et al. (31Gianturco S.H. Ramprasad M.P. Lin A.H.-Y. Song R. Bradley W.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1674-1687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gianturco S.H. Song R. Li R. Reese C.R. Stinson D. Strickland D. Bradley W.A. Circulation. 1995; 92: I-690Google Scholar) have shown the existence of a macrophage receptor that recognizes a binding domain within apolipoprotein B-48 but which is not expressed by native LDL. Alternatively, vortexing of LDL could reveal a cryptic lipid ligand. In this regard, uptake of oxidized LDL appears to be mediated in part by a lipid moiety of the oxidized LDL (33Nicholson A.C. Frieda S. Pearce A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Trypsin treatment of the VxLDL in our study did prevent its uptake by monocyte-macrophages.2 However, trypsin treatment also reversed the aggregation of VxLDL. Thus, it was not clear whether loss of a protein ligand or loss of multi-valency of aggregated VxLDL was responsible for the lack of macrophage uptake of the trypsin-treated VxLDL. Uptake into SCC is a pathway that leads to cellular accumulation of at least two different types of aggregated LDL (e.g. vortexed and phospholipase C-treated LDL). In preliminary experiments, we have observed macrophage uptake into SCC for some lots of oxidized LDL, another form of LDL that can aggregate (27Hoff H.F. Zyromski N. Armstrong D. O'Neil J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1919-1929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the role of SCC in the uptake of aggregated lipoproteins will be important in future studies. Furthermore, uptake of aggregated LDL by the non-LDL receptor pathway shown in this study could be important in cellular lipoprotein uptake in atherosclerotic lesions where activity of the classical LDL receptor is down-regulated (34Ylä-Herttuala S.

It has been hypothesized that the acyl-CoA pool of the retina contains amounts of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 elevated over 14:0, in comparison to other tissues, and this accounts for the specificity of N-terminal fatty acylation. To test this hypothesis, we performed fatty acid analysis on total acyl-CoAs purified from bovine retina (light-adapted), heart, and liver. We also examined theN- and S-linked fatty acid composition of the total protein pools from these tissues. Acyl-CoAs were prepared from heart, liver, and retina and separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Identities of peaks were based on HPLC of standard 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs. Total protein was subjected to base hydrolysis followed by acidic methanolysis to release S- and N-linked fatty acids, respectively, and fatty acid phenacyl esters were prepared for HPLC analysis.

Liver had levels of 12:0 (16.1 ± 5.7%) and 14:2n-6 (8.1 ± 1.2%) CoAs above and 14:1n-9 CoA (1.2 ± 0.6%) below that of 14:0 CoA (5.9 ± 0.8%). Fatty acid analysis of total protein showed that all tissues contained S-linked 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-9. Retina proteins contained N-linked 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6, whereas heart and liver had only 14:0. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the CoA ester pool of the retina is enriched with 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 over 14:0, in comparison to other tissues. This suggests that alternative models must be considered for the regulation of N-terminal fatty acylation of proteins in photoreceptor cells. Several proteins found in retinal photoreceptor cells (guanylate cyclase activating protein, protein kinase A, recoverin, and transducin) are N-terminally modified with the fatty acids 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6, whereas similar proteins in other tissues contain only 14:0. It has been hypothesized that the acyl-CoA pool of the retina contains amounts of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 elevated over 14:0, in comparison to other tissues, and this accounts for the specificity of N-terminal fatty acylation.

Retina proteins contained N-linked 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6, whereas heart and liver had only 14:0. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the CoA ester pool of the retina is enriched with 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 over 14:0, in comparison to other tissues. This suggests that alternative models must be considered for the regulation of N-terminal fatty acylation of proteins in photoreceptor cells. Coenzyme A (CoA) is the major fatty acid carrier molecule in plant and animal cells. Fatty acids are bound to CoA through a thioester linkage, the formation of which is carried out in mammalian cells by long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (1Waku K. Biochim. Biophys.

Several proteins found in retinal photoreceptor cells (guanylate cyclase-activating protein, protein kinase A, recoverin, and transducin) are N-terminally acylated with 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6, whereas similar proteins in other tissues contain only 14:0 (6Johnson R.S.

In the case of guanylate cyclase-activating protein, recoverin, and transducin, the percentages of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 present are near or greater than that of 14:0 (6Johnson R.S. Ohguro H.

Consequently, it appears modification with 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 is a retina-specific phenomenon (6Johnson R.S. Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. Neubert T.A. J. Biol.

Although 14:2n-6 CoA has not been tested, 12:0 and 14:1n-9 CoAs are utilized by the human NMT at a 3.1- and 1.9-fold lower catalytic efficiency, respectively (V max/K m ), than 14:0-CoA (20Kishore N.S.

A recent examination of acyltransferase activity for yeast NMT toward 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs, compared with 14:0 CoA (22Bhatnagar R.S. Schall O.F. Jackson-Machelski E. Sikorski J.A. Devadas B. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6700-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), showed equal activity for 14:1n-9 CoA and significantly lower activity for 12:0 and 14:2n-6. Overall, the studies for NMTs show that 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs are not superior substrates compared with 14:0 CoA. Consequently, to compete for the NMT, levels of available 12:0 and 14:2n-6 CoAs must be higher and 14:1n-9 at least equal to that of 14:0 CoA. It can be hypothesized that the retina contains elevated amounts of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs over 14:0 CoA compared with other tissues, accounting for the specificity of heterogenous N-terminal acylation (6Johnson R.S. Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. Neubert T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21067-21071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We describe here experiments designed to test this hypothesis by analyzing the fatty acid composition of the acyl-CoA pools from bovine heart, liver, and retina. As a complementary study, we determined the 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 content of proteins from bovine heart, liver, and retina. Our results show that all three tissues contain CoA derivatives of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6, yet these fatty acids are N-acylated only to retinal proteins. Thus, the heterogeneous N-terminal fatty acylation in retina may reflect unusual synthesis and utilization of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs, rather than acyl-CoA pool composition. 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, and 20:4n-6 CoA standards were from Sigma-Aldrich. [3H]14:0, 14:1n-9, 14:2n-6, [3H]16:0, and 22:6n-3 CoAs were synthesized according to the method of Hajra and Bishop (23Hajra A.K. Bishop J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Hajra A.K. Bishop J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). [3H]14:0, [3H]16:0, and 22:6n-3 used in the synthesis were from NEN Life Science Products, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 were generously provided by Dr. H. Sprecher (Department of Medical Biochemistry, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). All synthesized acyl-CoAs were judged to be ∼100% pure by HPLC (described below), thin layer chromatography (silica gel 60 plates (EM Science, Philadelphia, PA) using a butanol/HOAc/H2O (50:30:20, v/v/v) solvent system), and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (courtesy of Dr. K. Jackson, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). KH2PO4, acetonitrile, CHCl3, hexane, isopropanol, and MeOH were HPLC grade, and 12 n HCl was OptimaTM grade (Fisher). Ethanol was HPLC grade, and KOH was semiconductor grade (Sigma-Aldrich). All other chemicals were of reagent grade (Fisher or Sigma-Aldrich). Bovine eyes, heart, and liver were obtained from Mikkelson Beef Inc. (Oklahoma City, OK). Eyes were obtained within 2 h of slaughter and kept at 4 °C. Heart and liver were obtained within 30 min of slaughter and finely sectioned and chilled rapidly in wet ice. For final processing, heart and liver were cut into 1–2-g cubes, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.4 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Eyes were light-adapted on ice for 3–4 h in room light. Retinas were dissected from eyes, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The extraction procedure was a modification of the methods of Woldegiorgis et al. (25Woldegiorgis G. Spennetta T. Corkey B.E. Williamson J.R. Shrago E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Corkey (26Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 55-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Frozen tissue was finely powdered by grinding in a mortar chilled by dry ice; the amount per extraction was ∼1.5 g of heart, ∼1.5 g of liver, and two retinas. Powdered frozen tissue was suspended in 5 ml of isopropanol, 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2 (1:1 v/v) and warmed to 4 °C. For some samples, extraction efficiency was determined by adding 25,000–100,000 dpm (0.05–0.2 nmol) [3H]14:0 CoA or [3H]16:0 CoA. In some retina samples, 29,000 dpm (0.06 nmol) [3H]14:0 CoA and 5 nmol each of 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs were added. The samples were acidified with 100 μl of glacial acetic acid, warmed to 23 °C, and extracted twice with 4 ml of hexane/isopropanol (2:1 v/v) and then twice with 3 ml of hexane. The hexane phases containing nonpolar lipids were discarded. To the aqueous phase was added 200 μl of saturated (NH4)2SO4 and 10 ml MeOH/CHCl3 (2:1 v/v) to form a monophase. After 20 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation and washed once with 4 ml of MeOH/CHCl3/H2O (5:2.5:1 v/v/v). Protein pellets were saved for analysis of covalently bound fatty acids. To the pooled supernatant, 4 ml of water was added to form a stable bilayer. The CHCl3 phase containing glycerolipids was removed and combined with subsequent CHCl3 extracts. The aqueous phase was extracted twice more with 3 ml of CHCl3, the pooled CHCl3 phases were back-extracted twice with 1.5 ml of H2O, and the water phases added to the previous aqueous phase. The CHCl3 phases were then discarded. After adding ∼10 mg of butylated hydroxy toluene, the aqueous pool was taken to dryness by nitrogen gas evaporation and lyophilization (VirTis lyophilizer, VirTis, Gardiner, NY). The residue, containing acyl-CoAs, was solubilized in 0.5–1.0 ml of 25 mmKH2PO4 (pH 5.3) and passed through a 0.45 μm filter (nylon-66 MicrofilterfugeTM, Rainin Instruments, Inc., Woburn, MA); this material was used for HPLC analysis. HPLC was carried out following the modified methods of Woldegiorgis et al. (25Woldegiorgis G. Spennetta T. Corkey B.E. Williamson J.R. Shrago E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Corkey (26Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 55-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Standards or acyl-CoA extracts from tissues (entire extract injected) were separated using a Waters (Milford, MA) Nova-PakTM C-18 column (60 A, 4 μm, and 3.9 mm × 15 cm inner diameter). Elution (2 ml/min) was done using a linear gradient of 25 mm KH2PO4 (pH 5.3)/acetonitrile started at 70:30 (v/v), decreased to 54:46 after 20 min, decreased again to 38:62 after 5 min, held at 38:62 for 20 min, and returned to 70:30 after 5 min. Acyl-CoA elution was monitored by 254 nm absorbance. Recovery of [3H]14:0 or [3H]16:0 CoAs was quantitated with an on-line scintillation counter (Flo-One Radioactive Flow Detector A-200, Radiomatic, Tampa, FL) using Ultima-Flo M mixture (Packard Instrument Co., Inc., Meriden, CT) at a 2.5:1 (v/v) ratio with the column eluant. The procedure used was a modification of the methods of Corkey (27Corkey B.E. Brandt M. Williams R.J. Williamson J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA extracts from heart, liver, and retina were adjusted to pH 12.5 by addition of 10m KOH and heated for 10 min at 56 °C, with agitation. After cooling on ice, the pH was readjusted to 5.3 by addition of 70% (w/v) HClO4. After centrifugation to remove the KClO4 precipitate, the extract was filtered and subjected to HPLC as described above. This procedure was carried out on a mixture of 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, 14:2n-6, 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, and 22:6n-3 CoAs; the posthydrolysis HPLC profile (data not shown) showed complete disappearance of these standards. In the analysis, two retina protein pellets and one heart or liver protein pellet were used per sample. To remove free lipids, the protein pellets were washed two times with 10 ml of MeOH, two times with 10 ml of CHCl3/MeOH/12 n HCl (100:100:1 v/v/v), four times with 10 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 v/v), and two times with 10 ml of EtOH. The protein was dried in a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant, Hicksville, NY). For release of thioester-linked fatty acids, the protein was saponified in 6 ml of 2% KOH/EtOH (w/v) at 37 °C for 4 h. Following addition of 2 ml of H2O and 300 μl of 12 nHCl, the hydrolysate was extracted three times with 4 ml of hexane. The hexane extracts were combined and used to prepare fatty acid phenacyl esters (FAPEs) by the method of Wood and Lee (28Wood R. Lee T. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 254: 237-243Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). FAPEs were separated on HPLC using a Supelco (Bellefonte, PA) SupelcosilTM LC-18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter), with elution (2 ml/min) by a linear gradient of acetonitrile/H2O started at 80/20 (v/v), increased to 92:8 after 45 min, held at 92:8 for 10 min, and returned to 80:20 after 5 min. FAPE elution was monitored by absorbance at 242 nm. After adding 6 ml of EtOH to the aqueous phase to decrease polarity, the protein was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was washed once with 10 ml of EtOH, twice with 10 ml CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 v/v), and three times with 10 ml MeOH. The protein was dried in a Speed Vac concentrator and subjected to acidic methanolysis as described below. To release amide-linked fatty acids, the proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 ml of 2 n HCl/83% MeOH at 100 °C for 6 h, under nitrogen. The hydrolysate was extracted three times with 4 ml of hexane. Fatty acid methyl ester extracts were dried under nitrogen and saponified in 2 ml of 2% KOH/EtOH at 100 °C for 60 min. After adding 1 ml H2O and 100 μl of 12 n HCl, the hydrolysate was extracted with three times with 2 ml of hexane. FAPEs were prepared and subjected to HPLC as described above. FAPE peaks from fatty acids released during base hydrolysis and acidic methanolysis were collected, 20 nmol of 17:0 FAPE was added as carrier, and the total FAPEs were extracted with hexane. The FAPEs were saponified with 2% KOH/EtOH as described above. Free fatty acids were solubilized in 2 ml of EtOH/hexane (2:1) and bubbled with hydrogen (20 min) in the presence of ∼10 mg of Pt2O (Matheson, Norwood, OH). Spent Pt2O was removed by centrifugation. Fatty acids were phenacylated and separated on HPLC as described above, with the modification of a 30-min elution with 100% acetonitrile immediately following 98:2 acetonitrile/H2O, to elute saturated fatty acids larger than 18 carbon atoms. Fig.1 A is a HPLC profile for standard acyl-CoAs, chromatographed in parallel with the retina acyl-CoA extracts. Under our HPLC conditions, 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, 14:2n-6, 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, and 18:3n-3 acyl-CoAs eluted as individual peaks with moderate to complete base line separation. While retaining complete separation from the other standards, 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, and 22:6n-3 acyl-CoAs co-eluted as an unresolved peak. Detection response at 254 nm was estimated (12:0, 14:0, and 16:0 CoAs, 2 nmol each) to be 250 ± 51 mV·s/nmol. For each standard, R F values were calculated relative to 16:0 CoA because of its inclusion as an internal reference standard ([3H] 16:0 CoA) in the extractions. To determine the efficiency of our method, we added [3H]14:0 (retina) or [3H]16:0 (heart, liver, and retina) CoAs prior to extraction. Percentage of recovery of the [3H]16:0 CoA was quantitated from the obtained HPLC radioactivity profiles. A radioactivity tracing from the retina extract is shown in Fig.1 C. Recovery of [3H]16:0 CoA was 12.5 ± 1.8, 34.4 ± 1.7%, and 35.9 ± 11.0% for heart (n = 2), liver (n = 2), and retina (n = 7), respectively. We also examined the efficiency of the extraction of 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs from the retina by adding 5 nmol each of 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs prior to extraction. Recovery was calculated by comparing the HPLC absorbance at 254 nm (data not shown) to that of the original mixture. The recoveries for 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs were 53.8 ± 4.0, 46.9 ± 1.4, 41.7 ± 7.1, and 39.5 ± 2.9%, respectively. HPLC profiles of the acyl-CoAs from retina are shown in Figs. 1 B and2 A. Identification of the peaks was made by comparing R F values to those calculated for standard acyl-CoAs. Peaks near the R F for 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, 14:2n-6, 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, and 22:6n-3 CoAs are discernible. 14:0 and 16:0 CoAs were also identified by their radioactivity profiles (Fig. 1 C); both [3H]CoAs were recovered intact and aligned exactly with the corresponding absorbance peaks. To further confirm identity assignments, a sample of retina extract was subjected to HPLC after mixing with 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, 14:2n-6, 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, and 22:6n-3 CoA standards (Fig. 2 B). Co-elution with the standards lends support to their identity assignments. A HPLC profile for retina extracts after base hydrolysis is shown in Fig. 2 C. Although disappearance was uncertain for the 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoA candidates, complete disappearance was seen for all of the other peaks except 17:0 CoA, suggesting that they are thioester-linked lipids. The resistance of the 17:0 CoA candidate suggests that it may not be an acyl-CoA. Fig. 3 A shows the average percentage of each identifiable acyl-CoA found in the retina extracts (n = 12). The most abundant acyl-CoA is 16:0 (27.3 ± 2.6%), followed by 18:2n-6/20:4n-6/22:6n-3 (23.3 ± 5.5%), 18:0 (18.7 ± 6.2%), 18:1n-9 (14.0 ± 2.0%), 14:0 (7.0 ± 1.8%), 14:1n-9 (2.9 ± 2.2%), 12:0 (2.7 ± 2.1%), 18:3n-3 (2.6 ± 0.9%), and 14:2n-6 (1.6 ± 0.7%). The most noteworthy finding is that the relative amounts (TableI) of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs are less than that of 14:0 CoA.Table IRelative ratios for 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs to 14:0 CoA in acyl-CoA extracts from bovine retina, heart, and liverTissue12:0 CoA14:1n-9 CoA14:2n-6 CoA14:0 CoARetina0.40.40.21.0Heart0.70.21.01.0Liver2.70.21.41.0Percentages for 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs are found in Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab Percentages for 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs are found in Fig. 3. The total acyl-CoA content of the retina was estimated from HPLC profiles (n = 7). Total identifiable peak areas from each profile were adjusted to a theoretical 100% yield, based on [3H]16:0 recovery, and divided by the sample wet weight; the resulting values were averaged and divided by the detection response at 254 nm. The yield was estimated to be 1.9 ± 0.7 nmol/g of wet weight or 1.6 ± 0.5 nmol/retina. A HPLC profile of acyl-CoAs from heart is shown in Fig.4 A. Identification of the peaks was carried out using R F values as described previously. Peaks near the R F positions for 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, 14:2n-6, 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, and 22:6n-3 CoA were discernible. Shown in Fig. 4 B is the HPLC profile for the extract after mixing with the standards. Co-elution with the acyl-CoA standards lends support to their identity assignments. Co-elution with the 14:1n-9 CoA standard was not seen, making its existence in heart uncertain. A HPLC profile for heart acyl-CoA extracts after base hydrolysis is shown in Fig. 4 C. Complete disappearance was seen for all peaks except 17:0 CoA, supporting the idea that they are thioester-linked lipids. The resistance of the 17:0 CoA candidate suggests that it may not be an acyl-CoA. The average percentage of each identifiable acyl-CoA species in the extracts (n = 2) is shown in Fig. 3 B. The most abundant is 16:0 CoA (37.8 ± 1.5%), followed by 18:2n-6/20:4n-6/22:6n-3 (30.0 ± 0.6%), 18:0 (13.4 ± 1.0%), 18:1n-9 (5.3 ± 1.3%), 14:0 (3.8 ± 1.0%), 14:2n-6 (3.7 ± 0.1%), 18:3n-3 (3.0 ± 0.2%), 12:0 (2.6 ± 0.6%), and 14:1n-9 (0.7 ± 0.3%) CoAs. The levels of 12:0 and 14:2n-6 CoAs are both near that of 14:0 CoA, and the level of 14:1n-9 CoA is lower than that of 14:0 CoA (Table I). Total acyl-CoA yield was estimated to be 4.6 ± 0.8 nmol/g of wet weight. A HPLC profile for acyl-CoAs from liver is shown in Fig.5 A. Identification of the peaks was carried out using R F values as described previously. Peaks near the appropriate R F positions for all the acyl-CoA standards were discernible. The HPLC profile for the extract after mixing with the standards is shown in Fig.5 B. Co-elution with the acyl-CoA standards was seen for the peaks found in the extract, lending support to their identity assignments. There were also several prominent peaks in the trace that did not match the R F value or co-elute with any standard, making identity assignment impossible. A HPLC profile for liver acyl-CoA extracts after base hydrolysis is shown in Fig. 5 C. Complete disappearance was seen for all the acyl-CoA candidate peaks, as well as those that were unidentifiable, supporting the idea that they are thioester-linked lipids. The average percentage of each identifiable acyl-CoA species in the extracts (n = 2) is shown in Fig. 3 B. The most abundant was 18:2n-6/20:4n-6/22:6n-6 CoA (35.3 ± 4.0%), followed by 16:0 (20.1 ± 0.9%), 12:0 (16.1 ± 5.7%), 18:3n-3 (9.3 ± 1.6%), 14:2n-6 (8.1 ± 1.2%), 14:0 (5.9 ± 0.8%), 18:1n-9 (2.4 ± 0.1%), 18:0 (1.8 ± 1.3%), and 14:1n-9 (1.2 ± 0.6%) CoAs. The levels of 12:0 and 14:2n-6 CoAs were greater than that of 14:0 CoA, and the level of 14:1n-9 CoA was lower than that of 14:0 CoA (Table I). Total acyl-CoA yield was estimated to be 5.3 ± 1.4 nmol/g of wet weight. Shown in Fig. 6 are the HPLC profiles for FAPEs released by base hydrolysis of retina, heart, and liver total protein. Controls consisted of blank tubes on which all procedures were performed. All controls contained 16:0 and 18:0; their averaged areas were subtracted from those of the tissues prior to percentage calculations. Retina proteins released 16:0 (66.1 ± 1.1%), 18:1n-9 (11.4 ± 0.6%), and 18:0 (16.7 ± 0.9%), as well as trace amounts (<2%) of 14:0, 18:2n-6, and 22:6n-3. Heart proteins released 16:0 (40.5 ± 0.7%), 18:0 (31.0 ± 0.4%), 18:1n-9 (15.4 ± 0.4%), and 18:2n-6 (9.2 ± 0.3%), as well as a trace amount (<3%) of 14:0. Liver proteins released 16:0 (29.9 ± 2.4%), 18:0 (46.1 ± 3.2%), and 18:1n-9 (8.8 ± 0.8%), as well as trace amounts (<2%) of 14:0 and 18:2n-6. The liver protein also showed four peaks (11.3 ± 0.6% total) at 40–50 min, the identities of which are unknown. The short chain fatty acids 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 were not found in any of the base hydrolysates. The HPLC profiles of the FAPEs released by acidic methanolysis of retina, heart, and liver total protein are shown in Fig.7. All controls contained 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0; their averaged peak areas were subtracted from those of the tissues prior to percentage calculations. Retina proteins released 14:2n-6 (4.3 ± 1.3%), 14:1n-9 (4.0 ± 1.0%), 14:0 (20.4 ± 2.9%), 16:0 (31.1 ± 1.0%), and 18:0 (40.3 ± 6.1%). Heart protein, although devoid of detectable 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6, released 14:0 (22.0 ± 9.3%), 16:0 (31.5 ± 2.4%), and 18:0 (46.5 ± 11.2%). The small peak in the area of 14:1n-9 did not yield 14:0 after catalytic hydrogenation (data not shown). Liver protein was devoid of detectable 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 released 14:0 (27.4 ± 5.5%), 16:0 (25.9 ± 2.5%), and 18:0 (45.3 ± 6.2%). HPLC profiles of the hydrogenated 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 peaks from methanolysis of retina total protein are shown in Fig. 8. Control samples, consisting of blank tubes on which all hydrogenation procedures were performed, were found to contain 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0. Identities of both 14:2n-6 and 14:1n-9 peaks were confirmed by production of 14:0 greater than that seen in the controls (2.5 ± 0.2 and 3.8 ± 0.4 times the control level, respectively); however, the 16:0, 17:0 (carrier), and 18:0 levels were not above those of the controls. The 14:0 released from retina proteins by acidic methanolysis was also hydrogenated (data not shown) and produced only 14:0 and 20:0 at levels 20.9 ± 2.0 and 2.7 ± 0.1 times, respectively, those found in the control. The presence of 20:0 suggests that the original 14:0 peak contained some underlying 20:4n-6 (1.4% of 14:0), which has been found to modify proteins on lysine residues (29Hallak H. Muszbek L.

Although bovine tissues have not been examined, acyl-CoA compositional analyses have been carried out for many other mammals (25Woldegiorgis G. Spennetta T. Corkey B.E. Williamson J.R. Shrago E.

Levels of 12:0 CoA in pig heart and 12:0 and 14:1 CoA in rat liver and skeletal muscle were below that of 14:0 CoA, whereas 14:1 CoA in pig heart and 12:0 and 14:1 CoA in rat heart were higher than that of 14:0 CoA. Pig and rat heart results are noteworthy because protein kinase A is exclusively modified with 14:0 in heart (6Johnson R.S. Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. Neubert T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21067-21071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Carr S.A. Biemann K. Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6128-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), whereas in photoreceptors the same protein is N-terminally acylated with 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 (6Johnson R.S. Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. Neubert T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21067-21071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our examination of bovine heart, liver, and retina for 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoA content was essential in explaining how heterogeneous N-terminal fatty acylation arises. In heart and retina, 12:0, 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs were sometimes difficult to distinguish from background; therefore, the reported percentages should be taken as an upper limit for their presence. Although our data are relative percentages, there was no obvious indication in heart and retina that 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs exceed 14:0 CoA by a substantial amount. On the other hand, liver acyl-CoA levels were all significantly above background levels, showing amounts of 12:0 and 14:2n-6 CoAs slightly higher than that of 14:0 CoA, whereas 14:1n-9 CoA was somewhat lower. As in heart and retina, there was no dramatic enrichment of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs over 14:0 CoA in liver. Based on the catalytic efficiency (V max/K m ) data for the human NMT (20Kishore N.S. Wood D.C. Mehta P.P. Wade A.C. Lu T. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4889-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there should be at least 2.6- and 3.1-fold higher amounts of 12:0 and 14:1n-9 CoAs, respectively, relative to 14:0 CoA for equal utilization. Activity (V max) and dissociation constant (K d ) data for the yeast NMT toward 14:0 and 14:2n-6 CoAs (22Bhatnagar R.S. Schall O.F. Jackson-Machelski E. Sikorski J.A. Devadas B. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6700-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that, minimally, 18.9- and 5.0-fold higher amounts, respectively, than 14:0 CoA would be required for equal incorporation. Although the amounts of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs in heart are consistent with the acylation of heart proteins with only 14:0, the levels of these CoAs in the retina are definitely not high enough to lead to the heterogeneous acylation pattern seen for photoreceptor proteins. Likewise, the relative amounts of 12:0 and 14:2n-6 CoAs in liver suggest that these fatty acids should be found on liver proteins in addition to 14:0 (104 and 7–28% of 14:0, respectively), but this is not the case (35Ozols J. Carr S.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13349-13354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is very unlikely heterogeneous N-terminal fatty acylation is determined by differences in the acyl-CoA composition of the tissues. Our results suggesting the presence of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs in heart and liver led us to question whether there might exist heterogeneously acylated proteins in these tissues that have yet to be identified. We performed fatty acid analysis on the total protein precipitates from heart, liver, and retina. Base hydrolysis released considerable 16:0 from all of the proteins, which is consistent with the thioester modification of proteins by 16:0 (15Schlesinger M.J. Lipid Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 2-18Google Scholar). We also observed the release of 14:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, and 18:2n-6, which can also be S-linked to proteins (36Muszbek L. Laposata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8251-8255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Berger M. Schmidt M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the representative palmitoylated proteins in heart and liver are uncertain, the major modified protein in retina is likely the photoreceptor protein rhodopsin (38Papac D.I. Thornburg K.R. Bullesbach E.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16889-16894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acidic methanolysis of heart and liver total protein showed release of 14:0 but not of 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6. Retina total protein released 14:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6, consistent with the presence of these fatty acids in photoreceptor proteins. Thus, whereas all three tissues may contain 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 CoAs, only retinal proteins contained these two fatty acids in an amide linkage. In light of our results, alternative models must be considered for regulation of N-terminal fatty acylation in photoreceptors. Previously, we showed that the retina synthesizes 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 by retroconversion of 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 or 20:4n-6, respectively (39DeMar Jr., J.C. Wensel T.G. Anderson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5007-5016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that retina peroxisomes might be more active in producing 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6. It is also possible that the retina acyl-CoA synthetase is more efficient at generating the required 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, and 20:4n-6 CoAs. Interestingly, the retina has very high 20:4n-6 CoA synthetase activity (40Reddy S.T. Bazan N.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1984; 3: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Reddy S.T. Bazan N.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the retina may contain an unique NMT isozyme that prefers 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs. Consistent with this, bovine brain has been shown to contain NMT isoforms (42McIlhinney R.A.J. McGlone K. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 43Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12080-12083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) NMTs differ by 10 kDa in mass. Another option is a regulatory protein that makes the NMT more selective for 12:0, 14:1n-9, and 14:2n-6 CoAs. Proteins controlling the enzymatic rate of NMT have been identified (45King M.J. Sharma R.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 46King M.J. Sharma R.J. Mol. Cell.

Finally, although NMTs are cytosolic proteins (48Knoll L.J. Levy M.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5366-5373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49McIlhinney R.A.J.

Cell Res. 1996; 223: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the retina NMT could be compartmentalized where it is more accessible to 14:1n-9 and 14:2n-6 CoAs than 14:0 CoA. Our previous studies showed that 14:2n-6 could not be provided to the retina NMT through a direct cytoplasmic route (39DeMar Jr., J.C. Wensel T.G. Anderson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5007-5016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas 14:0 was utilized. It is likely that one or more of the above mentioned mechanisms for controlling NMT activity is at work in photoreceptors."

Binding of cells to ECM proteins is attributed primarily to the interaction between integrin receptors, heterodimeric transmembrane proteins involved in adhesion and communication, and specific peptide sequences in each ECM molecule (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar,2Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, certain αv- and β1-containing integrins recognize the RGD sequence displayed by many ECM proteins. α4β1 integrin binds the sequence LDV in the CS-1 region of fibronectin as well as the sequence QIDS in VCAM. Accordingly, much research has focused on the identification of sequence motifs responsible for integrin-ligand interaction. Changes in integrin activity, which affect functions as diverse as strength of adhesion, natural ligand specificity, and matrix assembly (3Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr.

Mn2+ and activating antibodies such as TS2/16 and 8A2 bind to the receptor, independent of activation state, and induce an active conformation (5Kovach N.L. Carlos T.M. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J.

Changes in receptor conformation have been documented by anti-integrin antibodies that specifically bind receptors in the activated state (9Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I. Plow E.F.

Many cell-surface and ECM proteins are, in part, composed of multiple repeating domains of ∼90 amino acids known as fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. Cell-surface receptors containing these repeats include the human growth hormone receptor, the erythropoietin receptor, and multiple interleukin receptors; cell-surface adhesion molecules include chicken L1 and Drosophila neuroglian; and ECM proteins including fibronectin, tenascin, and certain collagens (11Brümmendorf T.

Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), have very similar tertiary structures. The dominant feature of all FNIII repeats is a sandwich formed by two anti-parallel β-sheets enclosing a hydrophobic core. FNIII repeats adjacent to the RGD-containing FNIII10 contribute to cell adhesion mediated by fibronectin (15Danen E.H.J. Aota S. van Kraats A.A. Yamada K.M. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N.P. J. Biol.

With the exception of the synergy sequence (PHSRN) in FNIII9 of fibronectin, no systematic effort has been made to understand this contribution or to identify potential cell-surface receptors for FNIII repeats. We now report that cells adhere and spread on FNIII repeats lacking RGD after experimental activation of β1 integrins. FNIII repeats derived from both extracellular matrix proteins and cytokine receptors mediate adhesion of multiple cell types. Interaction between individual FNIII domains and β1 integrins mediates focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and subsequent stress fiber and focal contact formation. These data suggest that, in vivo, many FNIII-containing proteins may bind and signal through activated β1 integrins, dramatically expanding the potential for integrin-dependent intercellular and cell-matrix communication. Cell adhesion assays were performed and quantified as described (18Gotwals P.J. Chi-Rosso G. Lindner V. Yang J. Ling L. Fawell S.E. Koteliansky V.E. J. Clin.

Cell adhesion buffer contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm glucose with varying concentrations of Mn2+. The relative amount of each recombinant FNIII repeat bound to plastic was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay using a mAb to the histidine tag (diaNovo). The absorbance of FNIII repeats to plastic was linear between 0.5 and 5.0 μg/ml and reached saturation at ∼8.0 μg/ml. FNIII repeats were plated at 10 μg/ml to standardize the relative amount of each repeat bound to plastic. Native FNIII domains (a gift of Drs. Sergei V. Litvinovitch and Kenneth C.

Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured for up to 2 weeks in the wells of a 24-well dish coated previously with anti-CD3 antibody OKT-3. T blasts were recovered and tested for adhesion in the presence of 2.5 μm PMA (Sigma). Fibronectin contains 15–17 FNIII repeats numbered sequentially from the most proximal repeat to the amino terminus (20Schwarzbauer J.E. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). DNA encoding individual FNIII repeats was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a full-length rat fibronectin cDNA. Purified amplification products were cloned into the expression vector pQE30 (QIAGEN Inc.) and sequenced. Recombinant FNIII repeats, which include an additional 18 amino acids (MRGSH6GSACELGT) at the amino terminus and 3 additional amino acids (KLN) at the carboxyl terminus, were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 (Stratagene). All FNIII domains were soluble and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Native FNIII repeats as well as FNIII repeats expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins mediate cell adhesion. Polyhistidine did not support cell adhesion, indicating that cells did not adhere to FNIII repeats through the histidine tag. The soluble extracellular domains of the human IL-2 receptor β chain, the IL-4 receptor α chain, and the IL-2 receptor γc chain were expressed by cloning the corresponding polymerase chain reaction fragments into pBlueBac II (Invitrogen) or pFASTBAC I (Life Technologies, Inc.) baculovirus expression vectors. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Hi-5 insect cells (Invitrogen) and purified by mAb 18741D (Pharmingen) or mAb 230 (R&D Systems) affinity chromotography for the IL-2 receptor β and IL-4 receptor α chains, respectively, or by nickel chelate (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid) affinity chromatography for the IL-2 receptor γc chain. PAC1 cells, in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glucose, 100 μmMnCl2, and 1% fetal calf serum, were plated on 100-mm plastic dishes (Corning Inc.) coated previously with either 20 μg/ml FNIII repeats or 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. At 20, 40, or 60 min, cells were lysed in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. To each 1 ml of lysate were 5 μg of anti-FAK mAb (Signal Transduction Laboratories) and/or 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody (Signal Transduction Laboratories). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, 60 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads were added, followed by an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis as described (18Gotwals P.J. Chi-Rosso G. Lindner V. Yang J. Ling L. Fawell S.E. Koteliansky V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PAC1 cells in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glucose, 100 μm MnCl2, and 1% fetal calf serum were plated in each well of two-well chamber slides (Nunc) coated previously with 20 μg/ml FNIII repeats or 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine and allowed to adhere for 2 h. Cells were fixed; permeabilized; and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.), anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody, rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of chicken β1 integrin (21Marcantonio E.E. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), or anti-vinculin mAb (Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with either an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG (Amersham Corp.) and streptavidin coupled to either Texas Red or fluorescein (Amersham Corp.). Cells were mounted in Movoil (Hoechst Celanese) and viewed under fluorescence at 630× magnification. Note that secreted or serum-derived proteins are not required for focal contact formation. Focal contacts form in cyclohexamide-treated cells and under conditions in which serum is replaced with lysophosphatidic acid. While analyzing pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PAC1) (22Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith C.W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) adhesion to fibronectin, we observed that, in the presence of Mn2+, recombinant or native FNIII domains derived from fibronectin support cell adhesion nearly equal in extent compared with the RGD-containing central binding domain, FNIII8–10 (Fig.1 A). Single FNIII repeats support adhesion equally as well as multiple repeats. Furthermore, an antibody that blocks RGD-dependent adhesion inhibits PAC1 cell adhesion to intact fibronectin in the presence of Ca2+and Mg2+, but not in the presence of Mn2+, suggesting that cells adhere through FNIII repeats other than FNIII10, which contains RGD. Recombinant FNIII repeats derived from tenascin also support Mn2+-dependent adhesion. 2G. Chi-Rosso, P. J. Gotwals, V. E. Koteliansky, and J. Yang, unpublished data. To investigate systematically FNIII-mediated adhesion, we studied recombinant fibronectin repeats FNIII1, FNIII3, FNIII4, and FNIII10. FNIII10, which contains the integrin-binding RGD sequence, serves as a positive control and comparison standard for studying adhesive events. Pairwise amino acid sequence comparison of FNIII1, FNIII3, FNIII4, and FNIII10 reveals a range of identity from 12% (FNIII1 versusFNIII3) to 30% (FNIII3 versusFNIII4). Simultaneous comparison of all four sequences reveals 21% identity at positions in at least three of the sequences, and there is no obvious region of sequence identity that might specifically mediate cell adhesion. A pairwise analysis of 26 animal FNIII sequences showed 20% identity (12Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, FNIII1, FNIII3, FNIII4, and FNIII10resemble each other no more than they resemble FNIII domains from proteins other than fibronectin. We therefore believe that FNIII1, FNIII3, FNIII4, and FNIII10 constitute a representative spectrum of FNIII repeat sequences. Cell adhesion to FNIII10 does not require Mn2+, but does require Ca2+ or Mg2+. Cell adhesion to FNIII1, FNIII3, and FNIII4 is Mn2+-dependent (Fig. 1 B) and is inhibited by the addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 C). Different FNIII repeats require various concentrations of Mn2+ to support specific levels of adhesion. FNIII3 requires 30 μm Mn2+ to support 50% cell adhesion, whereas FNIII1 and FNIII4 require 50 and >100 μm, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, a higher concentration of Ca2+ is required to completely inhibit FNIII3-mediated adhesion relative to FNIII1-mediated adhesion (Fig. 1 C). Relative levels of the FNIII repeats bound to tissue culture plastic were equal as measured by an immunoassay. Thus, specificity of adhesion apparently reflects sequence variation among FNIII repeats. Soluble FNIII repeats block FNIII-mediated adhesion (Fig.1 D). FNIII4- and FNIII1-mediated cell adhesion is competed by FNIII3, suggesting that all FNIII repeats are using the same receptor(s). IgG domains are very closely related to FNIII repeats in structure (12Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but cells do not adhere to immunoglobulin, which contains multiple IgG domains, or to recombinant CD2, which is composed of a pair of IgG domains (Figs.1 B and 3). FNIII-dependent cell adhesion is not competed by soluble VCAM (23Lobb R. Chi-Rosso G. Leone D. Rosa M. Newman B. Luhowskyj S. Osborn L. Schiffer S. Benjamin C. Dougas I. Hession C. Chow P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1498-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which contains seven IgG domains, or by fibronectin CS-1, which contains the α4β1 integrin-binding site, demonstrating apparent specificity for the FNIII repeat structure (Fig.1 D). Furthermore, neither ovalbumin nor recombinant CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, supports cell adhesion (data not shown). Numerous studies have demonstrated that integrin-dependent adhesion to certain ligands is enhanced by the presence of Mn2+ and blocked by the addition of Ca2+. For instance, Mn2+ stimulates and Ca2+ abrogates the α1β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of NB100 cells to collagen (24Luque A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, α4β1 integrin has multiple affinity states, the highest of which is induced by Mn2+ as well as other integrin-activating reagents (25Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Vandevert C. Goldbach E.G. Shaw G. Ellis D.K. Liaw C. Fritz L.C. Tanner L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28740-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the involvement of integrins in FNIII-mediated adhesion. Adhesion to all tested repeats can be inhibited by blocking antibodies to β1 integrin (Fig. 2, Aand B). Blocking cell adhesion to FNIII3required a higher concentration of antibody than blocking adhesion to FNIII1 or FNIII4. In the presence of 100 μm Mn2+, cell adhesion to FNIII1, FNIII3, and FNIII4 was blocked completely with 5 μg/ml anti-β1 integrin antibody, whereas adhesion to FNIII10 was blocked by 80% (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of 200 μm Mn2+, however, only adhesion to FNIII4 was completely blocked by antibody at 5 μg/ml (Fig. 2 B), whereas there was little, if any, blocking of FNIII3- and FNIII10-dependent adhesion at up to 10 μg/ml antibody. These data are consistent with results demonstrating that different FNIII repeats require different amounts of Mn2+to permit equivalent levels of cell adhesion. To take advantage of integrin-activating reagents other than Mn2+, we investigated human kidney epithelial 293 cell adhesion to FNIII repeats. This cell line, along with others (see below and Fig. 4), adheres to FNIII repeats in the presence of Mn2+. Activating anti-β1 integrin antibody TS2/16 (6Arroyo A.G. Sanchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martin-Padura I. Dejana E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) stimulates adhesion of 293 cells to FNIII1, FNIII3, and FNIII4 at concentrations of Mn2+ that do not support adhesion (Fig. 2 C) as well as under conditions in which Mn2+ is replaced with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 2 D). Thus, Mn2+ can be replaced with an activating anti-β1 integrin antibody to support FNIII-mediated adhesion. We conclude that activated β1 integrins mediate cell adhesion to FNIII repeats. Most β1 integrin ligands interact with a restricted subset of integrin heterodimers. For instance, collagen interacts with α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 integrins, but not with other members of the β1 integrin family. However, no tested blocking monoclonal antibodies to α integrin subunits blocked FNIII-mediated adhesion (data not shown). Furthermore, a screen designed to identify monoclonal antibodies that block FNIII-mediated cell adhesion identified multiple anti-β1 integrin antibodies, but no anti-α integrin antibodies, consistent with results reported here.2 We speculate that FNIII-mediated adhesion is independent of specific α integrin subunits. The extracellular domains of many cytokine receptors are composed of a tandem repeat, the repeating unit of which bears evolutionary resemblance to FNIII repeats (11Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 963-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the potential adhesion of cells to FNIII repeats derived from various cytokine receptors. 293 cells adhere to the recombinant extracellular domains of the interleukin-2 receptor β chain, the interleukin-4 receptor α chain, and the interleukin-2 receptor γc chain in the presence of Mn2+ or antibody TS2/16. Cells do not adhere to recombinant CD2, which is composed of a pair of IgG domains, and adhesion is completely abrogated by anti-β1 integrin-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3). These data show that FNIII repeats derived from molecules other than extracellular domain proteins interact with activated β1 integrins and suggest the potential for direct interaction of integrins and cytokine receptors. FNIII-mediated adhesion is not specific to the PAC1 smooth muscle cell line. Primary human dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and 293 epithelial cells also adhere to FNIII repeats in an activated β1 integrin-dependent manner (Fig.4). Nonadherent T lymphocytes, after activation by an anti-CD3 antibody, also bound FNIII repeats when stimulated further by PMA or Mn2+. As the effects of PMA on integrin activation are well documented, these data further support the observation that adhesion to FNIII repeats is mediated by activated integrins. Certain cell lines did not support FNIII-mediated adhesion. The extent to which β1 integrins are “activated” may not be sufficient to promote adhesion. K562 cells are particularly sensitive to activation. For example, K562 cells expressing α1β1 integrin will bind laminin in an α1-dependent manner only in the presence of integrin-stimulating reagents (27Wong L.D. Sondheim A.B. Zachow K.R. Reichardt L.F. Ignatius M.J. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1996; 4: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Alternatively, certain cultured cells may not express the intracellular components required for strong adhesion to the FNIII repeats. For instance, binding of the integrin LFA-1(αLβ2) to its ligand ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesionmolecule 1) can be induced by expression of the intracellular protein cytohesin-1, which interacts with the intracellular domain of β2 integrin (28Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). It is important to note that all primary cell lines we have tested (T lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) adhere to FNIII repeats. Interaction between integrins and ligands mediates intracellular signaling cascades that influence many physiological processes, including changes in intracellular Ca2+, pH, tyrosine phosphorylation, gene expression, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (29Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FAK is associated with integrin-mediated signal transduction (29Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the interaction between cells and FNIII repeats supports signaling, we tested for adhesion-dependent FAK phosphorylation. Within 40 min, FAK was phosphorylated in response to cell adhesion on all tested FNIII domains as well as intact fibronectin (Fig.5). At 40 min after plating, very few cells have begun to spread on FNIII1, FNIII3, and FNIII4 (data not shown), consistent with published data suggesting that phosphorylation of FAK precedes cell spreading (30Guan J.-L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunostaining of cells spread on the different FNIII domains with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody localized sites of phosphorylation to focal contacts (Fig. 5 B; see below). These data demonstrate that the interaction of cells with FNIII domains can precipitate the initial events associated with integrin-mediated intercellular signaling. Signaling via integrins can result in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of focal contacts, sites where transmembrane integrins link the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Adhesion of cells to FNIII domains results in the formation of stress fibers (Fig.6), indicative of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, as well as in the formation of focal contacts as demonstrated by double immunofluorescence using anti-vinculin and anti-β1 integrin antibodies (Fig. 6). Thus, in the presence of integrin-activating reagents, FNIII repeats mediate integrin-dependent architectural changes within the cell. Our data demonstrate that FNIII repeats mediate adhesion and signaling through experimentally activated β1 integrins. Although a comparison of aligned sequences reveals no obvious region common to FNIII repeats that might participate in integrin binding, β1 integrins may interact through particular charged residues in a specific loop. D'Souza et al. (31D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have proposed that integrins bind RGD-containing ligands through a cation displacement mechanism. In this scenario, the Asp residue provides a transitional cation coordination site during cation displacement and ligand binding (31D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All FNIII domains contain solvent-accessible Asp or Glu residues in loop E-F, on which RGD is displayed in FNIII10. The activated carboxyl residues in either of these amino acids could provide an analogous transitional cation coordination site. Alternatively, β1 integrin subunits may bind FNIII domains through a set of amino acids that occupy homologous positions in the tertiary structure, but are separated in primary sequence and therefore undetectable by simple sequence alignment. Although the physiological activation of integrins is not clearly understood, integrin activity can be modulated in vitro by a variety of agents, including divalent cations, phorbol esters, and activating antibodies. We have demonstrated that β1 integrins, activated by three independent reagents (Mn2+, PMA, and mAb TS2/16), will adhere to FNIII repeats. PMA and antibody TS2/16 are clearly not physiological activators of β1 integrins, although the former implicates the protein kinase C pathway in activation. Mn2+ may, however, be a physiological activator. The concentration of Mn2+ in tissue is estimated at 1–14 μm, and estimates as high as 50 μm in bone and 30 μm in liver have been reported (32Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Suehiro K. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10365-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These latter figures are consistent with the concentration of Mn2+ required for β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to FNIII repeats. The increase in cell adhesivity associated with activated integrins is attributed either to an increase in affinity for ligand or to post-occupancy-mediated events such as cytoskeleton assembly (4Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Both mechanisms assume an interaction between the integrin and a defined sequence within the ligand (e.g. RGD). We have now demonstrated a third mechanism by which activated integrins can increase cell adhesivity, namely, through promiscuous interactions with multiple FNIII repeats. Activated integrins are associated with numerous physiological processes in multiple cell types. Vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and activated T lymphocytes express activated integrins in vivo (34Arroyo A.G. Garcia-Vincuña R. Marazuela M. Yednock T. González-Amaro R. Sánchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Koyama N. Seki J. Vergel S. Mattsson E.J.R. Yednock T. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Clowes A.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 749-761PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of a fibronectin matrix, critical to diverse biological processes, requires both activated integrins and reorganization of an actin cytoskeleton (4Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Interactions between activated integrins and FNIII repeats could stabilize the interaction of cells with fibronectin and enhance cytoskeleton rearrangement to help modulate matrix assembly. Interactions between RGD and α5β1 integrin or between CS-1 and α4β1 integrin are thought to account for fibronectin-mediated T cell functions such as migration, signal transduction, and differentiation (36Shimizu Y. Shaw S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2292-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). FNIII repeats found in fibronectin and other matrix proteins may augment RGD- and CS-1-dependent interactions. Numerous extracellular domains of interleukin receptors contain FNIII repeats (11Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 963-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is speculative, but reasonable to suggest, that activated β1 integrins may bind directly to cytokine receptors via FNIII repeats to induce or otherwise modulate both integrin- and cytokine-mediated signaling. This suggestion is supported by our observation that FNIII repeats derived from cytokine receptors support β1 integrin-dependent adhesion. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that non-RGD-containing FNIII repeats with diverse sequences mediate cell adhesion through activated β1 integrins. This interaction is apparently specific to FNIII repeat structure as we have not consistently observed activated integrin-dependent adhesion to other proteins. The specific adhesivity of individual repeats apparently depends on variations in FNIII sequence. Furthermore, engagement of activated β1 integrins by FNIII repeats results in physiological responses by cells including tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Given the number of molecules that contain FNIII domains, the potential for integrin-dependent intercellular and cell-matrix communication is dramatically increased and may significantly enhance sequence-specific integrin-ligand interactions.

A structural model is presented to account for the observed rearrangements of intersubunit contacts within the complex during the loading process. The complexities of genomic DNA replication place special demands on the multiprotein complex that must carry out this process. The complex must move processively along the DNA template to account for the rapid and efficient synthesis seen in vivo (1Nossal N.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Young M.C. Reddy M.K. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8675-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but must also be able to cycle on and off the DNA rapidly to form Okazaki fragments during lagging strand synthesis. It is probably the complexity of this semidiscontinuous synthesis of double-stranded DNA, as well as the need to interact with repair, recombination, and transcription complexes, that has resulted in the evolution of separate protein subassemblies to perform different replication functions. This separation of functions may make it easier for the system to respond to rapidly changing requirements during the replication process (3O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Kong X.-P. Stukenberg P.T. Onrust R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Processive DNA synthesis is not an intrinsic quality of the T4 DNA polymerase itself under physiological solution conditions. On the contrary, under these conditions T4 DNA polymerase dissociates from single-stranded template DNA after only a few nucleotide residues have been added to the nascent DNA strand (4Fairfield F.R. Newport J.W. Dolejsi M.K. von Hippel P.H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Instead, another protein complex, called a sliding clamp, is used to fix the polymerase to the DNA and permit the addition of many nucleotide residues per binding event to the nascent chains within the replication fork. These sliding clamps, in the various replication systems, have the characteristic shape of a ring that can completely encircle the double-stranded DNA (5Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 6Krishna T.S. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). 1I. Moarefi and J. Kuriyan, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the term “sliding clamp” (8Huang C.-C. Hearst J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4087-4094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) signifies that polymerases bound to these proteins are “clamped” to the DNA but are still free to “slide” along the DNA templates in the course of elongation synthesis. The loading of a sliding clamp onto DNA requires the ATP-driven action of yet another protein complex. ATP hydrolysis is probably necessary to produce the substantial conformational changes that must occur when a topologically closed ring is forced to encircle DNA. In the T4 system, the sliding clamp is a homotrimeric ring of gp45 subunits (9Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

The arrangement of the gp44 and gp62 subunits within the clamp-loading complex is not yet known. The gp44 subunits carry the ATP binding sites of the complex as well as a binding site for the DNA cofactor that can stimulate the ATPase activity of both the gp44/62 complex and of a tetrameric complex of gp44 alone (10Jarvis T.C.

Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gp62 subunit is required for further stimulation of the ATPase activity by the gp45 sliding clamp, which does not stimulate the ATPase activity of the complex formed by gp44 subunits alone (11Rush J.

The four gp44 subunits bind four ATP molecules, which appear to be hydrolyzed in a single turnover reaction during the clamp loading process (12Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Young M.C. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP hydrolysis correlates well with the rate of holoenzyme complex formation (about 1 s−1; see Ref. 14Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10881-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), implying that ATP hydrolysis is, at least partially, rate-limiting within the clamp loading reaction (12Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,13Young M.C. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The gp44/62 complex functions catalytically to load the gp45. Therefore, once the gp45 loading process is complete, gp44/62 dissociates from the gp45-DNA complex and is then free to load another clamp (12Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Young M.C. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

ATP is absolutely required to assemble a functional holoenzyme onto DNA, and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (ATPγS) cannot substitute for it (17Piperno J.R. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5174-5179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Footprinting (19Munn M.M. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20024-20033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cross-linking (20Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Nossal N.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) studies have shown that ATPγS is nonetheless sufficient to assemble the accessory proteins complex onto primer-template DNA. These studies have shown that ATP hydrolysis causes a rearrangement of the proteins, together with a decrease in the DNA contacts of all three proteins of the complex. However, little is known about the actual physical changes that occur within the loading process during ATP hydrolysis to lead to the assembly of the gp45 trimer ring onto the DNA duplex. Direct studies of the conformational changes within the gp45 protein that are induced by the ATPase activity of the gp44/62 have recently been performed in our laboratory (21Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in the Benkovic laboratory (22Sexton D.J. Carver T.E. Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28045-28051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by fluorescently labeling single cysteine residues introduced in gp45 by site-directed mutagenesis at position 19 (21Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and at position 7 (22Sexton D.J. Carver T.E. Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28045-28051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies both showed that ATP hydrolysis is required to induce a fluorescent intensity change in the labeled gp45 mutants in the presence of gp44/62 and that this fluorescent change is reversed upon the addition of primer-template DNA, apparently reflecting the dissociation of the gp44/62-gp45 complex as a consequence of clamp loading. The binding of ATPγS does not induce this fluorescence change. Titration of the fluorescently labeled gp45 mutants with gp44/62 in the presence of ATP revealed a binding stoichiometry of one gp45 trimer to one gp44/62 complex. This result suggested that the observed fluorescence change reflects the formation of an activated clamp loading complex between the two protein subassemblies. Depolarization of fluorescence studies supported this conclusion, revealing a larger anisotropy value and therefore a larger size of the rotational unit when ATP was present, compared with the anisotropy observed in the absence of this nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ATPγS or ATP and DNA together (21Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We note that ATPγS has been shown to induce a DNA-dependent conformational change (22Sexton D.J. Carver T.E. Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28045-28051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which is consistent with previous studies in which a DNA-accessory protein complex was formed in the presence of ATPγS (19Munn M.M. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20024-20033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Nossal N.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although it is not known if this complex is properly assembled. To gain more insight into the modes and dynamics of contact between gp45 and the gp44/62 complex, we have labeled the same gp45 mutants used in the previous fluorescence work with a bifunctional reagent containing a maleimide group at one end that can react with the sulfhydryl group of cysteine and which carries an aryl azide moiety at the other end that, upon photoactivation to a nitrene, covalently inserts into nearby covalent bonds. The use of two mutants with the cysteines located in different positions on the gp45 ring structure has allowed us to propose a preliminary picture of the topographical arrangement of the subunits in the complex and of the way in which this topography might change during the clamp loading process. The cysteine-specific photo-cross-linker TFPAM-3 (described in Ref. 23Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, and shown as Structure Fs1) was a generous gift of Dr. R. Aggeler from the laboratory of Dr. R. A. Capaldi at the University of Oregon. This compound is now available from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Perfluorophenyl azides have been shown to be better photolabeling agents than their nitrophenyl azide analogues, because substitution of ring protons with fluorine atoms in phenyl azides leads to fewer rearrangement reactions and higher yields of insertions into C–H and N–H bonds (24Keana J.F.W. Cai S.X. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3640-3647Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum to the gp44/62 complex was generously supplied by Dr. E. P. Geiduschek of the University of California at San Diego, and a polyclonal antiserum to gp62 was the generous gift of Dr. M. Reddy (University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee). DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) and were used without further purification. All other biochemicals and chemicals were obtained from Sigma, Aldrich, or Boehringer-Mannheim and were also used without further purification. The primer-template DNA used in these experiments is shown as Sequence 1 and was made by annealing the component oligonucleotides. The completeness of the hybridization process was confirmed by native gel electrophoresis. 5′­CCGCAGCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA­3′3′­GGCGTCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTAGGTCTTGTTTTGCCGGTCA­5′Sequence 1 The construction, by site-directed mutagenesis, of gp45 mutants gp45S19C and gp45K81C, containing a single cysteine for serine substitution at position 19 or a cysteine for lysine substitution at position 81, respectively, has been described (21Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the positions within the gp45 ring of the cysteine residues in these two mutants. gp44/62 complexes and wild-type and mutant gp45 were purified as described previously (13Young M.C. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The purification of gp41 helicase has also been described (25Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using the following calculated molar extinction coefficients. For gp44/62, ε280 nm = 1.23 × 105m−1 cm−1; for gp45, ε280 nm = 5.72 × 104m−1 cm−1 (26Jarvis T.C. Ring D.M. Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15160-15167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and for gp41, ε280 nm = 4.55 × 105m−1 cm−1 (27Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The gp45K81C and gp45S19C mutants were passed through BioSpin 6 centrifuge columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol to remove any thiols and primary amines present in the protein storage buffer. About 50 μl of mutant protein stock solution were labeled at a concentration of 30–40 μm gp45 monomer, using 250 μm TFPAM-3 (diluted from a 4 mm stock solution in Me2SO) at room temperature for 1 h. After quenching the reaction with 1 mm cysteine for 30 min, excess label was removed by passage through another BioSpin 6 column. The labeled proteins were stored at −20 °C in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 60 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, and 25% glycerol. Labeling of the cysteine residues of both gp45 mutants was complete, as indicated by reaction of the proteins with the thiol-detecting reagent, 5,5′-dithiobis(2,2′-nitrobenzoic acid) (28Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 82: 70-77Crossref Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Before modification with TFPAM-3, all three cysteine residues of the gp45 trimer in both mutants could be reacted with 5,5′-dithiobis(2,2′-nitrobenzoic acid). No reaction was observed after the mutant proteins were modified with TFPAM-3. Labeled protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with unlabeled proteins as standards. This was necessary because the protein spectra overlap with that of the TFPAM-3 label. Replication-stimulating activities of the gp45 mutants are unaffected by the amino acid changes and modifications made (31Latham G.J. Bacheller D. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Photolysis was carried out in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 60 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, at the proteins, DNA, and nucleotide concentrations indicated for each experiment, by irradiating the samples for 45 min at room temperature in the tip of a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) at a distance of about 2 cm from a 6-W “366-nm” UV lamp (UVP, Inc., model UVL-56, Blak-Ray lamp). 3This “366-nm” UV lamp was used because its putative emission spectrum falls far above the absorption wavelengths for proteins and nucleic acids, and we wished to avoid photochemical damage to these entities. As our data show, this lamp is very effective in inducing cross-linking of our proteins. In addition, the absorption spectrum of the dye changes significantly as a function of time of irradiation with this lamp (R. Aggeler, personal communication). On the other hand, as we were reminded by Professor E. Peter Geiduschek (University of California at San Diego), the TFPAM-3 adduct itself absorbs little, if any, light at 366 nm. Thus, the effectiveness of this lamp in inducing photochemical cross-linking probably reflects the breadth of its actual emission spectrum (even after passage through a “366-nm” filter). At 338 nm, the absorbance of TFPAM-3 is about 1.5% of its maximum absorbance at 250 nm. Furthermore, the emission spectrum of the lamp displays several peaks between 300 and 366 nm as well as a basal emission level, and the filter transmits at least 10% of the incident light in the 320–366-nm range. We assume that the effective wavelengths that trigger the photochemical reaction that is responsible for cross-linking actually fall in this region of the emission spectrum. Under these conditions the label is completely photolyzed in about 35 min. 4R. Aggeler, personal communication. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, followed by subunit identification using polyclonal antibodies to gp45, gp44/62, and gp62, respectively. Western blotting was carried out in a Bio-Rad TransBlot System using Nitropure-supported nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm) purchased from Micron Separations, Inc. (Westboro, MA). Antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit from Amersham Corp. Two different mutants of gp45 were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis to introduce single defined cysteine residues as reactive sites within the protein (21Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The positions of the cysteines in these mutants are shown in Fig. 1 (drawn according to coordinates kindly supplied by I. Moarefi and J. Kuriyan. 5I. Moarefi and J. Kuriyan, personal communication. In previous work, we had reacted these cysteines with fluorophores to examine the conformational changes induced in the gp45 protein by the action of the gp44/62 ATPase (21Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To better define structural features of the interaction between the two proteins and to monitor their changing relative positions during the loading process, these mutants were reacted with a cysteine-specific photo-cross-linker to permit us to probe near-neighbor contacts at specific positions on the gp45 trimer. The photo-cross-linker (TFPAM-3) used in this work (Ref. 23Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; see “Experimental Procedures”) contains a maleimide group that can be reacted with a cysteine residue and a tetrafluorophenyl azide group that can be photoactivated to form a highly reactive and relatively nonspecific nitrene that inserts into a nearby chemical bond with high efficiency (24Keana J.F.W. Cai S.X. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3640-3647Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These functional groups of the cross-linker are separated by a flexible covalent linker that is 13 Å in length. Therefore, when we state in what follows that one protein subunit “contacts” another at a particular gp45 residue position, we mean that the proteins have approached within 13 Å of one another at this position under the defined conditions. The cross-linked products obtained were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cysteine residues of the gp45S19C mutant lie on one side of the ring of the gp45 trimer and close to the central hole (Fig. 1). Photolysis of the TFPAM-3-labeled gp45S19C mutant alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) leads to the appearance of a new band that migrates faster then the unphotolyzed sample (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) and corresponds to an internally cross-linked gp45 subunit. In the presence of gp44/62 (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), photolysis results in the appearance of three cross-linked products that run above the gp44 subunit and are not visible in the unphotolyzed sample (Fig.2 A, lane 6). These products were shown by Western analysis (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 7, and12) to correspond to covalent gp45-gp62 adducts (lower band) and two gp45-gp44 adducts (corresponding to the two upper bands, labeled a and b, that run very close together; the third closely spaced band of this group is a contaminant). This means that the TFPAM-3 cross-linkers attached to the cysteines located at position 19 on each subunit of the gp45 ring can reach both gp44 and gp62 subunits within the loading complex. The two gp45-gp44 cross-linked products that run with similar mobilities probably result from cross-links formed between Cys-19 on the gp45 subunit and different sites on individual gp44 subunits. When photolysis is carried out in the presence of ATP, we observe an increase in the yield of the band representing gp45-gp62 cross-linked product, as well as an increase in the upper band (band b) of the two closely spaced gp45-gp44 cross-linked products. The lower band (band a) nearly disappears. Also, a new band of slower mobility (band c) appears that is identified as a new gp45-gp44 cross-linked product by Western analysis (Fig. 2 A, lane 4, and Fig.2 B, lanes 3, 8, and13). When 30/50-mer primer-template DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) is added to a complex gp44/62 and gp45S19C in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 A, lane 5; Fig. 2 B, lanes 4, 9, and14), the band with the slowest mobility (band c) disappears, and the overall cross-linking pattern resembles that of the two proteins in the absence of ATP and DNA. Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B) confirms this and shows even more clearly the differences in the amount of cross-linking mentioned above, with the amount of the cross-linked products increasing when ATP is added and decreasing again when DNA is added in the presence of ATP. The gp45K81C mutant carries its cysteine residue very near to the subunit interface along the outside rim of the gp45 ring (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly, the photolysis of this TFPAM-3-modified mutant (Fig.3 A, lane 2) leads to the appearance of two new bands above the monomer, consistent with the formation of cross-linked gp45 dimer and trimer species (see “Discussion”). In the presence of gp44/62 (Fig. 3 A, lane 3), photo-cross-linking with the gp45K81C mutant generates several extra bands (labeled a, b, c, d,e, and f in Fig. 3), which Western analysis shows to contain gp45 and the gp44 subunits (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3, 6, and 10). No cross-linked product involving the gp62 subunit is observed with this mutant under these conditions, implying that TFPAM-3 adducts attached to Cys-81 on the gp45 subunits can only reach the gp44 subunit of the gp44/62 complex. An overall decrease in both the number and the intensity of the gp44-gp45 cross-linked products is observed when cross-linking with gp45K81C is carried out in the presence of ATP. We observe that the fainter bands (bands a and f) disappear (see the Western blot, Fig. 3 B,lanes 4 and 7), that band c decreases in intensity, and that the stronger bands (bands d and f) decrease slightly in intensity. More significantly, a new cross-linked product appears that is barely seen by silver staining but is clearly detected by Western analysis. This band results from the cross-linking of gp45 and gp62 subunits (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and11). Western analysis allows us to detect three gp45-gp62 cross-linked products. This is expected, even if only one of the three Cys-81 residues in the trimer can reach the gp62 subunit, since two or three gp45 subunits can still be cross-linked to the gp62 subunit via inter-gp45 subunit cross-linking. The above observations suggested that ATP induces a conformational change that weakens the contact of the Cys-81 adduct with the gp44 subunit and allows at least one of the substituted Cys-81 residues to contact the gp62 subunit. When 30/50-mer DNA containing a primer-template junction is added to the substituted gp45K81C mutant in the presence of ATP, the cross-linking pattern (Fig. 3 A,lane 5; Fig. 3 B, lanes 5,8, and 12) resembles in some ways that obtained with ATP alone. Some of the gp45-gp44 cross-linked products seen in the absence of ATP and DNA have disappeared (bands a and f) or are only barely visible (band c). In other ways, this new pattern resembles that obtained with gp44/62 and gp45 alone, in that gp45-gp62 cross-linked products are not present. Also, the two main gp44-gp45 cross-linked products (bands d and e) have comparable intensities. These two bands are slightly more intense in the presence of ATP and DNA or in the absence of both cofactors than in the presence of ATP alone. To distinguish between the effects of binding and of hydrolysis of ATP, we performed photo-cross-linking experiments in the presence of different nucleotides. The cross-linking pattern of the TFPAM-3-labeled gp45S19C obtained in the presence of ATP plus EDTA (EDTA prevents ATP hydrolysis by chelating Mg2+) (Fig. 4,lane 5) is very similar to that obtained in the presence of ATP alone (Fig. 4, lane 4), suggesting that the binding of ATP by gp44/62 is sufficient to induce a conformational change. However, the amount of cross-linked products is greater in the presence of ATP with Mg2+, indicating that either the complex is somehow stabilized, leading to more complex formation and a higher cross-linked band intensity, or that a different gp45 conformation is attained after ATP has been hydrolyzed, placing the label closer to the gp44/62 complex and thus resulting in higher cross-linking efficiency. Similar results were obtained by cross-linking in the presence of ATPγS (data not shown). The direct addition of ADP, a product (with Pi) of the ATP hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by gp44/62, appears to drive the gp44/62-gp45S19C complex into a still different cross-linked conformation (Fig. 4, lanes 6). This conformation is manifested by the near disappearance of the band with the slowest mobility (band c) that was present in the samples containing ATP and ATP plus EDTA and by the relative amounts of the two closely migrating gp45-gp44 products (the lower band predominates in the presence of ADP, while the upper band predominates when any of the other nucleotide cofactors are present). Fig.5 shows the results of cross-linking the labeled K81C mutant of gp45 to gp44/62 in the absence and presence of various nucleotide cofactors. We note the strong similarity of the cross-linking patterns obtained in the presence of ATP (Fig.5 A, lane 4) and in the presence of ATP + EDTA"
https://openalex.org/W2064347689,"Two distinct but related groups of cDNA clones, CKβ4GT-I and CKβ4GT-II, have been isolated by screening a chicken hepatoma cDNA library with a bovine β1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GT) cDNA clone. CKβ4GT-I is predicted to encode a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of 41 kDa with one consensus site for <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation. CKβ4GT-II is predicted to encode a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of 43 kDa with five potential <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation sites. At the amino acid level, the coding regions of CKβ4GT-I and CKβ4GT-II are 52% identical to each other and 62 and 49% identical, respectively, to bovine β4GT. Despite this divergence in amino acid sequence, high levels of expression of each cDNA in<i>Trichoplusia ni</i> insect cells demonstrate that both CKβ4GT-I and CKβ4GT-II encode an α-lactalbumin-responsive, UDP-galactose:<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine β4-galactosyltransferase. An analysis of CKβ4GT-I and CKβ4GT-II genomic clones established that the intron positions within the coding region are conserved when compared with each other, and these positions are identical to the mouse and human β4GT genes. Thus CKβ4GT-I and CKβ4GT-II are the result of the duplication of an ancestral gene and subsequent divergence. CKβ4GT-I maps to chicken chromosome Z in a region of conserved synteny with the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 4 and human chromosome 9p, where β4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38) had previously been mapped. Consequently, during the evolution of mammals, it is the CKβ4GT-I gene lineage that has been recruited for the biosynthesis of lactose. CKβ4GT-II maps to a region of chicken chromosome 8 that exhibits conserved synteny with human chromosome 1p. An inspection of the current human gene map of expressed sequence tags reveals that there is a gene noted to be highly similar to β4GT located in this syntenic region on human chromosome 1p. Because both the CKβ4GT-I and CKβ4GT-II gene lineages are detectable in mammals, duplication of the ancestral β4-galactosyltransferase gene occurred over 250 million years ago in an ancestral species common to both mammals and birds."
https://openalex.org/W2092327903,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) requires proteolytic cleavage to generate a 37-kDa C-terminal fragment that translocates to the cytosol and ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2. Cleavage within cells is mediated by furin, occurs between arginine 279 and glycine 280, and requires an arginine at both P1 and P4 residues. To study the proteolytic processing of PE-derived chimeric toxins, TGFα-PE38 (transforming growth factor fused to the domains II and III of PE) and a mutant form, TGFα-PE38gly279, were each produced inEscherichia coli. When assessed on various epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-positive cell lines, TGFα-PE38 was 100–500-fold more toxic than TGFα-PE38gly279. In contrast to PE, where cleavage by furin is only evident at pH 5.5, furin cleaved TGFα-PE38 over a broad pH range, while TGFα-PE38gly279 was resistant to cleavage. TGFα-PE38 was poorly toxic for furin-deficient LoVo cells, unless it was first pretreated in vitro with furin. Furin treatment produced a nicked protein that was 30-fold more toxic than its unnicked counterpart. Using the single chain immunotoxin HB21scFv-PE40 as a substrate, furin-mediated processing of an antibody-based immunotoxin was also evaluated. HB21scFv-PE40, which targets cells expressing the transferrin receptor, was cleaved in a similar fashion to that of TGFα-PE38 and nicked HB21scFv-PE40 exhibited increased toxicity for LoVo cells. In short-term experiments, the rate of reduction in protein synthesis by furin-nicked immunotoxins was increased compared with unnicked protein, indicating that cleavage by furin can be a rate-limiting step. We conclude that furin-mediated cleavage of PE-derived immunotoxins is important for their cytotoxic activity. Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) requires proteolytic cleavage to generate a 37-kDa C-terminal fragment that translocates to the cytosol and ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2.

In contrast to PE, where cleavage by furin is only evident at pH 5.5, furin cleaved TGFα-PE38 over a broad pH range, while TGFα-PE38gly279 was resistant to cleavage. TGFα-PE38 was poorly toxic for furin-deficient LoVo cells, unless it was first pretreated in vitro with furin. Furin treatment produced a nicked protein that was 30-fold more toxic than its unnicked counterpart. Using the single chain immunotoxin HB21scFv-PE40 as a substrate, furin-mediated processing of an antibody-based immunotoxin was also evaluated. HB21scFv-PE40, which targets cells expressing the transferrin receptor, was cleaved in a similar fashion to that of TGFα-PE38 and nicked HB21scFv-PE40 exhibited increased toxicity for LoVo cells. In short-term experiments, the rate of reduction in protein synthesis by furin-nicked immunotoxins was increased compared with unnicked protein, indicating that cleavage by furin can be a rate-limiting step. We conclude that furin-mediated cleavage of PE-derived immunotoxins is important for their cytotoxic activity. Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) 1The abbreviations used are: PE,Pseudomonas exotoxin; EF2, elongation factor 2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HB21scFv-PE40, single chain immunotoxin targeted to the human transferrin receptor; IC50, the concentration that produces a 50% inhibition of protein synthesis; PE40, domains II, Ib, and III of PE; PE38, domains II and III of PE; scFv, single chain Fv fragment of a monoclonal antibody; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a single chain protein toxin that is toxic for mammalian cells because of its ability to translocate to the cell cytosol and ADP-ribosylate elongation factor 2 (EF2) and inhibit protein synthesis (1Pastan I. FitzGerald D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15157-15160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once synthesized, the toxin folds to form a 3-domain protein composed of an N-terminal domain that mediates receptor binding, a middle domain that mediates translocation and has a prominent arginine-rich loop that allows proteolytic cleavage, and a C-terminal domain that has ADP-ribosylating activity and a endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence (2Allured V.S.

In its native form, PE is a proenzyme, and in biochemical experiments, it requires a strong denaturant and reducing agent to reveal its enzyme activity (5Leppla S.H. Martin O.C. Muehl L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, of considerable interest to learn how toxin molecules unfold and are processed within cells without the use of harsh treatments. The pathway that PE takes to the cytosol begins with its binding to the multi-ligand surface receptor known as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), also known as the α2-macroglobulin receptor (6Kounnas M.Z.

Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Binding leads to endocytosis via coated pits, which brings the toxin to the low pH environment of the endosomal compartment. There, the toxin is cleaved into an N-terminal fragment of 28 kDa and a C-terminal fragment of 37 kDa (8Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage is between arginine 279 and glycine 280 (9Ogata M. Fryling C.M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and occurs when the toxin is exposed to furin at pH 5.0–5.5 (10Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lacking furin exhibit a toxin-resistant phenotype. Toxin sensitivity can be restored by transfection with a cDNA encoding furin (11Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Robertson B.J. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the peptide bond between residues 279 and 280 leaves the toxin fragments joined by the disulfide bond linking cysteines 265 and 287. At a later step in the pathway, this bond is reduced by a mechanism that is yet unclear. Translocation of the reduced 37-kDa fragment to the cytosol requires the presence of a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (4Chaudhary V.K. Jinno Y. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, the 37-kDa fragment ADP-ribosylates EF-2 (12Iglewski B.H. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1975; 72: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) inhibits protein synthesis and induces apoptosis (13Brinkmann U. Brinkmann E. Gallo M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10427-10431Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To target the cell-killing activity of PE to specific populations of mammalian cells, the binding domain of the toxin is removed and replaced with cDNAs that encode antibody Fv fragments or receptor-binding ligands (14Pastan I.H. Pai L.H. Brinkmann U. Fitzgerald D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 758: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). New binding sequences are placed at the 5′-end of constructs and fused with domains II and III of PE. Depending on the presence or absence of subdomain Ib, these truncated forms of PE are called PE40 and PE38, respectively. In native PE, portions of domain I associate with domain III via several hydrogen bonds (2Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The replacement of domain I by foreign sequences eliminates these interactions and changes toxin structure. This is reflected in the fact that immunotoxins exhibit full ADP-ribosylating activity, without the need of a denaturant. The intracellular pathways of immunotoxin traffic have not been evaluated extensively. Differences in immunotoxin processing are likely to occur because receptors of various function are targeted. Also, truncated toxins are likely to behave differently than their full-length counterparts. When characterizing the cytotoxicity of TGFα-PE40 on various cancer cell lines, it was noted that this immunotoxin was 10–100-fold more active than native PE (15Siegall C.B. Xu Y.H. Chaudhary V.K. Adhya S. Fitzgerald D. Pastan I. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The greater potency of the chimeric could have been due to differences in receptor number or binding affinity or to interactions with other cellular components. Here we characterize the proteolytic processing of PE-derived immunotoxins, report on comparisons with the cleavage of native PE, and speculate that the less stringent pH conditions needed to cleave chimeric toxins may contribute to their increased potency. The cell lines MCF7, HT29, KB, A431, LoVo, and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). To introduce the mouse furin sequence in the pRc/CMV plasmid (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA),HindIII and NotI sites were added by polymerase chain reaction at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the furin gene from the pRK7.musfurΔ1 plasmid (16Chiron M. Ogata M. FitzGerald D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The primers used were: 5′-GGTTCTAAGCTTCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAG-3′ and 5′-ATCGATTGCGGCCGCTAGATTCATTCATCTCGAGT-3′. The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with HindIII andNotI and ligated into cleaved pRc/CMV vector. This resulting construct, pRc/CMVfurΔ1, encodes a truncated soluble form of mouse furin (nucleotides 1–2142, amino acids 1–714). CHO cells plated at a density of 3 × 105cells/35-mm dish were transfected with 2.5 μg of the DNA construct pRc/CMVfurΔ1 by using Transfectam® (Promega). After 48 h, transfected cells were selected by treatment with Geneticin (G-418, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 mg/ml. The cells were then cloned by limiting dilution. Colonies were subsequently screened for secretion of soluble furin. A 10-μl aliquot of supernatant from each colony was tested for its ability to cleave the mutant toxin PEala281 as described previously (10Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clone CHOfurΔ1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The culture medium was replaced by serum-free minimal essential medium that was harvested 48 h later. The protease was then purified from conditioned medium by high performance liquid chromatography using a nonporous DEAE resin. Peak fractions, detected by Western blotting using anti-furin polyclonal antibodies, were pooled and used for protease assays. The furin preparation had an activity ranging from 2–8 × 10−7 units μl−1. As defined previously, 1 unit of furin cleaved 1 μmol of the mutant PEala281 in 1 min at 23 °C (10Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of toxins was conducted in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5–6.0, 200 mm HEPES, pH 6.5–7.5, or 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5–8.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 μg of toxin and 8 × 10−6 units of furin. Samples were incubated at 23 °C for 20 h and reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Digestion products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Following TGFα-PE38 cleavage, the reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and stained with Ponceau S to identify the 35-kDa fragment. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on the excised fragment. Automated Edman degradation analyses were carried out at the Protein Analysis Core Laboratory of the Cancer Center of Wake Forest University. PE and PE-derived chimeric toxins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21/λDE3 as described previously (15Siegall C.B. Xu Y.H. Chaudhary V.K. Adhya S. Fitzgerald D. Pastan I. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside, the expressed HB21ScFv-PE40 and TGFα-PE38 chimeric toxins accumulated in intracellular inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were denatured in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride and renatured in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The crude dialyzed protein preparation was then purified by sequential, Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), Mono-Q (Pharmacia), and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (15Siegall C.B. Xu Y.H. Chaudhary V.K. Adhya S. Fitzgerald D. Pastan I. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Brinkmann U. Pai L.H. FitzGerald D.J. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8616-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PE-related toxins were added to cells to determine their ability to inhibit protein synthesis. Purified proteins were diluted from concentrated stocks into PBS containing 0.2% human serum albumin and then added to cells for the indicated times. The cells were subsequently pulse-labeled with3H-leucine for 1 h and then washed with PBS. Proteins were precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH. The radioactivity associated with the precipitated proteins was determined by scintillation spectroscopy. Controls consisted of cells that were not treated with toxin. PE requires cleavage in domain II, between arginine 279 and glycine 280, to produce a C-terminal fragment capable of translocating to the cytosol and ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2. By mutating either arginine 276 or arginine 279 (P4 and P1, respectively) to glycine, PE is rendered refractory to cleavage and non-toxic for cells (8Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGFα-PE38, a ligand toxin composed of TGFα fused to domains II and III of PE, is toxic for cells expressing the EGF receptor. To characterize the cell-mediated cleavage of this ligand toxin, arginine 279 2The numbering system for amino acids in chimeric toxins reflects their location in the native toxin. was mutated to glycine to produce TGFα-PE38gly279. With the exception of LoVo cells (see below), TGFα-PE38 was toxic for cells expressing the EGF receptor, with IC50 (the concentration of immunotoxin causing a 50% reduction in protein synthesis) values in the range of 0.1–2.4 ng/ml while TGFα-PE38gly279 was 146- to >1000-fold less active (TableI). This indicated that arginine 279 was important for toxicity, possibly to facilitate cell-mediated cleavage. Unexpectedly, TGFα-PE38gly279 was toxic for A431 cells, with an IC50 of 10 ng/ml. This toxicity was apparently caused by ligand-receptor interactions, a phenomenon that has been reported previously for A431 cells and other non-toxic forms of TGFα-PE (18Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To confirm the ligand-receptor nature of this effect, we report that PEgly279 exhibited very low toxicity for A431 cells with an IC50 of >1000 ng/ml (Table I). Cells that do not express the EGF receptor, such as CHO, were resistant to both the wild-type and the mutant forms of the chimeric toxin (Table I).Table ICytotoxicity of TGFα-PE38 toxinsCell lineTissue of originIC50(ng/ml)TGFα-PE38TGFα-PE38 gly279MCF7Breast1.1>1,000HT29Colon2.4350LoVoColon37>1,000KBCpidermoid0.1310A4311-aA431 IC50 (PE) = 5 ng/ml; IC50(PEgly279) >1,000 ng/ml.Cpidermoid0.2810CHOCvary>1,000>1,000TGFα-PE38 and TGFα-PE38gly279 proteins were added to various cell lines and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab TGFα-PE38 and TGFα-PE38gly279 proteins were added to various cell lines and incubated overnight at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the level of protein synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]leucine into cellular protein. Results are expressed as IC50 values. Previously, we showed that PE was cleaved optimally by furin at pH 5.5, with no cleavage detected at pH values close to neutral (10Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result reflected an apparent pH-dependent change in toxin conformation and not the pH optimum of furin. Here we show that furin-mediated cleavage of TGFα-PE38 at pH 5.5 generated fragments of 35 and 11 kDa (Fig.1). The 35-kDa fragment is equivalent to the 37-kDa fragment from native PE. The 11-kDa band was not resolved in this gel. No products were seen when TGFα-PE38gly279 was incubated with furin (Fig. 1). To determine if the cleavage of the chimeric toxins resembled that of the parent toxin, furin, and TGFα-PE38 were co-incubated over a wide pH range. Results indicated that cleavage had a broad acidic optimum (pH 5.0–6.5), but fragments were produced at all values tested from 4.5 to 8.5 (Fig. 1). The generation of the 35- and 11-kDa fragments was consistent with cleavage at arginine 279. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 35-kDa fragment confirmed this (data not shown). LoVo is a human colon carcinoma cell line harboring two defective alleles of the furin gene (19Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Frequently, colon carcinomas and cell lines derived from them display high levels of EGF receptors, which potentially would make LoVo cells a good target for this ligand toxin. However, TGFα-PE38 had a relatively low activity against this line (IC50 = 37 ng/ml, Table I, and Fig.2). This result was consistent with the hypothesis that furin-mediated cleavage was necessary for toxicity. To test this directly, TGFα-PE38 was cleaved by furin to produce a nicked toxin (held together via the disulfide bond joining cysteines 265 and 287) that was then added to LoVo cells for 24 h. Precleavage increased cytotoxic activity by 30-fold (Fig. 2). In short-term kinetic experiments, unnicked TGFα-PE38, used at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml, exhibited little or no toxicity for LoVo cells while nicked toxin caused significant inhibition of protein synthesis (compare Fig.3 A with 3B). The greater activity of nicked TGFα-PE38 suggested that cleavage by furin was equivalent to processing by cells. An identical furin treatment of TGFα-PE38gly279 did not enhance toxicity, confirming that cleavage was necessary for activity (data not shown).Figure 3Kinetics of the toxicity by nicked and unnicked TGFα-PE38 on LoVo cells. The level of protein synthesis was determined as described in Fig. 2. One representative experiment is shown. The values are the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicates and are expressed as percent of the control. A, TGFα-PE38 was incubated for 20 h at 23 °C in 0.2 m sodium acetate, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 5.5 and then added to LoVo cells at three different concentrations (10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, and 1 μg/ml) for the length of time indicated. B, cleavage of TGFα-PE38 (5 μg) was performed at 23 °C for 20 h in 0.2m sodium acetate, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 5.5, using 1.6 × 10−5 units of recombinant furin. The precleaved TGFα-PE38 was then added to cells as indicated inpanel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having shown that furin could cleave TGFα-PE38 and that furin-deficient cells were poorly sensitive to this toxin, we next analyzed the role of furin-mediated cleavage in cells known to express furin. To determine if furin-mediated cleavage was rate-limiting, we compared the toxicity of nicked and unnicked TGFα-PE38. When added to HT29 cells for 24 h, no apparent difference in toxicity could be detected (Fig. 4 A). However, in shorter time periods, nicked ligand toxin was more active, suggesting that in vitro cleavage by furin mimics cellular processing and that furin cleavage can be rate-limiting (Fig.4 B). At a concentration of 100 ng/ml, nicked toxin reduced protein synthesis by 90% in 4 h. The same reduction in protein synthesis required an additional 3 h for the unnicked toxin. To determine if other PE-based chimeric toxins were susceptible to cleavage by furin, a single chain antibody-toxin was assessed as a substrate. Specifically, the scFv fragment of the HB21 antibody directed to the human transferrin receptor fused to PE40 (21Batra J.K. FitzGerald D.J. Chaudhary V.K. Pastan I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2200-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was evaluated. At pH 5.5, furin-mediated cleavage generated fragments of 37 and 28 kDa (Fig.5 A). In vitro, HB21scFv-PE40 was cleaved by furin over the same broad pH range as TGFα-PE38 (data not shown), and the size of the fragments was consistent with a single cleavage event at or near the Arg279-Gly280 peptide bond. To determine the relevance of furin cleavage, we compared the toxicity of nicked and unnicked immunotoxin on LoVo cells. Cleavage increased cytotoxic activity by 20-fold with the nicked immunotoxin having an IC50 of 1.2 ng/ml and the unnicked having 25 ng/ml. In short-term kinetic experiments, HB21scFv-PE40, at 10 ng/ml, reduced protein synthesis by 20% after 8 h on LoVo cells (Fig.5 B). When the immunotoxin was pretreated with furin, the protein synthesis rapidly decreased with 90% reduction after 8 h (Fig. 5 B). Furin is expressed widely and has been implicated in the processing of secreted proteins such as prohormones (22Thomas L. Leduc R. Thorne B.A. Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), growth factors (23Komada M. Hatsuzawa K. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Nakayama K. Kitamura N.

These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors and must be proteolytically cleaved to become functionally mature. Similarly,Pseudomonas exotoxin (10Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10817-10821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) require cleavage for maturation. For these toxins, it is necessary to produce enzymatically active fragments that translocate to the cytosol and inhibit protein synthesis. Furin appears to be one of the proteases that can mediate this cleavage (29Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protective antigen of anthrax toxin is also processed by furin (30Klimpel K.R. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). A variety of ligand-toxin or immunotoxin fusion proteins have been made from these toxins. While the importance of specific arginine residues for the cell killing activity of DT-IL2 has been reported (26Williams D.P. Wen Z. Watson R.S. Boyd J. Strom T.B. Murphy J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20673-20677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the proteolytic processing of immunotoxins has not been extensively investigated. Here we report that furin is needed for the cleavage and activation of PE-derived recombinant immunotoxins, and this processing can be rate-limiting for killing cells. To cleave its substrates, furin requires basic residues (often arginines) at P1 and P4 positions. Since PE was cleaved after arginine 279, we investigated the role of this residue in mediating the toxicity of the chimeric toxin, TGFα-PE38. When TGFα-PE38gly279 was added to cells, it exhibited greatly reduced toxicity for all receptor-positive cell lines, indicating an important role for this residue. To investigate this, the wild-type and mutant chimeric toxins were incubated with recombinant furin, and the appearance of cleavage products were monitored by SDS-PAGE. Furin cleaved TGFα-PE38 to produce fragments of 35 and 11 kDa while TGFα-PE38gly279 was not cleaved. Initial cleavage experiments with TGFα-PE38 were performed at pH 5.5 because this was the optimal pH for cleavage of PE. In later experiments, we examined cleavage over a broad pH range. Unlike native PE, TGFα-PE38 could be cleaved from pH 4.5 to 8.5. We speculate that this difference might allow greater production of the translocating fragment because furin is mostly expressed in the TGN (31Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T.

Previously, we found that the conformational change in PE, induced by acidic pH, is reversible, indicating that PE can be cleaved only in endosomes at pH 5.5 (10Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the broad pH range observed for the cleavage of the chimeric toxins suggests that they can be cleaved in any compartment expressing furin. While our initial experiments were performed with the ligand toxin, TGFα-PE38, we also evaluated the cleavage of an antibody-toxin fusion protein. Results with both kinds of immunotoxins were very similar, indicating that the composition of the binding domain did not unduly influence furin-mediated cleavage. Like TGFα-PE38, HB21scFv-PE40 was poorly toxic for LoVo cells and similarly, exhibited an enhanced activity upon in vitro cleavage by furin and the addition of nicked immunotoxin. The use of kinetic cytotoxicity assays confirmed that furin-mediated cleavage by cells can be a rate-limiting step in toxin action. As with PE, the addition of nicked protein provided a 2–3 h headstart compared with unnicked toxin. Because of the length of this step, the effect of precleavage on furin-expressing cells was only noticeable for the first few hours after toxin addition. By 24 h, the cleavage step had become a small fraction of the total intoxication process. The need for furin-mediated cleavage becomes an important consideration for immunotoxin design since cells that fail to express active furin or where furin is not part of the endocytic pathway are likely to be resistant to immunotoxin-mediated cell killing. Recently, we reported that Daudi cells were partially resistant to an anti-CD22 immunotoxin and that this resistance could be overcome by prior nicking of the immunotoxin with furin (34Mansfield E. Chiron M.F. Amlot P. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immunotoxins directed to other receptors on Daudi cells gave no indication of this partial resistance. This may indicate the existence of separate endocytic pathways that intersect to a greater or lesser extent with furin-containing organelles."

We selected a model sequence containing a well characterized site for RNAP II arrest in vitro, the human histone H3.3 gene arrest site. The 13-base pair core of the arrest sequence contains two runs of T in the nontranscribed strand that impose a bend in the DNA. We hypothesized that arrest of RNAP II might be affected by the presence of a CPD, based upon the observation that a CPD located at the center of a dA6·dT6 tract eliminates bending (Wang, C.-I., and Taylor, J.-S. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.88, 9072–9076). We examined the normal H3.3 sequence and a mutant sequence containing a T → G transversion, which reduces bending and efficiency of arrest. We show that a CPD in the transcribed strand at either of two locations in the arrest site is a potent block to transcription. However, a CPD in the nontranscribed strand only transiently pauses RNAP II. The CPD in concert with a mutation in the arrest site can reduce the extent of bending of the DNA and improve readthrough efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential importance of sequence context for the effect of CPDs within transcribed sequences.

These results demonstrate the potential importance of sequence context for the effect of CPDs within transcribed sequences. DNA repair rates along the genome are clearly heterogeneous (2Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1991; 247: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Certain lesions in actively transcribed genes are repaired much faster than in inactive loci. This can be generally ascribed to the preferential repair of the transcribed strand over the nontranscribed strand (3Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Transcription-dependent repair has been shown to occur in mammalian cells (4Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S.

Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) revealed that the sites at which CPDs were poorly repaired were also hot spots for mutations found in skin cancers, demonstrating a direct correlation between slow repair of CPDs and mutation hot spots in skin cancer. A correlation between slow repair rates and occurrence of mutations has also been observed in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene in human fibroblasts treated with benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (14Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2204-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Slow repair of CPDs at particular sites on the transcribed strand (10Kunala S. Brash D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11031-11035Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) may reflect efficient bypass of CPDs by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in specific sequence contexts. A dimer might even be masked in particular sequence contexts such that transcription-coupled repair would not be initiated.The role of the sequence context of a lesion on transcription can be analyzed more closely by using substrates containing site-specific lesions and a transcription assay with purified RNAP II and initiation factors. Using this approach, we have previously shown thatN-2-aminofluorene and N-2-acetylaminofluorene adducts located on the nontranscribed strand enhance arrest by rat liver RNAP II in vitro at a pause site located ∼15 bp downstream from the site of the lesion. Removal of that sequence-specific pause site abolished the adduct-specific arrest, suggesting that the adduct is responsible for the enhanced RNAP II pausing at this site (15Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This finding reveals the general importance of sequence context on polymerase arrest.Some clues to understanding the effect of DNA sequence context on repair rates of transcription blocking lesions are provided by the conditions under which transcriptional arrest occurs. Studies of transcription in vitro using partially purified components and substrates containing specific sequences have resulted in the identification and characterization of RNAP II arrest sites. In some cases, arrest occurs at a bend in the helix axis of template DNA (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Examples include sites within the first intron of the human c-myc gene, the first intron of the human histone H3.3 gene, and an early transcription unit of SV40. Polymerase arrest can also be induced by DNA binding drugs (17Mote J.J. Ghanouni P. Reines D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (18Reines D. Mote J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The human histone H3.3 gene arrest site has been well characterized for RNAP II in vitro (Ref. 19Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11238-11244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and references herein). It includes several runs of thymine in the nontranscribed strand that are required for transcription arrest. Circular permutation experiments have shown DNA to be bent at this sequence (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The core of the arrest site contains the sequence 5′-TTTTTTTCCCTTTTTT-3′ in the nontranscribed strand. Arrest occurs near the end of the first T run. When the entire sequence is present in the opposite orientation it does not cause transcription arrest, indicating a polarity in the recognition of the signal by RNAP II. Point mutations in the T runs that eliminate bending by this sequence are associated with readthrough of the arrest site by RNAP II, suggesting that bending of this sequence is involved in the arrest effect. However, a bend is not sufficient to cause transcription arrest, because the arrest signal is orientation-dependent, whereas the sequences containing the signal cause a bend when inserted in either orientation.Studies on the effect of thymine dimer formation on dAn·dTn tract bending (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) showed that a TT CPD located at the center of a dA6·dT6 tract eliminates bending of the sequence. Destruction of the A tract structure at the site of the dimer could have accounted for this effect, resulting in intact A tracts of reduced length and of reduced bending.Based upon these findings, we have hypothesized that the efficiency of RNA polymerase arrest at the H3.3 arrest site might be affected by the presence of a thymine dimer in the center of the dA7·dT7 tract contained in the H3.3 arrest site. Using an in vitro transcription assay with purified RNAP II and initiation factors and substrates containing specifically located CPDs we have analyzed the effect of a CPD on RNAP II arrest at the H3.3 sequence.DISCUSSIONWe have confirmed that the presence of a CPD in the nontranscribed strand in the H3.3 arrest site allows readthrough by RNAP II (15Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that when a T → G base substitution is introduced in the second T run of that arrest site, we observe almost complete readthrough when the CPD is located in the center of the first T run of the mutant site, and this correlates with removal of bending of the H3.3 sequence by the dimer. When the CPD is located in the beginning of the first T run we observe only partial readthrough that correlates with the persistence of bending in the sequence. A CPD located in either position on the nontemplate strand in the normal H3.3 arrest site did not affect readthrough by RNAP II.The ability of a CPD to allow readthrough of RNAP II at a natural arrest site is similar to the effect of base substitutions on the efficiency of RNAP II arrest at the H3.3 arrest site (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Arrest signals with single or double nucleotide substitutions that interrupt either one or both runs of T residues allowed efficient readthrough by RNAP II, suggesting that both runs of T residues are required for arrest. Restriction fragments containing mutant signals migrated with mobilities closer to those predicted by the DNA sequence length, indicating that the sequences that cause transcription arrest are identical with those that cause the bend in the DNA helix (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Footprinting analysis of the H3.3 arrest site showed that the footprint of RNAP II covers ∼35 nucleotides, with the 3′ end of the transcript about 10 nucleotides upstream of the leading edge of the polymerase (24Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar footprint has been observed in a mutant arrest site containing point mutations on both runs of T residues. However, the RNAP II complex can resume elongation after pausing at the mutant arrest site without the need for accessory elongation factors like SII, and it translocates 14–15 bp downstream, resuming the usual conformation characteristic of an elongation competent complex (25Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A cyclobutane dimer in the first run of T residues and a base substitution in the second run of T residues may have similar effects.Current models for transcriptional arrest propose that at certain template locations RNAP fails to continue nucleotide addition, resulting in a strained configuration, characterized by a decreased distance from the 3′ end of the transcript to the leading edge of the polymerase (24Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 27Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1995; 265: 793-796Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The “sliding clamp” model suggests that when RNAP II approaches pause, arrest, or termination sites it can slide backward along the RNA and DNA chains shifting the RNA·DNA hybrid and the transcription bubble with it, displacing the RNA 3′ end from the active site (29Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This model implicates the RNA·DNA hybrid in maintaining the RNA 3′ terminus engaged with the active site of RNA polymerase (29Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain why at certain template positions where the DNA·DNA hybrid at the leading edge of the transcription bubble is energetically favored over the RNA·DNA hybrid, as in the case of dA·dT base pairing versus dA·rU base pairing, RNAP becomes efficiently arrested at these sequences in the nontemplate strand. Conversely, the presence of a CPD in this sequence context may shift the equilibrium toward the RNA·DNA hybrid rather than the DNA·DNA hybrid (31Kahn M. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 669-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is also in agreement with our previous observation that a CPD is not inherently a block to RNAP II when it is located in the nontranscribed strand (22Donahue B.A. Fuchs R.P.P. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10588-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).A CPD in a dA6·dT6 sequence affects DNA curvature depending upon its location in the A tract. This has been explained by the “junction model” for DNA containing an A tract (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). According to this model, the base planes in A tracts are inclined relative to the helix axis, resulting in a bend at the junction with B DNA. Bends are formed in A tracts when the A tract is longer than 3 bp at which point the unfavorable base stacking configuration is offset by favorable minor groove hydration. Formation of a CPD causes a small deformation of the double helix consisting in unwinding and bending of at least 7 ° relative to B form (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Ciarrocchi G. Pedrini A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Kim S.H. Tomic M.T. Wemmer D.E. Pearlman D. Holbrook S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1791-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The dimerization of the pyrimidines requires rotation of the neighboring pyrimidines from their usual B-form DNA alignment with overlapping of the 5,6 bonds. This affects B-DNA duplex stability and Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interaction, which would interfere with cooperative A tract bending formation by preventing thymines from adopting the appropriate conformation. This results in intact A tracts of reduced length and reduced bending.Bending of the H3.3 arrest site appears to be a structural element required for arrest by RNAP II (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A bend in the DNA could influence the ability of the polymerase to move along the DNA helix, the contacts between RNAP II and the DNA template may be altered, or the conformation of RNAP II may change as it transcribes through this sequence (24Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, bending is not sufficient for arrest, because the arrest site is orientation-dependent, whereas the sequence is bent in both orientations. The bend geometry is likely to be important. Because the polymerase is travelling unidirectionally, the bend geometry of the sequence in one orientation would not be the same as the geometry when the sequence is positioned in the opposite orientation. This correlates with our finding that a site-specific CPD has a similar effect on bending in the normal or in the mutant arrest site, even though we observe improved readthrough efficiency of RNAP II only when the CPD is located in the mutant sequence.Control of the rate and extent of transcription elongation is an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (26Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 34Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase pause and termination signals have been identified (29Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and transcription elongation factors have been isolated (35Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A lesion, such as a CPD, can interfere with normal regulation of transcription through modulation of “natural” pause sites. These effects could lead to transitory destabilization of cellular growth control if the lesion were strategically located in the appropriate gene. Recently, it was shown that CPDs interfere also with binding of cell cycle regulatory proteins, DNA-damage responsive transcription factors (36Tommasi S. Swiderski P.M. Tu Y. Kaplan B.E. Pfeifer G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15693-15703Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and nucleosomes (37Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that interference with DNA-protein interactions by CPDs may be another relevant effect of UV-induced DNA damage on cellular metabolism. DNA repair rates along the genome are clearly heterogeneous (2Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1991; 247: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Certain lesions in actively transcribed genes are repaired much faster than in inactive loci. This can be generally ascribed to the preferential repair of the transcribed strand over the nontranscribed strand (3Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Transcription-dependent repair has been shown to occur in mammalian cells (4Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S.

An additional level of repair heterogeneity is represented by the sequence-specific rates of repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; GHD, gapped heteroduplex; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; GHD, gapped heteroduplex; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; bp, base pair(s).

Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) revealed that the sites at which CPDs were poorly repaired were also hot spots for mutations found in skin cancers, demonstrating a direct correlation between slow repair of CPDs and mutation hot spots in skin cancer. A correlation between slow repair rates and occurrence of mutations has also been observed in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene in human fibroblasts treated with benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (14Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2204-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Slow repair of CPDs at particular sites on the transcribed strand (10Kunala S. Brash D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11031-11035Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) may reflect efficient bypass of CPDs by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in specific sequence contexts. A dimer might even be masked in particular sequence contexts such that transcription-coupled repair would not be initiated. The role of the sequence context of a lesion on transcription can be analyzed more closely by using substrates containing site-specific lesions and a transcription assay with purified RNAP II and initiation factors. Using this approach, we have previously shown thatN-2-aminofluorene and N-2-acetylaminofluorene adducts located on the nontranscribed strand enhance arrest by rat liver RNAP II in vitro at a pause site located ∼15 bp downstream from the site of the lesion. Removal of that sequence-specific pause site abolished the adduct-specific arrest, suggesting that the adduct is responsible for the enhanced RNAP II pausing at this site (15Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This finding reveals the general importance of sequence context on polymerase arrest. Some clues to understanding the effect of DNA sequence context on repair rates of transcription blocking lesions are provided by the conditions under which transcriptional arrest occurs. Studies of transcription in vitro using partially purified components and substrates containing specific sequences have resulted in the identification and characterization of RNAP II arrest sites. In some cases, arrest occurs at a bend in the helix axis of template DNA (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Examples include sites within the first intron of the human c-myc gene, the first intron of the human histone H3.3 gene, and an early transcription unit of SV40. Polymerase arrest can also be induced by DNA binding drugs (17Mote J.J. Ghanouni P. Reines D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (18Reines D. Mote J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The human histone H3.3 gene arrest site has been well characterized for RNAP II in vitro (Ref. 19Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11238-11244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and references herein). It includes several runs of thymine in the nontranscribed strand that are required for transcription arrest. Circular permutation experiments have shown DNA to be bent at this sequence (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The core of the arrest site contains the sequence 5′-TTTTTTTCCCTTTTTT-3′ in the nontranscribed strand. Arrest occurs near the end of the first T run. When the entire sequence is present in the opposite orientation it does not cause transcription arrest, indicating a polarity in the recognition of the signal by RNAP II. Point mutations in the T runs that eliminate bending by this sequence are associated with readthrough of the arrest site by RNAP II, suggesting that bending of this sequence is involved in the arrest effect. However, a bend is not sufficient to cause transcription arrest, because the arrest signal is orientation-dependent, whereas the sequences containing the signal cause a bend when inserted in either orientation. Studies on the effect of thymine dimer formation on dAn·dTn tract bending (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) showed that a TT CPD located at the center of a dA6·dT6 tract eliminates bending of the sequence. Destruction of the A tract structure at the site of the dimer could have accounted for this effect, resulting in intact A tracts of reduced length and of reduced bending. Based upon these findings, we have hypothesized that the efficiency of RNA polymerase arrest at the H3.3 arrest site might be affected by the presence of a thymine dimer in the center of the dA7·dT7 tract contained in the H3.3 arrest site. Using an in vitro transcription assay with purified RNAP II and initiation factors and substrates containing specifically located CPDs we have analyzed the effect of a CPD on RNAP II arrest at the H3.3 sequence. DISCUSSIONWe have confirmed that the presence of a CPD in the nontranscribed strand in the H3.3 arrest site allows readthrough by RNAP II (15Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that when a T → G base substitution is introduced in the second T run of that arrest site, we observe almost complete readthrough when the CPD is located in the center of the first T run of the mutant site, and this correlates with removal of bending of the H3.3 sequence by the dimer. When the CPD is located in the beginning of the first T run we observe only partial readthrough that correlates with the persistence of bending in the sequence. A CPD located in either position on the nontemplate strand in the normal H3.3 arrest site did not affect readthrough by RNAP II.The ability of a CPD to allow readthrough of RNAP II at a natural arrest site is similar to the effect of base substitutions on the efficiency of RNAP II arrest at the H3.3 arrest site (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Arrest signals with single or double nucleotide substitutions that interrupt either one or both runs of T residues allowed efficient readthrough by RNAP II, suggesting that both runs of T residues are required for arrest. Restriction fragments containing mutant signals migrated with mobilities closer to those predicted by the DNA sequence length, indicating that the sequences that cause transcription arrest are identical with those that cause the bend in the DNA helix (16Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Footprinting analysis of the H3.3 arrest site showed that the footprint of RNAP II covers ∼35 nucleotides, with the 3′ end of the transcript about 10 nucleotides upstream of the leading edge of the polymerase (24Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar footprint has been observed in a mutant arrest site containing point mutations on both runs of T residues. However, the RNAP II complex can resume elongation after pausing at the mutant arrest site without the need for accessory elongation factors like SII, and it translocates 14–15 bp downstream, resuming the usual conformation characteristic of an elongation competent complex (25Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A cyclobutane dimer in the first run of T residues and a base substitution in the second run of T residues may have similar effects.Current models for transcriptional arrest propose that at certain template locations RNAP fails to continue nucleotide addition, resulting in a strained configuration, characterized by a decreased distance from the 3′ end of the transcript to the leading edge of the polymerase (24Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 27Nudler E.

Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The “sliding clamp” model suggests that when RNAP II approaches pause, arrest, or termination sites it can slide backward along the RNA and DNA chains shifting the RNA·DNA hybrid and the transcription bubble with it, displacing the RNA 3′ end from the active site (29Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This model implicates the RNA·DNA hybrid in maintaining the RNA 3′ terminus engaged with the active site of RNA polymerase (29Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain why at certain template positions where the DNA·DNA hybrid at the leading edge of the transcription bubble is energetically favored over the RNA·DNA hybrid, as in the case of dA·dT base pairing versus dA·rU base pairing, RNAP becomes efficiently arrested at these sequences in the nontemplate strand. Conversely, the presence of a CPD in this sequence context may shift the equilibrium toward the RNA·DNA hybrid rather than the DNA·DNA hybrid (31Kahn M. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 669-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is also in agreement with our previous observation that a CPD is not inherently a block to RNAP II when it is located in the nontranscribed strand (22Donahue B.A. Fuchs R.P.P. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10588-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).A CPD in a dA6·dT6 sequence affects DNA curvature depending upon its location in the A tract. This has been explained by the “junction model” for DNA containing an A tract (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). According to this model, the base planes in A tracts are inclined relative to the helix axis, resulting in a bend at the junction with B DNA. Bends are formed in A tracts when the A tract is longer than 3 bp at which point the unfavorable base stacking configuration is offset by favorable minor groove hydration. Formation of a CPD causes a small deformation of the double helix consisting in unwinding and bending of at least 7 ° relative to B form (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Ciarrocchi G. Pedrini A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Kim S.H. Tomic M.T. Wemmer D.E. Pearlman D. Holbrook S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1791-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The dimerization of the pyrimidines requires rotation of the neighboring pyrimidines from their usual B-form DNA alignment with overlapping of the 5,6 bonds. This affects B-DNA duplex stability and Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interaction, which would interfere with cooperative A tract bending formation by preventing thymines from adopting the appropriate conformation. This results in intact A tracts of reduced length and reduced bending.Bending of the H3.3 arrest site appears to be a structural element required for arrest by RNAP II (1Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A bend in the DNA could influence the ability of the polymerase to move along the DNA helix, the contacts between RNAP II and the DNA template may be altered, or the conformation of RNAP II may change as it transcribes through this sequence (24Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, bending is not sufficient for arrest, because the arrest site is orientation-dependent, whereas the sequence is bent in both orientations. The bend geometry is likely to be important. Because the polymerase is travelling unidirectionally, the bend geometry of the sequence in one orientation would not be the same as the geometry when the sequence is positioned in the opposite orientation. This correlates with our finding that a site-specific CPD has a similar effect on bending in the normal or in the mutant arrest site, even though we observe improved readthrough efficiency of RNAP II only when the CPD is located in the mutant sequence.Control of the rate and extent of transcription elongation is an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (26Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 34Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase pause and termination signals have been identified (29Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and transcription elongation factors have been isolated (35Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A lesion, such as a CPD, can interfere with normal regulation of transcription through modulation of “natural” pause sites. These effects could lead to transitory destabilization of cellular growth control if the lesion were strategically located in the appropriate gene. Recently, it was shown that CPDs interfere also with binding of cell cycle regulatory proteins, DNA-damage responsive transcription factors (36Tommasi S. Swiderski P.M. Tu Y. Kaplan B.E. Pfeifer G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15693-15703Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and nucleosomes (37Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that interference with DNA-protein interactions by CPDs may be another relevant effect of UV-induced DNA damage on cellular metabolism. We have confirmed that the presence of a CPD in the nontranscribed strand in the H3.3 arrest site allows readthrough by RNAP II (15Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl.

Pairs of cysteine residues were then reintroduced to determine whether their juxtaposition would result in the formation of disulfide cross-links between transmembrane helices.

The Ca2+ ATPase of rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a) is a 110-kDa transmembrane protein, which transports Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasm to the lumen of the membrane system at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. We developed an expression/mutagenesis system for analysis of the functional consequences of site-specific mutagenesis of the Ca2+ATPase (1Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and used it to identify six amino acids, located in transmembrane sequences M4, M5, M6, and M8, which appeared to provide Ca2+ binding ligands (2Clarke D.M.

Extensive mutational analysis of the six Ca2+ binding residues has provided criteria for the assignment of Glu771, Thr799, and Glu908 to Ca2+ binding site I (the more lumenal of the two stacked sites) and Glu309 and Asn796 to Ca2+ binding site II (the more cytoplasmic of the two stacked sites) (6Andersen J.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Helix M5, which runs antiparallel to M4 and M6, has a similar patch of mutation-sensitive residues. M4 and M6 share a sequence motif, (E/D)GLPA(V/T). The motif forms a prominent part of the mutation-sensitive patch, suggesting that it may be an important component of the Ca2+ binding pore. A reverse sequence in the mutation-sensitive patch of M5 shares many characteristics of the M4/M6 motif. In particular, the sequences EGL (M4), EGV (reverse in M5), and DGL (M6) share a negative charge, a Gly linked to an acidic residue and a hydrophobic residue. In contrast, transmembrane helix M8 contained only one mutation-sensitive residue, Glu908, and only vestiges of the motif observed in M4 and M6. These results suggest that Glu908 and, indeed, all of M8 is unlikely to play more than a peripheral role in Ca2+ binding and translocation. A limiting factor in our understanding of the mechanism of Ca2+ transport is our lack of knowledge of the detailed structure of the Ca2+ binding and translocation domain of SERCA1a. A method of site-directed disulfide mapping, in which cysteine residues are inserted in pairs into predicted transmembrane domains, followed by exposure to oxidant, has been used to map interactions between helices of several bacterial chemoreceptors (13Lynch B.A. Koshland Jr., D.

Cross-links between monomers were detected by testing for anomalous migration of monomers in nonreducing SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide;E 1P, ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate;E 2P, ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. More recently, this method has been applied to eukaryotic multispanning membrane proteins such as rhodopsin (16Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14963-14969Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and P-glycoprotein (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the latter studies, the cDNA encoding a single large peptide chain was first divided into two fragments, and site-specific mutagenesis was used to introduce a single cysteine residue into each half. The two altered pieces were co-expressed and subjected to oxidizing conditions. Rejoining of the two expressed halves through disulfide bond formation was detected by SDS-PAGE. Unlike P-glycoprotein and rhodopsin, expressed fragments of SERCA1 have not been shown to associate into an active enzyme complex. However, cleavage at the hypersensitive tryptic site, T1, located at Arg505 in the large cytoplasmic domain between transmembrane helices M4 and M5, divides the protein into two segments of nearly equal length (18Thorley-Lawson D.A. Green N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Stewart P.S. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 985-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions that stabilize the E2 conformation of the enzyme, this reaction is rapid, specific, and complete. Separation of the products by SDS-PAGE provides a convenient method of assay for cross-links formed between helix M4 and downstream helices. We have utilized this technique to explore the juxtaposition of the proposed Ca2+ binding residues in the central tiers of helices M4, M5, M6, and M8, and we have extended the analysis to residues in the upper and lower tiers of the M4 and M6 helices, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The positions of cross-links demonstrate that M4 and M6 are likely to interact as a right-handed coiled-coil in the membrane. Insight into these structural arrangements has allowed us to propose a side-by-side arrangement of the Ca2+ binding sites in the membrane (20MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

Secondary antibodies were from Promega. Nicholson plastic models for helix modeling were from Labquip (Reading, UK). Mutagenesis was carried out according to the method of Kunkel (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Cell culture and transient transfections were performed as described previously (22Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were harvested 40 h after transfection, and microsomes were prepared as described previously (1Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), with minor modifications made to accommodate the cross-linking assay. Briefly, cells were harvested 40 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and swollen at 0 °C for 10 min in hypotonic solution. Aprotinin was added, and the cells were homogenized with 40 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted with an equal volume of solution A (0.5 m sucrose, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 μm CaCl2, and 5 mm freshly dissolved glutathione) and homogenized with an additional 20 strokes. Mitochondria and nuclei were removed from the suspension by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatant was made 0.6 m in KCl, and microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 180,000 ×g for 1 h. The microsomal pellet was suspended in solution B (0.5 × solution A containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). Microsomal protein was quantified (23Bradford M.M. Anal.

Expression of mutant SERCA1a was verified by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody A52 (24Zubrzycka-Gaarn E. MacDonald G. Phillips L. Jorgensen A.O. MacLennan D.H. J. Bioenerg.

Phosphorylation from Pi was performed in a buffer containing 100 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm[32P]KH2PO4, 20% (v/v) Me2SO, and either 100 μm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Approximately 10 μg of microsomes were phosphorylated for 10 min at 22 °C before quenching with 10 volumes of ice-cold 7% trichloroacetic acid. Sample preparation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (2Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 27Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Microsomes were thawed on ice, diluted to 1 mg of microsomal protein/ml, and reduced by the addition of 120volume of 20 mm freshly dissolved glutathione. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, samples were oxidized by the addition of an equal volume of a buffer containing copper phenanthroline as an oxidant and EGTA and vanadate, which are likely to promote the E 2 conformation. The final incubation conditions were 140 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 400 μm sodium vanadate, 25 mm PIPES, pH 7, 150 mm sucrose, 1.75 mm glutathione, 0.3 mm CuSO4, and 0.9 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, trypsin, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, was added to a final ratio of 1:20 (trypsin/microsomal protein). After 4 min at room temperature, an equal volume of 2 × loading buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), containing 25 mm NEM and 245 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in place of reducing agent, was added. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed by a modification of the method of Ross and McIntosh (29Ross D.C. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2042-2049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of SERCA1aΔC microsomes in solution B, diluted to 1 mg of protein/ml, were warmed to 22 °C. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of 125 mmglutaraldehyde, followed by incubation for 3 min at 22 °C. Tryptic digestion was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 mEGTA, followed by 2 μl of trypsin (1 mg/ml), and incubation for 3 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of nonreducing loading buffer. For nonreducing gels, samples were loaded on 8% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and run according to standard protocols (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). For reducing gels, DTT was added to 200 mm, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to loading on 10% acrylamide gels. Prestained standards (Bio-Rad) were used in both cases to visualize bands during the run. Nonstained standards (New England Biolabs) were loaded on nonreducing gels for more accurate determination of molecular weight. In both cases, loading volumes were adjusted so that approximately equal amounts of expressed SERCA1 were present in each lane. A semidry electroblot apparatus was used to transfer proteins to nitrocellulose membranes (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and Ponceau red stain was used to visualize transferred protein. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in a solution of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 0.5% (w/v) powdered milk and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody A25 (N-terminal specific) or A52 (C-terminal specific) (24Zubrzycka-Gaarn E. MacDonald G. Phillips L. Jorgensen A.O. MacLennan D.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TBS containing 0.1% (w/v) powdered milk for an additional 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed twice with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 15 min and incubated in TBS with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were again washed in TBS/Tween, and expressed SERCA1 protein was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce SuperSignal). Bands were detected on Kodak Biomax x-ray film. Quantitation of band intensities was done by analysis of computer-scanned images of the autoradiographs using NIH Image version 1.59 software. The deduced transmembrane sequences of wild type SERCA1a contain six cysteine residues. Mutant Serca1aΔC was constructed by mutating Cys70 to Ser and Cys268, Cys318, Cys774, Cys910, and Cys938 to Ala. The locations of Cys318, Cys774, and Cys910 are indicated in Fig.1. Cys877 and Cys890, predicted to lie in a large lumenal loop and to form a disulfide cross-link (31Thorley-Lawson D.A. Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), could not be mutated because substitution of either of these residues reduced expression dramatically. Attempts at simultaneous removal of cytoplasmic cysteine residues C-terminal to the T1 site also decreased expression, although none of them appear, individually, to be essential to function. 2D. M. Clarke, T. W. Loo, and D. H. MacLennan, unpublished observations. Serca1aΔC, expressed in HEK-293 cells, transported Ca2+with activity equivalent to 44% of wild type (TableI). Apparent Ca2+ affinity, measured as Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake, was increased slightly, from pCa 6.5 in wild type to pCa 6.74 in Serca1aΔC (Table I). Since gross perturbations of the structure of the mutant protein would manifest as either loss of expression or loss of function, these data indicate that the overall structure of the Serca1aΔC mutant was not significantly different from that of the wild type enzyme.Table IProperties of mutants retaining Ca 2+ transport functionAlterationV maxK Ca% of wild typepCa unitsWild type1006.50 ± 0.01Serca1aΔC44 ± 66.74 ± 0.04I298C/I788C10 ± 16.66 ± 0.09A301C/I788C23 ± 76.52 ± 0.06A303C/L792C34 ± 96.04 ± 0.05A303C/V795C49 ± 166.44 ± 0.05L321C/G808C11 ± 26.53 ± 0.04Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ transport activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Maximal uptake activity was normalized to that of the wild type protein expressed in HEK-293 cells.

K Ca, presented in pCa units, is the concentration at which half maximal Ca2+ uptake rates were obtained. Data represent mean ± S.E.;n = 3. Our initial strategy was to introduce cysteine residues, one pair at a time, into different helices in the Ca2+binding domain. Cys was substituted for either Glu309 or Gly310, in combination with a second substitution of Cys for either Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, or Glu908. These residues, identified as probable Ca2+ binding ligands (2Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), were expected to cluster close to each other in the transmembrane domain. In later mutants, a series of residues in M4 and in M6 were replaced with cysteine, on the basis of models that allowed us to predict which residues might lie close to each other. The locations of all of the residues that were changed to Cys in different experiments are shown in Fig. 1. All of the doubly cysteine-substituted mutants were expressed in HEK-293 cells at levels similar to the wild type enzyme, as judged by Western blotting. None of the mutants in which Ca2+ binding ligands were replaced had Ca2+uptake activities above that of untransfected cells, and none of them formed a high energy phosphoenzyme intermediate (E 1P) by phosphorylation from ATP in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). As shown in Fig.2, all of these mutants formed a low energy phosphoenzyme intermediate (E 2P) from Pi in the absence of Ca2+ and, in all but mutants E309C/N796C and G310C/N796C, E 2P formation was insensitive to 100 μm Ca2+. The observation that double mutant E309C/N796C showed no Ca2+ activation of phosphoenzyme formation from ATP but normal Ca2+ inhibition from Pi at neutral pH is consistent with the hypothesis that Glu309 and Asn796 both contribute to Ca2+ binding site II, occupation of which is not required for conversion ofE 2 to E 1 conformations of the ATPase (32Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 101-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of 100 μm Ca2+resulted in partial inhibition of Pi phosphorylation of the double mutant G310C/N796C. This type of inhibition is consistent with an alteration of Ca2+ affinity at Ca2+ binding site I. Thus, an increase in the size of the residue (Gly to Cys) at position 310 appears to perturb site I, but not to disrupt it. Single mutations of Gly310 to Val or Pro had a similar effect (11Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18359-18364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal vesicles containing mutant ATPases were reduced with glutathione, a soluble, membrane-impermeant reducing agent, to prevent the formation of disulfide bonds between endogenous Cys residues located in the cytoplasmic domain. They were then incubated in a buffer containing EGTA and vanadate under conditions known to promote and maintain the E 2 conformation of the enzyme. Cu(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3 was present in this buffer as a membrane-permeant oxidant. After a 10-min incubation, trypsin was added for 4 min before loading buffer containing soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to stop the digestion. In this incubation buffer, trypsin cut predominantly and nearly completely at the T1site (Arg505), as illustrated in Figs.3, 4, 5, 6, demonstrating that the enzyme was in the E 2 conformation. The loading buffer also contained NEM to block free cysteines and prevent spurious cross-linking in denatured SERCA1. Following electrophoresis and blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes, SERCA1 fragments were detected immunologically.Figure 4Separation of disulfide cross-linked products on reducing gels.

The immunoblot in Fig. 3 A was probed with monoclonal antibody A25, specific to the N-terminal fragment, and the immunoblot in Fig. 3 B was probed with antibody A52, specific to the C-terminal fragment. All lanes in Fig. 3, A andB, contained heavy bands at 55 kDa, and double mutants E309C/N796, E309C/D800C, and G310C/D800C contained an additional band corresponding to a mass of 152 kDa. A very weak 152-kDa band was also observed with E309C/I799C. The 152-kDa band was detected with both antibodies and appeared with the same intensity relative to the 55-kDa band in all cases, demonstrating that both N- and C-terminal fragments were present in equal proportions (TableII). Although the anomalous mobility of the 152-kDa band suggested that its mass might approach that of three half molecules, antibody staining data are consistent only with a dimeric complex between the two halves of the molecule.Table IIQuantitation of cross-links by densitometric scanning of Western blotsDouble mutantCross-linkRatio (A25/A52)A25A52% of total densityI298C/I788C<4<4ND2-aND, not determined.A301C/I788C<4<4NDA305C/L792C14.714.21.03A305C/L793C15.115.30.99E309C/N796C<4<4NDE309C/T799C<1<1NDE309C/D800C<4<4NDG310C/D800C4.04.10.96T317C/A804C74.472.41.03T317C/L807C34.029.01.17L321C/G808C45.750.60.90Cross-linking, where evident in Figs. 2 and 4, was quantitated by densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although not shown, the 110-kDa band, present in every lane, accounted for less than 5% of total intensity in all cases.

These observations suggest that Ca2+ binding residues in M4 are juxtaposed with Ca2+ binding residues in M6 and possibly in M5, but not with Ca2+ binding residues in M8 in the E 2 conformation.

To investigate the importance of PHAS-I in the physiology of the intact animal, we disrupted the PHAS-I gene in mice. Tissues and cells derived from the knockout mice contained no detectable PHAS-I protein. A related protein, PHAS-II, and eIF4E were readily detectable in tissues from these animals, but neither appeared to be changed in a compensatory manner. Mice lacking PHAS-I appeared normal at birth. However, male knockout mice weighed approximately 10% less than controls at all ages, whereas female weights were similar to those of controls. Both males and females were fertile. Tissues from adult animals appeared to be normal by routine histological staining techniques, as were routine blood cell counts and chemistries. Fibroblasts derived from PHAS-I-deficient mouse embryos exhibited normal rates of growth and overall protein synthesis, responded normally to serum stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity and cell growth, and rapamycin inhibition of cell growth. Under these experimental conditions, PHAS-I is apparently not required for the normal development and reproductive behavior of female mice, but is required for normal body weight in male mice; the mechanisms responsible for this phenotype remain to be determined.

Phosphorylation of PHAS-I on the appropriate site(s) in response to insulin or growth factors promotes dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex (4Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A.

Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) releasing eIF4E to participate in mRNA translation initiation. eIF4E is the protein that binds to the mRNA-cap, m7GpppN (where N = any nucleotide), which is found at the 5′ end of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs (9Shatkin A.J. Bioessays. 1987; 7: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). eIF4E facilitates initiation of translation, which results in increased protein synthesis, because initiation is usually the rate-limiting phase of translation (10Altmann M. Traschsel H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 429-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sonenberg N. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Messages that contain a high degree of secondary structure in their 5′-untranslated regions are particularly dependent on eIF4E for translation (10Altmann M. Traschsel H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 429-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sonenberg N. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This dependence is probably explained by the role of eIF4E in generating eIF4F, a complex containing eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A. eIF4G, also known as eIF4γ or p220, binds both eIF4A and eIF4E. eIF4A is an ATP-dependent helicase whose activity is markedly enhanced when eIF4A is incorporated into the eIF4F complex. As the concentrations of eIF4E are thought to be lower than those of the other two subunits, the availability of eIF4E is believed to determine the amount of eIF4F (10Altmann M. Traschsel H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 429-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Thus increasing eIF4E increases eIF4F, which melts secondary structure in mRNA through the helicase activity of the 4A subunit. This action facilitates translation initiation by allowing more rapid binding and/or scanning by the 40 S ribosome. When bound to PHAS-I, eIF4E retains its ability to bind to the cap site (4Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 8Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), but its binding to eIF4G is abolished (13Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 14Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PHAS-1 blocks formation of the eIF4F complex and inhibits eIF4E-dependent translation both in vitro andin vivo (4Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Release of eIF4E as a result of PHAS-I phosphorylation appears to be an important mediator of the actions of insulin and growth factors on protein synthesis (1Lawrence Jr., J.C. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lin T.-A. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. Pergamon Press, NY1997: 239-267Google Scholar, 2Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). There is also reason to suspect that by regulating availability of eIF4E, PHAS-I may be involved in the control of cellular proliferation. For example, overexpression of eIF4E has been shown to increase the rate of growth and cause aberrant morphology of HeLa cells (15DeBenedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16DeBenedetti A. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas microinjection of eIF4E into rodent fibroblasts increased rates of proliferation and resulted in a transformed phenotype (17Smith M.R. Jaramillo M. Liu Y.-L. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Kung H.-F. Sonenberg N. New Biol. 1990; 2 (454): 648PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, stable overexpression of eIF4E in 3T3 fibroblasts increased growth and caused malignant transformation of the cells (18Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Recently, the overexpression of PHAS-I in eIF4E-transformed 3T3 cells was found to decrease both the rate of cell growth and the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar (19Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). The present experiments were performed to investigate the importance of PHAS-I in the physiology of the intact animal through targeted disruption of the PHAS-I gene. These knockout mice were used to evaluate the importance of PHAS-I in intact animals, and to investigate the specific effects of PHAS-I removal on rates of cell proliferation and protein synthesis in cultured cells derived from these animals. A phage clone (GC1) containing the mouse PHAS-I gene was cloned from a mouse genomic PCC4 library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by standard techniques using the mouse cDNA (20Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) as a probe. An 8-kbNotI/BcgI fragment of the original 14-kb GC1 clone was subcloned into the NotI and bluntedXhoI site of pPNT (21Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). A 1.5-kb 3′-fragment of GC1 was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into theXbaI/BamHI site of pPNT. pPNT has theNeo gene under the PGK-1 promoter just downstream of theXbaI site and the tk gene under control of the PGK-1 promoter just downstream of the BamHI site. The final targeting vector, pPNT/GC1, has Neo replacing exon 2 (Fig.1). The targeting vector was linearized with HindIII and electroporated into embryonic stem cells (E14TG2a) by standard techniques (22Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Selection of positive embryonic stem cell clones and generation of knockout mice was performed as described (22Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To identify the genotypes of the mice after the initial mating of the chimeric animals, genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies of mice by standard techniques, and 100–500 ng was assayed using the following two independent reactions: reaction A, the Neo gene was detected using a PGK-Neo primer, 5′-Neo(5′-GGGCCAGCTCATTCCTCCCACTC-3′) and a primer from GC1, 3′-GC1 (5′-CGCGGATCCGGTATAGACAGAGGCACA-3′); and reaction B, the PHAS-I gene was detected using exon 2 primers, 5′-EX2 (5′-CTTATTACACCTTCCCCACC-3′) and 3′-EX2 (5′-TTCAGGACCTGGACAGGAC-3′). Reaction A yields a PCR product 2000 nucleotides in size, and reaction B yields a PCR product of 185 nucleotides in size. Male and female offspring of matings of PHAS-I +/−mice were evaluated by observation and by measurements of body weight at intervals of 2 weeks after birth. Adult mice were euthanized with CO2, and blood taken from cardiac puncture was evaluated for glucose and triglyceride levels as well as complete blood counts and differential counts. Gross examination of all organs was conducted at autopsy of paired littermate mice of the same sex (+/+ versus −/−), and the carcasses and internal organs were fixed in paraformaldehyde and used for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Where indicated, abdominal fat and lactating mammary glands were removed from lactating−/−mice at 10–12 days postpartum, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for the preparation of protein and total RNA as described (22Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Protein and RNA samples were prepared by similar techniques from primary embryonic fibroblasts (see below). PHAS-I (20Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol.

For specific identification of PHAS-I sequences in putative fusion mRNA species, additional probes were used. The 793-bp parent mouse PHAS-I cDNA (20Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was cut withEcoRI and SmaI (cut at bp 1 and 140, respectively) to yield a 140-bp probe (5′) that was entirely 5′ of the exon 2 sequences (bp 191–376) removed in the construction of the knockout vector. The parent mouse cDNA was also cut withStuI and EcoRI (cut at bp 479 and 793, respectively) to release a 314-bp probe (3′) that represented the 3′ portion of the cDNA and did not contain any of the deleted exon 2 sequences. MEF were prepared from fetal mice at day 15.5 of gestation (E15.5), where E0.5 was the date of detection of the vaginal plug. MEF were prepared from individual fetuses from each litter as described (24Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) with the genotype being determined by evaluation of tail DNA from each fetal mouse. For evaluation of serum-stimulated cell growth, 10 cell cultures of MEF from −/− animals were compared with 10 lines of cells from both +/− and +/+ animals at passage 4. Each culture was derived from a separate fetal mouse. Cells (105 per 35-mm diameter dish) were seeded into 2 ml of growth medium (10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). After 96 h, cells were removed by trypsinization and counted. Statistical significance of differences was assessed using Student's t test. To determine rates of overall protein synthesis, 10 cell lines from each of the three genotypes were used at passage 4. Cells (2 × 105 per 35-mm dishes) were cultured in growth medium for about 50 h or until about 90% confluent. The cells were then serum-deprived by incubation in cysteine- and methionine-deficient medium as described (27Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After 16 h, cells were incubated with either 10% fetal calf serum or an equivalent amount of medium without calf serum for 3 h. A mixture (50 μCi) of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix, NEN Life Science Products) was then added to each plate. After 1 h, the cells were rinsed, and the amount of trichloracetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined as described (27Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Six lines of PHAS-I +/+ cells and six lines of −/− cells were used at passage 4. Cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes at approximately 5 × 104 cells per dish and then cultured to approximately 80% confluence in growth medium. The cells were serum-deprived for 16 h, stimulated for 3 h with 10% FCS or serum-free medium, and followed by washing, harvesting, and assay of ODC activity and protein determinations (28Hovis J.G. Stumpo D.J. Halsey D.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10380-10386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interbreeding of male and female mice that were +/− for the PHAS-I gene resulted in litters of normal size with the expected Mendelian frequency of genotypes. Of 218 total offspring tested, 56 (26%) were +/+, 113 (52%) were +/−, and 49 (22%) were −/−, indicating that there was no significant intrauterine mortality. Both male and female PHAS-I-deficient mice appeared normal at birth. However, the male −/− mice weighed on average 10% less than their +/+ and +/− littermates at all time points after 2 weeks; the differences between the mean weights of the −/− mice and the combined +/+ and +/− littermates were statistically significant at all time points after two weeks (Fig.2 A). Similar differences were observed when the −/− mice were compared with only the +/+ mice (data not shown). In contrast, the female −/− mice weighed on average only 3% less than their control littermates until week 8, after which the −/− mice were used for breeding; the mean weights were not significantly different at any time point (Fig. 2 B). Both male and female (−/−) mice displayed normal fertility and interbreeding has resulted in litters of normal size (mean ± S.D. = 5.6 ± 2.6; n = 18 litters). Blood glucose, triglyceride concentrations, complete blood counts, and white cell differential counts were indistinguishable between the +/+ and −/− animals (not shown). The −/− mice of both sexes appeared to be normal at autopsy; in addition, routine staining of paraffin-embedded sections of all organs and tissues revealed no apparent abnormalities at the level of hematoxylin and eosin staining and light microscopy (not shown). Particular attention was paid to tissues expressing the greatest amount of PHAS-I, especially white and brown adipose tissue, liver, and lactating mammary gland; these all appeared normal. To confirm that the PHAS-I gene had been disrupted in the putative −/− mice, mRNA and protein levels were measured in white adipose tissue, lactating mammary gland, and in cultured primary MEF derived from the wild-type mice and their knockout littermates (Figs. 3 and4). In the fibroblasts, the wild-type mRNA of approximately 0.9 kb seen in the cells from the +/+ mice decreased in amount in the +/− cells, and was accompanied by the formation of two novel species of approximately 1.5 and 0.7 kb. Experiments in which the same mRNAs were probed with 5′, 3′ andNeo cDNA probes demonstrated that the 1.5-kb band represented a fusion mRNA species that contained the Neosequences and was missing the 185 bp of deleted PHAS-I sequence, whereas the 0.7-kb band represented an mRNA species containing 5′ and 3′ but not intervening PHAS-I sequences (data not shown). In the −/− cells, the wild-type mRNA had disappeared completely, whereas the 1.5- and 0.7-kb mRNA species represented the entire hybridizing signal (Fig. 3 A).Figure 4Levels of PHAS-I, PHAS-II, and eIF4E in PHAS-I knockout mouse tissues. A, 8.5 μg of heat-stable protein per lane from adipose tissue (F) and mammary gland (M) was subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting with a PHAS-I antibody. The genotypes of the littermate mice from which the tissues were derived are shown at the bottom of the gel.I refers to purified PHAS-I used as a positive control;II refers to PHAS-II used to show cross-reactivity of the antibody. A faint band of approximately M r17,000 probably represents endogenous PHAS-II. B, the same samples were probed with an antibody to PHAS-II; molecular weight standards and other symbols are the same as in A.C, crude tissue homogenates (890 μg/lane) were probed with an antibody to eIF4E; D, a parallel blot to C was probed with nonimmune serum (NIS). See the text for further details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The complete absence of PHAS-I protein was demonstrated in parallel Western blots conducted on extracts from the same cells (Fig.3 B). The two immunoreactive bands representing theM r 22,000 and 20,000 forms of PHAS-I had decreased in amount by about 50% in the +/− MEF and had completely disappeared from the −/− cells. No evidence of a truncated protein was present in these blots; in addition, the design of the knockout construct ensured that the eIF4E binding site in PHAS-I (20Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was eliminated. In blots of the same cell extracts, PHAS-II protein was not detected using a separate specific antibody (23Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) even after long exposure of the autoradiographs (not shown). Similar results were obtained in tissue samples from +/+ and −/− female littermates that were lactating at 10–12 days postpartum (Fig.4 A). The normal doublet of PHAS-I protein could be readily detected in lactating mammary gland and white adipose tissue from the +/+ mouse but not in the analogous tissues from the −/− mouse (Fig.4 A). PHAS-II could be detected readily in Western blots of the same tissues both as a minor band in the blots exposed to the anti-PHAS-I antibody (Fig. 4 A) and using a specific antibody to PHAS-II (Fig. 4 B). However, there was no compensatory increase in PHAS-II protein expression in these tissues in the PHAS-I knockout mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Tissue homogenates from the same tissues were used to assess the amounts of eIF4E using a specific antibody (20Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). There were no differences in the amount of this protein per unit of homogenate protein when extracts of mammary gland and adipose tissue were compared between the +/+ and −/− mice (Fig. 4 C). A blot processed in parallel using nonimmune serum was completely blank under the same conditions (Fig.4 D). We also tested a wide variety of tissues from male PHAS-I knockout mice by Western blotting for PHAS-I and PHAS-II. In all cases, PHAS-I was absent, and there was no evidence of a compensatory increase in levels of PHAS-II in any of these tissues (not shown). Because the phosphorylation and activity of PHAS-I are inhibited by treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with rapamycin (20Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the growth of primary MEF based on previously described assays in cultured mouse fibroblasts (25Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Rapamycin (20 ng/ml) markedly inhibited the growth of both +/+ and −/− primary cultured MEF at each time point tested (Fig.5) when the experiments were performed on cells at passages 4–8. Thus, there appeared to be no difference between fibroblasts of the +/+ and −/− genotypes in their growth inhibitory response to rapamycin. The effects of rapamycin to inhibit cell growth were also tested in a splenocyte culture assay (26Warner L.M. Adams L.M. Sehgal S.N Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37 (287): 289Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Concentrations up to 100 nmdid not affect splenocyte proliferation in cells of either genotype, but higher concentrations (1 and 10 μm) inhibited proliferation in parallel in the cells from the +/+ and −/− mice (data not shown). We also compared cell growth rates in response to 10% FCS in large numbers of passage 4 primary cultured embryonic fibroblasts of the +/+, +/−, and −/− genotypes analyzed at 72 h after plating. Serum was used because of its known ability to promote phosphorylation of PHAS-I in a manner similar to that of insulin (7Blackshear P.J. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. Biochem J. 1983; 214: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and because of the paucity of insulin receptors on primary mouse fibroblasts. There were no differences in cell numbers under these conditions (mean ± S.D. of cells × 104 per 35-mm dish analyzed in triplicate): +/+, 31 ± 14 (n = 10); +/−, 26 ± 7 (n = 10); −/−, 39 ± 12 (n= 10). The means from the +/+ and −/− cells were not significantly different from each other using Student's t test. The rate of overall protein synthesis was measured in these same fibroblasts at the same passage in either the serum-deprived state or after 4 h of stimulation with 10% FCS using pulse labeling with [35S]methionine for the last 60 min of the stimulation. In both the serum-deprived state and serum-stimulated state, we could determine no effect of PHAS-I genotype on overall protein synthesis rates. For the serum-deprived cells, the protein synthesis rates were as follows (expressed as trichloroacetic acid precipitable cpm per mg of protein, assayed in triplicate wells from each of 10 primary cultures per genotype at passage 4 (mean ± S.D.)): +/+, 13.9 ± 2.9; +/−, 17.4 ± 6.9; −/−, 11.3 ± 2.8. For the serum-stimulated cells, the results were: +/+, 10.1 ± 2.1; +/−, 10.4 ± 2.7; −/−, 9.1 ± 1.7. The differences between the +/+ and −/− means were not statistically significant in either group. Finally, we analyzed the induction of ODC 3 h after stimulation of serum-deprived MEF with 10% FCS. The ODC mRNA contains a long 5′-untranslated region with considerable secondary structure, and its mitogen-stimulated translation has been used as a model of eIF4E activity (29Manzella J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11817-11822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Manzella J.M. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Hershey J.W.B. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

The 3 h time point was chosen because, in previous experiments in NIH-3T3 cells, near-peak induction of enzyme activity occurred at this time in response to FCS (28Hovis J.G. Stumpo D.J. Halsey D.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10380-10386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, 10% FCS induced ODC approximately 3–4-fold over control, but there were no reproducible statistically significant differences between the basal enzyme activities or the magnitude of this induction in cells from the +/+ and −/− genotypes (not shown). The PHAS-I protein has been implicated as a mediator of mitogen-stimulated protein synthesis in its role as a phosphorylation-regulated eIF4E-binding protein (1Lawrence Jr., J.C. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lin T.-A. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. Pergamon Press, NY1997: 239-267Google Scholar, 2Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). PHAS-I is expressed in many cells and tissues with the highest levels in white and brown adipose tissue (23Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PHAS-II or eIF4E-binding protein 2 is also expressed in many of the same cells and tissues that express PHAS-I, and PHAS-II appears to be a functional homologue of PHAS-I (3Hu C. Pang S. Kong X.

Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), it would be expected to continue this function in cells and tissues from PHAS-I knockout animals. Moreover, searches of expressed sequence tag data bases indicate that additional members of the PHAS family are expressed in cells. Because of the possible functional redundancy conferred by these PHAS family members, it was impossible to predict the phenotype of the PHAS-I knockout mouse. However, we hoped that the phenotype would shed some light on the physiological importance of this protein in the intact animal. To date, the only consistent phenotype that we have observed in the PHAS-I knockout mice was that the male −/− mice weighed on average 10% less than their control littermates at all ages between 4 and 24 weeks. These differences were statistically significant at all time points between 4 and 24 weeks and remained significant when the mean weights of the −/− males were compared with those of the +/+ littermates only. The weights of the female −/− mice were not significantly lower than those of their control littermates. Otherwise, the PHAS-I-deficient mice were phenotypically normal with normal external appearance, reproductive behavior, and tissue histology. These animals have been back-crossed to the C57BL6/J strain for only a single generation at present, and it is possible that the small amount of remaining 129 strain genome is diluting out a more dramatic phenotype that will become obvious after the 8 or 9 back-crosses generally required to remove the last remnants of the 129 genome. However, we suspect that even then such a phenotype is unlikely to be severe under the normal living conditions of laboratory mice. Instead, it seems likely that PHAS-I is not necessary for a relatively normal life in the mouse, perhaps because of the expression of functional homologues of PHAS-I. Such presumed compensation by functional homologues has been seen in other single knockouts of genes belonging to multigene families (32Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Several types of future studies can be used to address these possibilities. For example, 8 or 9 back-crosses into the C57BL6/J strain will be used in an attempt to remove the remaining 129 genome, a procedure that may make the low-weight phenotype more severe and/or extend it into females. In addition, crossing into other strains may magnify or alter this phenotype. If a more severe phenotype can be produced by these methods, then the mechanism of the decreased body weight can be investigated more thoroughly. For example, carcass analysis showing normal lean body mass but deficient adipose tissue stores would lead to an evaluation of triglyceride synthesis and breakdown rates in adipose tissue from the −/− mice, the tissue in which PHAS-I is most highly expressed (23Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Given the likely compensatory behavior of other members of the PHAS family, double or triple knockouts are likely to be more severely affected, as has been shown to be the case when multiple members of other gene families have been knocked out (32Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The facts that fibroblasts derived from PHAS-I deficient mice exhibited normal rates of serum-stimulated growth and overall protein synthesis were somewhat unexpected, since recent studies have shown that overexpression of PHAS-I results in slower rates of cell growth in 3T3 cells (19Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). These data have led Sonenberg and colleagues (19Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar) to propose that PHAS-I and -II might behave as tumor suppressors, by virtue of their capacity to inhibit mitogen-stimulated protein synthesis. Future studies will be necessary to fully characterize the tumorigenic capacity of the fibroblasts derived from the PHAS-I knockout mice; it will also be of interest to follow these mice as they age, since this hypothesis would suggest that they may have a predilection for tumor development. Our oldest PHAS-I knockout mice are 13 months of age at the time of this writing, and no evidence of a tendency to excess tumor growth has been noted. This may be an instance in which the response to pathological rather than physiological stimuli may need to be evaluated, such as the response to transplanted tumors, expressed oncogenes, or transforming viruses. We are very grateful to Betsy Kennington, Jane Tuttle, and Suhong Pang for expert technical assistance, to Dr. Beverly Koller and her colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for generating the chimeric mice, and to Dr. Daniel Schenkman for help with the evaluation of the mouse histopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2002980613,"The regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ is important for a variety of cell functions. One non-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) compound that may regulate Ca2+ is palmitoyl-coenzyme A (CoA), a fatty acid-CoA that is reported to cause Ca2+ release from intracellular stores of oocytes, myocytes, and hepatocytes. To study the role of palmitoyl-CoA in the pancreatic acinar cell, rat pancreatic acini were isolated by collagenase digestion, permeablized with streptolysin O, and the release of Ca2+ from internal stores was measured with fura-2. Palmitoyl-CoA released Ca2+ from internal stores (EC50 = 14 microM). The palmitoyl-CoA-sensitive pool was distinct from, and overlapping with the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool. The effects of submaximal doses of IP3 or cyclic ADP-ribose plus palmitoyl-CoA were additive. Fatty acid-CoA derivatives with carbon chain lengths of 16-18 were the most potent and efficacious. Ryanodine and caffeine or elevated resting [Ca2+] sensitized the Ca2+ pool to the actions of palmitoyl-CoA. Fatty acid-CoA levels in pancreatic acini were measured by extraction with 2-propanol/acetonitrile, followed by separation and quantification using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and were found to be 10.17 +/- 0.93 nmol/mg protein. These data suggest the presence of an IP3-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA-sensitive Ca2+ store in pancreatic acinar cells and suggest that palmitoyl-CoA may be needed for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W2008832557,"The PU.1 transcription factor is a member of the Ets family of DNA binding proteins. PU.1 binds to DNA via a loop-helix-loop domain and functions in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The structure of a PU.1-DNA complex was recently reported (Kodandapani, R., Pio, F., Ni, C.-Z., Piccialli, G., Klemsz, M., McKercher, S., Maki, R., and Ely, K. (1996) Nature 380, 456–460). The DNA in this complex is deformed by 8° as it curves around the protein. The pattern of electrostatic contacts between PU.1, and its DNA binding site suggests that laterally asymmetric phosphate neutralization accompanies PU.1 binding. Because of our previous studies showing that such neutralization can induce bending in naked DNA, we have explored the effect of phosphate neutralization by substituting neutral methylphosphonate internucleoside linkages at relevant positions within DNA containing the PU.1 binding sequence. Consistent with the prediction that DNA will collapse toward its partially neutralized surface, DNA neutralized at seven positions to simulate PU.1 binding is observed to bend by 28°. The directions of DNA curvature are slightly different in the co-crystalversus the partially neutralized duplexes.

DNA bending proteins presumably combine several kinds of forces to deform the trajectory of the double helix. Neutralization of the phosphate backbone of duplex DNA by cationic amino acids has been suggested as a plausible driving force in the bending of DNA by some proteins. According to this view, if phosphate neutralization is confined to one face of the double helix, an unbalanced charge distribution is induced along the DNA. The double helix is then envisioned to collapse toward the neutralized surface in response to asymmetric electrostatic repulsions. Theoretical calculations (1Manning G. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D.

For example, we have previously shown that asymmetric incorporation of six racemic methylphosphonate linkages into a 21-bp 1The abbreviation used is: bp, base pair(s). DNA duplex creates a neutralized region on one face of duplex DNA that induces ∼20° of bending toward the neutralized surface (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J.

Crystallographic and gel electrophoresis studies of DNA bending proteins also suggest that neutralization of phosphate charge is a possible source of DNA bending energy in many cases.

The present study focuses on the role of electrostatics in DNA bending that accompanies the binding of PU.1. The PU.1 protein is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors that regulate gene expression and share a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain that recognizes the core sequence 5′-(C/A)GGA(A/T)-3′ in duplex DNA. The ETS domain binds as a monomer, making extensive contacts over 30 Å of DNA (10Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.-Z. Piccialli G. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The PU.1 protein contacts DNA in three ways: the recognition helix of the protein (α3) interacts with the 5′-GGAA core sequence in the major groove, while contacts with the phosphate backbone from the minor groove occur on either side of the core sequence via two protein loops (10Kodandapani R.

Thus, the PU.1 ETS domain binds DNA by a loop-helix-loop motif. DNA in the PU.1 complex is uniformly curved by ∼8° toward the major groove without distinct kinks (10Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.-Z. Piccialli G. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In the present study, we wished to determine if asymmetric phosphate neutralization could provide a significant source of DNA bending energy for PU.1. A recent analysis has noted seven specific sites of phosphate neutralization in the PU.1-DNA complex (9Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.-Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23329-23337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have simulated the electrostatic consequence of PU.1 binding by substituting racemic methylphosphonate linkages at these positions in synthetic DNA duplexes. These sites of phosphate neutralization are highlighted in a molecular model of the PU.1 ETS domain binding to duplex DNA (see Fig.1) (9Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.-Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M.

Our electrophoretic studies of partially neutralized DNA duplexes suggest that electrostatic interactions between PU.1 and its target site are more than sufficient to explain the DNA bending observed in this duplex. Unmodified oligonucleotides were prepared using an ABI model 394 DNA synthesizer according to standard procedures. Oligonucleotides were cleaved and deprotected in hot ammonia. Oligonucleotides containing site-specific racemic methylphosphonate substitutions were synthesized at 1-μmol scale using methylphosphonamidite monomers obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Isobutyryl derivatives of cytosine were used to facilitate cleavage from the solid support and deprotection as described previously (11Hogrefe R.I. Vaghefi M.M. Reynolds M.A. Young K.M. Arnold L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All oligomers were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, and desalted using C18 reverse phase cartridges. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined at 260 nm using molar extinction coefficients (m−1 cm−1) of 15,400 (A), 11,700 (G), 7,300 (C), 8,800 (T) assuming no hypochromicity. Compositions of oligonucleotides containing methylphosphonate substitutions were verified by mass spectrometry. Analysis of DNA shape was performed by comparative gel electrophoresis of ligated DNA duplexes as described previously (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Crothers D.M. Drak J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 46-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Relative curvature values and estimates of electrostatic bend angles were determined as in previous studies (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Crothers D.M. Drak J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 46-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Koo H.-S. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, the distance migrated by duplex DNA standards of known length was measured and fit by a least-squares method to an exponential function. The apparent length of DNA in each gel band was then estimated using the derived function and the distance migrated. An equation of the formRL−1=(pL2−q)(relative curvature)2Equation 1 was fit by a least-squares method to data for duplexes containing one A6 tract per 21 bp (relative curvature = 0.5 A5–6 tract equivalents per helical turn) and no neutral phosphates. Estimates for the value of the constants,p and q, were determined for each gel (13Koo H.-S. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The resulting equation was then used to obtain estimates for unknown relative curvature values for duplexes containing an A5tract and either an unmodified or partially neutralized PU.1 binding site. Estimates for the magnitude of the unknown bend, b, were calculated by obtaining the least-squares fit of the data to the phasing equationc=[a2+b2−2ab cos(180−θ)]0.5Equation 2 using plots of the net curvature versus radial angle, θ. Constant a is the magnitude of the curvature due to the A5–6 tract (0.5 A5–6 tract equivalents per helical turn). Dependent variable c is the measured value of the net curvature (same units), and b is the unknown magnitude of the electrostatic bend (same units). Estimates of the electrostatic bend in degrees were obtained using a value of 18° for the deflection of the DNA helix axis by a single A5–6tract (12Crothers D.M. Drak J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 46-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Comparative gel electrophoresis is performed by the chemical synthesis and unidirectional enzymatic ligation of short DNA duplexes, each representing an integral number of helical turns of the DNA to be analyzed. In each short duplex, an uncharacterized site of helix deformation (e.g. a locus of curvature intrinsic to the DNA sequence or a bend induced by electrostatic effects) is placed a specified distance from an internal reference locus of curvature (an A5–6 tract) whose magnitude and direction of helix deformation are known (12Crothers D.M. Drak J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 46-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The phasing between the uncharacterized and internal reference bends is then changed in subsequent experiments. The overall curvature of each DNA duplex is amplified in the resulting ligated polymers. Net curvature for each phasing is sensitively measured by its effects on the mobility of DNA fragments through native polyacrylamide gels (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,12Crothers D.M. Drak J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 46-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For DNA molecules of identical mass and charge, curvature results in decreased electrophoretic mobility. Molecules wherein the reference deformation is enhanced by proper phasing with an electrostatic bend exhibit reduced electrophoretic mobility relative to other phasings. Phasing analysis is a useful approach because both the direction and magnitude of induced DNA bending can be estimated. The size of the PU.1 DNA binding site and the corresponding pattern of phosphate neutralizations (Fig.1) were important considerations in the design of synthetic DNA duplexes for phasing experiments. To permit inclusion of the PU.1 binding site at various phasings with the reference A5 tract, it was necessary to synthesize DNA duplexes comprising three turns of the double helix. Phasing analysis then required measurement of the helical repeat parameter (number of bp per helical turn of DNA) for each group of test sequences. To measure the helical repeat of unmodified DNAs containing the PU.1 binding site, we monitored gel mobility as a function of duplex length for duplexes having the A5 tract and PU.1 binding site on the same face (cis configuration). Duplex length was varied from 30 to 33 bp. Synthetic duplexes 1–3 were synthesized for this purpose (Fig. 2 A). The helical repeat was determined by finding the duplex length that gave rise to the greatest electrophoretic anomaly, corresponding to the arrangement wherein elements of curvature are phased most exactly with each other. Analysis of the dependence of gel mobility anomaly (R L ) on duplex length shows that the helical repeat of unmodified duplexes containing the PU.1 site is 10.5 ± 0.01 bp per helical turn, near the canonical value for B-DNA (Fig.3). The helical repeat of duplexes4–6 (Fig. 2 A) containing seven methylphosphonate linkages was estimated to be 10.4 ± 0.02 using a similar procedure. Subsequent experiments to study the behavior of three helical turns of DNA therefore employed 31-bp duplexes.Figure 3Experimental measurement of helical repeat. Helical repeat was estimated as the x axis value at the maximum of a parabolic function fit to the data. Electrophoretic measurements for unmodified (▪, solid line) and neutralized (•, dotted line) synthetic duplexes from Fig. 2 A are shown. Data correspond to averageR L values (from at least three experiments). Standard deviations of R L estimates were less than 0.02.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We designed three unmodified DNA duplexes containing the PU.1 binding site (Fig. 2). Duplex 2 contains the cis phasing arrangement (the center of curvature due to the reference A5 tract lies on approximately the same helical face as the center of the unmodified PU.1 site). Duplex 7 contains the orthogonal phasing arrangement (centers of curvature of these elements are positioned ∼235° away from each other), and duplex 8contains the trans phasing arrangement (centers of curvature are separated by ∼166°). Duplex 11 is an unmodified 21-bp standard that contains a single A6 tract (relative curvature equal to 0.5 A5–6 tract equivalents per helical turn). The curvature of the A6 tract in duplex11 is taken to be 18° toward the minor groove in a reference frame 0.5 bp 3′ of the center of the A6 tract (12Crothers D.M. Drak J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 46-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We collected electrophoretic data to assay intrinsic DNA curvature in the unmodified duplexes containing the PU.1 binding site (Fig.4; lanes 9–15). The mobilities of the respective 7-mer ligation products (217-bp actual length) are indicated by dots beside lanes 9, 12, and 14 of Fig. 4. As expected, the overall DNA shape was observed to depend only slightly on helical phasing. The ratio of apparent length to actual length (R L ) is plottedversus the actual length of the duplexes in Fig.5 A. The presence of phased elements of static curvature causes increasingly positive deviations from R L = 1.0 for increasing molecular lengths. The data in Fig. 5 A reinforce the conclusion that mobility differences between the three phasing arrangements of the unmodified PU.1 site with the A5 tract are small.Figure 5Quantitation of DNA bending.

Resulting estimates for relative curvature (A5–6 tract equivalents per helical turn) were determined for duplexes2, 7, and 8 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data from all three phasing arrangements were then combined to generate quantitative estimates for any intrinsic DNA curvature (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Relative curvature estimates are plotted as a function of the radial angle between the center of the A5tract and the center of the unmodified PU.1 site where the radial angle was chosen to give the best fit to the phasing data (Fig.6). Data fitting to the phasing equation indicates that the magnitude of the bend angle due to the unmodified PU.1 site is ∼6° toward the major groove in a reference frame ∼90° clockwise from the direction of bending observed in the PU.1-DNA complex (Table I).Table IDNA bending at the PU.1 binding siteDNA duplexCurvature toward major groove1-aBased on best fits to phasing equations.

Neutralization was accomplished by incorporating methylphosphonate linkages on one face of the double helix at seven positions consistent with salt bridges observed in the crystal structure of the PU.1-DNA complex (9Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.-Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. J. Biol.

Duplex 5 contains the cis phasing arrangement (the center of curvature due to the reference A5 tract lies on approximately the same helical face as the center of the patch of methylphosphonate linkages). Duplex 9contains the orthogonal phasing arrangement (these elements are positioned ∼235° away from each other), and duplex 10contains the trans phasing arrangement (elements are separated by ∼166°). Electrophoretic data were obtained to characterize induced bending due to the patch of methylphosphonate linkages (Fig. 4, lanes 2–7). The differences in migration of the 7-mer ligated species in cis, orthogonal, and trans arrangements is evident from Fig. 4(compare lanes 2, 4, and 7). These differences are more pronounced than had been observed in the unmodified cases (Fig. 4, lanes 9, 12, and14). The cis arrangement of the A5 tract and neutralized patch results in the slowest rate of migration (Fig. 4,lane 2), suggesting that the curvature due to the patch of methylphosphonate linkages tends to enhance the A5 tract curvature when the elements are on the same DNA face. The ratio of apparent length to actual length (R L ) is plottedversus the actual length of the duplexes in Fig.5 C. Overall, the data confirm that the patch of methylphosphonate linkages induces bending, enhancing the A5 tract bend. Interestingly, the lowest overall bending (greatest mobility) was observed for the orthogonal phasing. This observation indicates that the direction of bending induced by the neutral surface is toward the major groove but somewhat displaced relative to the reference frame defined by the center of the neutralized face. Data from Fig. 5 C were transformed to allow determination of relative curvature values for the modified duplexes. Data from all three phasing arrangements were then combined to generate quantitative estimates for induced DNA bending (Fig. 6). Data fitting to the phasing equation indicates that the magnitude of the bend angle due to the patch of methylphosphonate linkages is ∼28° toward the major groove in a reference frame 50°-60° clockwise from the center of the neutralized surface (Table I; see below). Optimized curve fits for the data in Fig. 6 indicate that the radial angle between the A5 tract and the direction of intrinsic curvature in the unmodified PU.1 duplexes is different from the radial angle separating the A5 tract from the direction of curvature induced by methylphosphonate substitution. These relationships are depicted schematically in Fig.7. In all cases of intrinsic or induced bending studied here, the PU.1 binding site is observed to bend toward the major groove (i.e. the major groove narrows and the minor groove widens). However, the reference frame in which the major groove is viewed is slightly different in each case, as depicted by the numbered sequence positions in Fig. 7 A and by the numbered vectors in Fig. 7 B. Thus, the directions of intrinsic, electrostatic, or protein-induced bending are all generally toward the neutralized DNA surface facing the PU.1 protein, but the precise bend directions appear to occur over a ∼90° range (Fig.7 B). Our data suggest several important conclusions regarding the role of electrostatic effects in DNA bending by the PU.1 protein. First, it is interesting to note that the sites of apparent salt bridges between PU.1 and phosphates in the DNA recognition sequence lie on one helical face of the DNA (magenta spheres in Fig. 1;open circles centered at vector 3 in Fig.7 B). However, the apparent direction of DNA bending induced by the protein is 30–40° clockwise from the center of the neutralized surface (Fig. 1; compare vectors 3 and4 in Fig. 7 B). The obvious implication is that electrostatic effects help determine the general direction of DNA deflection in the PU.1-DNA complex, but that other protein-induced forces modify this bend direction. A second notable feature of our data is the observation that a modest intrinsic curvature (∼6°) may be present in the unmodified PU.1 binding site, causing bending toward the major groove in a reference frame ∼90° clockwise from the direction of bending observed in the PU.1-DNA complex (Fig. 7 B, compare vectors 1 and4). An intrinsic DNA feature of this type, although subtle, could contribute to the kinetic process of binding site selection by PU.1. Our phasing data (Fig. 6) strongly suggest that the direction of DNA bending induced by partial neutralization of the PU.1 binding site is not precisely centered on the neutralized surface. This can be seen by comparing vector 3 (normal to the neutralized surface) and vector 2 (the apparent direction of the electrostatic bend) in Fig.7 B. One interpretation of this result is that details of the PU.1 DNA sequence (e.g. sequence-dependent propensities of various base pairs to roll toward the major grooveversus the minor groove) influence the exact point of DNA flexure relative to the neutralized surface. Of further note is the comparison between the apparent bend direction induced by partial charge neutralization in naked DNA and the bend direction observed in the crystal structure (compare vectors 2 and 4 in Fig. 7 B). The direction of the bend induced by neutralization is ∼ 23° clockwise from the apparent bend in the PU.1-DNA crystal structure. The interesting implication of this result is that electrostatic effects may determine the general DNA bend direction, but that other forces at the PU.1-DNA interface further mold this bend resulting in its final configuration. In quantitative terms, the extent of DNA bending induced by neutralization of seven appropriate phosphates in the naked PU.1 binding site was approximately 28°, substantially in excess of the bending observed in the PU.1-DNA crystal structure (∼8°). This result can be compared with the previous observation that six phosphate neutralizations at consecutive phosphates arrayed along two sides of one minor groove in GC-rich DNA caused ∼20° of bending toward the neutralized face (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The larger bend angle observed for the PU.1 sequence with only one additional neutralization suggests that the pattern of neutralization (major groove versus minor groove) and the DNA sequence may be important factors in modulating DNA bending by electrostatic effects. In addition, the fact that the electrostatic bend exceeds that observed in the PU.1-DNA complex suggests that the protein may, in a sense, be “captured” by the electrostatic DNA bend. In this manner, other aspects of PU.1 binding (e.g.Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds) may actually restrain the DNA from fully responding to the applied electrostatic force. As a technical aside, we note that the present study employed racemic methylphosphonate substitutions. Previous experiments with a different DNA sequence and alternating methylphosphonate substitutions showed that racemic substitution slightly exaggerated DNA bending (by ∼30%) relative to DNA duplexes with pure R P stereoisomers (14Strauss-Soukup J.K. Vaghefi M.M. Hogrefe R.I. Maher III, L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8692-8698Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Even accounting for this effect of stereochemistry, our data indicate that electrostatic forces are more than enough to account for PU.1-induced DNA bending. As has previously been observed for a variety of arbitrary DNA sequences (3Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 4Strauss J.K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8692-8698Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the PU.1 binding site responds to partial asymmetric phosphate neutralization by spontaneously bending toward the neutralized DNA face. These results reinforce the view that balanced interphosphate repulsion contributes to DNA stiffness, and that asymmetric patterns of phosphate neutralization give rise to measurable DNA bending forces. The present study represents direct application of the “phantom protein” approach for comparison of DNA bending by partial phosphate neutralization to DNA bending observed in the presence of a specific protein. In the future we hope to explore electrostatic contributions to DNA bending for other protein-DNA complexes."

DNA replication is an enormously complex process that requires the coordination of a number of specialized enzymatic activities involving many different proteins (1Baker T.A. Kornberg A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). These proteins include: (i) the replication helicase, which unwinds the duplex DNA to create single-stranded regions to serve as templates for DNA synthesis; (ii) the single-stranded binding protein, which protects the exposed single strands of DNA from nucleases and acts to stabilize the replication machinery; (iii) the primase, which synthesizes oligoribonucleotide primers that nucleate DNA polymerization on the leading and lagging strands; (iv) the DNA polymerase, which extends the RNA primers continuously against the leading strand template and discontinuously against the lagging strand template by means of a deoxynucleotide transferase mechanism; (v) the trimeric ring-shaped sliding clamp complex, which binds to the DNA polymerase to stabilize protein-DNA interactions and promotes highly processive DNA synthesis; and (vi) the clamp loader accessory proteins subassembly, which uses ATP hydrolysis to drive the loading of the sliding clamp onto the DNA (2Young M.C.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), raising a number of questions regarding the relation of form and function. Why is a ring-shaped structure necessary for the function(s) of these proteins? What is the structural basis of the interactions of protein rings with other macromolecules? Are opposite sides of the protein ring functionally equivalent?In the case of the sliding clamp proteins, their toroidal structure is generally believed to be essential for proper function. Prior to the determination of the first high resolution structure of a sliding clamp (the β dimer of Escherichia coli), considerable biochemical evidence existed to support the notion that the β-clamp must be topologically associated with the DNA (9Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was particularly gratifying to learn from crystallographic studies that the β-clamp is shaped like a doughnut, with a central hole of sufficient diameter to accommodate double-stranded DNA (7Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Although the dimeric β-clamp has no meaningful sequence homology with the trimeric sliding clamp proteins (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) of eukaryotes that have been investigated, nor with the trimeric phage T4 gp45 1The abbreviations used are: gp45, T4 gene 45 protein; gp44/62, a 4:1 complex of the T4 gene 44 protein and gene 62 protein; gp43, T4 gene 43 protein; IA, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)napthalene-1-sulfonic acid; TFPAM-3 or T3, N-(1-pyrene)maleimide; PM,N-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidopropionamide; SA, streptavidin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-carboxamido]butane.1The abbreviations used are: gp45, T4 gene 45 protein; gp44/62, a 4:1 complex of the T4 gene 44 protein and gene 62 protein; gp43, T4 gene 43 protein; IA, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)napthalene-1-sulfonic acid; TFPAM-3 or T3, N-(1-pyrene)maleimide; PM,N-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidopropionamide; SA, streptavidin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-carboxamido]butane. clamp protein, structural studies have now revealed that these proteins, like β, exist as protein rings (8Krishna T.S.

Moarefi and J. Kuriyan, manuscript in preparation. This result is consistent with the fact that β, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and gp45 have nearly identical functions. All three proteins are essential for highly processive DNA replication, can slide one-dimensionally on double-stranded DNA, and are lost to solution if the DNA is linearized. Significantly, gp45 is also known to act as a mobile enhancer (i.e. a DNA-tracking protein) in late transcription in phage T4 by stimulating the RNA polymerase machinery (11Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1992; 256: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Tinker R.L. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).From a structural perspective, one of the more interesting questions in DNA replication is how the sliding clamp is loaded onto the template-primer DNA at the replication fork. In the phage T4 system, gp45 loading is an ATP-dependent event that requires the action of the gp44/62 accessory proteins complex (13Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both gp45 and, separately, template-primer DNA, stimulate the rate of ATP hydrolysis of the gp44/62 clamp loader (13Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Young M. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This stimulation is synergistically activated when both gp45 and template-primer DNA are combined with gp44/62-ATP (13Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Young M. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that one gp44/62 molecule can act catalytically to load many gp45 molecules onto DNA (15Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with the release of ADP from gp44/62 probably representing the rate-limiting step in the reaction (14Young M.

These experiments have permitted us to begin to build some topographical details into the clamp loading reaction pathway that we (14Young M. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) had previously tried to define largely from a kinetic perspective. In this paper, we build on these results to further examine the interaction polarity and relative positioning of the two accessory proteins subassemblies during the clamp loading process.In an attempt to better understand how the gp45 DNA sliding clamp interacts with other DNA replication proteins and DNA itself, we previously described the creation of a gp45 mutant that contains a single cysteine residue (gp45-S19C) (17Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This mutant protein was labeled at the S19C position with an extrinsic fluorophore, which in turn reported ATP-dependent environmental changes when gp45-S19C was bound to the gp44/62 clamp loader or template-primer DNA. More specifically, we discovered that the fluorescence of the 5-((((2-Iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)napthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IA) fluorophore, covalently coupled to the S19C residue of gp45, increased dramatically upon binding gp44/62-ATP. This fluorescence enhancement could be quantified as a function of the concentration of gp44/62-ATP to yield a dissociation constant of ∼8 nm for the complex (17Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result suggested either that the S19C residue was located at or near the gp45 binding site for gp44/62-ATP or that this site was sensitive to a conformational change induced by the binding of the gp44/62-ATP complex to form the gp45-gp44/62-ATP loading complex. Significantly, the recent crystal structure of gp452 has revealed that the S19C residue of gp45 is located near the hole of the torus, on the C-terminal face of the ring (see Fig. 1).To determine if the S19C face of gp45 is indeed involved in binding to the gp44/62-ATP complex in clamp loading, we have constructed an additional gp45 mutant, gp45-S45C, in which the inserted cysteine residue lies on the N-terminal face of the gp45 ring, nearly directly opposite to the S19C mutation. In addition, we have continued to use a third mutated form of gp45, the previously described gp45-K81C (17Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which lies on the outside edge of the protein ring. Since the gp45 clamp is a trimeric protein, these three mutations allow us to probe up to nine different local environments, depending on the symmetry of the gp45 interaction with the loading proteins. For example, if the protein environment at each of these nine sites is nonequivalent in the trimer, then the nine positions would consist of three sites on one face of the gp45 ring (S19C), three on the opposite face (S45C), and three on the outside edge of the ring (K81C) (Fig. 1). In contrast, if the gp45 trimer interacts with other proteins with a predisposed symmetry, fewer than nine unique sites would exist, since some sites would share the same environment. By monitoring the environment of reporter groups covalently linked to each of these mutation sites in steady-state fluorescence assays, photo-cross-linking studies, and a novel “streptavidin interference assay,” we have determined that gp44/62-ATP binds to a single, defined face on the gp45 ring. We also present fluorescence evidence that gp45 binds asymmetrically in the gp45-gp44/62-ATP accessory protein complex, further supporting the detailed photochemical findings on the same point that are presented in the preceding paper (18Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe our efforts to “map” the surface regions on the gp45 sliding clamp that are important for binding to the gp44/62 clamp loader. The recently determined three-dimensional crystal structure of gp452 has proved invaluable in guiding our selection of residues that lie in different regions of the protein. In this regard, it is important to note that gp45 monomers self-assemble into trimers in solution, and thus each amino acid change is represented in triplicate in the biologically relevant structure. As a result, efficient labeling of the three mutated residues (S19C, S45C, and K81C) by reporter groups has allowed us to characterize up to nine potentially unique sites within the gp45 trimer.Protein-protein interactions between gp45 and gp44/62-ATP were probed by three distinct methods. First, extrinsic fluorophores were covalently attached to the lone cysteine residue, the positions of which differ within the trimer ring for the three gp45 mutants, and the steady-state fluorescence intensity and fluorescence polarization properties of these labeled gp45 trimers were examined. Second, photo-cross-linking groups were bound to the cysteine residues, and the nature of the protein-protein cross-links was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Finally, a novel streptavidin interference assay was developed that permits the occlusion of large regions of the gp45 surface using the streptavidin tetramer as a molecular surface “blocker.” The consequence of this steric perturbation upon gp45-gp44/62-ATP binding was quantified by measuring the ability of the various SA-gp45 mutant trimer rings to stimulate the gp44/62 ATPase. For each method, the results are consistent with the interpretation that gp44/62-ATP binds to gp45 on the C-terminal (S19C) side of the ring and, further, that no significant gp44/62-ATP interactions occur with the gp45 protein surface either at the edge of the torus or on the N-terminal (S45C) face.Fluorescence Methods for Determining Binding between the Clamp Loader and the Sliding ClampExtrinsic fluorophores such as IA and PM are known to be very sensitive indictors of local polarity change (22Haugland R.P. Molecular Probes: Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 5th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1992Google Scholar). Gp45-S19C and gp45-S45C were labeled with both of these reagents to determine the changes in fluorescence, if any, that might be observed upon adding gp44/62-ATP. Both proteins were efficiently modified by IA (2.5 IA labels/trimer for gp45-S19C, and 2.2 IA/trimer for gp45-S45C), consistent with the prediction from the gp45 crystal structure that both of these cysteine residues should be solvent-exposed. In agreement with previous work (17Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), IA-gp45-S19C reported a 20% increase in fluorescence and a slight blue shift in the emission maximum in the presence of saturating concentrations of gp44/62-ATP (Fig. 3). This result suggested that the environment of the IA label becomes more hydrophobic in the presence of gp44/62-ATP, as would be expected if S19C is at or near the binding site for the clamp loader. In contrast, IA-gp45-S45C failed to report any measurable change in fluorescence intensity upon the addition of gp44/62-ATP (Fig.4). The results were essentially the same when a second fluorophore, PM, was used to label the two proteins. Fluorescently labeled gp45-K81C also failed to show a fluorescence change in the presence of gp44/62-ATP, suggesting that the local environment of K81C, like that of S45C, is not perturbed in the clamp loading interaction.To ensure that binding between IA-gp45-S19C and gp44/62-ATP and IA-gp45-S45C and gp44/62-ATP is identical, the anisotropy of both fluorescent gp45 molecules was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of gp44/62-ATP. As shown in Fig. 5, the dissociation constants calculated from curve fits (∼1 nm) were equivalent for both IA-gp45-S19C and IA-gp45-S45C. This result clearly shows that both IA-derivatized proteins were completely bound to gp44/62-ATP at the concentrations used in the fluorescence intensity assays. We note also that our determination of the gp45-gp44/62-ATP dissociation constant yielded a value that is in good agreement with the previously reported value (17Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although the experimental set up was quite different.Photo-cross-linking Methods for Determining Binding between the Clamp Loader and the Sliding ClampAlthough the fluorescence intensity assays suggested that the S45C and K81C positions are not near the gp44/62-ATP binding site, we employed a photo-cross-linking technique to test this hypothesis. Our cross-linker of choice was T3, which is 13 Å in length and contains both a maleimide group (for attachment to sulfhydryl groups) and an azide moiety (which is converted to a highly reactive nitrene by irradiation with UV light). The results (Fig. 7) show that T3-gp45-S19C cross-links to both gp62 and gp44 in the presence and absence of ATP (see also Ref. 18Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the cross-linking observed with T3-gp45-S19C, the T3-gp45-S45C mutant failed to show any evidence of cross-linking, even at elevated protein concentrations. As a result, although the T3 label was covalently linked to about three S45C residues per gp45 trimer, none of these cross-linkers was positioned within 13 Å of either gp44 or gp62. We note that the Benkovic laboratory has also been unable to cross-link gp45 to gp44/62 when cross-linkers are positioned at the T7C residue of gp45, which lies on the same face as S45C. 4D. Sexton, personal communication. Neither T3-gp45-S19C nor T3-gp45-S45C formed intermolecular gp45 cross-links (data not shown), nor would any be expected, since interatomic distance measurements taken from the gp45 crystal structure indicate that the S19C and S45C residues are >13 Å removed from the closest amino acid residue in the neighboring gp45 monomer.The results of T3-gp45-K81C cross-linking to gp44/62-ATP are described in the first paper in this series (18Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, photo-cross-linking with T3-gp45-K81C revealed protein-protein cross-links between T3-gp45-K81C and gp44 but no significant cross-links between T3-gp45-K81C and gp62 in the absence of ATP. Although T3-gp45-K81C did cross-link to gp62 in the presence of ATP, the cross-linking efficiency between these two proteins was poor compared with the efficiency of cross-links formed between T3-gp45-S19C and gp62. Since gp62 is required to observe gp45 (but not DNA) stimulation of the ATPase activity of the gp44/62 complex (23Rush J. Lin T.-C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gp62 clearly plays a pivotal role in coordinating interactions between the gp44/62 clamp loader and the gp45 sliding clamp. As a result, we argue that the lack of T3-gp45-K81C cross-linking to gp62 when ATP is absent can be interpreted to mean that K81C is situated within 13 Å of gp44, whose position in space is determined by the disposition of gp44/62 at the gp45 binding site. In contrast, when ATP is available and weak cross-linking between T3-labeled gp45-K81C and gp62 is observed, we propose that conformational changes within the accessory protein complex (18Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bring K81C close enough to the actual gp62-gp45 binding site to permit cross-linking between the two protein subunits. In short, the cross-linking observed between T3-gp45-K81C and gp44 in the absence of ATP (and T3-gp45-K81C and gp62 in the presence of ATP) probably reflects the ability of the T3 cross-linker to “reach around and grab” the clamp loader bound at a site distal to K81C.Utility of the Streptavidin Interference AssayAs an additional test for the hypothesis that the N-terminal (S45C) face of the gp45 does not provide a binding surface for gp44/62-ATP, we developed a streptavidin interference assay. The purpose of this assay was to tether SA to biotin-derivatized gp45 and monitor the formation of the accessory protein complex by measuring the gp45-dependent stimulation of the gp44/62 ATPase. Since SA is a tetrameric protein with dimensions ∼50 × 50 × 40 Å and the face of the gp45 trimer is ∼90 Å in diameter, even one SA tethered to one face of gp45 would occlude roughly half of the available surface of the ring. The presence of a molecular obstacle the size of SA, combined with the flexibility of the long (32 Å) biotin-BMCC linker, would almost certainly prohibit gp44/62-ATP from docking to gp45 on the SA-bound face if that face contained the binding site for the clamp loader. This assertion is supported by the results of the experiment (Fig. 8). SA tethered to the S19C and K81C positions reduced the stimulation of the ATPase of gp44/62 by the gp45 cofactor to roughly the unstimulated level (∼0.3 μm/min under these conditions; Ref. 14Young M. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) In contrast, SA tethered to S45C had no statistically significant effect on the stimulation of the ATPase activity of gp44/62 by this mutant.Structural analyses based on an examination of physical models scaled to the dimensions of gp45, SA, and the biotin-BMCC linker offer the following insights. (i) SA tethered to S19C can block the C-terminal face and a sizable portion of the gp45 ring edge. (ii) SA linked to K81C can occlude the edge of the gp45 ring and a significant portion of both the C-terminal (S19C) and N-terminal (S45C) faces. (iii) SA tethered to S45C can block the N-terminal face and a significant portion of the edge of the gp45 ring. The fact that gp45-dependent stimulation of the gp44/62 ATPase is abolished when SA is linked to the K81C residue is consistent with the observation from model building that SA can swing around from the protein edge and block the binding of the clamp loader to the C-terminal face of gp45. In fact, S45C is actually closer to the edge of the protein ring than S19C. Consequently, it is difficult to imagine how the gp44/62-ATP subassembly could bind primarily to the edge of the gp45 ring if SA was bound to S45C. The only scenario that offers a satisfactory explanation for these results is that gp44/62-ATP binds primarily, if not exclusively, to the C-terminal (S19C) face of gp45. This conclusion is fully supported by the results of the fluorescence assays and photo-cross-linking studies discussed above.Fluorescence Evidence for Asymmetric Binding between the Clamp Loader and the Sliding ClampNearly all of the experiments described in this report have utilized gp45 molecules that were labeled efficiently by reporter groups (more than two labels/trimer). Thus, the absence of an effect, as reported by protein modification, simply indicates that none of the labels was able to make a macromolecular “contact.” These findings make the argument that a specific protein region is not involved in binding even more compelling, since more than one local environment was surveyed in each experiment. However, what can be said about the sites of interaction with gp44/62-ATP within the C-terminal (S19C) face itself? Since the S19C residue was labeled efficiently in each case, it is unclear whether gp44/62 contacts one, two, or all three monomers of the C-terminal face of the gp45 trimer ring.To address this question, we repeated the fluorescence intensity experiment described in Fig. 3 with IA-gp45-S19C labeled with fewer IA groups per gp45 trimer. When gp45-S19C contained an average of 1.4 IA labels/trimer (instead of the 2.5 labels/trimer used above), the fluorescence measured in the presence of gp44/62-ATP was enhanced by only 9%. Thus, a decrease in labeling efficiency (from 2.5 to 1.4 labels/trimer) caused a decrease in the relative percentage of fluorescence enhancement from 20 to 9% (data not shown). This finding suggests that each IA label on S19C does not make an equal contribution to the fluorescence increase upon binding gp44/62-ATP and that the loading complex interacts asymmetrically with the gp45 trimer, perturbing only one or two of the three available Cys-19 labeled fluorophores. This result is in good agreement with our photo-cross-linking studies (18Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also suggest binding asymmetry between gp45 and gp44/62.Possible Sites of Recognition on the Surface of the Sliding Clamp ProteinIt is intriguing to speculate about where on the gp45 surface gp44/62-ATP might bind. Structurally speaking, the C-terminal face of gp45 differs from the N-terminal face in many ways, but one of the more obvious differences is that the C-terminal face has several protruding loops, or “handle” structures 5O'Donnell and colleagues (10Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have put forward a similar proposal in connection with binding interactions between the γ complex clamp loader and the β-clamp. (see Fig. 1) that are absent on the N-terminal face, which is nearly planar by comparison.2 Since these “handle” regions are clustered near the three monomer-monomer interfaces of gp45, it is reasonable to suggest that gp44/62-ATP might dock onto gp45 using some of these sites and, through conformational changes in the accessory protein complex (18Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), disrupt the clamp interface(s) to open the ring. If this is true, it would also help to explain why the attachment of a bulky group such as PM to gp45 does not seem to compromise binding by gp44/62-ATP. Since the S19C residue does not extend into solution as far as do the “handle” structures,2 binding to these loop regions would also be consistent with the finding that Stern-Volmer plots failed to show any difference between the extent of acrylamide fluorescence quenching of the IA-gp45-S19C-gp44/62-ATP and IA-gp45-S45C-gp44/62-ATP accessory protein complexes (data not shown).ConclusionsElegant studies by O'Donnell and colleagues (10Naktinis V.

Here we extend these results by exploring the structural relationship between the gp43 polymerase and the gp45 sliding clamp. Using fluorescence intensity and polarization techniques, as well as photo-cross-linking methods, we present evidence that gp43, like gp44/62, binds to the C-terminal face of gp45. In addition, we show that g43 binds to the gp45 clamp in two distinct interaction modes, depending on the presence or absence of template-primer DNA. When template-primer DNA is present, gp43 binds tightly to gp45 to form the highly processive DNA polymerase holoenzyme. Gp43 also binds to gp45 in the absence of template-primer DNA, but this interaction is more than 100 times weaker than gp43-gp45 binding on DNA. Specific interactions between gp43 and the C-terminal face of gp45 are maintained in both modes of binding. These results underscore the pivotal role of template-primer DNA in modulating the strength of protein-protein interactions during DNA synthesis and provide additional insight into the structural requirements of the replication process.

Stable interactions between the sliding clamp and the DNA polymerase within the replication holoenzyme are essential for processive and efficient replication of genomic DNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Indeed, phage T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) 1The abbreviations used are: gp43, T4 gene 43 protein; gp45, T4 gene 45 protein; gp44/62, a 4:1 complex of the T4 gene 44 protein and gene 62 protein; IA, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)napthalene-1-sulfonic acid; T3,N-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidopropionamide; SA, streptavidin. dissociates from the template-primer DNA after incorporating only a few nucleotides into the nascent chain (1Newport J.W.

Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 485-505Crossref Google Scholar). Although gp43 is characterized by an intrinsic rate of synthesis (>400 s−1) (2Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that is comparable to the rate of DNA replication in vivo (600 s−1) (3McCarthy D. Minner C. Bernstein H. Bernstein C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 963-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the frequency of polymerase dissociation events in the absence of other replication factors would increase the time required for T4 genome synthesis from the observed 2–5 min to hours or even days (4Young M.C. Reddy M.K. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8675-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it has been suggested that the role of the polymerase accessory proteins is to increase the affinity of the polymerase for the template DNA during replication rather than to increase the inherent rate of chain extension (5Mace D.C Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This proposal is particularly appealing, since the functional role of gp45 sliding clamp can now be understood in terms of its structure. Moarefi and Kuriyan 2I. Moarefi and J. Kuriyan, manuscript in preparation. have recently determined that the gp45 trimer is a torus characterized by an internal diameter that is more than sufficient to encircle duplex DNA. Thus, if gp45 binds to DNA as a surrounding ring, as biochemical studies suggest (7Tinker R.L. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P.

In this way, inefficient polymerase dissociation and reassociation events can be avoided. In addition, regulation of the stability of the gp43-gp45 complex also provides a means of integrating the discontinuous synthesis that occurs on the lagging strand into the dynamics of the overall replication process. In the preceding paper (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) we described the use of three different cysteine mutants of gp45 to probe the polarity and general topography of interaction of the gp45 sliding clamp with the gp44/62-ATP clamp loader complex. In this work, we employ these gp45 mutants as tools to map regions on the sliding clamp surface that are at or near the binding site(s) of gp45 for gp43 in the T4 replication holoenzyme. We find that the gp43 polymerase binds to the gp45 clamp on the same C-terminal face with which the gp44/62 clamp loader interacts. Our results also demonstrate that gp45 can bind to gp43 in two interaction modes, depending on whether or not template-primer DNA is present. When template-primer DNA is available, gp43 and gp45 form a tight complex with a dissociation constant no greater than a few nm. In the absence of template-primer DNA, gp43 binds to gp45 much more weakly, with a dissociation constant of approximately 500 nm. These results are consistent with our current understanding of the regulation of protein-protein interactions within the replication complex during leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. The sources and methods of purification of most of the materials and proteins used in this study are described in the preceding paper (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with the exception of the purification of the T4 DNA polymerase. The gp43 polymerase was isolated by the method of Rush and Konigsberg (12Rush J. Konigsberg W.H. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 329-340PubMed Google Scholar), except that the order in which the columns were used was changed; the single-stranded DNA-cellulose column was used first in the preparative procedure, followed by the phosphocellulose and DE52 columns. In addition, the DE52 column replaced the Affi-Gel 10 column used by Rush and Konigsberg (12Rush J. Konigsberg W.H. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 329-340PubMed Google Scholar). All other procedures used have been presented previously (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

The indicated amino acid residues were chosen for site-specific mutation on the basis of their location within the three-dimensional structure of the gp45 protein ring. Thus, Ser-19 is situated on the C-terminal face of gp45 near the hole within the ring; Ser-45 is positioned on the opposite N-terminal face and slightly closer to the edge of the ring; and Lys-81 is located in the middle of the rim of the ring near the gp45-gp45 subunit interface (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have utilized the single cysteine sulfhydryl group within each mutant subunit to attach several different types of reporter groups to determine how the environment at these positions changes in the presence of the gp44/62 clamp loader and various protein and nucleotide cofactors. In summary, our results showed that the gp44/62-ATP subassembly binds to the C-terminal (and not the N-terminal) face of the gp45 sliding clamp ring. In this work we extend these findings by probing the site(s) of interaction of the gp45 sliding clamp with the gp43 polymerase. To determine whether the local environment of the S19C residue is perturbed by interaction with the gp43 polymerase, we extrinsically labeled gp45-S19C with IA to create IA-gp45-S19C. The Cys-19 group of gp45-S19C was efficiently labeled with the IA fluorophore (2.5 IA/gp45 trimer), as expected from the solvent accessibility of the S19C residue in the crystal structure.2 The addition of saturating concentrations of the gp44/62-ATP clamp loader complex increased the fluorescence of the IA-gp45-S19C probe by 22% (Fig.1, open circles; TableI). This fluorescence enhancement can be attributed to the formation of a gp45-gp44/62-ATP accessory proteins complex, as described previously (13Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The addition of template-primer DNA that had been “end-blocked” with streptavidin quenched the enhanced fluorescence by 7% (Fig. 1, open squares), consistent with previous results demonstrating that such DNA constructs can “catalyze” the release of gp44/62 from gp45 as the sliding clamp is loaded onto the template-primer DNA (13Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, an average of two gp45 rings have been shown to be present on the streptavidin-“bumpered” template-primer DNA (13Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The subsequent addition of the gp43 polymerase caused a 5% increase in the fluorescence of the IA-gp45-S19C trimer ring (Fig. 1, filled squares). Thus, this fluorescence increase offset more than half of the quenching induced by the addition of template-primer DNA.Table IRelative changes in IA-gp45 fluorescence in the presence of T4 replication proteins and cofactorsSampleChange in fluorescence intensity100 nm IA-gp45-S19C +1 mm ATP +120 nm gp44/62+22% +73 nmSA-50/30−7% +100 nm gp43+5%100 nm IA-gp45-S19C +1 mmATPNS1-aNS, not significant (<2% change in fluorescence). +120 nmgp44/62+25% +44 μm dA,dC, dTTP−2% +98 nm 50/30−12% +100 nmgp43NS100 nmIA-gp45-S45C +1 mm ATPNS +120 nm gp44/62NS +73 nm SA-50/30NS +100 nm gp43−2%200 nmIA-gp45-S19C +311 nm gp43+2%200 nm IA-gp45-S45C +311 nmgp43NSThe change in relative fluorescence caused by the addition of a reaction component was calculated by determining the maximum increase or decrease in the fluorescence relative to the level observed prior to the addition of that component.

The first three sets of results presented were calculated from the data of the representative experiments shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3. Studies in several laboratories have revealed that the DNA processivity clamps of different replication systems can slide off a linear template-primer DNA if the ends are not blocked (8Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5330-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the DNA polymerase holoenzymes from phage T4 and Escherichia coli both absolutely require either an end-blocked linear or circular template-primer construct to allow stable interactions on DNA between the sliding clamp and the polymerase (10Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10881-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the gp43-dependent fluorescence increase in DNA-bound IA-gp45-S19C reflects assembly of the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 1 using an unblocked linear template-primer DNA (biotin-50/30-mer) and three of four dNTPs to balance the polymerase and exonuclease activities of the enzyme and allow “polymerase idling” 3“Idling” conditions were chosen to best stabilize the polymerase on the template-primer DNA construct. Thus, even under optimal conditions for binding to the DNA, holoenzyme was still unable to assemble into a stable complex. (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the fluorescence enhancement caused by the addition of gp43 is not observed when the ends of the template-primer DNA substrate are not blocked by streptavidin. This finding indicates that the gp43-dependent fluorescence increase observed on streptavidin-blocked DNA (Fig. 1) is due to the formation of a DNA-bound gp43-IA-gp45-S19C complex with properties consistent with those of the T4 polymerase holoenzyme. Since, as described above, steady-state fluorescence assays have shown that IA coupled to the S19C residue of gp45 reports a change in the local environment when gp43 is added, the most straightforward interpretation is that gp43 contacts the gp45 ring at or near the S19C residue on the C-terminal face. Inasmuch as the S45C mutant residue is located on the N-terminal side of the ring (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we can use this residue in the same way to determine whether the N-terminal face of the ring is involved in gp43 binding as well. To this end, we labeled gp45-S45C with IA (three Cys-45 residues/gp45 trimer) and characterized the fluorescence properties of this protein during clamp loading and holoenzyme assembly. Although the IA-gp45-S45C protein was efficiently labeled (2.2 IA fluorophores/gp45 trimer), this mutant sliding clamp failed to report a fluorescence change upon binding to gp44/62-ATP (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or once loaded onto template-primer DNA (Fig. 3, filled squares). The addition of gp43 induced only a slight quench (2%) of the IA-gp45-S45C fluorescence (Fig. 3, open squares; Table I). One possible interpretation of the negative fluorescence results presented in Fig. 3 is that the IA-gp45-S45C protein is unable to bind gp43, perhaps due to the introduction of the amino acid change at S45C or to covalent attachment of the IA fluorophore. To rule out this possibility, two control experiments were performed to show that both IA-gp45-S45C and the IA-gp45-S19C trimer can bind polymerase. First, the fluorescence anisotropy of DNA-bound IA-gp45-S19C and IA-gp45-S45C clamps was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of gp43. As Table II shows, the anisotropy of both IA-gp45-S19C and IA-gp45-S45C increased when substoichiometric concentrations (50 nm) of gp43 were added, indicating that the gp43 protein decreases the rate of rotational diffusion of the IA-gp45 trimer rings. This result is consistent with the formation of a gp43-gp45 complex on template-primer DNA. When saturating gp43 (101 nm) was added, the anisotropy reached a plateau. This finding indicates that all of the gp43 was bound at this point. Thus, is it clear that gp43 changes the rotatory diffusion rate of the IA-gp45-S19C and IA-gp45-S45C clamps in a dose-dependent manner and that saturation is reached at a stoichiometric concentration of gp43. Although we cannot accurately calculate a dissociation constant for the gp45 interaction with gp43 in the presence of template-primer DNA on the basis of these limited data, the results do show that the binding interaction between the two proteins is very tight, with a K d in the low nanomolar range or less. In contrast, parallel attempts to measure a binding constant between gp43 and IA-gp45-S19C on linear, unblocked template-primer DNA didnot result in a significant change in the IA-gp45-S19C anisotropy at the concentrations used in the experiment (≤100 nm). This negative result was expected, since the polymerase holoenzyme cannot be stably assembled on a linear template-primer construct with unblocked termini (10Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10881-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Table IIBoth IA-gp45-S19C and IA-gp45-S45C bind to the gp43 polymerase on SA-50/30-mer template-primer DNASampleAnistropy (r)100 nm IA-gp45-S19C + 120 nmgp44/62 + 1 mm ATP + 73 nm SA-50/300.092 ± 0.002+51 nm gp430.111 ± 0.003+101 nmgp430.112 ± 0.003100 nm IA-gp45-S45C + 120 nm gp44/62+ 1 mm ATP + 73 nmSA-50/300.084 ± 0.002+51 nmgp430.090 ± 0.002+101 nm gp430.091 ± 0.003The first anisotropy value given for each data set is the anisotropy measured for a mixture of 100 nm IA-gp45, 120 nm gp44/62, 1 mm ATP, and 73 nmSA-50/30.

As a second test to show that the derivatized gp45 mutant proteins were functionally unaffected by the modification (either IA or T3; see below), the capacity of the modified mutant gp45 clamps to form functional polymerase holoenzyme complexes was monitored in two separate assays: (i) an M13 primer extension assay and (ii) a strand displacement assay (Fig. 4). In the M13 primer extension assay, the reaction conditions were carefully chosen such that the synthesis of multikilobase products is possible with the T4 polymerase holoenzyme but not with the gp43 polymerase alone. The efficiency of product formation was then determined at different concentrations of wild-type gp45 and compared with the processive synthesis activity conferred by similar concentrations of the various derivatized gp45 mutant clamps. The results show that each of the modified gp45 mutants are capable of stimulating significant synthesis activity that can only arise from the action of polymerase holoenzyme complexes. Furthermore, the relative activity of the gp45 mutants calculated from this assay was comparable with the activity stimulated by the unmodified, unmutated wild-type gp45 clamp. A strand displacement assay was also performed to test the ability of the mutant gp45 proteins to participate in holoenzyme assembly and function. In this assay, the fraction of holoenzyme molecules assembled can be measured from the percentage of polymerase molecules that can displace a “flap” 32-mer oligonucleotide partially annealed downstream of the primer. Strand displacement is not observed in the absence of gp45, and the efficiency of displacement of the “flap” DNA strand is dependent on the concentration of gp45 available in solution. As Fig. 4 shows, the various IA- and T3-modified gp45 clamps assemble into fully functional polymerase holoenzyme molecules that strand displace at levels nearly identical to the efficiency of strand displacement in the presence of comparable concentrations of the wild-type gp45 clamp. Thus, in two separate assays the various modified, mutant gp45 clamps were found to form functional polymerase holoenzyme complexes that were nearly indistinguishable from holoenzymes assembled with wild-type gp45. As shown in the companion papers (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

To provide further evidence that the S19C residue(s) (but not the S45C residues) of gp45 are at or near the gp43 binding site, the sulfhydryl groups of gp45-S19C and gp45-S45C were covalently attached to the T3 cross-linker (see Ref. 15Pietroni P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31666-31676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar for a discussion of the properties of this cross-linking agent). Both proteins were efficiently labeled by T3 (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and polymerase holoenzyme activity assays were used to demonstrate that T3 modification does not perturb the formation of a functional gp43-gp45 complex on template-primer DNA (Fig. 4). Cross-linking results for the interaction of T3-gp45 with other components of the T4 DNA replication machinery are presented in Fig.5. In the presence of T3-gp45-S19C and gp44/62-ATP, cross-linked bands were observed between gp45-gp62 and gp45-gp44 (Fig. 5, lane 2) (11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31666-31676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, when gp43 and end-blocked SA-50/30-mer template-primer DNA were added under polymerase idling conditions, the cross-linking efficiency of gp45 to gp44/62 decreased, and several new bands appeared that moved with electrophoretic mobilities less than that of gp43 (Fig. 5, lane 3). Since the formation of these bands required gp43 and the band mobilities were too small to represent any reasonable combination of cross-linked gp45-gp44/62 multimers, these new bands must represent cross-linked products of gp43 and gp45. We note that the formation of gp43-dependent cross-links with gp45 was equally efficient when unblocked linear 50/30-mer template-primer DNA constructs were used in place of the end-blocked DNA (Fig. 5, lane 4), indicating that gp43 and gp45 can interact at least transiently on this nonstabilizing template-primer construct. Cross-linking between T3-gp45-S45C and gp43 (or T3-gp45-S45C and gp44/62-ATP) was not observed when either end-blocked or unblocked template-primer DNAs were added (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and6). Thus, the T3 cross-linker reports a gp43-gp45 interaction on DNA when attached to S19C but not when attached to S45C. When T3-gp45-S19C is photoactivated in the presence of gp43, gp44/62-ATP, and unblocked 50/30-mer DNA in the absence of idling conditions, the gp43-gp45 cross-linked band appears at a slightly reduced efficiency (Fig. 5, lane 7). T3-gp45-S19C can also cross-link to gp43 in the absence of DNA (Fig. 5, lane 8), suggesting that these proteins can form a two-component complex in the absence of other proteins and cofactors of the T4 DNA replication system. Furthermore, this cross-linking in free solution demonstrates polarized ring binding, since T3-gp45-S19C cross-links to gp43 in solution (Fig. 5, lane 10), whereas T3-gp45-S45C does not (Fig. 5, lane 9). Photoactivation of a third T3-labeled gp45 mutant, gp45-K81C, in the presence of gp43, demonstrated that cross-linking can also be observed with this mutant, although the cross-linking efficiency is low compared with that of gp43 to T3-gp45-S19C (data not shown). This result is topographically significant, since the K81C residue lies on the edge of the gp45 ring, whereas the S19C residue lies on the C-terminal face of the ring (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 11Latham G.J. Bacheller D.J. Pietroni P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31677-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since T3 photo-cross-linking was used above to demonstrate the existence of an interaction between gp43 and gp45 free in solution, we have used fluorescence methods to measure this binding affinity under equilibrium conditions. As shown in Fig.6, increasing concentrations of gp43 caused a concomitant increase in the rotational anisotropy of the IA-gp45-S19C clamp. From these data we can calculate a dissociation constant of 480 ± 100 nm for the gp43-gp45 interaction in the absence of DNA. In light of this result, the fluorescence intensities of the IA-gp45-S19C and IA-gp45-S45C proteins in the presence of gp43 alone were also measured (Table II). Since gp43 induces a 5% increase in the fluorescence when the T3-gp45-S19C clamp is loaded onto template-primer DNA (Fig. 1, filled squares), one might expect that an increase in fluorescence would also be observed if the two proteins interact to form a similar binding complex (at least with respect to the IA-S19C environment) when free in solution. When IA-gp45-S19C and gp43 were combined at concentrations that should result in ∼35% complex formation on the basis of aK d of 480 nm for this interaction, a small but reproducible increase in the fluorescence was observed. In contrast, when the IA-gp45-S45C clamp was mixed with gp43 under similar conditions, no measurable change in fluorescence was observed (TableII). The recently determined crystal structure of gp45 shows that the protein trimer is a ring-shaped molecule,2 consistent with the published structures of the sliding clamps from yeast (proliferating cell nuclear antigen trimer; Ref. 16Krishna T.S.

Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). To better understand the structural nature of the interaction between the gp45 clamp and the gp43 polymerase, we used the gp45 crystal structure as a guide for selecting candidate residues for site-specific modifications that lie in distinct positions on the protein surface. The three sites (Ser-19, Ser-45, and Lys-81) that were selected were separately mutated to cysteine to create a specific chemical target for labeling with reporter groups such as IA and T3. The results from both fluorescence and photo-cross-linking experiments support the conclusion that gp43 interacts with gp45 on the C-terminal face of the sliding clamp and that the strength of this interaction is modulated by template-primer DNA. Characterization of both the labeled IA-gp45-S19C mutant (with 82% of its Cys-19 residues modified with IA) and the T3-gp45-S19C mutant (>90% of the Cys-19 residues modified with T3) provided clear evidence for protein-protein interactions between gp45 and gp43. However, in no experiment were we able to detect interactions between gp43 and reporter groups attached to the S45C residue of gp45. This result is significant, since both IA-gp45-S45C (72% of Cys-45 residues modified) and T3-gp45-S45C (>90% of Cys-45 residues modified) were extensively labeled with reporter groups in these fluorescence and photo-cross-linking studies. Thus, the negative results obtained for both experiments indicate that none of the three S45C residues in the gp45 trimer lie within the interaction distance of the gp43 protein in the T4 polymerase holoenzyme.

The hydrophilic subunits, SDH1p and SDH2p, comprise the catalytic domain involved in succinate oxidation.

They are usually composed of four nonidentical subunits: a large flavoprotein subunit of about 70 kDa to which is covalently attached an FAD cofactor, an iron-sulfur protein subunit of about 27 kDa that contains three iron-sulfur clusters, and two smaller hydrophobic membrane subunits of about 17 and 13 kDa. The hydrophobic subunits are thought to contain two quinone binding sites and may also ligand one or two b-type hemes. The flavoprotein and the iron-sulfur subunits form catalytically active dimers that can oxidize succinate or reduce fumarate with artificial electron acceptors or donors, respectively. However, the oxidation or reduction of natural quinone substrates is only possible with the membrane anchor subunits (1Cole S.T. Condon C. Lemire B.D. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III.

The primary structures of the flavoprotein and the iron-sulfur subunits are conserved in SDHs and FRDs of different species, but this is not the case for the membrane anchor subunits (2Ackrell B.A.C.

Thus, the anchor subunits may contribute to the unique properties of each enzyme. For example, the SDHs and FRDs from different sources interact with a variety of quinones and are differentially sensitive to quinone analog inhibitors (2Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P.

Furthermore, the hydrophobic subunits may determine the preferred direction of electron flow in SDH and FRD enzymes. To date, our understanding of the molecular details of electron flow through the membrane subunits is rather limited. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDH, the flavoprotein, the iron-sulfur, and the membrane subunits are encoded by nuclear genes,SDH1, SDH2, SDH3, and SDH4, respectively (6Lombardo A. Carine K.

They provide the attachment for the catalytic domain to the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as for the electron transfer reaction with ubiquinone. Alignment of the SDH4p subunits from different organisms reveals the presence of a 25–30 amino acid extension at the carboxyl terminus of the S. cerevisiae SDH4p (Fig. 1). A search for the presence of functional or structural domains in the carboxyl-terminal extension failed to identify any significant features. We were curious to determine whether the carboxyl-terminal extension was required for SDH function in yeast. In this study, we investigate the role of the SDH4p carboxyl-terminal extension by deletion mutagenesis. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus reveals that it is necessary for respiration on non-fermentable carbon sources, for quinone reduction, and for enzyme stability. The parental yeast strain, MH125 and theEscherichia coli strain, DH5α, have been described previously (12Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). sdh4W2 (MH125; SDH4Δ-1::TRP1) was constructed by replacing the 0.8-kilobase XhoI toSpeI fragment containing the entire SDH4 open reading frame with the TRP1 gene by targeted gene disruption in MH125. The yeast media used are SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose), SG (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 3% glycerol), YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose), and semisynthetic galactose (0.3% yeast extract, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.05% NaCl, 0.06% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05% CaCl2, 0.003% FeCl3, 2% galactose). Cultures were grown on SD media for 2 days to select for plasmid retention, used to inoculate YPGal medium supplemented with 0.01% glucose to a startingA 600 = 0.05, and grown at 30 °C to stationary phase. Cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell for the preparation of submitochondrial particles (10Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of mitochondria, cultures were grown in a semisynthetic galactose to late logarithmic phase (A 600 about 3), harvested, and lysed enzymatically as described (10Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By polymerase chain reactions with the plasmid pSDH4–17 as template (10Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the following oligonucleotides, 5′-TACTTCTAGACGTCGACACCATCATTCTCGGTTTC-3′, 5′-TACTTCTAGACCCATAGACTTTTTACTAAACC-3′, and 5′-TACTTCTAGACTTTCTCGGAAGAATCCC-3′, stop codons, encoded within the XbaI restriction sites (underlined), were introduced into the SDH4 gene following the Val-127, Trp-135, and Lys-140 codons (Fig. 1) to produce the SDH4ΔC23, SDH4ΔC15, and SDH4ΔC10 constructs, respectively. The oligonucleotides introduced the amino acids aspartate and valine, valine, and valine at the carboxyl termini of the SDH4ΔC23, SDH4ΔC15, and SDH4ΔC10 constructs, respectively. The M13 forward primer, 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′, was used in conjunction with each of the above primers. Amplifications were performed using the Expand Long Template PCR System kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification products were purified, digested with XhoI and XbaI, and ligated into SalI- and XbaI-digested YEplac181 (13Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 427-534Google Scholar) to yield the plasmids, pSDH4ΔC23, pSDH4ΔC15, and pSDH4ΔC10. The deletions were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids were introduced into sdh4W2 by lithium acetate-mediated transformation (14Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The succinate-dependent reduction of ubiquinone was monitored spectrophotometrically at room temperature as the 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB)-mediated reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP (15Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The succinate-dependent, phenazine methosulfate (PMS)-mediated reduction of DCPIP was determined as a measure of the membrane-associated SDH1p/SDH2p dimer; this assay does not require catalytically competent hydrophobic subunits, but membrane association of the SDH1p/SDH2p dimer requires intact anchor subunits (10Bullis B.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For thermal stability measurements, submitochondrial particles (20 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aliquots were assayed at 5-min intervals. Double reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk) were fitted by a weighted least squares algorithm in the EnzymeKinetics software package (Trinity Software, Campton, NH) to evaluate the inhibition patterns and the apparent Michaelis parameters,K m and V max. Where non-competitive inhibition was indicated from the nature of the double reciprocal plots generated with different inhibitor concentrations, secondary plots of reciprocal intercepts on the abscissa (or slopes) against the inhibitor concentrations were produced. When the secondary plots were linear, as for the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme, suggesting simple, linear, non-competitive inhibition, the hypothesis was confirmed by performing a non-linear least squares fit to Equation 1,v=VAK(1+(I/Kis))+A(1+(I/Kii))Equation 1 where v is the initial velocity observed in the presence of a fixed inhibitor concentration I,K is and K ii are the slope and intercept inhibition constants, respectively, A is the varied substrate concentration, and K and V are the apparent K m and V maxvalues, respectively (17Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Where hyperbolic secondary plots were obtained, as for the wild type, the SDH4ΔC10, and the SDH4ΔC15 enzymes, the data were fitted to Equation 2,y=a(1+(I/Ki1))(1+(I/Ki2))Equation 2 where y is the slope or intercept in the presence of a fixed concentration of the inhibitor I, a is the slope or intercept in the absence of inhibitor, andK i1 and K i2 are the high affinity and low affinity inhibition constants, respectively (17Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). The equation was compiled into proFit 5.0 (Quantum Soft, Zurich, Switzerland) and fitted by non-linear least squares using the quasi-Newton algorithm. In all cases, the fit with the lowest sum of squares error (SSE) was chosen to describe the inhibition patterns. Measurements of covalently bound flavin have been described (10Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An SDH4 disruption mutant, sdh4K7, previously made by insertion of theLYS2 marker into the SDH4 open reading frame, still possessed low levels of succinate-quinone reductase activity (10Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We surmised that the amino-terminal peptide of 65-amino acid residues might retain partial SDH4p function. A complete deletion of the SDH4 gene in the parent strain, MH125, was constructed in which the entire SDH4 open reading frame is replaced by the TRP1 marker gene by targeted gene disruption to produce the strain sdh4W2. The genotype was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). As expected, sdh4W2 has lost the ability to use glycerol as the sole carbon source unless a wild type SDH4gene is introduced. The presence of the unusual C-terminal extension in the yeast SDH4p sequence (Fig. 1) prompted us to determine whether this extension is required for proper enzyme function. Truncated, plasmid-borne SDH4 genes were constructed and introduced into sdh4W2. Deletion of 23-amino acid residues in pSDH4ΔC23 severely impairs respiratory growth on the non-fermentable carbon sources, glycerol and lactate. That the impaired respiration did not result from a mutation in the mitochondrial genome was verified by mating with a rho0 strain; the diploid is fully competent to grow on glycerol-containing media. These data indicate that the SDH4 carboxyl-terminal extension is essential for SDH function in vivo. To define more precisely the critical sequences in the carboxyl-terminal extension that are required for SDH function, two shorter truncations were constructed (Fig.2). The plasmids pSDH4ΔC10 and pSDH4ΔC15 both conferred the ability to grow on glycerol-containing media to sdh4W2. To compare the respiratory growth abilities of the wild type and mutant strains, growth on semisynthetic medium containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5% galactose was monitored (Fig.3). An initial growth phase is fermentative followed by a respiratory phase (18Bruel C. Manon S. Guerin M. Meunier-Lemesle D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Growth rates during the fermentative phases were similar for wild type and mutant strains (not shown) but were markedly different in the respiratory phases. The growth yields monitored as the optical densities at 600 nm of late stationary phase cultures reflect the respiratory capabilities of each strain and were plotted against the initial galactose concentrations (Fig. 3). The growth yields of the parent strain, MH125, and sdh4W2 carrying the plasmid pSDH4-17 are similar. The deletion strain, sdh4W2, by fermentation alone achieves 11% of the growth yield of the respiration-proficient wild type on 0.5% galactose. The growth yield of 85% achieved with sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC10 indicates that this deletion has only minor effects on respiratory growth. In contrast, the growth yield of sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC23 is severely reduced (29%), whereas sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC15 produces an intermediate value (59%). These data indicate that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of SDH4p severely impairs respiratory growth in vivo, while deletion of 15 residues results in partial impairment. To determine whether the impaired growth we observed is due to a loss of SDH activity or to decreased assembly of the enzyme into the membrane, we prepared mitochondrial membrane fractions for biochemical analysis (Table I). sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC23 mitochondrial membranes show greatly reduced turnover numbers for succinate-DB reductase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and malonate-sensitive succinate oxidase activities. As expected, these activities are not detectable in sdh4W2 mitochondrial membranes. Interestingly, the succinate-PMS reductase activity in sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC23 membranes is the same as that of MH125 membranes. These data indicate that the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme is correctly assembled into mitochondria in near normal amounts and is able to reduce the artificial electron acceptor, PMS, but is impaired in the reduction of ubiquinone or a ubiquinone analog (DB). To independently confirm enzyme assembly, we determined the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable flavin levels in mutant and wild type membranes. In S. cerevisiae, the amount of acid-precipitable flavin directly reflects the levels of SDH1p (16Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The covalent flavin levels of SDH4ΔC23 membranes are only slightly reduced compared with the wild type, supporting our conclusion that membrane assembly is only slightly impaired in this mutant. In contrast, the succinate-PMS reductase and covalent flavin levels in sdh4W2 membranes are not detectable. The levels of NADH oxidase and glycerol-1-phosphate-cytochrome c reductase activities are unaffected or even slightly elevated in sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC23, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal deletion specifically affects SDH. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the carboxyl-terminal extension of SDH4p is not necessary for a membrane-anchoring function but is required for ubiquinone reduction.Table IRespiratory chain activities of mitochondrial membranesMH125sdh4W2-pSDH4–17sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC10sdh4W-pSDH4ΔC15sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC23sdh4W2Succinate-DB reductase1-aActivities are expressed as μmol of DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.3400350032002600600ND1-bND, not detectable.Succinate-cytochrome creductase1-cActivities are expressed as μmol of cytochromec reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.2300310025001900500NDSuccinate oxidase1-dActivities are expressed as μg atoms of oxygen min−1 μmol of FAD−1.2500310026001700700NDSuccinate-PMS reductase1-aActivities are expressed as μmol of DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.41005100410037004300NDNADH oxidase1-dActivities are expressed as μg atoms of oxygen min−1 μmol of FAD−1.38004400470037005200951-eActivity is expressed as ng atoms of oxygen min−1mg of protein−1.Glycerol-1-P-cytochrome creductase1-cActivities are expressed as μmol of cytochromec reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.20002000210026002800551-fActivity is expressed as nmol of cytochrome creduced min−1 mg of protein−1.Covalent flavin1-gCovalent flavin contents are expressed as pmol of FAD mg of protein−1.3225292721ND1-a Activities are expressed as μmol of DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.1-b ND, not detectable.1-c Activities are expressed as μmol of cytochromec reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.1-d Activities are expressed as μg atoms of oxygen min−1 μmol of FAD−1.1-e Activity is expressed as ng atoms of oxygen min−1mg of protein−1.1-f Activity is expressed as nmol of cytochrome creduced min−1 mg of protein−1.1-g Covalent flavin contents are expressed as pmol of FAD mg of protein−1. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, truncation of 15 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus (SDH4ΔC15) had smaller effects on succinate-DB reductase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and succinate-oxidase activities, whereas the loss of 10 (SDH4ΔC10) amino acids had no appreciable effects; the results of the enzymatic assays are consistent with observed growth abilities in that the deletions of 10 or 15 amino acids do not greatly impair respiratory abilities. SDH4ΔC15 and SDH4ΔC10 membranes have normal levels of succinate-PMS reductase and covalent flavin. This suggests that the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide (DNSQKIEAKK) is dispensable for membrane anchoring and ubiquinone reduction while residues 136 to 140, missing in the SDH4ΔC15 enzyme, are required for optimal quinone reduction activity. Since the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme is partially active in quinone reduction, we tested whether its activity could be stimulated by higher quinone concentrations. We preincubated SDH4ΔC23 membranes at 22 °C with a 10-fold excess of DB (0.5 mm) before assaying succinate-DB reductase activity. A greater than 5-fold stimulation could be achieved (Fig. 4) with maximal stimulation occurring after a 5-min incubation. In contrast, preincubation with DB had no effect on the activities of the wild type, the SDH4ΔC15, or the SDH4ΔC10 enzymes (data not shown). We measured the apparent kinetic parameters K m andV max for DB reduction using the reporter DCPIP in a coupled enzyme assay as previously reported (15Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Succinate reduces exogenous DB directly without interference from endogenous Q6 (19Zhu Q.-S. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier observations (20Grivennikova V.G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we did not observe a lag in enzyme activity. SDH4ΔC23 mitochondrial membranes were preincubated with varying concentrations of DB at room temperature, and reactions were initiated by the addition of succinate and DCPIP. The apparent Michaelis constants K m andV max were calculated and are summarized in TableII. The apparent K m for DB of the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme (22 μm) is almost 7 times higher than that of the wild type enzyme (3.3 μm). The apparent K m for the SDH4ΔC15 and the SDH4ΔC10 enzymes are only slightly higher than that of the wild type. We suggest that the higher apparent K m of the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme is an indication of a reduced quinone binding affinity due to an altered binding site.Table IIApparent Michaelis constants for quinone reductionStrainK m 2-aValues are expressed as μm.V max2-bValues are expressed as μmol of DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.MH1253.3 ± 0.22-cValues represent means of triplicate determinations ± S.E.3500 ± 200sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC104.5 ± 0.13400 ± 40sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC155.1 ± 0.22900 ± 100sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC2322 ± 13400 ± 1002-a Values are expressed as μm.2-b Values are expressed as μmol of DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of FAD−1.2-c Values represent means of triplicate determinations ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows that preincubation of the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme with DB for longer than 5 min results in lower activities suggesting that the enzyme is unstable. We directly tested this possibility by incubating mitochondrial membranes at 30 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm succinate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Aliquots were withdrawn at 5-min intervals and assayed for succinate-DB reductase activity (Fig.5). The wild type and SDH4ΔC10 enzymes are stable over the course of the experiment. The SDH4ΔC15 and SDH4ΔC23 enzyme activities drop rapidly with 50% losses at 20 and 11 min, respectively. Interestingly, the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme could be partially stabilized by incubating in the presence of DB. These data indicate that the SDH4p carboxyl-terminal extension is also required for enzyme stability and that residues 136 to 140, missing in the SDH4ΔC15 enzyme, are crucial to this function. Since the maximal velocities of the wild type and mutant enzymes are similar under our standard preincubation and assay conditions (Table II), we do not believe that enzyme instability significantly affected the kinetic values reported in Tables II and III.Table IIIApparent inhibition constants for quinone reductionStrainK i13-aInhibition constants are expressed as mm.K i2MH1250.05 ± 0.013-bValues represent means of triplicate determinations ± S.E.0.56 ± 0.06sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC100.06 ± 0.010.74 ± 0.1sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC150.06 ± 0.011.14 ± 0.12sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC230.08 ± 0.023-a Inhibition constants are expressed as mm.3-b Values represent means of triplicate determinations ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Inhibitors have been very powerful tools in the elucidation of the mechanisms of quinone oxidation and reduction (21Daldal F. Tokito M.K. Davidson E. Faham M.

The 4,6-dinitrophenol derivative, 2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (s-BDNP) effectively inhibits beef heart complex II (23Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We tested whether the S. cerevisiae SDH was similarly sensitive. As with the bovine enzyme, we observed non-competitive inhibition of succinate-DB reductase activity with the yeast enzyme (Fig. 6 A). The secondary plots of the abscissa intercepts against the inhibitor concentrations for the wild type, the SDH4ΔC10, and the SDH4ΔC15 enzymes showed hyperbolic curvature (Fig. 6 B). The data could best be described with Equation 2 for non-competitive inhibition with two non-equivalent K i values. The sum of squares error (SSE) values for the wild type, the SDH4ΔC10, and the SDH4ΔC15 enzymes are 1.7 × 10−4, 1.6 × 10−4, and 2.0 × 10−4, respectively. This suggests a two-site model for inhibitor binding, with two non-equivalent inhibition constants. TableIII presents the estimates of the affinities of both inhibitor sites. The affinities of the inhibitor sites in the wild type and the SDH4ΔC10 enzymes are similar with an approximate 10-fold difference between the 2 sites. For the SDH4ΔC15 enzyme, the high affinity inhibitor site (0.06 mm) remains unchanged while the low affinity site has a 2-fold lower affinity (1.14 mm), consistent with a small perturbation of the putative low affinity inhibitor binding site and a partial loss of quinone-reductase activity exhibited in growth and activity studies. For the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme, non-competitive inhibition bys-BDNP is also observed (not shown), but the secondary plot of reciprocal maximal velocities against inhibitor concentrations is linear (Fig. 6 B). This suggests the presence of only one inhibitor binding site in the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme (Table III). There is a good fit of the data to Equation 1 (SSE = 4.0 × 10−5). The second inhibitor site may be non-functional, or its affinity for s-BDNP may be too low to measure. Interestingly, the apparent K i for the SDH4ΔC23 mutant enzyme (0.08 mm) is close to the value obtained for the high affinity inhibitor site in the wild type enzyme. The participation of ubiquinone in the mitochondrial electron transport chain is well established (2Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar, 3Hederstedt L. Ohnishi T. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier, New York1992: 163-197Google Scholar). However, the molecular details of its interactions with SDH are poorly understood. Studies on the bovine SDH (2Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K.

Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 271: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and theE. coli FRD (25Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19560-19567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed that quinone substrates interact via the membrane anchor subunits. Our data clearly demonstrate that the S. cerevisiae SDH4p subunit is required for an anchoring role. The SDH4 deletion mutant, sdh4W2, is unable to grow on glycerol, has undetectable levels of the ubiquinone-dependent enzyme activities, succinate oxidase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and undetectable levels of acid-precipitable flavin (Table I), consistent with absence of membrane-associated SDH. Similarly, the SDH3p subunit is essential for SDH assembly (11Daignan-Fornier B. Valens M. Lemire B.D. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15469-15472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also establish a role for the yeast SDH4p subunit in ubiquinone reduction and more specifically for its terminal 23-amino acid residues. The loss of those 23 amino acids severely impairs SDH function in vivo (Fig. 3). The lack of respiratory growth is not due to a loss of SDH4p anchoring function since mitochondrial membranes from sdh4W2-pSDH4ΔC23 have normal levels of succinate-PMS reductase activity (Table I); this clearly indicates that the SDH1p and SDH2p subunits are membrane-associated and active. This is further supported by the covalent flavin levels in SDH4ΔC23 membranes. The SDH4ΔC23 enzyme is only poorly able to reduce the ubiquinone analog, DB (Table I). Preincubation of the enzyme with 0.5 mm DB for 5 min at room temperature stimulates the succinate-DB reductase activity 5-fold (Fig. 4) and achieves a turnover number similar to the wild type enzyme (Table II). Stimulation of activity by preincubation with DB is not observed for the wild type or for the other mutant enzymes. This indicates that the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme is fully catalytically competent when provided with saturating substrate (DB) levels. The apparent affinity of the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme for DB is about 7-fold lower than that of the wild type enzyme (TableII). The data demonstrate that the SDH4p carboxyl-terminal extension is involved in quinone reduction. At the molecular level, at least two possibilities may account for these observations. The carboxyl-terminal extension may directly interact with DB and ubiquinone as part of a quinone binding site. Alternatively, it may stabilize protein conformations necessary for the formation of a high affinity quinone binding site. In either model, its loss impairs quinone binding and hence quinone reduction. Our data do not distinguish between these alternatives. Further insight should await a detailed structural analysis of the quinone binding sites in the S. cerevisiae SDH. The SDH4p residues 128–135, which are missing in the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme but not in the SDH4ΔC15 enzyme, are critical for the formation of a high affinity quinone binding site since it is only with the more extensive deletion that severely impaired quinone reduction is observed (Table I). Residues 136 to 140, missing in the SDH4ΔC15 enzyme but not in the SDH4ΔC10 enzyme, are necessary for optimal quinone reducing activity. The enzymatic activities of the SDH4ΔC10 enzyme are comparable with those of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide is dispensable. In addition to the carboxyl-terminal extension's role in quinone reduction, it also serves to stabilize the enzyme. At 30 °C, the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme is extremely labile with a complete loss of succinate-DB reductase activity within 20 min (Fig. 5), whereas the wild type and the SDH4ΔC10 enzymes are stable. The SDH4ΔC15 enzyme is moderately unstable indicating that residues 136–140 are important for stability while the additional loss of residues 128–135 in the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme can be compensated for by higher DB concentrations. The mechanism of how an iron-sulfur center, a one-electron carrier, can fully reduce a two-electron acceptor like ubiquinone has been a focus of considerable attention. Studies on the photosynthetic reaction center (27Wraight C.A. Trumpower B.L. Function of Quinones in Energy Conserving Systems. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 181-198Crossref Google Scholar) indicate that quinone reduction proceeds via two “one-electron” steps carried out at separate quinone binding sites, QA and QB. In this model, a tightly bound quinone at the QA site cycles between the fully oxidized and the semiquinone states to mediate single-electron transfer between the enzyme and a dissociable quinone at the QB site. A similar two-state model has been postulated for SDH and FRD based on thermodynamic considerations (28Cammack R. Crowe B.A. Cook N.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 1207-1208Crossref Google Scholar). During quinone reduction by beef heart SDH, two protein-stabilized ubisemiquinone radicals can be identified in the vicinity of Center 3 iron-sulfur cluster (29Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Schefler K.L. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Detailed mutational analysis of the E. coli FRD hydrophobic subunits has led to a structural model for the locations of the QA and QB sites (25Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19560-19567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the absence of detailed structural information about the yeast anchor subunits, our observations can be rationalized in terms of a two-ubiquinone binding site model. The non-competitive inhibition pattern of the enzyme by s-BDNP, an analog of ubiquinone, is best explained by 2 inhibitor binding sites; these may correspond to the QA and QB sites. By analogy to the model for the FRD QA and QB sites (25Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the SDH QA site would be oriented toward the cytoplasmic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and the SDH QB site toward the matrix. The SDH4 carboxyl-terminal extension is predicted to be on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (Fig. 2). Our data do not identify which of the two putative quinone binding sites is affected in the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme nor whether the inhibitor binding sites physically correspond to those sites, although the loss of quinone reductase activity is consistent with a perturbed QA site and with the topological model for SDH4p (25Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study clearly demonstrates that the SDH4 carboxyl-terminal extension is necessary for SDH activity and stability. It is interesting to note that of the 8 additional residues deleted in the SDH4ΔC23 enzyme as compared with the SDH4ΔC15 enzyme, only one, lysine 132, is charged, and only two, lysine 132 and serine 133 are potentially involved in hydrogen bonding. These residues are thus candidates for direct interactions with ubiquinone or for protein-protein interactions that produce a competent quinone binding conformation. More detailed mutagenesis studies are in progress."

GCY1 is inducible by galactose about 25-fold due to Gal4p-binding to a singleUAS GAL, whereas RIO1 is constitutively expressed. GCY1 has a TATA box obeying the consensus TATAAA, whereas the RIO1 5′-upstream region lacks such a motif. In vitro mutagenesis of the TATA motif ofGCY1, on the one hand, and introduction of a TATA-element into the promoter of RIO1, on the other hand, as well as inversion of the intergenic region have revealed that transcription ofGCY1 and RIO1 is only regulated by Gal4p when a consensus TATA motif is included in their core promoters but not in its absence. The data imply that only transcription complexes that assemble at a consensus TATA box are compatible with specific transactivators, such as Gal4p. As a result, the adjacent gene is subject to regulated expression. By contrast, if a consensus TATA sequence is absent, the initiation complex does not respond to regulatory transcription factors, and consequently, the respective gene is constitutively transcribed.

On the other hand, we show that two blocks of homo-oligomeric (dA·dT) sequences do not function as boundary sequences that might confine regulatory action of Gal4p toGCY1. The yeast genome is densely packed with genetic information, and consequently, distances between two genes are relatively short. Frequently, adjacent genes are transcribed divergently from the same intergenic control region. In some cases, the mode of their expression differs, e.g. one gene is expressed in a regulated fashion, whereas the other one is constitutively transcribed. One such example is HIS3 and PET56; HIS3 is induced by a shortage of amino acids, whereas expression of PET56 is unregulated (1Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8587-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). TATA boxes and initiator elements are targets of basal transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 2Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These elements are sufficient for basal transcription. However, specific transactivators, which bind to cis-acting upstream elements, are required for regulated gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 3Guarente L. Cell. 1988; 52: 303-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Regulatory transcription factors act in both orientations and at long distances. Therefore, it seems to be contradictory that transactivator-binding to an intergenic region exclusively influences expression of one gene, whereas the divergently transcribed gene is constitutively expressed. The maintenance of individual gene expression is controversially discussed. Analyses of the HIS3 promoter resulted in the hypothesis that two distinct types of TATA boxes exist: constitutive elements that assemble the basal initiation complex independent of upstream-binding transactivators, and regulatory TATA motifs following the consensus “TATAAA” that are responsive to upstream regulatory elements (4Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Ponticelli A.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2832-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was proposed that there are several TATA-binding proteins that associate with either type of TATA motif (4Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Chen W. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Harbury P.A.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A heterogeneity of TATA-binding proteins could not yet be found in yeast, and it has been shown that TBP binds to both types of TATA-elements (8Hahn S. Buratowski S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,9Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, recent results reveal that multiple TATA-binding protein associated factors (TAFs) 1The abbreviations used are: TAF, TATA-binding protein associated factor; bp, base pair(s).exist which modulate the properties of TFIID and dictate the specificity of the initiation complex by transmitting the signals from specific transactivators to the basal transcription machinery (10Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The 869-bp intergenic region of the genes GCY1 andRIO1 represents an example of divergently transcribed genes.GCY1 (galactose-induciblecrystallin-like yeast protein, YOR120w) encodes an aldo/keto reductase of unknown substrate specificity and shows particularly high homology to prostaglandin F synthetase. Expression ofGCY1 is inducible about 25-fold by growth on galactose as carbon source (11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene. 1990; 90: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This induction is due to Gal4p binding to a singleUAS GAL in the intergenic region. RIO1(right open reading frame, YOR119c), which codes for an essential, yet unknown function, is constitutively expressed. As regulatory factors, such as Gal4p, function in both orientations and at long distances, the question arises of why expression ofRIO1 is not influenced by Gal4p. Therefore, a mechanism must exist that ensures an individual mode of gene expression and that confines the regulatory action of the specific transactivator, Gal4p, to transcription of GCY1. We found two blocks of oligo(dA·dT) tracts 230 and 195 bp 5′ upstream of the initiation site of RIO1 in the intergenic region. These sequences are discussed as targets of datin, a protein possibly associated with the nuclear scaffold (12Winter E. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this case, such sequences could act as boundaries, i.e. they might act as repressors in such a manner that they prevent the effect of farther upstream binding transactivators on the expression of the respective gene. As theUAS GAL is located 5′ of the oligo(dA·dT) tracts with respect to the initiation site of RIO1, it appears feasible that the oligo(dA·dT) sequences prevent transmission of the Gal4p-dependent activation potential on the transcription of RIO1. On the other hand, these tracts are described as UAS elements for the expression of constitutive genes. Either the oligo(dA·dT) tracts exclude the assembly of nucleosomes by virtue of their stiff DNA structure (13Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8419-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) or T-rich element-binding factors stimulate transcription (15Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, these sequences could exert an activating function on the expression ofRIO1, particularly as they occur in conjunction with a presumptive Rap1p-binding site, a constellation which has been found to synergistically activate gene expression (16Rotenberg M.O. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 674-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The importance of these sequences was analyzed by deleting these blocks. The most obvious difference between both genes consists of the type of basal promoters: a consensus TATA box (TATAAA) occurs in the upstream region of GCY1, whereas such an element is absent from the promoter of RIO1. To test whether the basal promoter dictates the mode of gene expression, we changed the TATA element ofGCY1 to a nonconsensus sequence and introduced a consensus TATA box into the promoter region of RIO1. As soon as a consensus TATA element was present in the core promoter, the respective gene was transcribed under the control of Gal4p, whereas in its absence, gene expression was constitutive. These results imply that it depends on the type of basal promoter whether interactions between specific transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery are productive or not. pBluescript M13 KS (±) vectors (Stratagene, Heidelberg) were used in in vitro mutagenesis reactions in Escherichia coli strains CJ 236 (17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg), respectively. The intergenic region of GCY1 and RIO1 with N-terminal coding regions of both genes was ligated either as EcoRI-BamHI or as BamHI-EcoRI fragments (11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene. 1990; 90: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to the polylinker of pBluescript for in vitro mutagenesis. All constructs were then fused in the respective orientation to the bacterial lacZ gene of the low copy yeast expression vector pYLZ6 (19Hermann H. Häcker U. Bandlow W. Magdolen V. Gene. 1992; 119: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reporter gene lacked promoter and translational initiation codon. Analyses of gene expression were performed in the yeast strain W303–1A (18Crivellone M.D. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14323-14333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that had been transformed by the respective constructs (wild-type constructs: pGCY, and pRIO; mutant constructs: pGCY-TC(TATAGA), pRIO-TR(TATAAA), pRIOΔA, pRIOΔA∇U-TR, pRIOmut, pGCYmut, pRIO-SM, pRIO-BN, pGCY-SM, and pGCY-BN). Primer extension reactions ofRIO1 promoter-lacZ fusion constructs were performed using the multicopy yeast expression vector pYLZ2 (19Hermann H. Häcker U. Bandlow W. Magdolen V. Gene. 1992; 119: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) harboring the same wild-type and some of the mutant constructs as above (detailed in the legends). Site-specific in vitro mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel et al. (17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar, 20Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by restriction analysis and by nucleotide sequencing of the respective regions (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide 5′-GAATATAAAAATTG-3′ was used as a mutagenic primer to introduce a consensus TATA sequence into the RIO1 promoter. Oligonucleotide 5′-TGGGCGTATAGAACCGGG-3′ served to mutate the TATA box of GCY1. Restriction sites for enzymes producing compatible ends, flanking the TATA box of GCY1, and the TATA-resembling sequence of RIO1, respectively, were introduced into the intergenic region using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGCAGTAAAGAATTGCTTTACCCGGGCGTATAAAACCACGTGAATCAAGACATTC-3′, and 5′-GTCTTAGTATCTCATCTCATCGCGATTTCTATATTGGCCATAAAGTTTTTCACTC-3′. They contained restriction sites for the enzymes SmaI plus BbrPI and NruI plus MscI, respectively. By these means, the intergenic region could be inverted once including and once excluding the TATA sequence ofGCY1. A synthethicUAS GAL was inserted into the uniqueXhoI restriction site of the intergenic region ofGCY1 and RIO1. A HindII restriction site in this element then allowed the deletion of a 220-bp fragment containing the oligo(dA·dT) blocks and the presumptive Rap1p-binding site. Yeast cells in midlog phase were harvested, washed in water, and resuspended in RNA extraction buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5% SDS). 1 volume of glass beads (Braun, Melsungen) and 1 volume of phenol/chloroform were added, and the cells were vortexed (5 min). Glass beads were washed with 1 volume of RNA extraction buffer, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 5 min). After extracting the aqueous phase twice with phenol/chloroform, RNA and DNA were precipitated by ethanol (20,000 × g, 20 min). The RNA/DNA pellet was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mmTris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), LiCl added to a final concentration of 3.0 m, incubated on ice for 2–5 h, and RNA precipitated by centrifugation. Primer extensions were performed according to Maniatis et al. (22Chen E. Seeburg P.H. DNA. 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). 70–100 μg of total RNA was denatured in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 3.6 mNaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 2 units/μl RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim), and 50% formamide at 80 °C for 15 min and hybridized with 5′ radioactively labeled oligonucleotides (1–2 × 105 cpm) at 45 °C for 1.5 h and at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After precipitation of the annealed probe, reverse transcription was performed with reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer instructions. RNA was hydrolyzed in 0.09 mNaOH at 60 °C for 1 h. cDNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in TE buffer, and analyzed on denaturing sequencing gels; 5′-ends of the transcripts were identified by nucleotide sequencing (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) of the respective regions using the same oligonucleotides and running the reaction mixtures in adjacent lanes. Transcriptional start sites of GCY1 wildtype mRNA were determined using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGGATCCTGGGCTCCAGTAT-3′ (postion +40 to +64 of the N-terminal coding region ofGCY1), whereas the oligonucleotide 5′-GGATGTGCTGCAAGGCG-3′ (positions +139 to +155 of the N-terminal coding region of thelacZ gene) served to identify those of GCY1- orRIO1/lacZ hybrid RNA. The yeast expression vector pYLZ6 was used for determining the β-galactosidase activities of the respective promoter/lacZ fusion constructs (19Hermann H. Häcker U. Bandlow W. Magdolen V. Gene. 1992; 119: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in midlog phase and broken by vortexing with glass beads (Braun, Melsungen). β-Galactosidase assays were performed at 30 °C with ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) as substrate (23Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Activities are given as units per milligram of total protein. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol ONPG/min at 30 °C. All activity values have been corrected for background levels produced by the vector pYLZ6 (0.5–0.8 units/mg). Yeast transformations were performed as described by Keszenman-Pereyra and Hieda (24Keszenman-Pereyra D. Hieda K. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein contents were determined according to the method described by Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Other molecular methods were performed according to standard procedures (22Chen E. Seeburg P.H. DNA. 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) or as recommended by the manufacturer. The intergenic region of GCY1 and RIO1harbors several sequences which follow the consensus of variouscis-acting elements (Fig. 1). A UAS GAL is responsible for the galactose-induced expression of GCY1 (11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene. 1990; 90: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and 160 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation sites of GCY1(position −215, relative to the translational start codon), a functional binding site for the general regulatory protein, Reb1p, is found (26Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We show that the basal promoter of GCY1 contains a consensus TATA box, whereas RIO1 is a TATA-less gene. In the 5′-upstream region of RIO1, a presumptive Rap1p-binding site is located adjacent to two blocks of oligo(dA·dT) tracts. The promoter region of GCY1 contains a perfect match to the consensus TATA sequence TATAAA. To test functionality of this element, we changed this motif to the sequence “TATAGA” by site-directed mutagenesis. Promoter activities were determined using GCY1promoter/lacZ fusion constructs, i.e. pGCY (wild-type) and pGCY-TC (mutant promoter). This single base exchange affected basal as well as regulated transcription ofGCY1 and reduced expression to marginal levels (TableI). These results demonstrate that this motif functions as a TATA box and, in addition, that it is the sole basal element in this promoter and responsible for both basal and Gal4p-induced transcription. To confirm these results at the transcriptional level, we performed primer extensions with total RNA once from wild-type yeast and once from yeast transformants harboring pGCY. The initiation patterns of GCY1 mRNA andGCY1/lacZ hybrid mRNA were identical (not shown). The same transcriptional initiation sites were used for basal and regulated transcription, and all of them were used more frequently with galactose than with glucose as carbon source (Fig.2), verifying that both modes of transcription are directed by a single promoter element,i.e. the TATA element. This observation is in contrast to genes, like HIS3 or GAL80, where two promoter elements, TC and TR, have been found to mediate transcription initiation. However, only TR responds to transcriptional activators; accordingly, in the HIS3 andGAL80 promoters, different transcriptional start sites are used for basal or induced expression (4Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, these data imply that a consensus TATA box is required for regulated transcription. As soon as this sequence deviates from the consensus by just one base, expression of GCY1 is no longer inducible by galactose to a significant extent.Table IThe TATA box is the sole basal promoter element of GCY1Plasmidβ-Galactosidase activities in units/mgGlcGalGro/EtOHpGCY (TATAAA)13.7 ± 2.0338.0 ± 25.025.0 ± 2.1pGCY-TC (TATAGA)1.1 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.80.8 ± 0.1Values given represent the mean of activities derived from three to five independent yeast transformant clones; maximum deviations from the average are given.

To analyze the importance of the oligo(dA·dT) blocks and the presumptive Rap1p-binding site for the expression of RIO1 and simultaneously to examine the possibility that the unequal distances of the UAS GAL from the transcriptional start sites of both genes disfavor activation of RIO1 by Gal4p, we deleted these sequence blocks (pRIOΔA). β-Galactosidase activities were compared with RIO1 wild-type promoter-lacZfusion constructs (pRIO) (Table II). The deletion had no effect on expression of RIO1. Although the distance of the UAS GAL to the initiation sites of RIO1 was thereby decreased to 190 bp so that the Gal4p-binding site was closer to the transcriptional start site ofRIO1 than to those of GCY1, no significant influence of Gal4p on the expression of RIO1 was apparent. In this intergenic region, the dA·dT blocks obviously do not function as boundary sequences to restrict the effect of Gal4p to the promoter of GCY1. Furthermore, a concerted action of Rap1p and the dA·dT blocks as elements in transcriptional activation ofRIO1, under the conditions tested, can be excluded.Table IIIntroduction of a consensus TATA box into the RIO1 promoter leads to activation by Gal4pPlasmidβ-Galactosidase activities in units/mgTATAGATATAAA (TR)GlcGalGro/EtOHGlcGalGro/EtOHpRIO1.62.91.33.914.63.9pRIOΔA1.73.21.74.635.26.0pRIOΔA∇U1.79.31.83.9371.06.7Values given represent the mean of activities derived from three to five independent yeast transformant clones; maximum deviations from the average were 10–20%.

The basal promoter elements of GCY1 andRIO1 differ from one another in that GCY1 excels by having a consensus TATA box, whereas such a sequence is absent from the upstream region of RIO1. Only a related sequence, TATAGA, occurs, which was shown by deletion analyses to be non-functional (data not shown). We tested whether it is possible to bring transcription of RIO1 under the control of Gal4p by introducing a consensus TATA motif into the promoter region ofRIO1 and changed the above sequence by site-directed single base substitution to TATAAA (pRIO-TR) (Fig.3, A-C). The activities of theRIO1 promoter-lacZ fusion construct pRIO-TR exhibited an induction by galactose as carbon source by a factor of about 4. This value seemed to be moderate compared with the induced expression of GCY1 by galactose (factor of 25 compared with growth on glucose). Considering the distances between the UAS GAL and basal promoter elements, we found that this UAS is more than 100 bp farther away from the transcriptional start site of RIO1 than from those of GCY1. We deleted the oligo(dA·dT) blocks-containing fragment (220 bp) from the intergenic region (Fig.3 B). Although this deletion had no effect on expression from the TATA-less RIO1 promoter (compare pRIO with pRIOΔA), the TATA-containing RIO1 promoter (pRIOΔA-TR) was induced by galactose by a factor of nearly 8 (compare pRIOΔA-TR on glucose with galactose, Table II). This shows that the UAS GAL is, in fact, subject to an evident positional effect. Surprisingly, the inducibility ofRIO1 by galactose increased further to 95-fold (i.e. 12.3-fold over the construct pRIOΔA-TR) after introducing a second UAS GAL(pRIOΔA▿U-TR), indicating synergism of bothUAS GALs (Fig. 3 C). Expression ofGCY1, however, was not influenced by the insertion of an additional UAS GAL. The latter oberservation conforms with results showing that a secondUAS GAL does not influence the inducibility of a gene significantly that, by nature, already has one such element,e.g. GAL80 or MEL1 (28Bram R.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Introduction of a consensus TATA box into the promoter ofRIO1 created an additional basal promoter element. Therefore, it was not surprising that basal expression ofRIO1 was increased by a factor of 2.4 as well. These results indicate that a canonic TATA sequence alleviates the rate-limiting step in transcription relative to a TATA-less promoter. It remains to be shown whether assembly of the transcriptional initiation complex, transcriptional (re-)initiation or promoter escape is affected. Increase of mRNA synthesis due to the introduction of a consensus TATA box was corroborated by primer extension reactions performed with total RNA of the respective yeast transformants. The natural transcriptional start site of RIO1 (Fig.4 A) could not be detected after exposure times that allowed identification of six initiation sites of transcription started from the consensus TATA box (Fig.4 B). In the mutated TATA-containing RIO1 promoter (pRIO-TR) the same initiation sites were used for basal as well as for regulated transcription, indicating that both modes of expression were mediated by the TATA box. No change in the pattern of initiation sites was observed when the oligo(dA·dT) tracts were deleted and a second UAS GAL was introduced (Fig.4 C). The above results indicated that the basal transcription complex that recognizes a consensus TATA box constitutes an operative unit with regulatory transactivators and, thus, allows regulated gene expression. On the other hand, no productive interaction is established between specific transcription factors and the general transcription machinery that assembles on basal promoters that lack such a sequence. To corroborate the data obtained above, we introduced restriction sites into the intergenic region in the flanks of the promoter regions of both genes (GCYmut, RIOmut) in such a manner that we could invert the control region, once including the TATA box ofGCY1 (GCY-BN, RIO-BN) and once excluding this sequence (GCY-SM, RIO-SM) (Fig. 5). By these means, we were able to eliminate positional effects of basal promoters and upstream activating factors on the one hand, and on the other hand, we could analyze the importance of the constellation between transactivator and the type of basal promoter. β-galactosidase activities of both promoter-lacZ fusion constructs decreased by about one-half of the wild-type activities by introducing the restriction sites (pGCYmut, pRIOmut) (TableIII). Nevertheless, the mode of regulated or constitutive transcription remained unaffected for both genes. When the intergenic region was inverted excluding the TATA-sequence ofGCY1, the mode of gene expression remained essentially the same as in the original constellation (pGCY-SM, pRIO-SM).GCY1 was still inducible by galactose though to a lesser extent as in the wild-type promoter. These results confirm that the dA·dT blocks, which are promoter-proximal in this construct, do not delimit the activation potential of Gal4p. RIO1, however, continued to be expressed constitutively, although theUAS GAL was then closer to the initiation site ofRIO1 than to the transcriptional start sites ofGCY1.Table IIIβ-Galactosidase activities of GCY1- and RIO1/lacZ fusions after inversion of the intergenic regionConstructβ-Galactosidase activities in units/mgGCY/lacZRIO/lacZGlcGalGro/EtOHGlcGalGro/EtOHWtmut3-aRespective promoters after introduction of restriction sites (pgCYmut, pRIOmut).4.6161.37.60.81.31.0SM3-bInversion of the intergenic region excluding the TATA motif of GCY1 (pGCY-SM, pRIO-SM).6.947.68.90.92.32.3BN3-cInversion of the intergenic region including the TATA element (pGCY-BN, pRIO-BN); see also Fig. 5.1.12.91.26.768.312.9Values given represent the mean of activities derived from three to five independent yeast transformant clones; maximum deviations from the average were 10–20%.

Glc, glucose; Gal, galactose; Gro/EtOH, glycerol/ethanol. As soon as the intergenic region was inverted, including the TATA-sequence, the mode of gene expression changed. mRNA synthesis of GCY1 was no longer inducible by galactose, whereas transcription of RIO1 was regulated by Gal4p (pGCY-BN, pRIO-BN). In the construct pRIO-BN, the same initiation sites were used as in the point mutation construct pRIO-TR (Fig.6). These findings suggest that the basal transcription complex that assembles on a consensus TATA box and specific regulator proteins are able to build up a compatible unit, and as a result, expression of the respective gene is under regulated control. In contrast, if a promoter lacks such a motif, no productive interactions of basal transcription factors with a specific transactivator seem to occur. Above experiments demonstrate that individual gene expression in yeast is guaranteed by the type of basal promoters despite short intergenic regions. One type of promoter is concerned with regulated transcription, whereas the other one directs constitutive expression independent of an upstream located UAS. Regulated transcription seems to depend on a consensus TATA element. Comparison with other Gal4p regulated genes shows that GAL1,GAL2, GAL3, GAL7, and GAL80have bona fide TATA sequences that obey the consensus TATAAA or TATATA and are positioned between 50 and 140 bp 5′ of the most distal transcriptional initiation site. Surprisingly, GAL10, although transcription is strongly inducible by galactose, dispenses with a canonic TATA box. Rather, non-canonic sequences, TATTAA or TATAAG, are present (29Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 30Yocum R.R. Hanley S. West R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1984-1998Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Possibly, one or both of these sequences function as a weak TATA element, whereas TATAGA found in the 5′-flank of the RIO1 promoter does not. Weak interactions of TBP with nonconventional TATA elements may be stabilized by additional interactions with promoter sequences or with basic transcription factors (31Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 32Struhl K. Cell. 1996; 84: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These considerations are, however, hampered by the fact that functional tests of core promoter elements are lacking in most instances. Transcription analysis of RIO1 has revealed that a TATA box is absent from the RIO1 promoter. In agreement with the above hypothesis, we have furthermore shown that transcription of this gene is not significantly influenced by Gal4p, even if the region containing the presumptive Rap1p-binding site and the oligo(dA·dT) tracts are deleted, thereby decreasing the distance of theUAS GAL to the initiation sites ofRIO1. This indicates that interactions between the transcription machinery, which binds to core promoters lacking a consensus TATA element, and specific transactivators are much weaker than those established between the basal transcription complex recruited to a consensus TATA motif and specific regulatory DNA-binding proteins, such as Gal4p. Binding of TBP/TFIID to a TATA-less promoter could be too transient to allow response to specific transactivators (9Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Mutation of the consensus TATA box of the GCY1 gene does not abolish the inducibility by galactose completely, but the decrease of induction by this carbon source is drastic, confirming the above conclusion. In addition, these results demonstrate that the TATA box is functional and most likely the sole core promoter element ofGCY1. Usage of the same initiation sites for basal as well as for induced expression verifies that the TATA element is responsible for both modes of expression. This points to the existence of two different control mechanisms in yeast; the basal expression of some genes, such as HIS3 and GAL80, seems to be directed by a basal promoter element that is distinct from the one responding to regulated transcription (4Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, other genes like GCY1 harbor just one cis-acting element in their core promoter, the TATA element, which mediates basal as well as regulated transcription. Possibly, there are several classes of basal transcription factors, some of which recognize promoter elements that confer only basal transcription, and the other class binds to a consensus TATA box and directs basal expression from this site as long as a specific transactivator is absent from upstream binding sites or is blocked by the binding of a repressor. Recent data imply that, besides their role as coactivators, TAFs may act as core promoter recognition factors as well. Together with TBP these proteins constitute distinct TFIID complexes that assemble on different types of core promoter elements (33Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We have shown that expression of RIO1 becomes inducible by galactose by introducing a consensus TATA box. Thereby, it is unimportant whether this sequence is introduced by a point mutation or is posed there by inversion of the intergenic region. In both cases, the same initiation sites are used. These transcriptional start sites are used more frequently than the initiation site of the constitutive wild-type promoter. In contrast, when the intergenic region is inverted excluding the TATA sequence, the mode of expression is principally maintained, i.e. expression of GCY1 is still controlled by Gal4p, whereas transcription of RIO1 remains constitutive. These results suggest that the type of basal promoter determines whether interactions between specific transactivators and the general transcription machinery are productive or not. In the case of a consensus TATA element, the basal transcription factors are able to interact with regulatory factors, and as a consequence, the respective gene is expressed in a regulated way. In contrast, basal transcription complexes that assemble on TATA-less promoters cannot respond to the signals of an upstream-binding transactivator. Apparently, only one TATA-binding protein exists in yeast and binds to promoters that contain a conventional TATA motif as well as to promoters that lack such a sequence (8Hahn S. Buratowski S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). But data accumulate, suggesting that different preinitiation complexes exist. Different TAFs are required to support transcription mediated by distinct specific transactivators in vitro (34Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, two types of TFIID complexes were found: D-TFIID, which is responsive to specific transactivators, and B-TFIID, which does not respond to regulatory proteins (35Timmers H.T.M. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that distinct general transcription complexes exist in yeast as well (36Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 37Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The existence of complexes of TBP with different subsets of TAFs, dependent on the type or context of the promoter, could provide an explanation for the fact that some basal promoters (e.g. that ofGCY1) respond to specific transactivators, whereas others (e.g. that of RIO1) do not. This could mean that some TAFs transmit the effect of specific transactivators to the general transcription machinery that assembles on promoters containing a consensus TATA box, whereas a different subset of TAFs is responsible for transcriptional initiation on promoters lacking a TATA element. However, recent results imply that, in vivo, TAFs might not be generally required for transcriptional activation (31Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 39Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mediator complex, a component of the RNA-polymerase II holoenzyme, which is indispensable for regulated gene expression, might serve as coactivator (40Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 41Kim Y. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). For instance, Gal11p, a component of the mediator, is essential for regulated expression ofGAL80, but not required for initiator-dependent constitutive transcription of this gene (42Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 39: 113-119Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mechanism that distinguishes between TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters remains to be elucidated.

To define the subcellular localization and relative abundance of cAMP, we developed a novel immunochemical approach based on acrolein fixation to visualize cAMP within cells. We describe here the fixation and immobilization of cAMP within cells and the production of specific, high titer polyclonal antibodies that recognize cAMP. Relative levels of cAMP immunofluorescence were quantitated in glial cells (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and glioma cells) that were either untreated or treated with activators of endogenous adenylyl cyclase to raise cAMP levels. In treated cells, cAMP immunofluorescence is strongly localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm.

In treated cells, cAMP immunofluorescence is strongly localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm. Many signals that regulate the growth, development, and metabolism in cells use cAMP as a second messenger (1Iyengar R. Science. 1996; 271: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Neurotransmitters, growth factors, and hormones signal to appropriate receptors, causing either the stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through intermediate guanyl nucleotide regulatory proteins. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which acts by binding to protein kinase A (PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; FSK, forskolin; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.) and causing the release of activated catalytic subunits, or by binding and activating cAMP-gated ion channels (3Zufall F.

Activated PKA regulates the function of pre-existing cellular proteins by selective phosphorylation and also regulates the synthesis of new cellular proteins by phosphorylating and altering the activity of transcription factors (7Beebe S.J.

In the oligodendrocyte, the myelinating cell of the central nervous system, cAMP is thought to play independent roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Precursor cells, which are mobile and proliferative, exit the cell cycle upon exposure to cAMP analogs (10Raible D.W. McMorris F.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In oligodendrocyte-lineage cells that are differentiating, exposure to cAMP analogs or activators of adenylyl cyclase increases the rate of differentiation (11Raible D.W. McMorris F.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Raible D.W. McMorris F.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whereas experimentally induced cAMP can have potent regulatory effects in these processes, the role of cAMP in normal oligodendrocyte development is not well understood. Cyclic AMP has similar effects in the peripheral myelinating glia, Schwann cells (13Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Morgan L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 633: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and it is thought that axonal contact causes an elevation in cAMP, inducing proliferation and differentiation (14Ratner N. Glaser L. Bunge R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many questions remain about how cAMP relays signals, due in part to technical limitations that have prevented determination of the subcellular distribution of cAMP or comparison of cAMP levels between single cells. Homogeneous populations of cells may vary in their cAMP content from cell to cell, and conventional assays of cAMP extracted from homogenates of such a population generate a simple average level for the set (15Horton J.K. Baxendale P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 41: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar). These assay procedures also mask any useful information about cell-specific changes in cAMP levels in the heterogeneous environments of tissue or cell culture. Finally, there have been no methods for accurately measuring free cAMP levels within the local environment of a single cell. It is quite possible that differential cAMP elevation occurs in different regions of the cell,e.g. the soma versus the processes of neuronal cells. Such information may be invaluable in deciphering the role of cAMP in cellular regulation. Although antibodies against cAMP have been available for over two decades, they have not proven useful for cell staining, because conventional fixation techniques using formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde form unstable cross-linked products between cAMP and intracellular proteins so that cAMP is lost from the cell (16Steiner A.L. Parker C.W. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1106-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17De Vente J. Steinbusch H.W. Schipper J. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Rall T.W. Lehne R.A. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1982; 8: 243-265PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed methodology based on previous findings (19De Vente J. Schipper J. Steinbusch H.W. Histochemistry. 1993; 99: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that enables immobilization of cAMP by cross-linking it to intracellular proteins while fixing the cell or tissue with acrolein, an unsaturated aldehyde that forms a stable covalent bond between cAMP and proteins when used in the presence of acidic buffers (19De Vente J. Schipper J. Steinbusch H.W. Histochemistry. 1993; 99: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 20King J.C. Lechan R.M. Kugel G. Anthony E.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP can be linked to a carrier protein with acrolein, and this conjugate can be used as an immunogen for antibody production. We generated polyclonal antibodies that recognize acrolein-derivatized cAMP at a high titer and specificity on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screens. Use of this antiserum to stain a variety of cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and glioma cells) revealed significant differences between untreated cultures and cells treated with forskolin (FSK), cholera toxin, and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) to elevate intracellular cAMP levels. Our results demonstrate that cAMP can be reliably visualized and quantitated by this methodology. Anti-cAMP polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against cAMP (sodium salt, Sigma) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Sigma). Briefly, 25 mm cAMP was incubated with KLH (30 mg) in 30 ml of 1% acrolein (v/v) in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.75 (acetate buffer) for 4 h at room temperature. Glycine (600 mg) was added for 30 min to quench the reaction and react with free acrolein, followed by 400 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma) for 30 min to reduce double-bonded oxygen and nitrogen, completing cross-linking reactions (21Peter M.E. Hall C. Ruhlmann A. Sancho J. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This solution was dialyzed overnight against three changes of distilled water at 4 °C, frozen and lyophilized. The lyophilized product was white, with a light, spongy consistency. Coupling efficiency of cAMP to KLH by this reaction was 2.5% as determined by quantitating the incorporation of a trace amount (5 μCi) of [3H]cAMP (Amersham) added to the reaction. To optimize immunization with the cAMP-KLH conjugate, two series of rabbits were pretested to identify an appropriate adjuvant and to determine an optimal immunization schedule that avoids nonspecific cross-reactivity to cAMP. In both series, tyrosylarginine (Kyotorphin, Sigma), which is similar to cAMP in molecular weight and in structure, containing an unsaturated ring structure and both primary and secondary amine groups, was conjugated to KLH and used as antigen. Antigens were presented in Freund's complete, TiterMax (Cytex), or aluminum hydroxide adjuvants. TiterMax produced the most robust response, and immunization could be carried out to five boosts before cAMP nonspecific reactivity was detected. To generate anti-cAMP antibodies, rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 500 mg of cAMP hapten-carrier conjugate emulsified in 0.5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of TiterMax adjuvant and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Boosts were given with 200 mg conjugate in 0.5 ml TiterMax/PBS at 21 days, and then every 14 days for a total of four boosts. Blood samples were analyzed at day 14, and then 10 days after each boost. Comparison to control immunizations with a non-cAMP acrolein conjugate and several different adjuvants showed that this regimen produced a robust immune response without raising nonspecific cAMP reactivity. Antiserum (5 ml) was mixed with cAMP (5 ml) linked to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose (C-8 attachment, Sigma) for 48 h at 4 °C with rotation. The agarose was transferred to a 2.5-cm column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 100 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), followed by 100 ml of 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The anti-cAMP antibodies bound through acid-sensitive interactions were eluted with two 45-ml washes of 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5). Samples were collected in separate 50-ml polypropylene tubes containing 5 ml of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to neutralize the pH, and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) until the eluate pH was 8.8. Antibodies bound to the column by base-sensitive interactions were eluted by passing two 45-ml washes of 100 mmtriethanolamine (pH 11.5) over the column, and collecting the eluate in separate 50-ml polypropylene tubes containing 5 ml of 1 mTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The eluant was concentrated by centrifugal microconcentration (Amicon) and brought to the original starting volume with PBS. Antibody was stored at −80 °C in aliquots after addition of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide. Antiserum titer and specificity were evaluated using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ovalbumin (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) was used to coat 96-well micro-ELISA plates (Nunc) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (50 μl/well) at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing three times with 100 μl/well of 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) in PBS (T-PBS), wells were incubated with 25 μl of acetate buffer and 25 μl of 2% acrolein (control), or with 25 μl of 20 mm cAMP in acetate buffer and 25 μl of 2% acrolein for 1 h at room temperature to conjugate cAMP to the adherent ovalbumin. The contents of the wells were then discarded, and 50 μl of 1% glycine (w/v) in acetate buffer was added to the wells for 30 min. This solution was removed, and 50 μl of 1% NaCNBH3 (w/v) in acetate buffer was added for 30 min. Wells were rinsed three times with T-PBS (100 μl/well) and incubated with anti-cAMP antibody diluted in 0.5% gelatin (w/v), 0.5% Tween-20 (Sigma) in PBS. After 1 h at 37 °C, the plate was rinsed with T-PBS three times, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400 dilution, Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C. These antibodies were removed, the plates washed with T-PBS, and color was developed by incubating wells with 50 μl of peroxidase substrate solution (1 vol of 0.182 mm2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonate), 1 vol of 0.09% hydrogen peroxide, in 0.1 m citric acid, 0.2 msodium phosphate, pH 5.2) for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m sulfuric acid, and absorbance was read at 490 nm. For competition assays, diluted antiserum was incubated with the appropriate competitor (1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C, and this solution was added to the ELISA plate and tested. Cloned C6 rat glioma cells (22Benda P. Lightbody J. Sato G. Levine L. Sweet W. Science. 1968; 161: 370-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were used for the characterization of antibody staining. Cells were grown in oligodendroglial cell medium-5 (OM-5) (11Raible D.W. McMorris F.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that contains 10% fetal bovine serum. Schwann cells were isolated from 3-day-old rat pups as described (23Scherer S.S. Wang D.Y. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Wrabetz L. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1930-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), explanted onto glass coverslips, and grown for 1 week. To elevate cAMP levels, cells were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with forskolin (Sigma) to directly activate endogenous adenylyl cyclase activity and with isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma) to inhibit endogenous cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity. Concentrations are indicated in the individual experiments. Primary glial cell cultures were isolated from dissociated postnatal day 1 rat cerebra as described (24McMorris F.A. Smith T.M. DeSalvo S. Furlanetto R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Such cultures contain mixed glial cell populations, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglial cells. Mixed glial cultures were grown in OM-5 medium at 37 °C for 5 days, and enriched for oligodendrocytes by differential shakeoff (25McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar). These cells were inoculated onto 16-well polylysine-coated culture slides (Lab Disposable Products) and grown in OM-5 an additional day at 37 °C. Cholera toxin (List Biological Laboratories), FSK, and IBMX were added for 30 min at 37 °C to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. Astrocyte-enriched cultures were generated from primary glial cell cultures by inoculating 4-fold fewer cells (per ml and per cm2) into culture vessels (26McMorris F.A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Astrocyte cultures were grown for 7–14 days, trypsinized and replated in OM-5 onto 16-well polylysine-coated culture slides, and grown an additional day at 37 °C. Astrocytes were treated with FSK and IBMX to elevate cAMP. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing antigens expressed during specific oligodendrocyte developmental stages were prepared as tissue culture supernatants from hybridoma cells. Antibody to the O4 antigen, which recognizes oligodendrocytes and intermediate-stage oligodendrocyte precursors (27Sommer I. Schachner M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), was used to identify oligodendroglial cells in mixed glial cell cultures. Schwann cell identity was confirmed by the expression of P0 protein (28Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. Semin. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 423-435Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in a 5.5% (v/v) acrolein, 0.1 m acetate buffer solution for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were removed from the fixation solution and quenched in 1% glycine in acetate buffer for 30 min and then placed in 1% NaCNBH3 in acetate buffer for a final 30 min. Anti-cAMP antibody was serially diluted 5–1000-fold in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 m NaCl, with 0.5% goat serum (v/v), and 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v). Slides were incubated with the antiserum overnight at 4 °C, followed by 1 h incubations with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled avidin (1:100, Sigma) both at 37 °C. Because acrolein fixation disrupted the antigenicity of lipid epitopes recognized by diagnostic marker antibodies for oligodendrocyte developmental stages (e.g. O4), live cells were preincubated with antibody for 30 min at 37 °C before fixation to stain primary oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell cultures with antibodies to lipid antigens. Such treatment did not alter cAMP content in cells (data not shown). Fixation and cAMP staining were carried out as described for C6 glioma cells. Primary oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell markers were subsequently stained with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain specific). In experiments where cells were treated to elevate cAMP, stimulants were mixed with the marker antibody solution for presentation to the cells. Nucleotides were extracted from cells by perchloric acid extraction (29McMorris F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP and guanine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) in the extract were quantitated by an acetylcholinesterase-based ELISA according to manufacturer's procedures (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Protein abundance was determined using a modified Lowry assay, according to the manufacturer's procedures (Bio-Rad). The cGMP content of C6 cells was elevated by activating endogenous guanylate cyclase with the addition of 100 μm sodium nitroprusside (Sigma) and 5 mm N-acetylcysteine (Sigma) in OM-5 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Sodium nitroprusside spontaneously releases nitric oxide (30Bates J.N. Baker M.T. Guerra Jr., R. Harrison D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: S157-S165Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), which activates intracellular soluble guanylate cyclase (31Lad P.J. Liebel M.A. White A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). N-acetylcysteine forms anS-nitrosothiol adduct with nitric oxide increasing its bioavailability (32Ignarro L.J. Lippton H. Edwards J.C. Baricos W.H. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J. Gruetter C.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 218: 739-749PubMed Google Scholar). Conventional fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon Microphot-FXA fluorescence microscope and printed on a Sony color video Mavigraph printer. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained using a Leica confocal microscopy unit. Image analysis and fluorescence quantitation were performed on a Macintosh Performa 5200CD computer using the public domain NIH Image program (available on the Internet athttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). To compare immunofluorescence staining intensities among cells of different sizes and shapes, single optical sections (0.7 μm) were taken at a level that included the nucleus of the cell. Using NIH Image, four uniform sections (4.62 μm2) were sampled from either nuclear, perinuclear cytoplasmic (within 5 μm from the nucleus), peripheral cytoplasmic (more than 5 μm from the nucleus), or process regions of each cell. The mean pixel intensities for each of the four boxes for a given region were averaged to generate a mean value for each region of the cell. To calculate staining intensity per region, mean values for each cell region for individual cells were averaged over at least 20 cells. Bleaching of cAMP immunofluorescence was found to be negligible when cells were scanned repeated times. A large effort has been devoted to developing methods to visualize, localize, and quantitate the intermediates involved in signal transduction. For protein intermediates, antibody generation has been straightforward and successful. In calcium biology, efforts have also been quite fruitful, and it is now possible to dynamically image small rapid changes in concentrations over time using calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes (33Bolsover S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 627-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 34Diliberto P.A. Wang X.F. Herman B. Methods Cell. Biol. 1994; 40: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Tsien R.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C723-C728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a novel fixation procedure with the aldehyde acrolein, we have developed an antiserum that successfully detects cAMP immunoreactivity. Unpurified antiserum showed high reactivity toward cAMP cross-linked to protein but also showed significant reactivity toward acrolein-modified protein alone. However, following a single affinity purification step using cAMP bound to an agarose support, 98% of all nonspecific immunoreactivity to acrolein-derivatized protein was lost, whereas most of the reactivity toward cAMP was recovered (Fig.1). ELISA screen of serially diluted antiserum indicated that anti-cAMP antiserum was high titer recognizing cAMP bound to ovalbumin at dilutions of 50,000 and greater (Fig. 2 A). Antibody titer was also tested in cell staining where dilutions as high as 1:1000 gave significant staining in astrocytes treated for 30 min with FSK and IBMX to elevate cAMP (Fig. 2 B). All dilutions between 10- and 1000-fold yielded significantly more staining in treated cultures than in untreated controls (Fig. 2 B). To test the specificity of the antiserum for cAMP, antibody was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm concentrations of various competitors prior to addition of the antibody to ELISA wells. ATP, ADP, AMP, 2′:3′-cAMP, adenosine, and CMP did not compete with the anti-cAMP antibody (Fig.3 A), suggesting that the antigenic determinant recognized by the antiserum does not include the adenosine group of the molecule but that the 3′:5′-cyclic moiety is necessary for antibody binding. Cross-reactivity toward cGMP was detected. When the anti-cAMP antibody was incubated with serial dilutions of cAMP and cGMP, cAMP was found to compete more effectively (Fig. 3 B), reducing absorbance by 50% at 16 μm, whereas 36 μm cGMP was required for a similar reduction in absorbance. In the cAMP and cGMP molecules, the most probable reactive regions in the acrolein cross-linkage are the 1-nitrogen group and the amino group attached to the 6-carbon on the purine structure. These regions would be bound to protein during the fixation process, leaving the ribose group of both molecules facing away from the protein. It is likely that antibodies recognize this ribose 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate portion of both molecules, consistent with the inability of the antiserum to recognize adenosine or any other adenosine nucleotide, including adenosine 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate, which differs only in the phosphate moiety. Normal endogenous cellular cAMP levels vary from 5–20 pmol/mg of protein under basal conditions to 100–1000 pmol/mg of protein under treated conditions, whereas cGMP is present at much lower concentrations from basal levels of 0.1–0.3 pmol/mg of protein to stimulated levels of up to 10 pmol/mg of protein (36Villegas S. Brunton L.L. Anal. Chem. 1996; 235: 102-103Google Scholar). To determine whether cGMP cross-reactivity interferes with cell staining, C6 cells were treated with 100 μm sodium nitroprusside and 5 mm N-acetylcysteine to activate endogenous intracellular soluble guanylate cyclase and thus elevate cGMP levels (31Lad P.J. Liebel M.A. White A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ELISA of cGMP in treated cultures showed a 6.6-fold elevation over basal cGMP levels (Fig.4 A), which corresponds well to previously reported maximal values for cGMP in C6 cells (37Simmons M.L. Murphy S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). When these treated cells were immunostained with anti-cAMP antibody, there was no significant difference in immunofluorescence over control untreated cells (Fig. 4 B, p = 0.66). By contrast, treatment with 10 μm FSK and 1 mmIBMX to elevate cAMP resulted in a 3.2-fold elevation of cAMP determined biochemically (Fig. 4 A) and a 2.5-fold increase in immunofluorescence staining intensity (Fig. 4 B). Maximally stimulated cGMP levels are significantly lower than even basal cAMP levels in the cell. Thus, cross-reactivity with cGMP interferes negligibly with the determination of cellular cAMP content by this method. Cell fixation and staining procedures were optimized using astrocytes, and cAMP-specific immunofluorescence was imaged and quantitated by confocal microscopy. Cells were treated with 10 μm FSK and 1 mm IBMX for 30 min and fixed with acrolein concentrations between 1 and 8% (v/v); 5.5% acrolein yielded optimal immunofluorescence staining intensity (data not shown). Analysis of fixation times between 15 min and 1 h, indicated similar immunofluorescence staining intensity at all intervals (data not shown). We used 5.5% acrolein and 30 min as our standard fixation conditions. Astrocytes were stained for cAMP immunofluorescence in both basal and treated conditions (Fig. 5). Basal cAMP staining intensity was weak but significantly greater (p < 0.001) than controls in which primary antibody to cAMP had been omitted (Figs. 5, B and F, and 6). The cAMP staining of cytoplasm in untreated cells was slightly more apparent than the nuclei (Figs.5 F and 6), and the staining appeared to be uniformly dispersed (Fig. 5 F).Figure 6Quantitation of immunofluorescence staining in astrocytes. Mean fluorescence intensities from each cellular region (nuclear, perinuclear cytoplasmic, or peripheral cytoplasmic) from 20 cells in each condition (untreated and treated) were quantitated using image analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error bars indicate S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Astrocytes treated with 8 μm FSK, 1 mm IBMX show a marked increase in cytoplasmic cAMP immunofluorescence over basal cAMP levels (Figs. 5 L and 6). The majority of the immunofluorescence staining in treated cells was perinuclear (Fig.5 L), although in cells that were most intensely immunoreactive, the staining was uniform throughout the cytoplasm (not shown). Quantitative measurements taken in areas of the perinuclear region showed a 8.0-fold increase in treated cells in staining over basal unstimulated staining of the same region (Fig. 6). This immunoreactivity was completely blocked by pre-incubating the antiserum with 1 mm cAMP for 30 min at 37 °C prior to staining (Fig. 5 J). In treated cells, nuclear cAMP staining was 4.3-fold more intense than in untreated cells (Fig. 6). Conventional fluorescence microscopy of Schwann cell cultures treated with FSK and IBMX revealed strong cAMP immunofluorescence in treated cells (Fig. 7 D), whereas untreated cells stained weakly (Fig. 7 B). Untreated primary oligodendrocyte-enriched cultures were fixed and double-stained with antibodies to cAMP and to the O4 antigen, which marks intermediate oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Like untreated astrocytes, the untreated O4-positive cells exhibited low intensity nuclear staining with faint cytoplasmic staining (Fig.8 F) localized primarily in the cell body and was less intense in the processes (Figs. 8 Fand 9). Upon stimulation with 2 μm FSK, 250 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 1 mmIBMX, O4-positive cells dramatically increased cAMP immunoreactivity (Figs. 8 L and 9). Again, the greatest increase in staining occurred in the perinuclear region and spread outward toward the processes. Perinuclear staining was increased 8.3-fold on average compared with untreated O4-positive cell staining (Fig. 9). Nuclear staining and an unusual punctate pattern of cytoplasmic staining was seen in a subpopulation of treated cells from oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cultures. These patterns may reflect the presence of type II PKA, which contains the cAMP-binding RII regulatory subunit, and is associated with plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, and nuclear membrane (38Zhang Q.

Successful presentation of cAMP to an immune system has involved conjugation to a large antigenic protein which elicits a host immune response (16Steiner A.L. Parker C.W. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1106-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In prior studies, cAMP was cross-linked to protein by the addition of an acetyl- or succinyl-reactive group to the 2′ hydroxyl on the ribose (40Harper J.F. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cailla H.L. Racine-Weisbuch M.S. Delaage M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In a second step, this reactive group was covalently linked to protein carboxyl groups with ethylene dicarbamide. Cyclic AMP protein conjugates were generated with these reactions and used to produce antiserum toward the derivatized cAMP molecule. Indeed, numerous biochemical ELISA kits for cAMP have been developed based on this technique and the antibodies used recognize acetyl- or succinyl-derivatized cAMP with high sensitivity. However, antibody recognition of unmodified cAMP such as naturally occurring cAMP in cells is dramatically lower (42Pradelles P. Grassi J. Chabardes D. Guiso N. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Previous approaches to cAMP immunohistochemistry have also suffered from the ineffective immobilization of cAMP within the cell, resulting in its loss during processing (17De Vente J. Steinbusch H.W. Schipper J. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 43Cumming R. Dickison S. Arbuthnott G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 54-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Steiner A.L. Ong S.H. Wedner H.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1976; 7: 115-155PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kapoor C.L. Steiner A.L. Kebabian J.W. Nathanson J.A. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1982: 333-354Google Scholar). Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde fixatives produce unstable adducts between cAMP and cellular proteins and thus do not effectively immobilize cAMP. Microwave irradiation has also been used for fixation of cAMP within the cell (46Barsony J. Marx S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1188-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but this procedure has proven difficult to replicate. With all of these methods, free cAMP in the cell is washed away during fixation (17De Vente J. Steinbusch H.W. Schipper J. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 43Cumming R. Dickison S. Arbuthnott G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 54-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Steiner A.L. Ong S.H. Wedner H.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1976; 7: 115-155PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kapoor C.L. Steiner A.L. Kebabian J.W. Nathanson J.A. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1982: 333-354Google Scholar) and any detectable immunoreactivity is likely due to cAMP that was bound to protein (e.g. PKA) at the time of fixation (44Steiner A.L. Ong S.H. Wedner H.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1976; 7: 115-155PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kapoor C.L. Steiner A.L. Kebabian J.W. Nathanson J.A. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1982: 333-354Google Scholar). Thus, accurate measurement of total cellular cAMP requires that it be locked into the cell before or during the fixation procedure as achieved by acrolein fixation. Another approach to the imaging of cAMP within cells involves microinjection of PKA conjugated with fluorescein on the catalytic subunit and rhodamine on the regulatory subunit (47Adams S.R. Harootunian A.T. Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Because of the different fluorescence energy transfer characteristics of the derivatized PKA in the cAMP-bound and free forms, it acts essentially as a cAMP-sensitive dye (47Adams S.R. Harootunian A.T. Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The method allows analysis of changes in cAMP content with time in the same cell, but because the signal depends on the amount of PKA microinjected into the cell as well as the amount of endogenous PKA, it is not as useful for the comparison of cAMP content in different cells. This method also relies on the laborious microinjection of individual cells and the use of specialized equipment for spectral analysis of emitted light. Our method is much less laborious and allows comparison of different cells. The ability to monitor total cAMP levels in single cells will help to elucidate many longstanding questions in the biology of signal transduction. The immunochemical approach presented here provides a rapid and convenient method to address these questions.

Here, we demonstrate that anti-NKR-P1 enhances GTP binding in rat interleukin-2-activated NK cell membranes; GTP binding to Gi3α, Gsα, Gq,11α, and Gzα increased noticeably in these cell membranes after treatment with anti-NKR-P1.

These cells recognize the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on target cells, resulting in either inhibition or activation of their cytolytic potential (4Raulet D.H.

Target cell recognition by rodent NK cells involves C-type lectin proteins, such as NKR-P1 and Ly 49, that are expressed preferentially on NK cells (8Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Three homologous NKR-P1 genes have been identified both in mice and rats and are designated as NKR-P1 (A, B, and C) (9Yokoyama W.M. Ryan J.C. Hunter J.J. Smith H.R.C. Stark M. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3229-3236PubMed Google Scholar, 10Giorda R. Rudent W.A. Vavassori C. Chambers W.H. Hiserodt J.C. Trucco M.

In human NK cells, NKR-P1A has about 46% homology to the rodent NKR-P1 molecules (14Lanier L.L. Chang C. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2417-2428PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-NKR-P1 monoclonal antibody (3.2.3) reacts with rat NKR-P1 members and induces the production of IP3, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the secretion of interferon-γ, and the degranulation and cytotoxicity of NK cells (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chambers W.H. Vujanovic N.L. DeLeo A.B. Olszowy M.W. Herberman R.B. Hiserodt J.C. J. Exp.

Med. 1996; 183: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).Recently, we reported that the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins play important roles in mediating rat NK cell lysis of allogeneic and tumor target cells (18Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. Naper C. Torgersen K.M. Rolstad B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5308-5314PubMed Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ). In its inactive form, the α-subunit binds the guanine nucleotide GDP and exchanges it with GTP upon activation. Both the α-GTP and the βγ-heterodimer transduce regulatory signals from a large number of cell-surface receptors to various intracellular enzymes such as adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, and phospholipases (19Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,20Litosch I. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ability of NKR-P1 to induce various biological activities in NK cells suggests that multiple intracellular signaling pathways may be activated upon ligating NKR-P1. The presence of a number of different G proteins in rat NK cell membranes suggests that some of these may also be involved in the transmission of various signals in NK cells. Since it is not known to what extent signal transmission through NKR-P1 triggering is dependent on G proteins, we have investigated the physical and functional coupling of different heterotrimeric G proteins to NKR-P1 in NK cells.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that the anti-NKR-P1 mAb 3.2.3, which recognizes certain members of the NKR-P1 family of NK cell receptors, enhances the GTP binding in rat IL-2-activated NK cell membranes. NKR-P1 are 60-kDa homodimeric proteins belonging to the family of transmembrane glycoprotein receptors with lectin domains (16Chambers W.H. Vujanovic N.L. DeLeo A.B. Olszowy M.W. Herberman R.B. Hiserodt J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1373-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and were first characterized as activating receptors (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar). Although the natural ligand for NKR-P1 is still undefined, 3.2.3 antibody induces redirected lysis (16Chambers W.H. Vujanovic N.L. DeLeo A.B. Olszowy M.W. Herberman R.B. Hiserodt J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1373-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), transduces signals important for regulating NK cell growth (17Hisashi A. Noriko A. Takashi S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and induces intracellular calcium mobilization (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar), phosphoinositide turnover (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar), and interferon-γ secretion (17Hisashi A. Noriko A. Takashi S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).Signals are transmitted intracellularly via one of two identified pathways: the tyrosine kinase receptors pathway or the G protein-coupled receptor pathway. The G protein intracellular signaling pathway, being the older one, became specialized and has been conserved for at least the last 1.2 billion years (25Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). This pathway is important for the activation of various secondary messengers such as phospholipase, in particular phospholipase Cβ (20Litosch I. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 19-20Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (27Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that the βγ-dimer binds and activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ-isoform (27Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 28Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S.

In addition, this dimer binds pleckstrin homology domain (29Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Leftkowit R.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of G proteins in mediating various biological activities inside the cells.More than 20 α-subunits and at least 5 β- and 10 γ-subunits have been identified so far (30Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The α-subunit is divided into four subfamilies. These are (i) αs (stimulatory of adenylyl cyclases), which includes αs and αolf; (ii) αi (inhibitory of adenylyl cyclases), which includes αi1, αi2, αi3, αo, αt1, αt2, αz, and αgust; (iii) αq(activator of phospholipases), which includes αq, α11, α14, and α15/α16; and (iv) α12, which includes α12 and α13. In its resting state, the α-subunit binds GDP and upon ligation of the receptors, conformational changes occur within the receptor α-subunit initiating the activation of G proteins, resulting in the binding of GTP to the α-subunit and its dissociation from the βγ-dimer (30Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Both the α-subunit and the βγ-dimer can then interact with various regulatory effector molecules (30Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Several receptors present on NK cells are coupled to G proteins, which mediate various signals inside these cells. These include: (i) NK cell Fc receptors (32Procopio A.D. Paolini R. Vevhio I Frati L. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3550-3556PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) receptors present on human NK cells that recognize tumor targets, and are coupled to Gs and Go (22Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6796-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) receptors present on rat NK cells that recognize tumor or allogeneic target cells, and are coupled to Go and Gz (18Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. Naper C. Torgersen K.M. Rolstad B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5308-5314PubMed Google Scholar), (iv) transforming growth factor-β1 receptors present on rat NK cells, and are coupled to Go and Gs (33Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. Int.

Schall T.J. Maghazachi A.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 4255-4260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ix) the C chemokine lymphotactin receptors present on human NK cells, and are coupled to Gi, Go, and Gq (35Maghazachi A.A. Skalhegg B.S. Rolstad B. Al-Aoukaty A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and (x) exocytosis of NK cells, which involves certain G proteins (37Ting A.T. Schoon R.A. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23957-23962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our present results demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G proteins in rat IL-2-activated NK cells are activated upon ligating NKR-P1 receptors with anti-NKR-P1 antibody. Utilizing the ELISA and the immunoselection assays with magnetic beads and antibodies specific for various subtypes of G proteins, we were able to determine the binding of GTP to various G protein α-subunits in NK cell membranes. Our results clearly demonstrate that Gi3, Gs, Gq, and Gz, but not Gi1,2, Go, G12, or G13 are activated upon the binding of anti-NKR-P1 antibody to NKR-P1 molecules. Furthermore, we established that there is a physical association of NKR-P1 molecules with these G proteins. This was clearly demonstrated by immunoprecipitating NK cell membranes with antibodies to the α-subunit of Gi3, Gs, Gq, or Gz and then immunoblotting with anti-NKR-P1 antibody and, reciprocally, by immunoprecipitating the membranes with anti-NKR-P1 antibody and then immunoblotting with antibodies to the α-subunits of Gi3, Gs, Gq, or Gz.Although NKR-P1 is a single-transmembrane-spanning domain receptor, and does not belong to the seven-transmembrane-spanning domain receptors, which characteristically bind the heterotrimeric G proteins, other single transmembrane-spanning domain receptors such as transforming growth factor-β1 receptors (33Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 38Kataoka R. Sherlock J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19851-19857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or insulin like growth factor-1 receptors (39Davies P. Patton W. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 159: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also bind G proteins. It is interesting that both transforming growth factor-β1 type II receptors (40Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R. Lodish H. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and NKR-P1 receptors (10Giorda R. Rudent W.A. Vavassori C. Chambers W.H. Hiserodt J.C. Trucco M. Science. 1990; 249: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Giorda R. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1992; 147: 1701-1708Google Scholar) are rich in serine/threonine kinases. Whether these kinases form a motif in the single-transmembrane-spanning domain receptor that binds G proteins is an intriguing possibility that needs to be examined.In summary, our results are the first to show the functional coupling of NKR-P1, a type II plasma membrane receptor to various heterotrimeric G proteins in NK cell membranes. The promiscuous coupling of four different G proteins in these membranes to NKR-P1 may contribute to our understanding of the diverse biological functions attributed to this family of molecules in NK cells.

Target cell recognition by rodent NK cells involves C-type lectin proteins, such as NKR-P1 and Ly 49, that are expressed preferentially on NK cells (8Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Three homologous NKR-P1 genes have been identified both in mice and rats and are designated as NKR-P1 (A, B, and C) (9Yokoyama W.M. Ryan J.C. Hunter J.J. Smith H.R.C. Stark M. Seaman W.E. J.

In human NK cells, NKR-P1A has about 46% homology to the rodent NKR-P1 molecules (14Lanier L.L. Chang C. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2417-2428PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-NKR-P1 monoclonal antibody (3.2.3) reacts with rat NKR-P1 members and induces the production of IP3, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the secretion of interferon-γ, and the degranulation and cytotoxicity of NK cells (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chambers W.H. Vujanovic N.L. DeLeo A.B. Olszowy M.W. Herberman R.B. Hiserodt J.C. J. Exp.

Recently, we reported that the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins play important roles in mediating rat NK cell lysis of allogeneic and tumor target cells (18Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. Naper C. Torgersen K.M. Rolstad B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5308-5314PubMed Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ). In its inactive form, the α-subunit binds the guanine nucleotide GDP and exchanges it with GTP upon activation. Both the α-GTP and the βγ-heterodimer transduce regulatory signals from a large number of cell-surface receptors to various intracellular enzymes such as adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, and phospholipases (19Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,20Litosch I. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ability of NKR-P1 to induce various biological activities in NK cells suggests that multiple intracellular signaling pathways may be activated upon ligating NKR-P1. The presence of a number of different G proteins in rat NK cell membranes suggests that some of these may also be involved in the transmission of various signals in NK cells. Since it is not known to what extent signal transmission through NKR-P1 triggering is dependent on G proteins, we have investigated the physical and functional coupling of different heterotrimeric G proteins to NKR-P1 in NK cells. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that the anti-NKR-P1 mAb 3.2.3, which recognizes certain members of the NKR-P1 family of NK cell receptors, enhances the GTP binding in rat IL-2-activated NK cell membranes. NKR-P1 are 60-kDa homodimeric proteins belonging to the family of transmembrane glycoprotein receptors with lectin domains (16Chambers W.H. Vujanovic N.L. DeLeo A.B. Olszowy M.W. Herberman R.B. Hiserodt J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1373-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and were first characterized as activating receptors (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar). Although the natural ligand for NKR-P1 is still undefined, 3.2.3 antibody induces redirected lysis (16Chambers W.H. Vujanovic N.L. DeLeo A.B. Olszowy M.W. Herberman R.B. Hiserodt J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1373-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), transduces signals important for regulating NK cell growth (17Hisashi A. Noriko A. Takashi S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and induces intracellular calcium mobilization (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar), phosphoinositide turnover (15Ryan J.C. Niemi E.C. Goldfien R.D. Hiserodt J.C. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3244-3250PubMed Google Scholar), and interferon-γ secretion (17Hisashi A. Noriko A. Takashi S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).Signals are transmitted intracellularly via one of two identified pathways: the tyrosine kinase receptors pathway or the G protein-coupled receptor pathway. The G protein intracellular signaling pathway, being the older one, became specialized and has been conserved for at least the last 1.2 billion years (25Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). This pathway is important for the activation of various secondary messengers such as phospholipase, in particular phospholipase Cβ (20Litosch I. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 19-20Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (27Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that the βγ-dimer binds and activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ-isoform (27Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 28Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S.

In addition, this dimer binds pleckstrin homology domain (29Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Leftkowit R.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of G proteins in mediating various biological activities inside the cells.More than 20 α-subunits and at least 5 β- and 10 γ-subunits have been identified so far (30Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The α-subunit is divided into four subfamilies. These are (i) αs (stimulatory of adenylyl cyclases), which includes αs and αolf; (ii) αi (inhibitory of adenylyl cyclases), which includes αi1, αi2, αi3, αo, αt1, αt2, αz, and αgust; (iii) αq(activator of phospholipases), which includes αq, α11, α14, and α15/α16; and (iv) α12, which includes α12 and α13. In its resting state, the α-subunit binds GDP and upon ligation of the receptors, conformational changes occur within the receptor α-subunit initiating the activation of G proteins, resulting in the binding of GTP to the α-subunit and its dissociation from the βγ-dimer (30Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Both the α-subunit and the βγ-dimer can then interact with various regulatory effector molecules (30Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev.

These include: (i) NK cell Fc receptors (32Procopio A.D. Paolini R. Vevhio I Frati L. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3550-3556PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) receptors present on human NK cells that recognize tumor targets, and are coupled to Gs and Go (22Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. J. Biol.

Leibson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23957-23962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our present results demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G proteins in rat IL-2-activated NK cells are activated upon ligating NKR-P1 receptors with anti-NKR-P1 antibody. Utilizing the ELISA and the immunoselection assays with magnetic beads and antibodies specific for various subtypes of G proteins, we were able to determine the binding of GTP to various G protein α-subunits in NK cell membranes. Our results clearly demonstrate that Gi3, Gs, Gq, and Gz, but not Gi1,2, Go, G12, or G13 are activated upon the binding of anti-NKR-P1 antibody to NKR-P1 molecules. Furthermore, we established that there is a physical association of NKR-P1 molecules with these G proteins. This was clearly demonstrated by immunoprecipitating NK cell membranes with antibodies to the α-subunit of Gi3, Gs, Gq, or Gz and then immunoblotting with anti-NKR-P1 antibody and, reciprocally, by immunoprecipitating the membranes with anti-NKR-P1 antibody and then immunoblotting with antibodies to the α-subunits of Gi3, Gs, Gq, or Gz.Although NKR-P1 is a single-transmembrane-spanning domain receptor, and does not belong to the seven-transmembrane-spanning domain receptors, which characteristically bind the heterotrimeric G proteins, other single transmembrane-spanning domain receptors such as transforming growth factor-β1 receptors (33Maghazachi A.A.

Cell Physiol. 1994; 159: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also bind G proteins. It is interesting that both transforming growth factor-β1 type II receptors (40Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F.

Whether these kinases form a motif in the single-transmembrane-spanning domain receptor that binds G proteins is an intriguing possibility that needs to be examined. In summary, our results are the first to show the functional coupling of NKR-P1, a type II plasma membrane receptor to various heterotrimeric G proteins in NK cell membranes. The promiscuous coupling of four different G proteins in these membranes to NKR-P1 may contribute to our understanding of the diverse biological functions attributed to this family of molecules in NK cells.

https://openalex.org/W2078999710,"VP55, the vaccinia poly(A) polymerase catalytic subunit, interacts with oligonucleotide primers via two uridylate recognition sites (Deng, L., and Gershon, P. D. (1997) <i>EMBO J.</i> 16, 1103–1113). Here, we show that the cognate RNA sequence comprises a 5′-rU<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>15</sub>-rU-3′ motif (where N=any deoxyribo or ribonucleotide), embedded within oligonucleotide primers 29–30 nucleotides (nt), or greater, in length. Nine residues separate the 3′-most ribouridylate of the optimally positioned motif from the primer 3′-OH. A ribose sugar at the extreme 3′-terminal nucleotide of the primer is absolutely required for VP55's adenylyltransferase activity, but not for stable VP55-RNA interaction. A ribose at position −3 markedly stimulates both adenylyltransferase activity and stable binding. The use of uridine analogs indicated (i) those functional groups of the uracil base which contribute to stable VP55-primer interaction, and (ii) that VP55's ability to discriminate uracil from cytosine stems largely from the requirement for a protonated N3 nitrogen within the pyrimidine ring. The rU<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>15</sub>-rU motif was identified within the uridylate-rich 3′ end of a naturally occurring vaccinia mRNA. However, oligonucleotides whose only internal uridylates comprised the motif supported only a 3–5-nt processive burst of oligo(A) tail addition, as opposed to the ∼30–35-nt burst observed with the naturally occurring 3′ end."
https://openalex.org/W2005378082,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family encodes a large family of glycoproteins. Some are probably involved in the homeostasis/development of epithelial cells and granulocyte activation, while others e.g. the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, are expressed in the placenta and are essential for a positive outcome of pregnancy. In this paper, we have characterized <i>cea5</i>, a member of the murine CEA gene family. RNase protection and <i>in situ</i> hybridization analyses revealed that Cea5 mRNA is exclusively synthesized in primary and secondary trophoblast giant cells of the placenta only during early stages of development. Full-length Cea5 cDNA was obtained by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using day 10.5 post-coitum placental RNA. The 1.6-kilobase pair (kb) Cea5 mRNA encodes a secreted glycoprotein with a predicted size of 30 kDa. It is composed of a leader peptide (L), one immunoglobulin (Ig) variable or N, and one Ig constant-like or A domain. This domain organization is unique within the human and murine CEA families. Two overlapping cosmid clones covering 54 kb of the <i>cea5</i> gene locus were mapped.<i>cea5</i> consists of three exons (L, N, A/3′-untranslated region exon) located within a 4-kb region. <i>rnCGM2</i>, the rat<i>cea5</i> counterpart, exhibits the same restricted expression pattern. This together with their exceptional conservation within the rat and murine CEA families and their absence from the human CEA family suggests that <i>cea5</i> and <i>rnCGM2</i> are of functional importance for rodent placental development."

Transient transfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells showed that a negative regulatorycis-element (NRE) is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of the distal L promoter.

We conclude that the expression of L-type mRNA is modulated by the interaction between a cell cycle-dependent DNA-binding protein and the murine aldolase A NRE. Aldolase A gene expression is regulated by an intriguing mechanism that involves three alternative promoter regions (distal or pL, middle or pM, and proximal or pF). Transcription of multiple mRNA species (L, M, and F types), containing the same coding region but different untranslated 5′-ends, is driven by three autonomous promoters and splicing of alternative leader exons (L, M, and F) (1Salvatore F. Izzo P. Paolella G. Horiz. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 8: 611-665PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maire P. Gautron S. Hakim V. Gregori C. Mennecier F. Khan A. J. Mol.

We have demonstrated that the human genomic regions upstream from exons F and L are able to drive autonomous transcription (7Izzo P. Costanzo P. Lupo A. Rippa E. Salvatore F.

We found that the basal transcriptional activity of pF is regulated by several binding sites for the ubiquitous factor Sp1 (7Izzo P. Costanzo P. Lupo A. Rippa E. Salvatore F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Binding of nucleartrans-acting factors AP-1 and NF-1 in the −384/−262 region increases pF transcriptional activity (7Izzo P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The pL promoter is regulated by both positive and negativecis-elements (8Costanzo P. Lupo A. Rippa E. Grosso M. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Within this promoter, we detected a negative regulatory element (hAldA-NRE) 1The abbreviations used are: hAldA-NRE, human aldolase A negative regulatory element; mAldA-NRE, murine aldolase A negative regulatory element; FCS, fetal calf serum; bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.1The abbreviations used are: hAldA-NRE, human aldolase A negative regulatory element; mAldA-NRE, murine aldolase A negative regulatory element; FCS, fetal calf serum; bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. and a protein factor from Hep3B cells that binds to this element. This complex down-regulates to one-fifth the transcription of the distal promoter in several cell types and furthermore regulates transcription of other cellular genes (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In rodent tissues, only two mRNAs, the ubiquitous AH type, corresponding to the human F type, and the muscle-specific type (M type), have been characterized (11Stauffer J.K. Colbert M.C. Ciejek-Baez E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11773-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mukai T. Akai Y. Yatsuki H. Joh K. Hori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that a third species, which corresponds to human aldolase A L-type mRNA, is expressed and correctly processed in rodent cell lines and that its expression is increased during differentiation and is associated with cell-growth arrest (13Lupo A. Costanzo P. De Rosa M. Russo T. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here we report that the modulation of murine L-type mRNA expression is transcriptionally controlled and differentially regulated in proliferating and confluence-arrested cell populations. Within the murine distal promoter, we identified a negative regulatory element (mAldA-NRE), homologous to the human aldolase A silencer, that is recognized by a protein factor from NIH3T3 cells of ∼97 kDa. This protein binds to the mAldA-NRE to form a complex that is present at higher levels in proliferating cells than in growth-arrested cells. Preliminary mutational analysis of the AldA-NRE suggests that at least two target sequences are required for specific protein binding and full silencer function. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The medium was changed every 2–3 days, and the cultures were maintained strictly subconfluent. Cells were allowed to grow exponentially for 3 days, at which time the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS. Cells were maintained in 0.5% FCS for 3 days to achieve quiescence and then stimulated with fresh medium containing 20% FCS for the indicated times. With this procedure, we found that 80–90% of the cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase. Concentration ofgas1 mRNA, a growth-arrested specific gene (14Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and cytofluorometric measurements confirmed cell synchrony. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Sigma) or cycloheximide (50 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to the cells at the times indicated. Total RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described (13Lupo A. Costanzo P. De Rosa M. Russo T. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The aldolase A L-type probe was obtained by transcribing with T7 RNA polymerase, in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (400Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.), a mouse genomic 180-bp fragment (including 49 bp of the 3′-end of exon L1 and the 71 bp of exon L2) cloned in the pGem3Z vector (Promega). The protected fragments generated from this probe are 118 and 69 bp long. The hybridization aldolase A F-type probe was obtained by transcribing a mouse genomic fragment of 350 bp (which included the entire exon F) cloned in the pGem3Z vector. This probe generated two protected fragments of 141 and 95 bp. A 75-bp protected fragment of rat β-actin cDNA was used as an internal control. In Northern blot experiments, 10 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and then transferred onto a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were baked at 80 °C and then hybridized for 16 h at 65 °C in Church's buffer (7% SDS, 0.5m NaH2PO4, and 1 mmEDTA). After washing for 45 min in 50 mmNaH2PO4 and 1% SDS, filters were autoradiographed with x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The hybridization probes used as controls were a cDNA fragment of mousegas1 and a specific DNA fragment of 28 S RNA labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) using a random priming kit (Promega) (specific activity of ∼109cpm/μg). Nuclear protein extracts from NIH3T3 cells were prepared according to Dignamet al. (16Dignam J. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cellular pellets were obtained in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in solution I (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol). Cells were broken 10-fold through a 1-ml syringe with a 25-gauge needle. The nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation for 30 s in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C and resuspended in solution II (solution I plus 400 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol and without KCl). The pellet was swollen for 30 min at 4 °C in solution II and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 45 min. The supernatant containing nuclear extracts was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Gel shift assays were performed as described (8Costanzo P. Lupo A. Rippa E. Grosso M. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The plasmid construct clones AldALΔ−555, RBP9-CAT+AldANRE1 (where RBP is retinol-binding protein), and RBP9-CAT+AldANRE2 are described elsewhere (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The clones AldALΔ−555MutN1 and AldALΔ−555MutN2 were obtained from clone AldALΔ−555 using the MutN1 and MutN2 oligonucleotides, respectively, in accordance with the instructions provided with the ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Subconfluent NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 20 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Graham F. Van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were cultured for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS to maintain them in their logarithmic phase of growth or were allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS for 12 h and replaced with serum-free medium for another 48 h to force them into a quiescent state. The cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity by thin-layer chromatography using [14C]chloramphenicol as a substrate (18Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized against β-galactosidase activities. Equal amounts (40 μg) of nuclear extracts from growing and serum-deprived NIH3T3 cells were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 25 mA for 1 h. The gel was soaked for 30 min in transfer buffer (25 mmTris, 250 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Corp.) using the Bio-Rad transfer cell system. The filter was blocked for 2 h at room temperature in a solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk and binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The filter was washed for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer, and binding was carried out at room temperature in the same buffer plus 0.25% nonfat dry milk with at least a 106 cpm/ml concentration of the appropriate labeled probe. The oligonucleotides used in the Southwestern experiments were as follows: M3 oligonucleotide, CTGCCAGAGCCTCAACTGCCTCTGTTTCGAGATC; Neg3 oligonucleotide, CTGCCGAGACCTCAACTGTCTCTGCTTCGAGATC; Neg1 oligonucleotide, TCCCCTTAGAGAGCAACAGACGTGT; MutN1 oligonucleotide, TCCCCTTCCGCGGCAACAGACGTGT; and MutN2 oligonucleotide, TCCCCTTAGAGAGCGGCAGACGTGT. After three 5-min washes in binding buffer, the filter was dried and placed on x-ray films for visualization. We have previously demonstrated that the expression of L-type mRNA in cultured murine cells increases during the growth-arrested state (13Lupo A. Costanzo P. De Rosa M. Russo T. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We have extended this work to investigate whether the increased expression is cell cycle-regulated and whether the expression of F-type mRNA is similarly regulated. We performed RNase protection analysis to examine aldolase A L-type mRNA expression in proliferating or serum-starved mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells in exponential growth, in quiescence, and at various times after serum restimulation. The antisense RNAs used as probes in the RNase protection assay are shown in Fig. 1: riboprobe L includes mouse exons L1 and L2, whereas riboprobe F contains the entire mouse exon F. Using riboprobe L, we detected two protected fragments of 69 and 118 nucleotides, which correspond to different transcription initiation sites of mouse L-type mRNA (Fig.2 A). The hybrid band, corresponding to the most abundant 69-nucleotide transcript, was much more intense in serum-starved cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) than in proliferating cells (lane 1). Densitometric scanning showed that the concentration of L-type mRNA increased ∼8-fold during quiescence (data not shown). When the serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by the mitogenic action of the serum, L-type mRNA expression was markedly repressed already after 2 h of serum stimulation (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). The 118-bp mRNA, when detectable, also increased in serum-starved cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) compared with proliferating cells (lane 1) and decreased considerably after 2 h of serum stimulation (lane 3). Both mRNA (118 and 69 bp) levels progressively decreased up to 12 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4–6), and as demonstrated by densitometric scanning (data not shown), they slightly increased between 12 and 20 h of serum restimulation, when the cells, although not completely synchronized, went through the cell cycle. The modulated expression of 118- and 69-bp transcripts suggests that L-type mRNAs in NIH3T3 fibroblasts are modulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. To determine whether the arrest of cellular proliferation affects F-type mRNA expression, we performed RNase protection analysis using riboprobe F (see Fig. 1). Two specific bands of 95 and 141 nucleotides, corresponding to the major transcription initiation sites of mouse F-type mRNA, were detected (Fig. 2 B). Identical levels of F-type mRNA expression were observed in proliferating cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells (lane 2), and in cells refed for 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h (lanes 3–10). In this case, there was no difference between proliferating and growth-arrested cells or after serum restimulation. An antisense fragment complementary to rat β-actin mRNA, which gives a hybrid band of 75 nucleotides, served as a internal control of the amounts of RNA used in each sample.Figure 2RNase protection assay of total RNA from proliferating and starved NIH3T3 cells using the specific probe for L- and F-type mRNAs. A, total RNA isolated from proliferating (lane 1) and starved (lane 2) NIH3T3 cells and from NIH3T3 cells after starvation and refeeding with 20% FCS for different times (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h inlanes 3–10, respectively) was hybridized with riboprobe L.

The same filter was hybridized to a specific 28 S probe to ensure comparable RNA loading (Fig. 2 D). To examine whether the induction of L-type mRNA expression in growth-arrested cells is due to increased mRNA stability, we analyzed the expression of L-type mRNA in proliferating and serum-starved NIH3T3 cells after treatment with actinomycin D, a specific inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Total RNA from proliferating and serum-starved NIH3T3 cells, extracted at different times after the addition of actinomycin D to the culture medium, was analyzed in RNase protection experiments using riboprobe L (Fig. 3). L-type mRNA levels in proliferating NIH3T3 cells were unchanged up to 24 h of actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–6), whereas they decreased substantially in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells after 14 and 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5and 6). In contrast, the gas1 transcript decreased significantly within 3 h in both proliferating and serum-starved cells (Fig. 3, C and D). The actinomycin D treatment of the proliferating and serum-deprived cells affected mainly the 69-bp transcript. These results indicate that the increased levels of L-type mRNA observed in serum-starved cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) are not due to increased mRNA stability, thus indirectly suggesting a transcriptionally regulated control. To determine whether de novo protein synthesis is responsible for the modulation of L-type mRNA expression during the growth state, we performed RNase protection assays on total RNA from proliferating NIH3T3 cells treated for 4, 8, and 12 h with cycloheximide (Fig. 4 A,lanes 2–4). The levels of L-type mRNA transcripts increased significantly after 4 h of cycloheximide treatment (Fig.4 A, lane 2), with the increases being more evident for the most abundant species (69 nucleotides long). Cycloheximide treatment, even after 8 h, did not affect the F-type transcripts (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that the expression of F- and L-type mRNAs is regulated by different transcriptional mechanisms. The decreased mRNAs in Fig. 4 (A and B, lanes 4) are probably caused by cycloheximide-induced toxicity. Taken together, the experiments with actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggest the existence of a protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor of L-type mRNA synthesis in proliferating NIH3T3 cells. We have previously demonstrated that a negative regulatory cis-element (hAldA-NRE) within the distal promoter (pL) of the human aldolase A gene is involved in the negative regulation of pL transcription (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine if the different L-type mRNA levels expressed in growth-arrested and proliferating NIH3T3 cells result from a negative transcriptional mechanism that involves specific DNA-protein interactions, we performed transient transfection experiments in mouse cells using previously described human recombinant constructs (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The transcriptional activity of the AldALΔ−555 clone, which includes the hAldA-NRE plus exons L1 and L2 fused to the CAT transcriptional unit, was much lower in proliferating NIH3T3 cells (6.4%) than in growth-arrested cells (12.1%). This indicates that starved cells lack a negative transcriptional control. Two clones in which the AldA-NRE was cloned in opposite directions (RBP9-CAT+AldANRE1 and RBP9-CAT+AldANRE2) upstream from the basal promoter of the human retinol-binding protein gene fused to the CAT gene showed a reduced transcriptional activity in proliferating NIH3T3 cells (1.5 and 7.5%, respectively) compared with the levels obtained with the RBP9-CAT clone without the AldA-NRE (22.6%). In contrast, the RBP9-CAT+AldANRE1 and RBP9-CAT+AldANRE2 clones showed increased levels of CAT transcriptional activity in growth-arrested cells (5.1 and 15.5%, respectively). The transcriptional activity of the RBP9-CAT clone alone was the same in both proliferating and starved cells. A pGM2CAT clone containing 500 bp of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter region fused to the CAT gene (not shown in Fig. 5) was used as a positive control of the transcription assay (taken as 100% activity) in both culture conditions. These results indicate that also in mouse cells, as already demonstrated in human cells (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), there is a negative nuclear protein able to repress transcription of at least two different promoters and that the repression observed in proliferating cells was abolished when cells were cultured in serum-deprived medium. The human and mouse silencer sequences within the L promoter contain a highly homologous fragment from −430 to −338 bp upstream from exon L1 (Fig. 6). Within this fragment, we previously identified two protected DNAcis-elements (called Neg1 and Neg3) that are specifically recognized by the same nuclear proteins extracted from a human hepatoma cell line (Hep3B) (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, an oligonucleotide (M3) based on the murine sequence and homologous to human Neg3 (see boxedsequence in Fig. 6) was used in gel retardation experiments together with nuclear extracts from proliferating and starved NIH3T3 cells. A retarded DNA-protein complex was found in both proliferating (Fig.7 A, lane 2) and growth-arrested (lane 3) NIH3T3 cells, although the interaction was diminished in growth-arrested cells. When growth-arrested cells were refed with 20% FCS for different times (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h) and allowed to reenter the cell cycle, the binding activity appeared to be cell cycle-regulated. This finding is shown by the time-dependent peak-and-trough profile of the DNA-protein complex after serum restimulation,i.e. an increase after 2–12 h of restimulation (Fig.7 A, lanes 4–8) followed by a decrease after 16 and 20 h (lanes 9 and 10). A bar graph demonstrating the intensity of the complex in each lane is shown in Fig. 7 B. A retarded complex of identical electrophoretic mobility was observed with the human Neg1 and Neg3 oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a similar nuclear factor present in both human and murine cells recognizes the same sequence motif and binds to it.Figure 7Gel shift assay of nuclear extracts from proliferating and starved NIH3T3 cells. A, the 5′-end-labeled probe, i.e. the M3 oligonucleotide, was incubated with nuclear extracts from proliferating (lane 2) and serum-deprived (lane 3) NIH3T3 cells and from NIH3T3 cells after starvation and refeeding with 20% FCS for different times (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h in lanes 4–11, respectively). In lane 1 is the M3 oligonucleotide probe alone. The arrow indicates the specific DNA-protein complex.F indicates the free DNA probe. B, shown is densitometric scanning of levels of the M3 DNA-protein complexes. The results are expressed as relative percent binding ((bound/(free + bound)) × 100%). A value of 100% was assigned to the binding of the sample in lane 2. The data are representative of three experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the nuclear protein that binds the AldA-NRE, we conducted Southwestern experiments with proliferating and serum-starved NIH3T3 nuclear extracts (Fig. 8). Using as probe the mouse M3 oligonucleotide, a specific complex of ∼97 kDa appeared in both extracts. The DNA-protein interaction was clearly stronger in proliferating NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 8 A, lane 1) than in starved NIH3T3 cells (lane 2). The same result was obtained using the human Neg1 oligonucleotide as probe (Fig.8 B, lanes 1 and 2). To explore DNA sequence requirements for both the binding activity and the silencer function of the AldA-NRE, two mutant oligonucleotides were designed and analyzed by Southwestern assay and by transient transfections. In the MutN1 oligonucleotide, the AGAGA motif was replaced by a CCGCG sequence, and in the MutN2 oligonucleotide, the dinucleotide AA was mutated to GG (Fig. 8 C). In Southwestern experiments, both MutN1 and MutN2 displayed a significant decrease in binding activity (Fig. 8 B, lanes 3 and 4 andlanes 5 and 6, respectively) compared with Neg1 (lanes 1 and 2). The binding activity was also reduced when the MutN1 and MutN2 mutant oligonucleotides were used as probes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig.9, A and B). Furthermore, both MutN1 and MutN2 showed a higher binding activity in proliferating cells (Fig. 9, A and B, lanes 1) than in growth-arrested cells (A andB, lanes 2). Fig. 9 C shows the competition of the wild-type complex with unlabeled Neg1 oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 1 and3, respectively, in both proliferating and starved nuclear extracts) and the competition with increasing concentrations of unlabeled MutN1 (lanes 6–8) and MutN2 (lanes 9–11) mutant oligonucleotides. The MutN1 oligonucleotide shows a lower binding activity than MutN2 (Fig. 9, A andB). Accordingly, it is a less efficient competitor (Fig.9 C, lanes 6–8) compared with MutN2 (lanes 9–11) for Neg1 complex formation.Figure 9Gel shift assay of nuclear extracts from proliferating and starved NIH3T3 cells. A, the 5′-end-labeled MutN1 oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts from proliferating (lane 1) and serum-deprived (lane 2) NIH3T3 cells. B, the 5′-end-labeled MutN2 oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts from proliferating (lane 1) and serum-deprived (lane 2) NIH3T3 cells. C, the 5′-end-labeled Neg1 oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts from proliferating (lane 1) and serum-deprived (lane 3) NIH3T3 cells; a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous competitor was used in lanes 2 and 4. Competition experiments (lanes 5–11) were performed in the presence of nuclear extracts from proliferating NIH3T3 cells. In lane 5, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled nonspecific competitor was used. Inlanes 6–8, 100-, 200-, and 500-fold molar excesses of unlabeled MutN1 competitor, respectively, were used. In lanes 9–11, 100-, 200-, and 500-fold molar excesses of unlabeled MutN2 competitor, respectively, were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In transient transfection experiments (Fig. 8 C), the mutations in the AGAGA motif (MutN1) or in the dinucleotide AA (MutN2) caused a loss of silencer function. In fact, the CAT activity increased to 18.9% in cells transfected with the AldALΔ−555MutN1 clone and to 8.6% in cells transfected with the AldALΔ−555MutN2 clone compared with cells transfected with the wild-type AldALΔ−555 clone (4.6%). The CAT activities are normalized to the value of a positive control pGM2CAT clone taken as 100%. The transcriptional activity of the AldALΔ−555 clone observed in NIH3T3 cells is lower than that found in Hep3B cells (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the human Neg1 and mouse M3 oligonucleotides bind the same 97-kDa protein and that their binding activity is higher in proliferating cells than in serum-starved cells. Mutations in the hAldA-NRE (MutN1 and MutN2) cause a reduced silencing function (detected by transient transfections) and a diminished DNA-protein binding activity (revealed by Southwestern and electrophoretic mobility shift assays). The binding activity is differently affected by the mutations in the AGAGA (MutN1) and AA (MutN2) motifs contained in the Neg1 site. In fact, the highly reduced binding activity of MutN1 (compared with MutN2) was responsible for the higher transcriptional activity (Fig. 8, B and C). Regulation of the aldolase A gene involves multiplecis-elements located within the promoter regions upstream from leader exons L1, M, and F that interact with several nuclear proteins (7Izzo P. Costanzo P. Lupo A. Rippa E. Salvatore F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Costanzo P. Lupo A. Rippa E. Grosso M. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The differential expression of various aldolase A mRNAs (L, M, and F types) is controlled by an interplay of interactions between DNA and proteins according to cell and stage specificity (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Khan A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously identified a negative regulatory element (hAldA-NRE) within the human aldolase A distal promoter (pL) that acts as a true “silencer” because it represses the transcription in its own configuration and the transcription of a reporter gene driven by a heterologous promoter (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the third promoter (pL) within the aldolase A gene exists also in rat and mouse cells and that it is regulated by transcription factors in a proliferation/quiescence-dependent manner (13Lupo A. Costanzo P. De Rosa M. Russo T. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We have now identified within the murine distal promoter acis-element (mAldA-NRE), highly homologous to the human silencer, that binds a nuclear protein from growing NIH3T3 cells, thus down-regulating transcription of the L-type promoter. Gel retardation assays and Southwestern experiments indicate that the binding efficiency of the repressor-silencer complex is greater in proliferating NIH3T3 cells than in serum-deprived cells. These data suggest a mechanism of cell cycle-dependent regulation. The down-regulation exerted by the murine repressor is removed when proliferating NIH3T3 cells are treated with cycloheximide (i.e. absence of active protein synthesis), and thereafter, the distal promoter region (pL) is transcribed already 4 h after the treatment at levels comparable to those of resting cells. Transcriptional regulation of the aldolase A L-type promoter gene in proliferating and growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells was conclusively demonstrated by transient transfections. Mutations in the hAldA-NRE showed that at least two DNA motifs strongly inhibited the silencer activity in proliferating cells. (Fig. 8 C). The same mutated sequences display a reduced binding activity for the repressor protein in Southwestern experiments (Fig. 8 B) and in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 9), thus suggesting that these nucleotides play a role in conferring a silencer-competent DNA structure and in binding to silencer protein. In the human L promoter, we demonstrated that an AGAGA motif is the target for the binding with a nuclear factor from Hep3B cell extracts (10Lupo A. Costanzo P. Medugno L. Salvatore F. Izzo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that this DNA motif plays an important role in binding and silencing functions also in murine NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nucleotides AA, adjacent to the GA-rich motif, are required for silencing activity. Taken together, these results indicate that (i) a nuclear protein present in mouse cells recognizes the sequences contained in the murine and in human AldA-NREs, (ii) the AldA-NRE is a more general silencer because it represses also a heterologous promoter, and (iii) the mAldA-NRE is involved in the cell cycle-dependent modulation of aldolase A L-type promoter activity. These observations raise the possibility that a negative trans-acting factor that binds to the murine and human AldA-NREs is a nuclear protein involved in a general mechanism of gene regulation during alternating stages of the cell cycle. It has been suggested that negative regulatory elements, not yet completely characterized, play a role in modulating transcription of the aldolase A gene, particularly as regards the muscle-specific promoter in both the murine and human gene systems (19Stauffer J.K. Ciejek-Baez E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Khan A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Hermfisse U. Schafer D. Netzker R. Brand K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the mouse aldolase A gene, transient transfection experiments have demonstrated that a negative element, the muscle sequestering element, selectively sequesters the M promoter from nonspecific stimulatory activities. This indicates that the muscle sequestering element plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of muscle-specific mRNA expression (19Stauffer J.K. Ciejek-Baez E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of the expression of the human aldolase A gene in transgenic mice indicated that removal of a putative negative element increases pM activity in fast muscles (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Khan A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that these sequences prevent constitutive activation of pM by enhancer-like sequences, located upstream from the proximal promoter (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Khan A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The above-described negative regulatory elements in the mouse and human aldolase A genes are located in the same genomic region of the AldA-NRE. In the present study, the AldA-NRE exerted its silencing effect on the modulation of a different promoter, i.e. on pL transcription during cell cycle stages. It has not yet been investigated if the murine and human AldA-NREs affect also the transcription driven by the muscle-specific promoter (pM). Should the AldA-NRE be the same cis-negative element reported by Stauffer and Ciejek-Baez (19Stauffer J.K. Ciejek-Baez E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and by Salminen et al. (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Khan A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it is feasible that the interaction between the AldA-NRE and a nuclear protein is involved in the events that lead to the muscle differentiation program. Be that as it may, the interaction between a repressor protein and the human and mouse AldA-NREs reported in this study is the first well characterized case of negative control in aldolase A gene transcriptional activity. Moreover, by mutagenesis analysis, the specific sequences within the AldA-NRE that mediate the negative transcriptional effect have been defined. A negative regulatory transcriptional element (reducing module), located upstream from exon M (clone −1066/−731), has been found to attenuate the proximal promoter (AH1)-driven transcription in the rat thymocyte aldolase A gene (21Hermfisse U. Schafer D. Netzker R. Brand K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, this negative “reducing module” is located in a position completely different from that of the AldA-NRE. Transcriptional repression is involved in a wide variety of tissue-specific (22Jackson S.M. Keech C.A. Williamson D.J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell.

This protein could belong to a repressor family that is itself modulated during the cell cycle. The eukaryotic cell cycle consists of the continuous and discontinuous processes that are required for cell growth and proliferation. Most genes are expressed at roughly constant rates throughout the cell cycle, and thus, their transcription falls into the continuous class of cell cycle processes. A small number of genes show a discontinuous pattern of expression during the cell cycle. This group of genes includes those encoding products involved in DNA metabolism (thymidine kinase and dihydrofolate reductase), some structural proteins, components of the basic cell cycle regulatory machinery (cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase), and transcription factors (E2F1, B-myb, and Jun), which themselves confer cell cycle-regulated expression to target genes. The isolation and cloning of the protein that binds the AldA-NRE will shed light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression and the biological role played by this protein during cell cycle-regulated gene transcription.

Recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations defined a 16-amino acid long antigenic epitope from Lys5 to Ile20 in the RP135 peptide (corresponding to residues 312–327 in gp120) and showed that it forms an 8-residue turn upon binding to the 0.5β monoclonal antibody (9Zvi A.

The crystal and solution structures of the 0.5β monoclonal antibody (or fragments thereof) without and in complex with the peptide antigen have not yet been solved. The structures of antibody fragments of two other monoclonal antibodies, 50.1 and 59.1, in complex with V3 loop-derived peptides have, however, been determined (11Rini J.M. Stanfield R.L. Stura E.A.

Science. 1994; 264: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In both cases, the antibody fragments bind 7-residue-long epitopes in a β-turn conformation, as frequently found in other antibody-peptide interactions (13Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Analysis of the energetics of peptide-antibody interactions is complicated by the fact that peptide antigens often undergo large conformational changes upon binding. To date, the energetics of interaction between antibodies and HIV-1-derived peptide antigens have been little studied. Previously (6Faiman G.A. Levy R. Anglister J. Horovitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13829-13833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we characterized the salt dependence of the interaction between the 0.5β Fv fragment and the RP135 peptide and measured the contribution of arginine residues in the peptide to the interaction. To obtain further structural information on the interaction between the 0.5β Fv fragment and the RP135 peptide, we decided to determine the temperature dependence of the binding constant of this reaction for wild-type peptide and six mutants thereof. Isothermal calorimetry experiments did not yield reproducible results, probably owing to aggregation and/or nonspecific binding. We therefore carried out a van't Hoff analysis in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Tween-20. Our results show that there is enthalpy-entropy compensation in the effects of the mutations in the peptide on the binding to the Fv fragment, indicating that the mutations do not change the binding mechanism. Using van't Hoff plots, one can estimate the change in heat capacity, ΔC p, associated with the binding reaction. We find that the value of ΔC p depends strongly on the concentration of detergent. This finding has important implications for attempts to correlate values of ΔC p with the amount of surface area buried in protein-ligand complexes (14Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv.

We suggest that this failure is due, in part, to the frequent use of protein-stabilizing agents or detergents in binding experiments. Expression and purification of the 0.5β Fv fragment was achieved as before (6Faiman G.A. Levy R. Anglister J. Horovitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13829-13833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The antigenic peptide TRKSIRIQRGPGRAFVTIGK and variants thereof were synthesized, purified, and characterized as described (6Faiman G.A. Levy R. Anglister J. Horovitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13829-13833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the peptides were estimated using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid method for determination of amines (25Snyder S.L. Sobocinski P.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was obtained from Chembridge Corp., Illinois. All other analytical grade reagents were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescence measurements of the 0.5β Fv fragment in the presence of different peptide concentrations were made as described previously (6Faiman G.A. Levy R. Anglister J. Horovitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13829-13833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All the reactions were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing different fixed amounts of the non-ionic detergent Tween-20. Phosphate buffers were prepared separately for each temperature using a pK a value of 6.86 at 25 °C and a temperature-dependence coefficient, ∂pK a /∂T, of −0.0028 (26Stoll V.S. Blanchard J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The titrations were carried out at least in duplicate over a temperature range from 10 to 35 °C (± 0.1 °C) in a thermostatted cuvette. Differential scanning calorimetry was carried out using the MCS instrument (Microcal Inc., Amherst, MA) at a scan rate of 1 K min−1. The concentration of the Fv fragment was 26 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) without or with 0.05% Tween-20. Determination of dissociation constants (K d ) between the Fv fragment and the different peptides from the fluorescence enhancement titrations was achieved as described previously (6Faiman G.A. Levy R. Anglister J. Horovitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13829-13833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). van't Hoff analysis was carried out by plotting ln K a (= ln(1/K d )) as a function of the inverse absolute temperature (1/T). The data were fitted using Kaleidagraph (Version 2.1, Synergy Software (PCS Inc.)) to the following equation,lnKa=−ΔH0R1T−1T0+ΔCpT0R1T−1T0+ΔCpRlnTT0+lnKa,0Equation 1 where K a is the association constant,T 0 is a reference temperature in degrees Kelvin,K a ,0 and ΔH 0are the association constant and enthalpy change at the reference temperature, and ΔC p is the heat capacity change of the binding reaction. Estimates (± S.E.) of the parameters ΔH 0, ΔC p, and ln K a ,0 were obtained from the fits. The changes in free energy of binding, ΔG 0, and entropy, ΔS 0, at the reference temperature of 298 K were calculated using the following relations,ΔG0=ΔH0−TΔS0=−RT lnKa,0Equation 2 where R is the gas constant, and all other notations are as before. Equation 1 is derived by combining Equation 2 and the following relations.ΔCp=∂ΔH/∂T=T(∂ΔS/∂T)Equation 3 Solvent-accessible areas were calculated using the method of Lee and Richards (27Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar) in the Homology package within Insight II (Biosym/MSI). A linear dependence of the fluorescence on the Fv concentration at different temperatures (in the absence of peptide) indicates that dissociation of the Fv fragment into light and heavy chains is negligible (Fig. 1). The thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between the 0.5β Fv fragment and the RP135 peptide at different temperatures between 10 and 35 °C were determined in the presence of different concentrations of Tween-20 by monitoring fluorescence enhancement upon binding. Plots of the natural logarithm of the association constant as a function of the inverse absolute temperature were found to have increasingly more convex shape in the presence of increasing concentrations of the non-ionic detergent (Fig. 2). Convex plots are characteristic of processes with a negative change in heat capacity. The data were fitted using Equation 1 and 298 K as a reference temperature. A linear relationship is observed between the value of ΔC p and the concentration of Tween-20 with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 (Fig.3). The value of ΔC p in the absence of detergent is estimated by linear extrapolation to be −0.1 (± 0.9) kcal K−1 mol−1.Figure 2van't Hoff plots for the binding of wild-type and mutant RP135 peptides to the 0.5β Fv fragment.Binding experiments were carried out at different temperatures in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing different concentrations of Tween-20 in the case of wild-type peptide (panel A) and 0.05% Tween-20 in the case of the mutants (panels B-D).

Of importance is that the apparent heat capacity of the Fv fragment is always less negative when Tween-20 is present. In the absence of Tween-20, two transitions are observed that may correspond to the dissociation of the Fv fragment and the denaturation of the two chains. In the presence of Tween-20, a third transition is observed that may be due to different melting temperatures of the light and heavy chains when the detergent is present. Six variants of the RP135 peptide with the single amino acid replacements R4A, K5A, R8A, R11A, F17A, and T19A were used in this study. These mutations span the entire sequence of the RP135 peptide except for the conserved GPGR loop that is thought to be crucial for stabilizing the conformation of the peptide (12Ghiara J.B. Stura E.A. Stanfield R.L. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Science. 1994; 264: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Zvi A. Hiller R. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). van't Hoff plots were constructed for the binding of these RP135 variants to the 0.5β Fv fragment in the presence of 0.05% Tween-20 (Fig. 2). The changes in heat capacity upon binding of the mutant peptides to the Fv were found to be negative and relatively large in all of the cases (TableI). The effects of the replacements R4A, K5A, R8A, R11A, F17A, and T19A on the change in heat capacity upon binding (ΔC p(wild-type) − ΔC p(mutant)) were found to be −0.7 (± 1.1), −0.2 (± 1.4), −2.6 (± 0.9), −2.3 (± 1.1), −1.8 (± 1.0), and −2.0 (± 0.9) kcal K−1 mol−1, respectively. The free energies, enthalpies, and entropies of binding of wild-type and mutant peptides at the reference temperature of 298 K were calculated using Equation 2 and are given in Table I. The effects of the replacements R4A, K5A, R8A, R11A, F17A, and T19A on the enthalpies of binding at 298 K (ΔH 0(wild-type) − ΔH 0(mutant)) are calculated to be 2.4 (± 3.2), −2.3 (± 5.2), −8.9 (± 1.1), −2.4 (± 3.5), −0.5 (± 2.3), and −9.1 (± 1.3) kcal mol−1, respectively. The effects of the replacements R4A, K5A, R8A, R11A, F17A, and T19A on the entropies of binding at 298 K (ΔS 0(wild-type) − ΔS 0(mutant)) are calculated to be 7 (± 11), −8 (± 18), −16 (± 4), −3 (± 12), 5 (± 9), and −27 (± 4) cal K−1 mol−1, respectively. The effects of the replacements R4A, K5A, R8A, R11A, F17A, and T19A on the free energies of binding at 298 K (ΔG 0(wild-type) − ΔG 0(mutant)) are calculated to be 0.16 (± 0.11), 0.09 (± 0.18), −4.14 (± 0.04), −1.45 (± 0.12), −1.86 (± 0.09), and −0.90 (± 0.04) kcal mol−1, respectively.Table IThermodynamic parameters of the interaction at 25 °C between the 0.5β Fv fragment and the RP135 peptide or mutants thereofPeptideΔG0ΔH 0ΔS 0TΔS 0ΔC pkcal mol −1kcal mol −1cal K −1 mol −1kcal mol −1kcal K −1 mol −1Wild-type−11.46 ± 0.03−22.1 ± 0.9−36 ± 3−10.7 ± 0.9−3.4 ± 0.9R4A−11.63 ± 0.10−24.5 ± 3.1−43 ± 10−12.9 ± 3.1−2.7 ± 0.7K5A−11.55 ± 0.17−19.9 ± 5.2−28 ± 17−8.3 ± 5.2−3.2 ± 1.1R8A−7.33 ± 0.02−13.3 ± 0.5−20 ± 2−6.0 ± 0.5−0.8 ± 0.1R11A−10.01 ± 0.11−19.8 ± 3.4−33 ± 11−9.7 ± 3.4−1.1 ± 0.7F17A−9.61 ± 0.08−21.7 ± 2.4−40 ± 8−12.0 ± 2.4−1.6 ± 0.5T19A−10.56 ± 0.03−13.1 ± 0.9−8 ± 3−2.5 ± 0.9−1.4 ± 0.2All the titrations were carried out at least in duplicate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween-20 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab All the titrations were carried out at least in duplicate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween-20 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The entropies of binding of wild-type and mutant peptides to the Fv fragment at 298 K and 0.05% Tween-20 were plotted as a function of the respective enthalpies of binding (Fig. 5). The data were fitted to the linear equation,ΔSi=α+βΔHiEquation 4 where i stands for the ith peptide. A linear relationship is observed with a slope, β, of 0.0026 (± 0.0004) K−1 and a correlation coefficient of 0.94. This result indicates almost complete entropy-enthalpy compensation. The change in solvent-accessible area upon binding of the RP135 peptide to the 0.5β Fv fragment is due to (i) area buried within the peptide and (ii) area buried in the interface between the peptide and Fv in their complex. The area buried within the peptide is the difference between the solvent-accessible area of the free peptide in its bound and unbound (extended) conformations. The conformation of a shorter version (Arg4-Ile20) of the peptide in its bound state was recently determined by NMR methods (10Zvi A. Feigelson D.J. Hayek Y. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8619-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The solvent-accessible area of the free peptide in its bound conformation was calculated using the NMR-derived coordinates to be 2064.8 Å2 (of which 1048.7 Å2 are nonpolar and 1016.1 Å2 are polar). The solvent-accessible area of the shorter version of the free peptide in an extended conformation was calculated to be 2444.7 Å2 (of which 1364.7 Å2 are nonpolar and 1080.0 Å2 are polar). The area buried within the peptide upon binding to the Fv fragment is, therefore, 379.9 Å2(of which 316.0 Å2 are nonpolar and 63.9 Å2are polar). In the absence of a known structure of the complex, the interface area between the peptide and the Fv in the complex was estimated from the literature on other peptide-antibody complexes (13Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to be about 1000 Å2 (of which about 500 Å2are estimated to be nonpolar and 500 Å2 are polar). The interaction between the RP135 peptide and the 0.5β Fv fragment was studied here by measuring the effects of mutations in the peptide on the temperature-dependence of the binding reaction. In principle, the mutations in the peptide may alter the binding mechanism, thereby considerably complicating the analysis of their effects. It can be shown that enthalpy-entropy compensation is a good indication for a single interaction mechanism (29Leffler J.E. Grunwald S. Rates and Equilibria of Organic Reactions. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1963: 315-342Google Scholar). The almost complete enthalpy-entropy compensation observed here (Fig. 5) indicates, therefore, a single interaction mechanism of the different mutant peptides with the Fv fragment. Heat capacity changes associated with peptide binding are usually in the range of −0.1 to −0.5 kcal mol−1 K−1although some exceptions have been reported. There are several reasons for changes in heat capacity due to ligand binding. A positive contribution to the change in heat capacity is due to the decrease in configurational freedom of one or both of the molecules that form the complex. It can be readily shown that the change in heat capacity is proportional to the change in the extent of fluctuations in the system (ΔC p = {(〈H 2〉-〈H〉2)free− (〈H 2〉 − 〈H〉2)bound}/kT 2). This factor is of relatively more importance in the case of flexible peptide binding owing to the loss of side chain and backbone entropy that accompanies the binding. A negative and relatively large contribution to the change in heat capacity arises from binding-induced desolvation of nonpolar groups that are exposed to water in the unbound state. Finally, the heat capacity might change because of changes in ionization of charged side chains although this factor generally has a relatively small contribution. We have attempted to rationalize the change in heat capacity associated with the binding of the RP135 peptide to the 0.5β Fv fragment by using the previously described structure-based parameterization approach (30Gómez J. Hilser V.J. Xie D. Freire E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). According to this approach, the effect of changes in hydration and noncovalent interactions on the change in the heat capacity, ΔC p,hyd, upon folding or binding (14Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 17Murphy K.P. Xie D. Garcia K.C.

Biol. 1992; 227: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) can be expressed as a linear combination of contributions associated with changes in polar (ΔASA p) and nonpolar (ΔASA np) solvent-accessible surface areas, as follows,ΔCp,hyd=a(T)ΔASAnp+b(T)ΔASApEquation 5 where the coefficients a(T) andb(T) are the respective contributions per Å2 of nonpolar and polar areas that become solvent-exposed, which are equal to 0.45 + 2.63 × 10−4(T − 25) − 4.2 × 10−5 (T − 25)2 and −0.26 + 2.85 × 10−4(T − 25) + 4.31 × 10−5(T − 25)2 in cal K−1 mol−1 (32Gómez J. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The change in solvent-accessible area upon binding of the RP135 peptide to the 0.5β Fv fragment consists of changes due to (i) area buried within the peptide and (ii) area buried in the interface of the peptide-Fv complex. The area buried within the peptide upon binding is 379.9 Å2 (of which 316 Å2 are nonpolar and 63.9 Å2 are polar). The contribution of the area buried within the peptide to ΔC p,hyd is calculated using Equation 5 to be −0.125 kcal K−1 mol−1 at 25 °C. In the absence of a known three-dimensional structure of the Fv-peptide complex, we estimated the size of the interface area by assuming that, in the complex, about half of the solvent-accessible area of the peptide becomes buried (13Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The area buried in the interface of the peptide-Fv complex is accordingly estimated to be about 1000 Å2 (of which about 500 Å2 are estimated to be nonpolar and 500 Å2 are polar) per molecule, and its contribution to ΔC p,hyd is, therefore, about −0.2 kcal K−1 mol−1. The overall contribution to ΔC p,hyd due to the change in solvent-accessible area buried within the peptide and in the interface of the peptide-Fv complex is equal to about −0.3 kcal K−1 mol−1. This value is in agreement, within experimental error, with the value of ΔC p in the absence of detergent estimated by linear extrapolation to be −0.1 (± 0.9) kcal K−1 mol−1 (Fig. 3). The magnitude of mutational effects on ΔG and ΔC p is consistent with NMR investigations (9Zvi A. Kustanovich I. Feigelson D. Levy R. Eisenstein M. Matsushita S. Richalet-Sécordel P. Regenmortel M.H.V. Anglister J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,10Zvi A. Feigelson D.J. Hayek Y. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8619-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that mapped the antigenic epitope from Lys5 to Ile20, i.e. replacement of Arg4 and Lys5 by alanine is found to have relatively little effect on both ΔG and ΔC p, whereas replacement by alanine of residues within the epitope has a large effect on both ΔG and ΔC p (TableI). There is a good correlation between the mutational effects on ΔC p and calculated values of ΔΔC p,hyd, using Equation 5 and the polar and nonpolar surface areas of amino acids (27Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar), for residues within the antigenic epitope (Fig. 6). Due to the uncertainty associated with linear extrapolation to zero concentration of detergent, the relatively large errors in the experimental values of ΔΔC p and the likely possibility that some side chains within the epitope are not fully buried, an agreement between the values of the experimentally measured ΔΔC p and calculated changes in ΔC p,hyd upon mutation is not to be expected. Discrepancies between measured and calculated values of ΔC p have been observed in the case of other systems (19Mandiyan V. O'Brien R. Zhou M. Margolis B. Lemmon M.A. Sturtevant J.M. Schlessinger J.

Biol. 1997; 267: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that the structure-based parameterization approach may apply to folding but not to binding processes. Our results suggest that the lack of correlation is due, at least in some cases, to the presence of detergents or protein stabilizing agents. Polyethylene glycol, sucrose, and Tween-20, for example, are often used in biological assays to prevent denaturation, aggregation, or nonspecific binding. Many of these protein-stabilizing agents are excluded from the surface of proteins which, therefore, become preferentially hydrated when these compounds are present at high concentrations (34Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Such preferential hydration is expected to augment effects on heat capacity due to desolvation, as observed here in the case of the denaturation of the 0.5β Fv fragment in the presence of 0.05% Tween-20 (Fig. 4). Likewise, in the presence of Tween-20, both the peptide and the Fv fragment are preferentially hydrated, and complex formation between them, therefore, involves a larger desolvation step that should be reflected by a relatively more negative change in heat capacity, as indeed observed in this study (Fig. 3). This may explain why unusually large negative heat capacity changes have been observed in several other binding studies in which detergents or protein-stabilizing agents were employed (21De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Ayala Y.M. Vindigni A. Nayal M. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Di Cera E. J. Mol.
