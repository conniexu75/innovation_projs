https://openalex.org/W2559720913,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a ubiquitous family of molecular chaperones that suppress the unspecific aggregation of miscellaneous proteins. Multicellular organisms contain a large number of different sHsps, raising questions as to whether they function redundantly or are specialized in terms of substrates and mechanism. To gain insight into this issue, we undertook a comparative analysis of the eight major human sHsps on the aggregation of both model proteins and cytosolic lysates under standardized conditions. We discovered that sHsps, which form large oligomers (HspB1/Hsp27, HspB3, HspB4/αA-crystallin, and HspB5/αB-crystallin) are promiscuous chaperones, whereas the chaperone activity of the other sHsps is more substrate-dependent. However, all human sHsps analyzed except HspB7 suppressed the aggregation of cytosolic proteins of HEK293 cells. We identified ∼1100 heat-sensitive HEK293 proteins, 12% of which could be isolated in complexes with sHsps. Analysis of their biochemical properties revealed that most of the sHsp substrates have a molecular mass from 50 to 100 kDa and a slightly acidic pI (5.4–6.8). The potency of the sHsps to suppress aggregation of model substrates is correlated with their ability to form stable substrate complexes; especially HspB1 and HspB5, but also B3, bind tightly to a variety of proteins, whereas fewer substrates were detected in complex with the other sHsps, although these were also efficient in preventing the aggregation of cytosolic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2558593042,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) hold promise for both cell replacement and immune modulation strategies owing to their progenitor and non-progenitor functions, respectively. Characterization of MSC from different sources is an important and necessary step before clinical use of these cells is widely adopted. Little is known about the biology and function of canine MSC compared to their mouse or human counterparts. This knowledge-gap impedes development of canine evidence-based MSC technologies.We hypothesized that canine adipose tissue (AT) and bone marrow (BM) MSC (derived from the same dogs) will have similar differentiation and immune modulatory profiles. Our objectives were to evaluate progenitor and non-progenitor functions as well as other characteristics of AT- and BM-MSC including 1) proliferation rate, 2) cell surface marker expression, 3) DNA methylation levels, 4) potential for trilineage differentiation towards osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cell fates, and 5) immunomodulatory potency in vitro.1) AT-MSC proliferated at more than double the rate of BM-MSC (population doubling times in days) for passage (P) 2, AT: 1.69, BM: 3.81; P3, AT: 1.80, BM: 4.06; P4, AT: 2.37, BM: 5.34; P5, AT: 3.20, BM: 7.21). 2) Canine MSC, regardless of source, strongly expressed cell surface markers MHC I, CD29, CD44, and CD90, and were negative for MHC II and CD45. They also showed moderate expression of CD8 and CD73 and mild expression of CD14. Minor differences were found in expression of CD4 and CD34. 3) Global DNA methylation levels were significantly lower in BM-MSC compared to AT-MSC. 4) Little difference was found between AT- and BM-MSC in their potential for adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Chondrogenesis was poor to absent for both sources in spite of adding varying levels of bone-morphogenic protein to our standard transforming growth factor (TGF-β3)-based induction medium. 5) Immunomodulatory capacity was equal regardless of cell source when tested in mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte reactions. Priming of MSC with pro-inflammatory factors interferon-gamma and/or tumour necrosis factor did not increase the lymphocyte suppressive properties of the MSC compared to untreated MSC.No significant differences were found between AT- and BM-MSC with regard to their immunophenotype, progenitor, and non-progenitor functions. Both MSC populations showed strong adipogenic and osteogenic potential and poor chondrogenic potential. Both significantly suppressed stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The most significant differences found were the higher isolation success and proliferation rate of AT-MSC, which could be realized as notable benefits of their use over BM-MSC."
https://openalex.org/W2559728510,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor FOXP3 play a pivotal role in maintaining immunologic self-tolerance. We and others have shown previously that EZH2 is recruited to the FOXP3 promoter and its targets in Treg cells. To further address the role for EZH2 in Treg cellular function, we have now generated mice that lack EZH2 specifically in Treg cells (EZH2Δ/ΔFOXP3+). We find that EZH2 deficiency in FOXP3+ T cells results in lethal multiorgan autoimmunity. We further demonstrate that EZH2Δ/ΔFOXP3+ T cells lack a regulatory phenotype in vitro and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Of special interest, EZH2Δ/ΔFOXP3+ mice develop spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease. Guided by these results, we assessed the FOXP3 and EZH2 gene networks by RNA sequencing in isolated intestinal CD4+ T cells from patients with Crohn's disease. Gene network analysis demonstrates that these CD4+ T cells display a Th1/Th17-like phenotype with an enrichment of gene targets shared by FOXP3 and EZH2. Combined, these results suggest that the inflammatory milieu found in Crohn's disease could lead to or result from deregulation of FOXP3/EZH2-enforced T cell gene networks contributing to the underlying intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2558741885,"In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), and also in other fish species, certain plant protein ingredients can increase fecal water content creating a diarrhea-like condition which may impair gut function and reduce fish growth. The present study aimed to strengthen understanding of the underlying mechanisms by observing effects of various alternative plant protein sources when replacing fish meal on expression of genes encoding proteins playing key roles in regulation of water transport across the mucosa of the distal intestine (DI). A 48-day feeding trial was conducted with five diets: A reference diet (FM) in which fish meal (72%) was the only protein source; Diet SBMWG with a mix of soybean meal (30%) and wheat gluten (22%); Diet SPCPM with a mix of soy protein concentrate (30%) and poultry meal (6%); Diet GMWG with guar meal (30%) and wheat gluten (14.5%); Diet PM with 58% poultry meal. Compared to fish fed the FM reference diet, fish fed the soybean meal containing diet (SBMWG) showed signs of enteritis in the DI, increased fecal water content of DI chyme and higher plasma osmolality. Altered DI expression of a battery of genes encoding aquaporins, ion transporters, tight junction and adherens junction proteins suggested reduced transcellular transport of water as well as a tightening of the junction barrier in fish fed the SBMWG diet, which may explain the observed higher fecal water content and plasma osmolality. DI structure was not altered for fish fed the other experimental diets but alterations in target gene expression and fecal water content were observed, indicating that alterations in water transport components may take place without clear effects on intestinal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2557934497,"Reproducibility in animal research is alarmingly low, and a lack of scientific rigor has been proposed as a major cause. Systematic reviews found low reporting rates of measures against risks of bias (e.g., randomization, blinding), and a correlation between low reporting rates and overstated treatment effects. Reporting rates of measures against bias are thus used as a proxy measure for scientific rigor, and reporting guidelines (e.g., ARRIVE) have become a major weapon in the fight against risks of bias in animal research. Surprisingly, animal scientists have never been asked about their use of measures against risks of bias and how they report these in publications. Whether poor reporting reflects poor use of such measures, and whether reporting guidelines may effectively reduce risks of bias has therefore remained elusive. To address these questions, we asked in vivo researchers about their use and reporting of measures against risks of bias and examined how self-reports relate to reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. An online survey was sent out to all registered in vivo researchers in Switzerland (N = 1891) and was complemented by personal interviews with five representative in vivo researchers to facilitate interpretation of the survey results. Return rate was 28% (N = 530), of which 302 participants (16%) returned fully completed questionnaires that were used for further analysis. According to the researchers’ self-report, they use measures against risks of bias to a much greater extent than suggested by reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. However, the researchers’ self-reports are likely biased to some extent. Thus, although they claimed to be reporting measures against risks of bias at much lower rates than they claimed to be using these measures, the self-reported reporting rates were considerably higher than reporting rates found by systematic reviews. Furthermore, participants performed rather poorly when asked to choose effective over ineffective measures against six different biases. Our results further indicate that knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines had a positive effect on scientific rigor. However, the ARRIVE guidelines were known by less than half of the participants (43.7%); and among those whose latest paper was published in a journal that had endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines, more than half (51%) had never heard of these guidelines. Our results suggest that whereas reporting rates may underestimate the true use of measures against risks of bias, self-reports may overestimate it. To a large extent, this discrepancy can be explained by the researchers’ ignorance and lack of knowledge of risks of bias and measures to prevent them. Our analysis thus adds significant new evidence to the assessment of research integrity in animal research. Our findings further question the confidence that the authorities have in scientific rigor, which is taken for granted in the harm-benefit analyses on which approval of animal experiments is based. Furthermore, they suggest that better education on scientific integrity and good research practice is needed. However, they also question reliance on reporting rates as indicators of scientific rigor and highlight a need for more reliable predictors."
https://openalex.org/W2557313129,"Hancornia speciosa Gomes (Apocynaceae) is a fruit tree, popularly known as mangabeira, and it is widely distributed throughout Brazil. Several parts of the plant are used in folk medicine, and the leaf and bark extracts have anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and antimicrobial properties. In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of the ethanolic extract of Hancornia speciosa leaves (EEHS) and its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities as well as the mechanisms involved in cell death. The chemical compounds were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The antioxidant activity of the EEHS was investigated using the method that involves the scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals as well as the inhibition of oxidative hemolysis and lipid peroxidation induced by 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) in human erythrocytes. The antimicrobial activity was determined by calculating the minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and zone of inhibition. Kasumi-1 leukemic cells were used to assess the cytotoxic activity and mechanisms involved in cell death promoted by the EEHS. The chemical compounds identified were quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, rutin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-rutinoside, and catechin-pentoside. The EEHS demonstrated antioxidant activity via the sequestration of free radicals, inhibition of hemolysis, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes incubated with an oxidizing agent. The antimicrobial activity was observed against American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and hospital strains of bacteria and fungi, filamentous fungi and dermatophytes. The cytotoxic activity of the EEHS was induced by apoptosis, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of cathepsins. Together, these results indicate the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the EEHS and that their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities in acute myeloid leukemia cells are mediated by apoptosis."

SAMHD1 expression is differentially regulated by interferon in certain primary cells, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here, we report a detailed characterization of the promotor region, the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of SAMHD1, and the mechanism responsible for the cell type-dependent up-regulation of SAMHD1 protein by interferon. We demonstrate that induction of SAMHD1 by type I and II interferons depends on 3′-UTR post-transcriptional regulation, whereas the promoter drives basal expression levels. We reveal novel functional target sites for the microRNAs miR-181a, miR-30a, and miR-155 in the SAMHD1 3′-UTR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of endogenous miR-181a and miR-30a levels inversely correlates with SAMHD1 protein up-regulation upon type I and II interferon stimulation in primary human monocytes. These miRNAs are not modulated by interferon in macrophages or dendritic cells, and consequently protein levels of SAMHD1 remain unchanged.

Recently, it was proposed that the basal level of SAMHD1 mRNA expression is negatively regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) (32Gottwein E. Mukherjee N. Sachse C. Frenzel C. Majoros W.H. Chi J.-T.A.

Neuroinflammation. 2015; 12: 66Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 22 nucleotides (nt) in length that are part of the post-transcriptional regulatory network. They act mostly as negative regulators that recognize complementary sequences in mRNAs and induce translational repression or deadenylation of the respective mRNA (35Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N.

Alternatively, extensive complementarity to the target sequence can induce an RNAi-like mechanism by which miRNAs induce cleavage of the target mRNA (35Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N.

Furthermore, miRNAs have also been described to mediate repressive chromatin modifications and transcriptional gene silencing (37Moazed D. Small RNAs in transcriptional gene silencing and genome defence.Nature. 2009; 457: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Jin et al. (33Jin C. Peng X. Liu F. Cheng L. Lu X. Yao H. Wu H.

Furthermore, it has been shown in astrocytes that miRNA mimics or inhibitors of miR-181a and miR-155 influence SAMHD1 basal expression levels (34Pilakka-Kanthikeel S. Raymond A. Atluri V.S.R. Sagar V. Saxena S.K. Diaz P. Chevelon S. Concepcion M. Nair M.

An earlier report on a screen for targets of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded miRNA miR-K12-11 revealed that both miR-K12-11 and its cellular homologue miR-155 negatively regulate SAMHD1 basal expression in reporter assays (32Gottwein E.

In these reports, however, only one functional target site of miR-181 has been mapped. miRNAs target the 5′-UTR, coding DNA sequences (38Miranda K.C. Huynh T. Tay Y. Ang Y.-S. Tam W.-L. Thomson A.M.

MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15855) Google Scholar), with the latter being the most frequent and effective target site. miRNAs are thought to control expression of up to 60% of all mammalian genes (40Lewis B.P.

It is known that expression patterns of miRNAs are cell type/tissue-dependent (41Liang Y. Ridzon D. Wong L. Chen C.

Moreover, IFNs have been shown to modulate the expression levels of miRNAs, suggesting a significant potential for post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs in the innate immune response (43Pedersen I.M.

Tate M.D. Hertzog P.J. MicroRNA as type I interferon-regulated transcripts and modulators of the innate immune response.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 334Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that miR-181a levels and SAMHD1 mRNA levels are inversely correlated in microglia by IFNα and -γ (29Jin C. Peng X. Liu F. Cheng L. Xie T. Lu X. Wu H. Wu N. Interferon-induced sterile α motif and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 expression in astrocytes and microglia is mediated by miR-181a.AIDS. 2016; 30: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms of SAMHD1 regulation upon interferon stimulation, specifically the regulatory elements, specific miRNA species involved, and their exact target sites, has not yet been undertaken. Moreover, the regulatory mechanisms affecting differential SAMHD1 expression in sentinel cells of the innate immune response are still unknown. Here, we show, for the first time, a detailed analysis of the promoter, 5′-UTR, and 3′-UTR of SAMHD1 and provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of IFN-mediated stimulation of SAMHD1 expression in innate sentinel cells. We demonstrate that the SAMHD1 3′-UTR is responsible for the IFN induction of SAMHD1, whereas the promoter drives basal expression levels. The SAMHD1 locus reveals a dispersed pattern of transcription initiation, common for broadly expressed proteins, as reported for SAMHD1. We define novel active target sites for miR-181a, miR-30a, and miR-155 in the SAMHD1 3′-UTR. The cell type-dependent IFN stimulation of SAMHD1 is mediated by modulation of levels of miR-181a and miR-30a, but not miR-155. In conclusion, we demonstrate an inverse correlation of both miRNA levels and protein levels of SAMHD1 in primary human monocytes upon IFN stimulation, whereas both miRNA and protein levels stay unchanged in monocyte-derived macrophages or dendritic cells. Current data suggest that SAMHD1 is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in certain cell types. We and others described up-regulation of SAMHD1 protein level by IFNα in monocytes (16Berger A. Sommer A.F.R. Zwarg J. Hamdorf M. Welzel K. Esly N. Panitz S. Reuter A. Ramos I. Jatiani A. Mulder L.C.F. Fernandez-Sesma A. Rutsch F. Simon V. König R. Flory E. SAMHD1-deficient CD14+ cells from individuals with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome are highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7e1002425Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and monocytic cell lines (30Goujon C. Schaller T. Galão R.P. Amie S.M. Kim B. Olivieri K. Neil S.J.D. Malim M.H. Evidence for IFNα-induced, SAMHD1-independent inhibitors of early HIV-1 infection.Retrovirology. 2013; 10: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), by IFNα and IFNγ in microglia (29Jin C. Peng X. Liu F. Cheng L. Xie T. Lu X. Wu H. Wu N.

Amie S.M. Coleman C.M. Hoy H. Hollenbaugh J.A. Kim B. Wu L.

To corroborate these findings, we comprehensively analyzed the up-regulation of SAMHD1 protein and mRNA levels upon stimulation with type I and II IFNs in sentinel cells. In the monocytic cell line U937 as well as in primary human monocytes, both type I (IFNα and IFNβ) and type II IFNγ led to an increase in SAMHD1 protein (Fig. 1A) and mRNA levels (Fig. 1B) after 24 h. Of note, induction of SAMHD1 mRNA was less pronounced than mRNA levels of the known ISGs ISG54 or IRF1. Specifically, in primary human monocytes, we observed SAMHD1 mRNA induction of about 2-fold by any of the IFNs (Fig. 1B) accompanied by protein up-regulation of 2–9-fold (Fig. 1A), depending on the donor and the type of IFN. To evaluate the possible regulatory mechanisms of SAMHD1 expression, we performed a detailed characterization of the promotor region and the 5′- and 3′-UTR of SAMHD1. IFN stimulation could lead to activation of transcription factors (TFs) specifically targeting the SAMHD1 promoter, leading to an enhanced transcriptional activity. Additionally, there is the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation of the SAMHD1 mRNA upon IFN stimulation. Because one major post-transcriptional mechanism is the transcript regulation by IFN-controlled miRNAs (43Pedersen I.M. Cheng G. Wieland S. Volinia S. Croce C.M. Chisari F.V. David M.

First, we characterized in detail the 5′-UTR of SAMHD1 using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) on mRNA from the monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937 (Fig. 2A). Six transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were detected at positions 69, 82, 112, 152, 173, and 200 nt upstream of the coding region. One of these TSSs has been reported previously (18Li N. Zhang W.

CCRCC is generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Approved multikinase inhibitors have led to only minimal improvements in overall survival (3Powles T. Chowdhury S. Jones R.

Recent genomic studies have shown that CCRCC is associated with mutations in chromatin modifying enzymes, such as PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, and KDM5C, thus implying that epigenetic dysregulation plays a role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy (4Varela I.

Our studies showed that widespread DNA methylation changes could be seen in CCRCC and affect enhancer regions of the kidney genome. We also observed both novel and well characterized genomic copy numbers changes in these CCRCC samples (8Hu C.Y. Mohtat D. Yu Y. Ko Y.A. Shenoy N. Bhattacharya S. Izquierdo M.C. Park A.S. Giricz O.

Analysis of differentially methylated regions in CCRCC in our study revealed enrichment for binding sites of HAIRY transcription factor. Because HAIRY is a downstream mediator of the NOTCH signaling pathway, we focused on analysis of this pathway in the present study. Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated that inhibition of NOTCH pathway can be efficacious in various malignancies. In fact, there have been reports that have suggested that components of the NOTCH pathway are activated in renal cell cancer and that targeting components such as DLL4 can have therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models (9Sjölund J. Boström A.K. Lindgren D. Manna S. Moustakas A. Ljungberg B. Johansson M. Fredlund E. Axelson H.

Still, not much is known about the mechanisms of NOTCH pathway activation in renal cell cancer. In the current study, we analyzed genetic and epigenetic abnormalities related to the NOTCH pathway in CCRCC and determined that ligands JAGGED1 and JAGGED2 were overexpressed and associated with both genetic and epigenetic alterations. Widespread NOTCH activation was also seen in independent large TCGA data sets. Transgenic overexpression of NOTCH1 led to severely dysplastic and hyperproliferative tubules in vivo, demonstrating the procarcinogenic role of this pathway in RCC. Finally, treatment with a clinical inhibitor of the NOTCH pathway LY-3039478 led to increased survival in CCRCC xenografts, demonstrating this pathway as a therapeutic target in CCRCC. We had conducted a recent study on integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of CCRCC and microdissected renal glomerular tissue from 13 primary samples (8Hu C.Y. Mohtat D. Yu Y. Ko Y.A. Shenoy N. Bhattacharya S. Izquierdo M.C. Park A.S. Giricz O. Vallumsetla N. Gundabolu K. Ware K. Bhagat T.D. Suzuki M. Pullman J. et al.Kidney cancer is characterized by aberrant methylation of tissue-specific enhancers that are prognostic for overall survival.Clin. Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we had observed that the binding site for NOTCH-driven transcription factor, HAIRY, was highly enriched in differentially methylated regions in CCRCC (8Hu C.Y. Mohtat D. Yu Y. Ko Y.A. Shenoy N. Bhattacharya S. Izquierdo M.C. Park A.S. Giricz O. Vallumsetla N. Gundabolu K. Ware K. Bhagat T.D. Suzuki M.

Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, we now analyzed gene expression data from these samples for numerous components of the NOTCH pathway, including ligands (JAGGED1), receptors (NOTCH 2-4) and downstream effectors (HEY1,2 and HES1) and found them to be overexpressed in CCRCC samples (Fig. 1A) when compared with controls. Next, we validated our findings by examining RNA-seq data from CCRCC samples in the TCGA portal (12Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). We examined a cohort of 405 RCC samples and 68 non-tumor kidney controls that included 66 matched CCRCC/control samples. Analysis of the complete cohort of matched and unmatched samples (n = 473) revealed widespread activation of NOTCH ligands and effectors in CCRCC (Fig. 1B) with up-regulation of JAG1, JAG2, DLL4, NOTCH 1,3,4, HEY1, HEY2, and HES5 genes. (p < 0.05, t test). To quantify the magnitude of up-regulation, we analyzed the matched pairs (n = 66) and determined that the ligands JAG1 and JAG2 were overactivated (>2-fold increase) in 36 and 67% cases, respectively (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, analysis of matched pairs also indicated the increased expression of another NOTCH ligand DLL4 in 85% of CCRCC cases. Next, we confirmed the overexpression of JAG1 and JAG2 seen by genome-wide analysis in an independent set of seven matched renal tumors and their non-tumor microdissected controls by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Finally, the overexpression of NOTCH1, JAG1, and DLL4 was also corroborated by immunostaining. As shown on the representative figures, NOTCH1 and JAG1 were highly overexpressed in malignant CCRCC cells (Fig. 1, E and F), whereas DLL4 expression was overexpressed in the interstitial cells (Fig. 1G). Next, we examined whether the JAGGED positive RCC samples are clinically different from those of low JAGGED expressing tumors. We found that the overall survival for cases with either JAG1 or JAG2 overactivation was significantly better than those with low JAGGED-expressing tumors (log rank p value = 0.0094). The median survival of the high JAG1/JAG2 RCC cases was 2600 days versus 1584 of the low JAG1/JAG2 cases (Fig. 1H). A similar prognostic impact was also seen in CCRCC cases with NOTCH1, DLL4, and HEY1 overexpression (Fig. 1H). In summary, these results demonstrate the increased activation of NOTCH pathway genes in independent cohorts of CCRCC and revealed that samples with NOTCH activation comprise a clinically distinct subgroup of tumors. Aberrant expression of genes in cancer can be accomplished via gene amplifications, as well as by aberrant epigenetic modifications (13Alvarez H. Opalinska J. Zhou L. Sohal D. Fazzari M.J. Yu Y.

Analysis of our integrative CCRCC data set revealed that even though hypermethylation was the predominant epigenetic abnormality in CCRCC (8Hu C.Y. Mohtat D. Yu Y. Ko Y.A. Shenoy N. Bhattacharya S.

Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), JAG1 was one of the select genes that was aberrantly hypomethylated in CCRCC (supplemental Table S1). The loss of DNA methylation on the JAG1 locus coincided with H3K4me1 chromatin modification, and computational annotation indicated that these differentially hypomethylated regions are on an active enhancer regions (yellow, orange) (Fig. 2A). These aberrant differentially hypomethylated regions were validated the quantitatively by MassARRAY EpiTYPER analysis and demonstrated loss of methylation in tumors when compared with controls (Fig. 2B). To further establish that JAG1 is epigenetically regulated in kidney epithelia, we treated two sets of normal kidney tubular cells with the DNMT inhibitor decitabine in vitro and observed a significant increase in JAG1 expression in both cell lines (Fig. 2C). The increase was observed at both high and low doses of the inhibitor. Quantitative MassARRAY analysis of individual CpGs located in the differentially methylated JAG1 locus determined that significant demethylation of multiple CpGs occurred after decitabine treatment and correlated with the increase in expression (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the hypomethylation of this enhancer region of JAG1 is associated with the increased ligand expression observed in CCRCC. The other NOTCH ligand, JAG2, was not affected by aberrant methylation but was found to be amplified in 3 of 13 cases of CCRCC (representative sample shown in Fig. 2E). These data revealed that both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms were up-regulating NOTCH receptor ligands in CCRCC. To functionally test the role of NOTCH pathway activation as a driver of carcinogenesis in CCRCC, we generated a mouse model with tubule epithelial cell specific expression of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1. Because most human CCRCC cases occur in presence of deletion or mutations affecting the VHL gene, first we crossed the VHLflox/flox animals with the Kspcre (also known as Cdh16cre) animals. Kspcre mice express the cre recombinase in renal tubule epithelial cells (14Shao X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. Epithelial-specific Cre/lox recombination in the developing kidney and genitourinary tract.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). As it has been described before, tubule-specific VHL null mice do not have an observable phenotype, which we confirmed (Fig. 3B). To test the effect of NOTCH activation, we crossed these animals with transgenic mice containing a sequence encoding an intracellular portion of the mouse NOTCH1 gene (amino acids 1749–2293) (5Murtaugh L.C. Stanger B.Z. Kwan K.M. Melton D.A. Notch signaling controls multiple steps of pancreatic differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14920-14925Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Expression of the NOTCH1 fragment and GFP is blocked by a loxP-flanked STOP fragment placed between the coding sequence and the promoter. When crossed with the KspCre animals, the ICNOTCH1 is expressed constitutively in tubule epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). The truncated cytoplasmic fragment encoded by the NOTCH1 sequence causes constitutive signaling activity. Kidneys obtained from 8-week-old male double transgenic knock-out animals (Kspcre/ICNOTCH1/VHLflox/flox) were significantly larger than control animals (n = 9 from each genotype group) (Fig. 3, B and C). Kidney sections obtained from these animals showed striking dysplastic changes, consisting of nuclear enlargement and clearing, nucleolar prominence, microcystic change, and epithelial stratification (Fig. 3, B and E). Multiple cells layers of dysplastic cells were seen instead of a single layer of tubular cells observed in control animals. Having seen that tubule-specific transgenic expression of Notch phenotypically recapitulates features of human CCRCC, we performed a comprehensive molecular transcript analysis to examine the molecular overlap between Notch target genes and genes differentially expressed in patients CCRCC. We obtained the list of tubule-specific Notch target genes from microarray studies performed in control and mice inducible expression of Notch intracellular domain in tubule epithelial cells using the Pax8rtTA TREICNotch1 model (15Bielesz B. Sirin Y. Si H. Niranjan T. Gruenwald A. Ahn S. Kato H. Pullman J. Gessler M. Haase V.H. Susztak K. Epithelial Notch signaling regulates interstitial fibrosis development in the kidneys of mice and humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 4040-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (GEO GSE80384). Next, we examined the expression of the human orthologues of these kidney tubule-specific Notch target genes in human CCRCC samples. We observed that 380 genes that were regulated by Notch expression in mouse kidney tubules were also differentially expressed in human CCRCC. Human CCRCC samples recapitulated the regulation of close to 30% of differentially expressed Notch targets (Fig. 4A and supplemental Tables S2 and S3). As seen on the heat map analysis, the expression of these genes showed consistent patterns in numerous control and CCRCC samples and were able to distinctly cluster tumor from non-tumor samples in an unsupervised fashion (Fig. 4B). Next, we also compared the in vivo NOTCH signature to the human CCRCC signature using gene set enrichment analysis based on transcripts we identified in the Notch transgenic mice. When we examined the enrichment level of top 100 Notch target genes in CCRCC, there was a statistically significant enrichment for genes overexpressed in the Notch transgenic animals, and there was a statistically significant depletion for genes those expression decreased in tubule-specific Notch transgenic mice (Fig. 4, C and D). Functional pathway analysis of the common gene signature between NOTCH and human CCRCC revealed that cell cycle regulators were significantly represented in genes that were overexpressed (Fig. 5A and supplemental Table S4). Pathways involved in cell metabolism were also significantly represented in the commonly underexpressed genes (Fig. 5B). Having seen differential expression of genes involved in cell proliferative pathways, we examined the NOTCH overexpressing mice for changes in cell division. Expression of NOTCH1 in renal tubular cells was seen to be associated with an increase in Ki67 positive epithelial cell number, demonstrating increased epithelial cell proliferation (Fig. 5C). In summary, these data demonstrate molecular similarities between NOTCH-driven murine dysplasia and human CCRCC and show that a sizable proportion of dysregulated genes in CCRCC are driven by NOTCH pathway activation. Having demonstrated overactivation of NOTCH pathway in CCRCC, we tested the effect of γ-secretase inhibition in representative human renal carcinoma cell lines. The γ-secretase complex is necessary for NOTCH cleavage, and this cleavage is essential for NOTCH activation. Treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor that is being tested in clinical trials, LY3039478, significantly inhibited the growth of 2 CCRCC cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). LY3039478 treatment also led to decreased expression of Myc and cyclin A1, two genes that were part of the NOTCH-driven proliferative signature in murine and human model systems (Fig. 6B). LY3039478 treatment also led to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in CCRCC cells (Fig. 6C) Next, immunodeficient NOD-scid IL2Rγ null mice were xenografted with 769-P CCRCC cells, and mice were treated with 8 mg/kg of drug and vehicle control by oral gavage. LY3039478 treatment resulted in significantly increased survival and delayed tumor growth (Fig. 6, D and E) in independent cohorts of mice demonstrating in vivo efficacy in CCRCC. Our work demonstrates that the NOTCH pathway is overexpressed in a large proportion of clear cell RCC cases. The NOTCH pathway has been shown to be an oncogenic pathway in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and head and neck cancers (16Choi K. Ahn Y.H. Gibbons D.L. Tran H.T. Creighton C.J. Girard L. Minna J.D. Qin F.X. Kurie J.M. Distinct biological roles for the notch ligands Jagged-1 and Jagged-2.J. Biol.

Components of the NOTCH signaling pathway have been shown to be active in RCC also (10Sjölund J. Johansson M. Manna S. Norin C. Pietras A. Beckman S. Nilsson E. Ljungberg B. Axelson H.

JAG2 induction in hypoxic tumor cells alters Notch signaling and enhances endothelial cell tube formation.Mol. Cancer Res. 2011; 9: 626-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although not many NOTCH mutations have been seen in these tumors. Furthermore, even though mutations have been described in the NOTCH receptors in some tumor samples, they are not sufficient to explain the activation of this pathway in the majority of tumors. Our findings show that up-regulation of NOTCH ligands JAG1 and JAG2 occur via loss of DNA methylation and gene amplifications. In addition to our data, an analysis of the TCGA data shows that both JAG1 and JAG2 are amplified in CCRCC. The TCGA data also reveals that JAG2 is also hypomethylated in CCRCC samples. Thus, it is clear that both genetic and epigenetic alterations are leading to overexpression of these NOTCH ligands in CCRCC samples. JAG1 and JAG2 can bind to the NOTCH receptor and result in two proteolytic cleavage events in the receptor that lead to its activation. Once the intracellular domain of NOTCH is cleaved, it interacts with downstream proteins to promote transcription (15Bielesz B. Sirin Y. Si H. Niranjan T. Gruenwald A. Ahn S. Kato H. Pullman J. Gessler M. Haase V.H. Susztak K. Epithelial Notch signaling regulates interstitial fibrosis development in the kidneys of mice and humans.J. Clin.

The Notch pathway in podocytes plays a role in the development of glomerular disease.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings demonstrate novel mechanisms for the activation of this pathway in CCRCC. Most importantly, the observation of both epigenetic and genetic hits leading to activation of the NOTCH pathway in different patients suggests the importance of this pathway in pathogenesis of CCRCC. Activation of the NOTCH pathway mediates effects via various downstream mediators such as transcription factors belonging to the HAIRY (HES and HEY) family. In an earlier epigenomic study in CCRCC, we observed that differentially methylated sites in tumor tissues were enriched for binding sites for HAIRY (8Hu C.Y. Mohtat D. Yu Y. Ko Y.A. Shenoy N. Bhattacharya S. Izquierdo M.C. Park A.S. Giricz O. Vallumsetla N. Gundabolu K. Ware K. Bhagat T.D. Suzuki M. Pullman J. et al.Kidney cancer is characterized by aberrant methylation of tissue-specific enhancers that are prognostic for overall survival.Clin. Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), supporting the role of NOTCH activation in downstream epigenetic changes. In the present study we observed that Myc as well as cyclin A1 and cyclin D1 were overexpressed in both NOTCH-driven renal lesions as well as in human tumors. Myc is a known direct target of the NOTCH pathway and leads to procarcinogenic proliferations seen in these tumors. A recent study demonstrated that NOTCH can bind to Myc enhancers and lead to activation of Myc transcription in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (22Herranz D. Ambesi-Impiombato A. Palomero T. Schnell S.A. Belver L. Wendorff A.A. Xu L. Castillo-Martin M. Llobet-Navás D. Cordon-Cardo C. Clappier E. Soulier J. Ferrando A.A. A NOTCH1-driven MYC enhancer promotes T cell development, transformation and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We observed that pharmacologic inhibition of the NOTCH pathway in CCRCC cells led to a significant decrease in Myc and cyclin A1 expression, demonstrating on target effects on cell cycle proliferative pathways. Furthermore, we observed that intracellular activation of NOTCH in murine renal tubular cells leads to severe dysplasia in the kidneys. These dysplastic cells acquire histologic characteristics of CCRCC and also contain molecular changes that mimic human tumors. We also observed that CCRCC tumors that overexpress NOTCH pathway have a distinct clinical outcome. The improved survival for the Jag1/Jag2 overexpressors was compared with the other cases of CCRCC (that have various other molecular alterations including PI3K pathway, chromatin, and metabolic mutations). It is possible that even though the NOTCH pathway activation is oncogenic as seen from our in vivo data, there are other pathways that are even more rapidly oncogenic in RCC. Furthermore, the in vivo data demonstrate that NOTCH activation in part leads to transcriptional changes seen in human CCRCC. Because of the lack of valid precancerous models of CCRCC pathogenesis, our findings suggest that our murine model can be used for future pathogenic and therapeutic studies in this malignancy. The NOTCH pathway is comprised of numerous family members that include ligands (Jag1, Jag2, and DLL), receptors (NOTCH 1–4), and downstream effectors. Examination of the TCGA and our data reveal that numerous ligands and receptors are overexpressed in CCRCC samples, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in this malignancy. This raises the possibility that signaling downstream from the NOTCH receptors can differ depending on the type of receptor that is activated or the ligand that is overexpressed. This can also lead to subtle differences in outcomes and survival rates, even though we saw that overall the trends were similar with overexpression of various NOTCH components. These differences that can arise from the complexity of the pathway will be tested in subsequent studies, especially if NOTCH pathway inhibitors are translated into clinical trials in CCRCC. NOTCH inhibition has been explored as a therapeutic strategy in various tumors. γ-Secretase is an internal protease that cleaves within the membrane-spanning domain of the NOTCH protein thus leading to its activation. Various γ-secretase inhibitors have been developed and are being tested in clinical trials. Adverse effects such as gastrointestinal toxicities have been seen with previous inhibitors thus limiting their clinical development. LY-3039478 is a novel γ-secretase inhibitor that has shown specific activity in inhibiting the NOTCH pathway (23Massard C. Azaro A. Le Tourneau C. Soria J. Alt M. Smith C. Ohnmacht U. Oakeley G. Patel B. Yuen E. Benhadji K. Ahnert J. First-in-human study of LY3039478, a Notch signaling inhibitor in advanced or metastatic cancer.J. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 33Crossref Google Scholar) and is being tested in clinical trials. In the present study, we demonstrate significant in vivo activity of this compound and provide a preclinical rationale for the use of this and similar agents in future trials in CCRCC. In total, 13 RCC samples and 13 control samples were collected from tumor nephrectomies performed at Montefiore Medical Center. Samples were collected under institutional review board protocol approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (supplemental Table S5). Kidney samples were obtained from living allograft donors, surgical nephrectomies, and leftover portions of diagnostic kidney biopsies. Nephrectomies were anonymized with the corresponding clinical information and were collected by an individual who was not involved in the research protocol. These samples were collected without consent. For protocol allograft and kidney biopsies, informed consent was obtained from the donor. Tissue was placed into RNALater and manually microdissected at 4 °C for the tubular compartment (as renal cell cancer originates from tubular epithelial cells) (24Woroniecka K.I. Park A.S. Mohtat D.

We used a Zeiss stereomicroscope under 60× magnification for the microdissection. Genomic DNA was isolated using the dialysis tubing method, as performed and described previously (13Alvarez H.

RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits. An additional seven non-tumor and tumor pairs were used for qRT-PCR-based confirmation studies. The HELP assay was carried out as previously published (8Hu C.Y. Mohtat D. Yu Y. Ko Y.A. Shenoy N. Bhattacharya S. Izquierdo M.C. Park A.S. Giricz O. Vallumsetla N. Gundabolu K. Ware K. Bhagat T.D.

Validation of HELP microarray findings was carried out by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using EpiTYPER by MassARRAY (Sequenom, CA) on bisulfite-converted DNA as previously described (26Figueroa M.E.

MassARRAY primers were designed to cover the flanking HpaII sites for a given HAF, as well as any other HpaII sites found up to 2,000 bp upstream of the downstream site and up to 2,000 bp downstream of the upstream site, to cover all possible alternative sites of digestion. Jag1 intergenic regions were examined by MassARRAY in primary CCRCC samples, as well as in decitabine-treated human kidney-derived cell lines. The MspI representation in a HELP assay is not affected by cytosine methylation but is instead dependent on the amount of DNA available and thus was used to detect copy number variation, as described previously (8Hu C.Y.

The data were normalized using HPRT as housekeeping gene and the ddCT method. Normal human kidney tubular epithelial cell line HK2 and renal cell cancer cell lines 786-O, 769-P, and Caki were purchased from ATCC (with authentication). HKC-8 cells were kindly provided by Lorainne Racusen (Johns Hopkins University). The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, insulin, transferrin, and selenium. All the ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the Roadmap database with GEO accession numbers specified below (NCBI Build GRCh37/UCSC Build hg19).

These included 405 CCRCC samples and 68 non-tumor kidney controls (12Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). Mice with TEC-specific overexpression of NOTCH1 intracellular domain and deletion of VHL were achieved by crossing the Kspcre mice (kindly provided by Dr. Igarashi, UTSW) with Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(NOTCH1)Dam mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 008159) and VHL floxed mice (Vhltm1Jae, obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 004081). The major role of Jag1 and Jag2 is to activate Notch signaling. It has been difficult to express active Jagged1 on cell surface in vivo that would lead to Notch activation. This is mostly because following ligand presentation, Jagged1 is endocytosed with Notch extracellular domain. For these reasons, expression of Notch intracellular domain is the most accepted way to examine the role and effect of Notch signaling in vivo. Animals were identified by tail genomic PCR analysis. Male 8-week-old Kspcre VHLf/f ICNotch1 mice and Kspcre VHLf/f littermate controls were used in this study. Animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Transcriptome analysis overlap was performed using differentially expressed genes (fold change > 2 and false discovery rate < 0.05) from Notch mouse model and CCRCC expression data. The orthologues were identified using MGI vertebrate homology. For the gene set enrichment analysis, the top 100 significant genes were selected from Notch data, and the enrichment levels were determined for the orthologues in CCRCC expression data. Control and RCC human kidney samples were performed using NOTCH1, DLL4, and JAGGED1 specific antibodies as previously described (30Kinney S.R. Pradhan S. Ten eleven translocation enzymes and 5-hydroxymethylation in mammalian development and cancer.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2013; 754: 57-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For in vitro studies, LY3039478 was compared with DMSO controls in RCC cell lines. The cell cycle was assessed by FACS using propidium iodide staining. For in vivo studies, LY3039478 was administered via oral gavage formulated in 1% Na-CMC, 0.25% Tween 80, and 0.05% anti-foam. Dosing was done at 8 mg/kg on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule.

https://openalex.org/W2557606849,"Despite the remarkable progress to fight against breast cancer, metastasis remains the dominant cause of treatment failure and recurrence. Therefore, control of invasiveness potential of breast cancer cells is crucial. Accumulating evidences suggest Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a promising target to control migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. Thus, an Ahr-based exploration was performed to identify a new Ahr agonist with inhibitory potentials on cancer cell motility.For prediction of potential interactions between Ahr and candidate molecules, bioinformatics analysis was carried out. The interaction of the selected ligand with Ahr and its effects on migration and invasion were examined in vitro using the MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell lines. The silencing RNAs were transfected into cells by electroporation. Expressions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and coding genes were quantified by real-time PCR, and the protein levels were detected by western blot.The in silico and in vitro results identified Flavipin as a novel Ahr agonist. It induces formation of Ahr/Ahr nuclear translocator (Arnt) heterodimer to promote the expression of cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp1a1). Migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells were inhibited with Flavipin treatment in an Ahr-dependent fashion. Interestingly, Flavipin suppressed the pro-metastatic factor SRY-related HMG-box4 (Sox4) by inducing miR-212/132 cluster. Moreover, Flavipin inhibited growth and adhesion of both cell lines by suppressing gene expressions of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and integrinα4 (ITGA4).Taken together, the results introduce Flavipin as a novel Ahr agonist, and provide first evidences on its inhibitory effects on cancer cell motility, suggesting Flavipin as a candidate to control cell invasiveness in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2559203822,"Environmental pollution with heavy metals is a serious issue worldwide posing threats to humans, animals and plants and to the stability of overall ecosystem. Chromium (Cr) is one of most hazardous heavy metals with a high carcinogenic and recalcitrant nature. Aim of the present study was to select low-cost biosorbent using wheat straw and Eupatorium adenophorum through simple carbonization process, capable of removing Cr (VI) efficiently from wastewater. From studied plants a low cost adsorbent was prepared for removing Cr (VI) from aqueous solution following very simple carbonization method excluding activation process. Several factors such as pH, contact time, sorbent dosage and temperature were investigated for attaining ideal condition. For analysis of adsorption equilibrium isotherm data, Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models were used while pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, external diffusion and intra-particle diffusion models were used for the analysis of kinetic data. The obtained results revealed that 99.9% of Cr (VI) removal was observed in the solution with a pH of 1.0. Among all the tested models Langmuir model fitted more closely according to the data obtained. Increase in adsorption capacity was observed with increasing temperature revealing endothermic nature of Cr (VI). The maximum Cr (VI) adsorption potential of E. adenophorum and wheat straw was 89.22 mg per 1 gram adsorbent at 308K. Kinetic data of absorption precisely followed pseudo-second-order model. Present study revealed highest potential of E. adenophorum and wheat straw for producing low cost adsorbent and to remove Cr (VI) from contaminated water."
https://openalex.org/W2558791186,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are malignant brain tumors with a median survival of less than 18 months. Redundancy of signaling pathways represented within GBMs contributes to their therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles released from cells and present in human biofluids that represent a possible biomarker of tumor signaling state that could aid in personalized treatment. Herein, we demonstrate that mouse GBM cell-derived extracellular nanovesicles resembling exosomes from an H-RasV12 myr-Akt mouse model for GBM are enriched for intracellular signaling cascade proteins (GO: 0007242) and Ras protein signal transduction (GO: 0007265), and contain active Ras. Active Ras isolated from human and mouse GBM extracellular nanovesicles lysates using the Ras-binding domain of Raf also coprecipitates with ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-associated exosome proteins Vps4a and Alix. Although we initially hypothesized a role for active Ras protein signaling in exosome biogenesis, we found that GTP binding of K-Ras was dispensable for its packaging within extracellular nanovesicles and for the release of Alix. By contrast, farnesylation of K-Ras was required for its packaging within extracellular nanovesicles, yet expressing a K-Ras farnesylation mutant did not decrease the number of nanovesicles or the amount of Alix protein released per cell. Overall, these results emphasize the primary importance of membrane association in packaging of extracellular nanovesicle factors and indicate that screening nanovesicles within human fluids could provide insight into tissue origin and the wiring of signaling proteins at membranes to predict onset and behavior of cancer and other diseases linked to deregulated membrane signaling states. Glioblastomas (GBMs) are malignant brain tumors with a median survival of less than 18 months. Redundancy of signaling pathways represented within GBMs contributes to their therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles released from cells and present in human biofluids that represent a possible biomarker of tumor signaling state that could aid in personalized treatment. Herein, we demonstrate that mouse GBM cell-derived extracellular nanovesicles resembling exosomes from an H-RasV12 myr-Akt mouse model for GBM are enriched for intracellular signaling cascade proteins (GO: 0007242) and Ras protein signal transduction (GO: 0007265), and contain active Ras. Active Ras isolated from human and mouse GBM extracellular nanovesicles lysates using the Ras-binding domain of Raf also coprecipitates with ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-associated exosome proteins Vps4a and Alix. Although we initially hypothesized a role for active Ras protein signaling in exosome biogenesis, we found that GTP binding of K-Ras was dispensable for its packaging within extracellular nanovesicles and for the release of Alix. By contrast, farnesylation of K-Ras was required for its packaging within extracellular nanovesicles, yet expressing a K-Ras farnesylation mutant did not decrease the number of nanovesicles or the amount of Alix protein released per cell. Overall, these results emphasize the primary importance of membrane association in packaging of extracellular nanovesicle factors and indicate that screening nanovesicles within human fluids could provide insight into tissue origin and the wiring of signaling proteins at membranes to predict onset and behavior of cancer and other diseases linked to deregulated membrane signaling states."
https://openalex.org/W2558927302,"Emerging and changing evidence made it necessary to update STOPP-START criteria, and version 2 was published recently. In this study the objectives were to determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication prescribing (PIM) in primary care using STOPP versions 1 (v1) and 2 (v2), as well as 2012 AGS Beers criteria, and analyze the factors associated with inappropriate prescribing according to STOPP/START v2. A cross-sectional study was carried out including community-dwelling older adults over the age of 65. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional and comprehensive drug therapy data were collected. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients receiving at least one PIM. This variable was measured using three tools: STOPP v1, 2012 AGS Beers criteria and STOPP v2. Similarly, the percentage of patients receiving at least one potential prescribing omission (PPO) was calculated using START versions 1 and 2. A total of 1,615 prescriptions were reviewed. The median number of medications per patient was 7.1 drugs (±3.8). The prevalence of elderly people exposed to polypharmacy (≥5 medications) was 72.9%, whereas 28.4% of the participants took ≥10 drugs regularly. PIM were present in 18.7%, 37.3% and 40.4% of participants, according to the STOPP v1, 2012 Beers criteria and STOPP v2, respectively. According to STOPP v2, the number of medications taken (OR: 1.14, 1.06–1.25), the presence of a psychological disorder (OR: 2.22, 1.13–4.37) and insomnia (OR: 3.35, 1.80–6.32) were risk factors for taking a PIM. The prevalence of PPOs was 34.7% and 21.8% according to version 1 and 2, respectively. In conclusion, STOPP-START criteria have been remarkably modified, which is evidenced by the different prevalence rates detected using version 2, as compared to version 1. In fact, the level of agreement between version 1 and the updated version is only moderate. Special attention should be paid on benzodiazepines, which keep being the most frequent PIM."
https://openalex.org/W2559664119,"Accumulating evidence implicates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as a mediator of impaired lipid metabolism, thereby contributing to fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis. Previous studies demonstrated that ER stress can activate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2), an ER-localized transcription factor that directly up-regulates sterol regulatory genes, including PCSK9. Given that PCSK9 contributes to atherosclerosis by targeting low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) degradation, this study investigates a novel mechanism by which ER stress plays a role in lipid metabolism by examining its ability to modulate PCSK9 expression. Herein, we demonstrate the existence of two independent effects of ER stress on PCSK9 expression and secretion. In cultured HuH7 and HepG2 cells, agents or conditions that cause ER Ca2+ depletion, including thapsigargin, induced SREBP2-dependent up-regulation of PCSK9 expression. In contrast, a significant reduction in the secreted form of PCSK9 protein was observed in the media from both thapsigargin- and tunicamycin (TM)-treated HuH7 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes, and in the plasma of TM-treated C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, TM significantly increased hepatic LDLR expression and reduced plasma LDL concentrations in mice. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which ER Ca2+ depletion promotes the activation of SREBP2 and subsequent transcription of PCSK9. However, conditions that cause ER stress regardless of their ability to dysregulate ER Ca2+ inhibit PCSK9 secretion, thereby reducing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and promoting LDLR-dependent hepatic cholesterol uptake. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that the retention of PCSK9 in the ER may serve as a potential strategy for lowering LDL cholesterol levels."
https://openalex.org/W2557352986,"Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide that mediates many physiological as well as inflammatory responses. Recently, SP has been implicated in the resolution of inflammation through induction of M2 macrophages phenotype. The shift between M1-like and M2-like, allowing the resolution of inflammatory processes, also takes place by means of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 is induced in response to oxidative stress and inflammatory stimuli and modulates the immune response through macrophages polarisation. SP induces HO-1 expression in human periodontal ligament (PDL), the latter potentially plays a role in cytoprotection. We demonstrated that SP promotes M2-like phenotype from resting as well as from M1 macrophages. Indeed, SP triggers the production of interleukine-10 (IL-10), interleukine-4 (IL-4) and arginase-1 (Arg1) without nitric oxide (NO) generation. In addition, SP increases HO-1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Here we report that SP, without affecting cell viability, significantly reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukine-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and ameliorates migration and phagocytic properties in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. M2-like conversion required retention of NF-κB p65 into the cytoplasm and HO-1 induced expression. Silencing of the HO-1 mRNA expression reversed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 stimulated by LPS and down-regulated anti-inflammatory hallmarks of M2 phenotype. In conclusion, our data show that SP treatment might be associated with anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by suppressing NF-κB activation and inducing HO-1 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2557287572,"Jasmonic acid is a plant hormone that can be produced by the fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae via submerged fermentation. From a biotechnological perspective jasmonic acid is a valuable feedstock as its derivatives serve as important ingredients in different cosmetic products and in the future it may be used for pharmaceutical applications. The objective of this work was to improve the production of jasmonic acid by L. theobromae strain 2334. We observed that jasmonic acid formation is dependent on the culture volume. Moreover, cultures grown in medium containing potassium nitrate as nitrogen source produced higher amounts of jasmonic acid than analogous cultures supplemented with ammonium nitrate. When cultivated under optimal conditions for jasmonic acid production, L. theobromae secreted several secondary metabolites known from plants into the medium. Among those we found 3-oxo-2-(pent-2-enyl)-cyclopentane-1-butanoic acid (OPC-4) and hydroxy-jasmonic acid derivatives, respectively, suggesting that fungal jasmonate metabolism may involve similar reaction steps as that of plants. To characterize fungal growth and jasmonic acid-formation, we established a mathematical model describing both processes. This model may form the basis of industrial upscaling attempts. Importantly, it showed that jasmonic acid-formation is not associated to fungal growth. Therefore, this finding suggests that jasmonic acid, despite its enormous amount being produced upon fungal development, serves merely as secondary metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W2558418741,"Background Obesity is associated with severe co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. However, studies have shown that 10–25 percent of the severely obese individuals are metabolically healthy. To date, the identification of genetic factors underlying the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) state is limited. Systems genetics approaches have led to the identification of genes and pathways in complex diseases. Here, we have used such approaches across tissues to detect genes and pathways involved in obesity-induced disease development. Methods Expression data of 60 severely obese individuals was accessible, of which 28 individuals were MHO and 32 were metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). A whole genome expression profile of four tissues was available: liver, muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue. Using insulin-related genes, we used the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method to build within- and inter-tissue gene networks. We identified genes that were differentially connected between MHO and MUO individuals, which were further investigated by homing in on the modules they were active in. To identify potentially causal genes, we integrated genomic and transcriptomic data using an eQTL mapping approach. Results Both IL-6 and IL1B were identified as highly differentially co-expressed genes across tissues between MHO and MUO individuals, showing their potential role in obesity-induced disease development. WGCNA showed that those genes were clustering together within tissues, and further analysis showed different co-expression patterns between MHO and MUO subnetworks. A potential causal role for metabolic differences under similar obesity state was detected for PTPRE, IL-6R and SLC6A5. Conclusions We used a novel integrative approach by integration of co-expression networks across tissues to elucidate genetic factors related to obesity-induced metabolic disease development. The identified genes and their interactions give more insight into the genetic architecture of obesity and the association with co-morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2559445021,"Ligand binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) results in dimerization of their cytosolic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains and recruitment of post-receptor signal transducers into a complex signalosome. TLR activation leads to the production of transcription factors and pro-inflammatory molecules and the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) in a process that requires the multimodular B-cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (BCAP). BCAP has a sequence previously proposed as a ""cryptic"" TIR domain. Here, we present the structure of the N-terminal region of human BCAP and show that it possesses a canonical TIR fold. Dimeric BCAP associates with the TIR domains of TLR2/4 and MAL/TIRAP, suggesting that it is recruited to the TLR signalosome by multitypic TIR-TIR interactions. BCAP also interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3K and phospholipase Cγ, enzymes that deplete plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and these interactions provide a molecular explanation for BCAP-mediated down-regulation of inflammatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2559663962,"The stromal compartment of secondary lymphoid organs is classicaly known for providing a mechanical scaffold for the complex interactions between hematopoietic cells during immune activation as well as for providing a niche which is favorable for survival of lymphocytes. In recent years, it became increasingly clear that these cells also play an active role during such a response. Currently, knowledge of the interactions between human lymphoid stroma and hematopoietic cells is still lacking and most insight is based on murine systems. Although methods to isolate stromal cells from tonsils have been reported, data on stability in culture, characterization, and functional properties are lacking. Here, we describe a reproducible and easy method for isolation and in vitro culture of functional human lymphoid stromal cells from palatine tonsils. The cells isolated express markers and characteristics of T cell zone fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and react to inflammatory stimuli by upregulating inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as adhesion molecules, as previously described for mouse lymphoid stroma. Also, cultured tonsil stromal cells support survival of human innate lymphoid cells, showing that these stromal cells can function as bone fide FRCs, providing a favorable microenvironment for hematopoietic cells."

Although CT systems have been researched and successfully implemented on some farms in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV), overall adoption is low and the reasons for the region’s comparatively low rates of adoption are not known. In 2011, we conducted written surveys and interviews with SJV farmers to identify characteristics of farmers who adopt or do not adopt CT, to determine reasons for non-adoption of CT, and to learn how successful CT adoption takes place in the SJV. We found that a universally acceptable definition of CT needs to be developed in order for effective research, outreach and communication on CT. Our research, which examined CT adoption within the expected progression of the diffusion of innovation model, suggested that larger and less diverse farms were more likely to use CT. Most farmers expressed transition to CT as a continuous learning process. Further, we conclude that gaining meaningful experience with CT practices by researchers in the local context is also a large component of successful adoption."

A major challenge in the post-genomic era is that a large fraction of protein-coding genes remain functionally unknown or poorly characterized in all sequenced genomes (1Hanson A.D. Pribat A.

Even in a well characterized organism such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the number of protein-coding genes with no known biological function, based on database searches in UniProt, amounts to ∼30%, which corresponds to about 2000 proteins. In this study, we investigated the function of two proteins of unknown function, the S. cerevisiae Ydr109c protein (Q04585) and its human homolog FGGY (Q96C11). Both proteins contain the highly conserved FGGY_N and FGGY_C Pfam domains. The members of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, of which more than 8000 sequences are known according to the Pfam database, are widespread across the various kingdoms of life and show a high functional diversification (3Zhang Y.

Performing a genome-wide association study comparing healthy controls and S-ALS patients of European Caucasian descent living in the United States, the authors reported 10 statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with S-ALS. The most significant gene associated with S-ALS was FGGY (FLJ10986). Assessment of FGGY expression in the same study using Western blotting indicated the presence of FGGY protein in cerebrospinal fluid, spinal cord, small intestine, lung, kidney, liver, and fetal brain. Association of the FGGY gene with S-ALS could, however, not be confirmed in subsequent studies using different cohorts (5Chen Y. Zeng Y. Huang R. Yang Y. Chen K. Song W. Zhao B. Li J. Yuan L.

The contradictory results on the involvement of FGGY in S-ALS were suggested to be due to the variable causes and complexity of the disease itself (10Cai B. Tang L. Zhang N. Fan D.

An exome sequencing study, which was carried out in a family with three female patients affected by bipolar disorder and one unaffected male sibling, identified heterozygous, very rare, and likely protein-damaging variants in eight brain-expressed genes, including FGGY (11Kerner B.

Replication and functional studies would, however, be required to confirm disease association and test causality, respectively, of the identified variants. Although these observations suggest a possible link of the FGGY gene with neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders, the overall evidence supporting this link thus remains limited at this stage. In recent years, metabolomics has emerged as a new tool for discovery of enzyme function. Untargeted metabolomics has enabled us to analyze metabolites in biological samples in a much more comprehensive way and is a powerful technique for hypothesis generation. A remaining challenge of this methodology is metabolite identification; the data obtained via untargeted metabolomics contains thousands of metabolite features, with relatively few being identified in the end (12Patti G.J. Yanes O. Siuzdak G. Innovation: metabolomics: the apogee of the omics trilogy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). In contrast to untargeted metabolomics, targeted metabolomics serves to identify and/or quantify a more or less limited set of preselected metabolites. In the field of enzymology, metabolomics or metabolite profiling techniques may be exploited to identify endogenous enzyme substrates. Ewald et al. (13Ewald J.C. Matt T. Zamboni N. The integrated response of primary metabolites to gene deletions and the environment.Mol. Biosyst. 2013; 9: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) studied the effect of single enzymatic gene deletions in central carbon metabolism and of environmental changes on the metabolome of S. cerevisiae. 30–40% of the enzymatic gene deletions tested led to a very local metabolic response in proximity of the enzyme deficiency (often accumulation of the substrate of the deleted enzyme) (13Ewald J.C. Matt T. Zamboni N. The integrated response of primary metabolites to gene deletions and the environment.Mol. Biosyst. 2013; 9: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The observations suggest that this approach is a viable strategy for enzyme function identifications through comparative metabolomics analyses of wild-type cells and cells deficient in metabolic enzymes of unknown function. A notable advantage of this type of approach over in vitro substrate screens with purified enzymes is the higher likelihood of identifying the true physiological or endogenous substrate(s) of the deleted enzyme under investigation (14Saghatelian A. Trauger S.A. Want E.J. Hawkins E.G. Siuzdak G. Cravatt B.F.

Melamud E. Singer A. Gooding J.R. Xu X. Dong A. Cui H. Campagna S.R. Savchenko A. Yakunin A.F. Rabinowitz J.D. Caudy A.A. Riboneogenesis in yeast.Cell. 2011; 145: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and mammalian sedoheptulokinase (SHPK) (16Wamelink M.M. Struys E.A. Jansen E.E. Levtchenko E.N. Zijlstra F.S. Engelke U. Blom H.J. Jakobs C. Wevers R.A. Sedoheptulokinase deficiency due to a 57-kb deletion in cystinosis patients causes urinary accumulation of sedoheptulose: elucidation of the CARKL gene.Hum. Mutat. 2008; 29: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). LC-MS-based metabolite profiling can involve full scan or tandem MS methods. In the full scan MS methods, only the m/z of parent ions and/or adducts of the parent ions are utilized along with the retention time characteristic of each molecule to identify detected metabolites. Tandem MS methods increase the potential for metabolite identification by allowing the generation of m/z fingerprints (MS2 spectra), obtained by fragmenting the parent ions, that can then be matched with those of metabolite standards. We used a combination of untargeted full scan MS, ddMS2, and targeted methods to search for the endogenous substrate of the S. cerevisiae Ydr109c protein using ydr109cΔ knock-out strains. We found that ribulose was one of the most significantly changed metabolites, accumulating in the ydr109cΔ mutants as compared with the wild-type control strains. d-Ribulose was subsequently shown to be the preferred substrate of the yeast Ydr109c kinase as well as for its human homolog FGGY in vitro. In contrast to yeast cells, ribulose formation in human HEK293 cells could only be detected when ribitol was supplemented to the cultivation medium. Under this condition, FGGY knockdown led to ribulose accumulation in the HEK293 cells. Taken together, our results establish the molecular identity of d-ribulokinase in yeast and humans. Furthermore, combined sequence and structural analyses allowed us to identify a conserved signature motif that enables the prediction of d-ribulokinase activity with high confidence for FGGY protein family members. The YDR109C gene is currently annotated as an uncharacterized open reading frame in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), which means, according to the SGD glossary, that “there are no specific experimental data demonstrating that a gene product is produced in S. cerevisiae.” In addition, no molecular or biological function has been assigned to this gene yet. Therefore, we started by investigating YDR109C expression in our prototrophic WT strain by quantitative RT-PCR. The YDR109C transcript was readily detected in exponentially growing wild-type cells (Fig. 1), with an average measured cycle threshold (Ct) value of 26.3 ± 0.3 (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) as compared with an average measured Ct value of 23.8 ± 0.5 (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) for the mannosyltransferase ALG9, which is commonly used as a reference gene for quantitative RT-PCR studies in S. cerevisiae (17Teste M.-A. Duquenne M. François J.M. Parrou J.-L. Validation of reference genes for quantitative expression analysis by real-time RT-PCR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.BMC Mol. Biol. 2009; 10: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The YDR109C transcript was not detectable in our ydr109cΔ prototrophic knock-out strain (Fig. 1). These results show that YDR109C is transcribed in S. cerevisiae and indicate that our knock-out strain is a good model to explore the function of this gene. The Ydr109c protein was also detected and quantified (119 molecules/cell) in a proteomics study (18Kulak N.A. Pichler G. Paron I. Nagaraj N. Mann M. Minimal, encapsulated proteomic-sample processing applied to copy-number estimation in eukaryotic cells.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The Ydr109c protein sequence contains the widely conserved Pfam FGGY_N and FGGY_C domains, suggesting that it functions, as other members of the FGGY protein superfamily, as a kinase acting on sugars or sugar derivatives. To identify endogenous substrate candidates of this putative sugar kinase, we analyzed the polar metabolites extracted from our prototrophic WT and ydr109cΔ strains using LC-HRMS. Two complementary methods, ZIC-HILIC coupled to ddMS2 and reverse phase chromatography coupled to full scan MS with polarity switching, were used. Ribulose was found to be the metabolite with the highest fold change (more than 30-fold increase in KO versus WT), among the ones confirmed to be produced endogenously by the co-cultivation method described below, using the ZIC-HILIC-ddMS2 method in negative ionization mode (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). We repeated the same analysis in metabolite extracts derived from a ydr109cΔ deletion strain in the auxotrophic background BY4741 and the corresponding WT strain. As for the prototrophic strains, ribulose was identified as the most significantly changed metabolite, accumulating in the auxotrophic ydr109cΔ mutant, among the metabolites detected in negative mode (23-fold increase in KO versus WT; supplemental Table S2). Identification of the accumulating compound as ribulose was based on accurate mass (m/z 149.0445), co-elution with a d-ribulose standard (Fig. 2A), and MS2 fragmentation pattern (Fig. 2B). Polar metabolites were separated better using ZIC-HILIC; the bulk of yeast polar metabolites eluted very early with our reverse phase chromatography method and was therefore not used for further experiments in this study. Using the ZIC-HILIC-based method, we were able to separate ribulose from other pentoses (Fig. 2C). We were, however, not able to separate the d- and l-forms of ribulose. Although we could detect a number of other sugars and sugar derivatives, including glucose, arabinose, mannitol, ribitol, maltose, xylose, galactose, and 2-deoxyribose (identification based on accurate mass and co-elution with standards) in the analyzed yeast metabolite extracts, only ribitol showed significantly different levels (>2-fold higher in the prototrophic and auxotrophic KO strains than in the corresponding WT strains; supplemental Tables S1–S4) upon YDR109C deletion in addition to ribulose. Taken together, these analyses highlighted ribulose as a strong endogenous substrate candidate for the putative Ydr109c kinase. Free ribulose has not been described so far as an endogenous metabolite in S. cerevisiae, and there is also no entry for ribulose in the YMDB (19Jewison T. Knox C. Neveu V. Djoumbou Y. Guo A.C. Lee J. Liu P. Mandal R. Krishnamurthy R. Sinelnikov I. Wilson M. Wishart D.S. YMDB: the yeast metabolome database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D815-D820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our detection of ribulose accumulation in yeast strains grown on controlled minimal medium containing d-glucose as the sole carbon source suggested that yeast cells can form free ribulose from d-glucose. We wanted to consolidate this observation via stable isotope labeling (SIL) experiments in which we replaced the non-labeled glucose with d-[U-13C]glucose in an otherwise identical cultivation medium. In these experiments, we observed a +5 m/z shift for the pentose peak (monoisotopic mass of 154.0612) accumulating in the ydr109cΔ mutant and perfectly co-eluting with a supplemented d-[12C]ribulose standard (Fig. 2D). As can also be seen in Fig. 2D, supplemented non-labeled d-xylulose and d-ribose standards, which elute in close proximity to the d-ribulose standard (see Fig. 2C), eluted slightly later than the labeled pentose accumulating in the ydr109cΔ mutant. These results consolidate the identity of the compound building up after deletion of the YDR109C gene as ribulose and show that S. cerevisiae can produce this compound from d-glucose. Using a 13C internal standard isotope dilution MS method and biovolume measurement by Coulter counter, we estimated an intracellular ribulose concentration of 0.054 ± 0.010 and 2.2 ± 0.3 mm (means ± S.D.; n = 6) for the prototrophic WT and ydr109cΔ strains, respectively. The ZIC-HILIC-ddMS2 data obtained with the prototrophic strains were further analyzed to investigate whether the levels of additional metabolites were significantly affected in response to YDR109C gene deletion. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the mTIC-normalized negative and positive mode data produced clusters separating WT and ydr109cΔ samples in a PC1 versus PC2 plot in which all the replicates were within the 95% CI of their group centroids (Fig. 3, A and B). Because PCA is an unsupervised visualization method, which is not guaranteed to preserve well the distances between the original untransformed data points, the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) supervised method was additionally used to investigate the separability between the sample groups and to find features important in differentiating the WT from the ydr109cΔ strain. The data showed clear separation of the WT and ydr109cΔ replicate groups using PLS-DA as well, with again all the replicates lying within the 95% CI of their respective group (Fig. 3, C and D). The supplemental Tables S1–S4 contain a column with variable importance in projection scores for all the listed m/z features, reflecting their importance for PLS-DA separation of the WT and ydr109cΔ samples. Fold changes between the prototrophic WT and ydr109cΔ strains for each metabolite feature detected by ZIC-HILIC-ddMS2 and associated p values were calculated using Welch’s t test for unequal variances. Unexpectedly, the levels of as many as 92 and 213 non-redundant metabolite features having m/z matches in the KEGG database were found to be changed at least 2-fold and with a p value lower than 0.05 between the two strains in the negative and positive ionization modes, respectively. These numbers dropped to 26 and 69 non-redundant metabolite features, respectively, when only features with additional m/z matches in the YMDB (19Jewison T. Knox C. Neveu V. Djoumbou Y. Guo A.C. Lee J. Liu P. Mandal R. Krishnamurthy R. Sinelnikov I. Wilson M. Wishart D.S. YMDB: the yeast metabolome database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D815-D820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were retained (supplemental Tables S1 and S3). Interestingly, several intermediates of the arginine synthesis pathway (N-acetylglutamate, ornithine, N-acetylornithine, and N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde; supplemental Table S3) as well as several intermediates or derivatives of the kynurenine pathway for tryptophan catabolism (tryptophan itself, formylkynurenine, kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, kynurenic acid, and xanthurenic acid) ranged among the most significantly changed metabolites, and accordingly, some of those metabolites also had the highest scores in the PLS-DA. Given that those two pathways do not share any obvious connection with ribulose metabolism, we wanted to test whether similar changes could also be found upon YDR109C deletion in a different genetic background. We therefore also analyzed the ZIC-HILIC-ddMS2 data obtained for the auxotrophic WT and ydr109cΔ strains using multivariate and univariate statistics. In strong contrast to the prototrophic strains, the auxotrophic WT and ydr109cΔ strains showed much more similar metabolite profiles, and corresponding samples did not form two separate clusters after PCA of the non-targeted metabolomics data obtained in negative or positive ionization mode (data not shown). Data analysis using the Welch’s t test yielded nevertheless 8 and 21 significantly changed metabolite features (2 and 11 metabolite features when retaining only features with matches in both the KEGG and YMDB databases; supplemental Tables S2 and S4) in the auxotrophic ydr109cΔ strain compared with the WT strain in the negative and positive ionization mode, respectively. Comparing those changes to the ones observed for the prototrophic strains, only two metabolites differed significantly between WT and KO in both genetic backgrounds in the negative mode (ribulose and ribitol), and nine metabolites were changed significantly in the KO versus the WT strain in both genetic backgrounds in the positive mode (all metabolites listed in supplemental Table S4, except for 4-aminobutanoate and methionine sulfoxide). As described above, this showed that the ribulose and ribitol accumulations observed upon YDR109C deletion are robust changes likely to be specifically linked to this gene, whereas the metabolite changes observed in the arginine synthesis and tryptophan degradation pathways upon YDR109C deletion in the prototrophic strain are background-specific. To further test which of the KO versus WT metabolite changes in the prototrophic background were specifically caused by YDR109C deficiency, we generated a rescue strain (KOres or ydr109cΔ rescue) expressing YDR109C under the control of the endogenous promoter from a low copy number plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin B (p41Hyg 1-F) in the ydr109cΔ background. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we measured two times higher YDR109C transcript levels in the rescue strain than in the corresponding wild-type strain (Fig. 1), validating the rescue strategy at the gene expression level. The YDR109C transcript was not detectable in a ydr109cΔ strain transformed with an empty plasmid (KOcnt or ydr109cΔ empty plasmid; Fig. 1). Polar metabolites extracted from the KOcnt and KOres strains were analyzed using ZIC-HILIC-ddMS2 in positive and negative ionization mode. Although ribulose levels were consistently lower in the rescue strain than in the empty vector control strain (KOcnt/KOres ratio of 1.7 with a p value of 0.0000005 calculated using the unequal variances Welch’s t test; n = 6), the rescue efficiency was only very partial at the metabolite level given the more than 30-fold higher levels of ribulose measured in the non-transformed ydr109cΔ strain compared with the prototrophic wild-type control strain (supplemental Table S1). Except for N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylglutamate 5-semialdehyde, ribitol, and deoxyribose, other metabolite changes observed in the prototrophic ydr109cΔ strain compared with the wild type were either not found or were found to vary in opposite direction in the KOcnt versus KOres strain comparison (data not shown). Such results typically would suggest that those supplementary changes in the metabolite profiles of the original strains were due to the presence of secondary mutations present in the ydr109cΔ mutant but not in the wild-type control strain. However, given the incomplete rescue of the ribulose metabolic phenotype, it seems that the rescue plasmid used led, for reasons that remain unclear, to the formation of a transcript that does not allow reconstitution of wild-type protein and/or wild-type enzyme activity levels, potentially explaining why other metabolic changes were not rescued.

The successful integration of peers into outreach efforts and wider access to HIV point-of-care testing (POCT) create opportunities to explore the role of peers in providing HIV testing. The PROUD study, in partnership with Ottawa Public Health (OPH), sought to develop a model for community-based peer-administered HIV POCT.PROUD draws on community-based participatory research methods to better understand the HIV risk environment of people who use drugs in Ottawa. From March-October 2013, 593 people who reported injecting drugs or smoking crack cocaine were enrolled through street-based recruitment. Trained peer or medical student researchers administered a quantitative survey and offered an HIV POCT (bioLytical INSTI test) to participants who did not self-report as HIV positive.550 (92.7%) of the 593 participants were offered a POCT, of which 458 (83.3%) consented to testing. Of those participants, 74 (16.2%) had never been tested for HIV. There was no difference in uptake between testing offered by a peer versus a non-peer interviewer (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.67-1.66). Despite testing those at high risk for HIV, only one new reactive test was identified.The findings from PROUD demonstrate high uptake of community-based HIV POCT. Peers were able to successfully provide HIV POCT and reach participants who had not previously been tested for HIV. Community-based and peer testing models provide important insights on ways to scale-up HIV prevention and testing among people who use drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2559267479,"Background Even with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved. Objectives The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80°C. Methods Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH). Results Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months. Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C. These findings have relevance both to high value, ground-based experiments when sample collection capability is severely constrained, and to spaceflight experiments that entail on-orbit sample recovery by astronauts."
https://openalex.org/W2558420251,"Dispersal and gene flow are important mechanisms affecting the dynamics of vectors and their pathogens. Here, patterns of genetic diversity were analyzed in many North European populations of the tick, Ixodes ricinus. Population sites were selected within and between areas separated by geographical barriers in order to evaluate the importance of tick transportation by birds in producing genetic connectivity across open sea and mountain ranges. The phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial control region and the cytochrome b gene revealed two distinct clades with supported sub-clades, with three genetic lineages: GB and WNo associated with Great Britain and western Norway respectively, and Eu with a wider distribution across continental Europe in agreement with much lower efficiency of tick dispersal by birds than by large mammals. The results suggest different ancestry of I. ricinus colonizing Britain and the rest of northern Europe, possibly from different glacial refuges, while ticks from western Norway and continental Europe share a more recent common ancestry. Demographic history modeling suggests a period of strong increase in tick abundance coincident with progression of the European Neolithic culture, long after their post-glacial colonization of NW Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2559510290,"Biogeography studies that correlate the observed distribution of organisms to environmental variables are typically based on local conditions. However, in cases with substantial translocation, like planktonic organisms carried by ocean currents, selection may happen upstream and local environmental factors may not be representative of those that shaped the local population. Here we use an individual-based model of microbes in the global surface ocean to explore this effect for temperature. We simulate up to 25 million individual cells belonging to up to 50 species with different temperature optima. Microbes are moved around the globe based on a hydrodynamic model, and grow and die based on local temperature. We quantify the role of currents using the “advective temperature differential” metric, which is the optimum temperature of the most abundant species from the model with advection minus that from the model without advection. This differential depends on the location and can be up to 4°C. Poleward-flowing currents, like the Gulf Stream, generally experience cooling and the differential is positive. We apply our results to three global datasets. For observations of optimum growth temperature of phytoplankton, accounting for the effect of currents leads to a slightly better agreement with observations, but there is large variability and the improvement is not statistically significant. For observed Prochlorococcus ecotype ratios and metagenome nucleotide divergence, accounting for advection improves the correlation significantly, especially in areas with relatively strong poleward or equatorward currents."
https://openalex.org/W2557362574,"Synaptic vesicles (SVs) fuse with the plasma membrane at a precise location called the presynaptic active zone (AZ). This fusion is coordinated by proteins embedded within a cytoskeletal matrix assembled at the AZ (CAZ). In the present study, we have identified a novel binding partner for the CAZ proteins Piccolo and Bassoon. This interacting protein, Trio, is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) known to regulate the dynamic assembly of actin and growth factor dependent axon guidance and synaptic growth. Trio was found to interact with the C-terminal PBH 9/10 domains of Piccolo and Bassoon via its own N-terminal Spectrin repeats, a domain that is also critical for its localization to the CAZ. Moreover, our data suggest that regions within the C-terminus of Trio negatively regulate its interactions with Piccolo/Bassoon. These findings provide a mechanism for the presynaptic targeting of Trio and support a model in which Piccolo and Bassoon play a role in regulating neurotransmission through interactions with proteins, including Trio, that modulate the dynamic assembly of F-actin during cycles of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2557751294,"Experimental immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and genetically attenuated sporozoites has proved to be a promising approach for malaria vaccine development. However, parasite biomarkers of growth attenuation and enhanced immune protection in response to radiation remain poorly understood. Here, we report on the effect of an attenuating dose of γ-irradiation (15 krad) on the Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) ultrastructure by electron microscopy, growth rate of liver stage P. falciparum in liver cell cultures, and genome-wide transcriptional profile of liver stage parasites by microarray. We find that γ-irradiation treated PfSPZ retained a normal cellular structure except that they were vacuous with a partially disrupted plasma membrane and inner membrane complex. A similar infection rate was observed by γ-irradiation-treated and untreated PfSPZ in human HCO-4 liver cells (0.47% versus 0.49%, respectively) on day 3 post-infection. In the microarray studies, cumulatively, 180 liver stage parasite genes were significantly transcriptionally altered on day 3 and/or 6 post-infection. Among the transcriptionally altered biomarkers, we identified a signature of seven candidate parasite genes that associated with functionally diverse pathways that may regulate radiation induced cell cycle arrest of the parasite within the hepatocyte. A repertoire of 14 genes associated with protein translation is transcriptionally overexpressed within the parasite by radiation. Additionally, 37 genes encode proteins expressed on the cell surface or exported into the host cell, 4 encode membrane associated transporters, and 10 encode proteins related to misfolding and stress-related protein processing. These results have significantly increased the repertoire of novel targets for 1) biomarkers of safety to define proper attenuation, 2) generating genetically attenuated parasite vaccine candidates, and 3) subunit candidate vaccines against liver stage malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2557921754,"Trophectoderm lineage specification is one of the earliest differentiation events in mammalian development. The trophoblast lineage, which is derived from the trophectoderm, mediates implantation and placental formation. However, the processes involved in trophoblastic differentiation and placental formation in cattle remain unclear due to interspecies differences when compared with other model systems and the small repertoire of available trophoblast cell lines. Here, we describe the generation of trophoblast cell lines (biTBCs) from bovine amnion-derived cells (bADCs) using an induced pluripotent stem cell technique. bADCs were introduced with piggyBac vectors containing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transcription factors (Oct3⁄4(POU5F1), Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). Colonies that appeared showed a flattened epithelial-like morphology similar to cobblestones, had a more definite cell boundary between cells, and frequently formed balloon-like spheroids similar to trophoblastic vesicles (TVs). biTBCs were propagated for over 60 passages and expressed trophoblast-related (CDX2, ELF5, ERRβ, and IFN-τ) and pluripotency-related genes (endogenous OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC). Furthermore, when biTBCs were induced to differentiate by removing Dox from culture, they formed binucleate cells and began to express pregnancy-related genes (PL, PRP1, and PAG1). This is the first report demonstrating that the induction of pluripotency in bovine amniotic cells allows the generation of trophoblastic cell lines that possess trophoblast stem cell-like characteristics and have the potential to differentiate into the extra-embryonic cell lineage. These cell lines can be a new cell source as a model for studying trophoblast cell lineages and implantation processes in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2558403462,"Recently it has been suggested that rearing conditions during preadolescence in one generation may affect health outcomes in subsequent generations. Such parental effects, potentially induced by epigenetic modifications in the germ line, have attracted considerable attention because of their implications for public health and social policies. Yet, to date, evidence in humans has been rare due to data limitations and much further investigation in large studies is required. The aim of this paper is to reproduce and extend a recent study which found that paternal smoking before age 11 was associated with elevated body mass index (BMI) among male offspring in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Using the Nord-Trøndelag Health (HUNT) Study, we find that paternal smoking during pre-adolescence (<age 11) is not reliably or strongly associated with BMI among sons, with an estimated association close to zero (mean difference in kg m-2 (95% CI) was -0.18 (-1.75, 1.39) for sons aged 12-19 and 0.22 (-0.53, 0.97) for all ages). Among daughters, early-onset paternal smoking was imprecisely associated with an elevated BMI (mean difference was 1.50 (0.00, 3.00) for daughters aged 12-19 and 0.97 (0.06, 1.87) for all ages). Our results do not support a son-specific association of the magnitude reported in the ALSPAC study and we consider it improbable that early onset paternal smoking should influence specifically sons' BMI in one population and daughters' BMI in another. However, despite our considerable sample size (>45,000 offspring), we cannot rule out a weaker association, perhaps common to sons and daughters, which would be consistent with the ALSPAC study. Alternatively, we discuss whether confounding, chance in parallel tests, or sample selection effects might explain the observed associations of early paternal smoking with offspring BMI."
https://openalex.org/W2559360220,"Percocypris pingi is a near threatened cyprinid species, which has suffered a dramatic decline due to anthropogenic factors. As one response to this decline, hatchery release for P. pingi has been conducted in the lower reaches of the Yalong River since 2012. To understand the conservation status of this species and the potential impact of the release of hatchery-reared fish, we studied the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and hatchery populations of P. pingi. Two hatchery populations (Jinping [JPH] and Ya'an [YAH]) and two wild populations (Muli [MLW] and Woluo [WLW]) of P. pingi were analyzed based on microsatellite markers and the mitochondrial DNA control region. The results showed that P. pingi possesses moderate levels of genetic diversity, with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.657 to 0.770 and nucleotide diversities ranging from 0.00212 to 0.00491. Our results also suggested WLW harbors considerable proportions of genetic diversity in this species and serves as a refuge for P. pingi during anthropogenic disturbance, thus playing an important role for the conservation of P. pingi populations. Microsatellite and mitochondrial markers both indicated close genetic relationships between YAH and MLW, JPH and WLW, respectively. The results to some extent reflected the geographical provenances for original broodstocks of the two hatchery populations, which provide some practical guidance for hatchery release of P. pingi. The existence of remarkable genetic divergence distributed along limited geographical range (approximately 10 kilometers) suggests the two wild populations should be regarded at least as two distinct evolutionary significant units (ESUs) and management units (MUs). Considering reduced intra-population genetic variation in hatchery population for release and significant genetic compositions of the two hatchery populations, some appropriate breeding strategies were proposed to benefit conservation of P. pingi."
https://openalex.org/W2557285586,"In the liver, the signal and function of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) have mainly been assessed in association with liver regeneration. However, the effects of TWEAK on liver fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. To investigate the effects of TWEAK on human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and to explore the relevant potential mechanisms, human HSCs line-LX-2 were cultured with TWEAK. Cell migration was detected by transwell assay; cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8; the expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP8, MMP9, MMP10, MMP11, MMP12, MMP13 gene was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting; the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was tested by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay; small interfering RNA transfection was applied for depletion of MMP9 and p65. The result of transwell assay revealed that TWEAK promoted LX-2 migration. Subsequently, our data testified that the expression and activity of MMP9 was induced by TWEAK in LX-2 cells, which enhanced the migration. Furthermore, our findings showed that TWEAK upregulated the phosphorylation of IκBα and p65 protein to increase MMP9 expression in LX-2 cells. Meanwhile, the alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and desmin expression were upregulated following TWEAK treatment. The results in the present study revealed that TWEAK promotes HSCs migration via canonical NF-κB/MMP9 pathway, which possibly provides a molecular basis targeting TWEAK for the therapy of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2557354721,"When humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) sing in coastal waters, the units they produce can generate reverberation. Traditionally, such reverberant acoustic energy has been viewed as an incidental side-effect of high-amplitude, long-distance, sound transmission in the ocean. An alternative possibility, however, is that reverberation actually contributes to the structure and function of songs. In the current study, this possibility was assessed by analyzing reverberation generated by humpback whale song units, as well as the spectral structure of unit sequences, produced by singers from different regions. Acoustical analyses revealed that: (1) a subset of units within songs generated narrowband reverberant energy that in some cases persisted for periods longer than the interval between units; (2) these highly reverberant units were regularly repeated throughout the production of songs; and (3) units occurring before and after these units often contained spectral energy peaks at non-overlapping, adjacent frequencies that were systematically related to the bands of reverberant energy generated by the units. These findings strongly suggest that some singing humpback whales not only produce sounds conducive to long-duration reverberation, but also may sequentially structure songs to avoid spectral overlap between units and ongoing reverberation. Singer-generated reverberant energy that is received simultaneously with directly transmitted song units can potentially provide listening whales with spatial cues that may enable them to more accurately determine a singer’s position."
https://openalex.org/W2559202089,"The metalloproteinase anthrax lethal factor (LF) is secreted by Bacillus anthracis to promote disease virulence through disruption of host signaling pathways. LF is a highly specific protease, exclusively cleaving mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs) and rodent NLRP1B (NACHT leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 1B). How LF achieves such restricted substrate specificity is not understood. Previous studies have suggested the existence of an exosite interaction between LF and MKKs that promotes cleavage efficiency and specificity. Through a combination of in silico prediction and site-directed mutagenesis, we have mapped an exosite to a non-catalytic region of LF. Mutations within this site selectively impair proteolysis of full-length MKKs yet have no impact on cleavage of short peptide substrates. Although this region appears important for cleaving all LF protein substrates, we found that mutation of specific residues within the exosite differentially affects MKK and NLRP1B cleavage in vitro and in cultured cells. One residue in particular, Trp-271, is essential for cleavage of MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 but dispensable for targeting of MEK1, MEK2, and NLRP1B. Analysis of chimeric substrates suggests that this residue interacts with the MKK catalytic domain. We found that LF-W271A blocked ERK phosphorylation and growth in a melanoma cell line, suggesting that it may provide a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 for use as a cancer therapeutic.

These findings provide insight into how a bacterial toxin functions to specifically impair host signaling pathways and suggest a general strategy for mapping protease exosite interactions. Infectious bacteria often produce protein toxins that promote virulence, by facilitating evasion of the host immune system, by promoting bacterial dissemination, or by otherwise contributing to disease pathology (1Alouf J.E. Bacterial protein toxins: an overview.Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar). So-called “A-B toxins” enter host cells by means of a targeting subunit, allowing an enzymatic subunit to act on host substrates. Several well characterized A-B toxins are proteases that disable host cell function by cleaving intracellular proteins. One might expect that a nonspecific digestive protease, delivered intracellularly, would compromise cell function. In practice, however, protease toxins typically act with exquisite specificity. For example, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins exclusively cleave substrates involved in synaptic vesicle fusion, promoting paralysis that is a characteristic disease symptom (2Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R.

Understanding how these proteases selectively cleave an extremely limited substrate repertoire therefore provides basic insight into how bacterial toxins function in disease. Anthrax lethal factor (LF) 2The abbreviations used are: LFlethal factorPAprotective antigenMKKMAP kinase kinaseLeTxlethal toxinMca7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetic acidSEC-MALSsize exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering. is a metalloproteinase produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis (4Turk B.E. Manipulation of host signalling pathways by anthrax toxins.Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). LF is the enzymatic component of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), a classic A-B toxin that includes the protein PA (protective antigen). PA facilitates LF delivery into the host cell cytosol through an endocytic route that has been characterized in detail (5Brossier F. Lévy M. Landier A. Lafaye P. Mock M. Functional analysis of Bacillus anthracis protective antigen by using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6313-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As with other protease toxins, LF cleaves a small number of proteins in the host cell with a high degree of specificity. The major targets of LF in humans are the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs). LF cleaves six MKKs (MEK1/2 and MKK3/4/6/7) within sites that directly interact with their cognate MAPK substrates (4Turk B.E. Manipulation of host signalling pathways by anthrax toxins.Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L.

LF cleavage thereby functionally inactivates the MKKs, terminating signaling through the three major MAPK pathways: the ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways (4Turk B.E.

MAPK pathways mediate responses to diverse extracellular signals in many cell types (8Keshet Y. Seger R. The MAP kinase signaling cascades: a system of hundreds of components regulates a diverse array of physiological functions.Methods. Mol. Biol. 2010; 661: 3-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). MAPK function in cells of the innate immune system is particularly important in the context of anthrax infection (4Turk B.E. Manipulation of host signalling pathways by anthrax toxins.Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, neutrophil chemotaxis and antimicrobial activity are dependent on p38 and ERK signaling (9Cara D.C. Kaur J. Forster M. McCafferty D.M. Kubes P.

In addition, ERK-dependent transcriptional induction and p38-dependent translational up-regulation are essential for inflammatory cytokine production by activated macrophages (11Guha M. Mackman N.

The role of mammalian MAPK signaling in regulation of cytokine mRNA stability and translation.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2014; 34: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated macrophages are protected from apoptosis by p38-dependent induction of pro-survival genes (13Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Macrophage apoptosis by anthrax lethal factor through p38 MAP kinase inhibition.Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Multiple MAPK pathways are also important for proliferation of cells of the adaptive immune system such as T and B lymphocytes (4Turk B.E. Manipulation of host signalling pathways by anthrax toxins.Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is thought that an important function of LF is to help to establish infection by impairing host defense. LeTx also causes calcium dysregulation and impairs contractile function in cardiovascular muscle cells, possibly by inhibiting JNK, a phenomenon that likely contributes to fatality in late stage anthrax (14Liu S.

Cardiol. 2013; 168: 3884-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition to its MKK substrates, LF also cleaves NLRP1B, a rodent-specific paralog of the NOD-like inflammasome protein NLRP1 (17Hellmich K.A. Levinsohn J.L. Fattah R. Newman Z.L. Maier N. Sastalla I. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Moayeri M.

Direct proteolytic cleavage of NLRP1B is necessary and sufficient for inflammasome activation by anthrax lethal factor.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003452Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cleavage of NLRP1B triggers inflammasome activation, caspase-1 activation, and rapid pyroptotic death of macrophages and dendritic cells from inbred strains of mice and rats harboring specific Nlrp1b alleles (17Hellmich K.A.

Anthrax lethal factor cleavage of Nlrp1 is required for activation of the inflammasome.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002638Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This phenomenon appears to have evolved in rodents as a defense mechanism against anthrax infection to limit B. anthracis dissemination but is not known to be relevant to human disease. LF cleaves both MKKs and NLRP1B site-specifically, exclusively at one or two sites close to their N termini (4Turk B.E. Manipulation of host signalling pathways by anthrax toxins.Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Chavarría-Smith J. Vance R.E. Direct proteolytic cleavage of NLRP1B is necessary and sufficient for inflammasome activation by anthrax lethal factor.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003452Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The primary sequences surrounding cleavage sites in MKKs and NLRP1B conform to a consensus sequence characterized by basic residues at multiple positions upstream of the cleavage site, a basic residue, or Pro immediately upstream of the cleavage site (the P1 position) and hydrophobic residues positioned two residues upstream (P2) and immediately downstream (P1′) of the cleavage site. These features are also found in LF substrates cleaved in random peptide libraries, likely explaining why LF chooses particular sites in its substrate proteins (20Turk B.E. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Jarrell E.T. Leppla S.H. Collier R.J. Liddington R.C. Cantley L.C. The structural basis for substrate and inhibitor selectivity of the anthrax lethal factor.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, because many proteins having these sequences features are present in mammalian proteomes, the established LF cleavage site motif cannot explain why LF only cleaves MKKs and NLRP1B. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the presence of an exosite, or non-catalytic site, interaction between LF and its substrates that is required for efficient proteolysis. For example, MEK2 constructs lacking the N-terminal LF cleavage sequence interacted with LF in a yeast two-hybrid assay (21Vitale G. Pellizzari R. Recchi C. Napolitani G. Mock M. Montecucco C. Anthrax lethal factor cleaves the N-terminus of MAPKKs and induces tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation of MAPKs in cultured macrophages.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion analysis of MEK1 identified a region within its catalytic domain distal from the cleavage site that was required for efficient proteolysis by LF, and deletion of the MKK6 catalytic domain greatly impairs cleavage by LF (22Chopra A.P.

Identification of exosite-targeting inhibitors of anthrax lethal factor by high throughput screening.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently identified small molecules that competitively inhibit LF cleavage of MKKs while having no effect on cleavage of short peptides (23Bannwarth L. Goldberg A.B. Chen C. Turk B.E. Identification of exosite-targeting inhibitors of anthrax lethal factor by high throughput screening.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that a physical interaction between LF and the catalytic domain of MKKs is required for efficient cleavage. While there is evidence for an interaction between LF and the MKK catalytic domain, the location of the putative exosite on LF has not been mapped. LF is a 90-kDa protein comprising four domains (24Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Crystal structure of the anthrax lethal factor.Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The C-terminal catalytic domain (domain IV) contains the signature HEXXH motif including two zinc-binding His residues and the catalytic base Glu residue found in many groups of zinc-binding metalloproteases. The LF catalytic domain is most closely related to MtfA, a putative intracellular aminopeptidase widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, and a group of secreted metalloproteinases found in some species of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, represented by Zmp1 from Clostridium difficile (25Xu Q. Göhler A.K. Kosfeld A. Carlton D. Chiu H.J. Klock H.E. Knuth M.W. Miller M.D. Elsliger M.A. Deacon A.M. Godzik A. Lesley S.A. Jahreis K. Wilson I.A.

These proteases share with LF a conserved zinc-binding Glu residue and an additional active site Tyr residue important for catalysis. LF has been co-crystallized with both peptide substrates and substrate-based inhibitors, which has provided insight into its cleavage site specificity (20Turk B.E. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7958-7963Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Outside of the catalytic domain, the N-terminal domain I binds PA and is necessary and sufficient for PA-mediated uptake of LF into cells (28Rabideau A.E. Pentelute B.L. Delivery of non-native cargo into mammalian cells using anthrax lethal toxin.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 1490-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Domain II shares its fold with a family of bacterial ADP ribosyltransferases but lacks necessary catalytic residues and is thought to be inactive. Domain III is a small helical bundle inserted into domain II. Domains II and III together form the central portion of the protein and have been hypothesized to regulate substrate access to the active site in domain IV (24Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y.

D. 2014; 70: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This region has also been proposed to mediate substrate recruitment, yet details of these interactions remain obscure (30Liang X. Young J.J. Boone S.A. Waugh D.S. Duesbery N.S. Involvement of domain II in toxicity of anthrax lethal factor.J. Biol.

Here, we identify and characterize in detail an LF exosite in domain II that is required for the efficient cleavage of MKK substrates. To identify potential LF residues that interact with MKK substrates, we used CPORT, a server that combines results from multiple structure-based protein interface prediction algorithms (31de Vries S.J. Bonvin A.M. CPORT: a consensus interface predictor and its performance in prediction-driven docking with HADDOCK.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e17695Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar32Khashan R.

Liu S. Zhou Y. Protein binding site prediction using an empirical scoring function.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3698-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We submitted Protein Data Bank files corresponding to all reported X-ray crystal structures of full-length LF for CPORT analysis and prioritized investigation of residues that were identified in three or more of the eight analyses (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, CPORT analysis identified residues at two established interaction sites: the PA binding site (including His-229, Leu-235, and Tyr-236) and the peptide substrate binding cleft (including Gly-657, Leu-658, Tyr-659, His-690, Tyr-728, and Glu-735). In addition to these known sites, CPORT also identified a continuous patch of residues spanning the non-catalytic domains I and II of LF as a predicted protein interaction interface. Based on these predictions we hypothesized that domain I of LF could be important for protease activity against protein substrates. We tested this hypothesis by examining the proteolytic activity of an N-terminally truncated form of LF, LF-CT, comprising domains II–IV (Fig. 2A). We found that LF-CT cleaved a short peptide substrate with similar kinetics to full-length LF (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, however, we found that concentrations of LF and LF-CT displaying equivalent activity on the peptide substrate had substantially different activity on a full-length MKK6 substrate, with LF-CT being ∼10-fold less active than full-length LF (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that in addition to its well characterized role in mediating LF uptake into cells, domain I is also required for optimal cleavage of MKK substrates. We therefore proceeded to test the role of individual residues in the putative interaction surface spanning domains I and II.FIGURE 2Removal of domain I specifically reduces cleavage of a full-length MKK substrate by LF. A, scheme showing LF-CT protein, an LF construct lacking the N-terminal domain I. B, peptide cleavage assay comparing full-length LF with LF-CT. C, MKK6 cleavage assay comparing full-length LF with LF-CT. Recombinant MKK6 protein substrate was subjected to proteolysis by the indicated units of LF and LF-CT as defined by activity against the peptide substrate. MKK6 cleavage was visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the role of predicted residues in LF-substrate interactions, we generated a series of LF point mutants and examined their cleavage of purified MKKs in vitro. To ensure that these mutations did not cause global destabilization or unfolding of LF, each mutant was first evaluated in peptide cleavage assays. A protease inactive LF mutant (E687A) had no detectable activity using the peptide substrate (not shown), indicating that peptide cleavage activity in our preparations was not due to contaminating proteases. Although we found no consistent decrease in peptide cleavage rate for any of the mutants tested, we did observe some variability in activity between LF preparations, including WT LF. To control for such variability, we defined units of LF based on activity on the peptide substrate and included equivalent units in MKK cleavage reactions. Of 11 mutants tested, we found that 6 of them had significantly reduced activity with MKK6 as the substrate (Fig. 3, A and B). The most dramatic effect was observed with LF-W271A, which had no detectable activity against MKK6 despite being fully active against the peptide substrate. Two additional mutants, LF-M264A and LF-Y268A, had substantially (7- and 12-fold, respectively) reduced protease activity against MKK6 compared with WT LF, whereas the other mutants (L259A, L265A, and R491E) had more modestly reduced activity (2–3-fold). Notably, the three residues that appeared to be most important for MKK6 cleavage (Met-264, Tyr-268, and Trp-271) form a continuous patch located in the first α-helix of domain II (Fig. 3C), suggesting that this region is a hotspot for the interaction between LF and MKK6. To examine whether these mutations affect MKK cleavage in general, we next examined activity of the LF mutants using purified MEK1 as the substrate (Fig. 3, A and B). We found that most mutations that reduced cleavage of MKK6 also impacted cleavage of MEK1 but to a lesser extent. For example, LF-M264A and LF-Y268A cleaved MEK1 2.5- and 6-fold less efficiently than WT LF, respectively. Other mutations (L259A and R491E) affected MEK1 cleavage ∼2-fold, and the L265A mutation did not significantly impact on MEK1 cleavage. Most notably, the W271A mutation that completely abolishes cleavage of MKK6 had no effect on the ability of LF to cleave MEK1. These observations suggest that this region of LF is generally important for maximal cleavage of both MKK6 and MEK1 but that Trp-271 is uniquely essential for its interaction with MKK6. MKKs consist of a short unstructured N-terminal region harboring the LF cleavage site and a C-terminal kinase catalytic domain. To determine which region of an MKK permits cleavage by LF-W271A, we generated chimeric MEK1/MKK6 proteins in which we exchanged their N-terminal sequences (Fig. 4A). For these experiments, WT or chimeric MKKs were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, and cleavage was assessed in cell lysates. In this system, WT LF efficiently cleaved both MEK1 and MKK6, whereas as expected LF-W271A only cleaved MEK1 (Fig. 4, B and C). We found that the chimera in which the N terminus of MKK6 was fused to the kinase domain of MEK1 was cleavable by LF-W271A, albeit with slightly lower efficiency than WT LF. The analogous chimera harboring the N terminus of MEK1 and the MKK6 catalytic domain expressed poorly and was not cleaved by either WT LF or LF-W271A, suggesting that this fusion protein was non-functional (data not shown). These results suggest that the failure of LF-W271A to cleave MKK6 is due to loss of a critical interaction with its kinase domain and not with the N-terminal cleavage sequence of MKK6. Although LF is typically described as being monomeric, full-length LF has been crystallized in both monomeric and dimeric forms. Because several of the residues important for MKK cleavage, in particular Met-264 and Tyr-268, map to the dimer interface observed in some crystal structures, we considered whether LF cleavage of MKKs might require dimerization. We first examined whether we could detect formation of dimeric LF in solution by size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis. We found that LF is almost entirely (98%) monomeric in solution, with an observed mass of 96.8 ± 0.4 kDa, with the remainder appearing as early eluting higher order multimers, suggestive of aggregation (Fig. 5A). Importantly, we did not detect any dimeric LF by this analysis. This observation indicates that at the low nanomolar LF concentrations used in our cleavage reactions, at most only a very small fraction could be dimeric. To further test the possibility that LF acts as a dimer, we examined the concentration dependence of LF activity. Because LF is predominantly monomeric in our cleavage reactions, if LF functions as a dimer, we would expect its activity to increase exponentially with enzyme concentration because of higher levels of the dimeric form. Instead, we found that the amount of product formed varied linearly with concentration at low LF concentrations and began to plateau at higher concentrations because of substrate depletion (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results indicate that LF is unlikely to function as an obligate dimer and suggest that residues in domain II required for efficient proteolysis are more likely to interact directly with MKKs. To determine whether residues that affect MKK cleavage in vitro are also important for LF function in cells, we initially examined cleavage of endogenous MKKs in J774A.1 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line that is susceptible to LeTx-induced pyroptosis. Because endogenous, untagged MEK1 undergoes a very small change in molecular weight upon LF cleavage, for these experiments we instead examined cleavage of its closest homolog, MEK2, using an antibody directed against its N terminus that does not react with its LF cleavage product. Likewise, we were unable to detect endogenous MKK6 in these cells, so we instead examined cleavage of MKK3. In addition to MEK2 and MKK3, we also assayed cleavage of MKK4"

We describe the establishment and molecular characteristics of the DLBCL cell line U-2946. This cell line was derived from a 52-year-old male with DLBCL. U-2946 cells carried the chromosomal translocation t(8;14) and strongly expressed MYC, but not the mature B-cell lymphoma associated oncogenes BCL2 and BCL6. Instead, U-2946 cells expressed the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 which was highly amplified genomically (14n). MCL1 amplification is recurrent in DLBCL, especially in the activated B cell (ABC) variant. Results of microarray expression cluster analysis placed U-2946 together with ABC-, but apart from germinal center (GC)-type DLBCL cell lines. The 1q21.3 region including MCL1 was focally coamplified with a short region of 17p11.2 (also present at 14n). The MCL1 inhibitor A-1210477 triggered apoptosis in U-2946 (MCL1pos/BCL2neg) cells. In contrast to BCL2pos DLBCL cell lines, U-2946 did not respond to the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-263. In conclusion, the novel characteristics of cell line U-2946 renders it a unique model system to test the function of small molecule inhibitors, especially when constructing a panel of DLBCL cell lines expressing broad combinations of antiapoptotic BCL2-family members."

Objective This two-arm randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the effect of dressing wear time on surgical site infection (SSI) rates, skin colonization and patient perceptions. Methods A total of 200 breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to group I (dressing removed on the first postoperative day, n = 100) or group II (dressing removed on the sixth postoperative day, n = 100). SSIs were defined and classified according to criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples collected before placing the dressing and after 1 day (group I) and 6 days (both groups) were cultured for skin colonization assessments. Patients preferences and perceptions with regard to safety, comfort and convenience were recorded and analyzed. Results A total of 186 patients completed the follow-up. The global SSI rate was 4.5%. Six patients in group I and three in group II had SSI (p = 0.497). Before dressing, the groups were similar with regard to skin colonization. At the sixth day, there was a higher colonization by coagulase-negative staphylococci in group I (p<0.0001). Patients preferred to keep dressing for six days (p<0.0001), and considered this a safer choice (p<0.05). Conclusions Despite group I had a higher skin colonization by coagulase-negative staphylococci on the sixth postoperative day, there was no difference in SSI rates. Patients preferred keeping dressing for six days and considered it a safer choice. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01148823"
https://openalex.org/W2557958234,"Contamination of potentially carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in the drinking water is a major public health concern worldwide. However, little information is available regarding the biological effects of a nanomoler amount of Cr(VI). Here, we investigated the genotoxic effects of Cr(VI) at nanomoler levels and their repair pathways. We found that DNA damage response analyzed based on differential toxicity of isogenic cells deficient in various DNA repair proteins is observed after a three-day incubation with K2CrO4 in REV1-deficient DT40 cells at 19.2 μg/L or higher as well as in TK6 cells deficient in polymerase delta subunit 3 (POLD3) at 9.8 μg/L or higher. The genotoxicity of Cr(VI) decreased ~3000 times when the incubation time was reduced from three days to ten minutes. TK mutation rate also significantly decreased from 6 day to 1 day exposure to Cr(VI). The DNA damage response analysis suggest that DNA repair pathways, including the homologous recombination and REV1- and POLD3-mediated error-prone translesion synthesis pathways, are critical for the cells to tolerate to DNA damage caused by trace amount of Cr(VI)."
https://openalex.org/W2558344797,"Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection that in dairy cattle causes reduced milk yield, weight loss, and ultimately fatal diarrhea. Subclinical animals can excrete bacteria (Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP) in feces and infect other animals. Farmers identify the infectious animals through a variety of test-strategies, but are challenged by the lack of perfect tests. Frequent testing increases the sensitivity but the costs of testing are a cause of concern for farmers. Here, we used a herd simulation model using milk ELISA tests to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of continuously adapting the sampling interval in response to the estimated true prevalence in the herd. The key results were that the true prevalence was greatly affected by the hygiene level and to some extent by the test-frequency. Furthermore, the choice of prevalence that will be tolerated in a control scenario had a major impact on the true prevalence in the normal hygiene setting, but less so when the hygiene was poor. The net revenue is not greatly affected by the test-strategy, because of the general variation in net revenues between farms. An exception to this is the low hygiene herd, where frequent testing results in lower revenue. When we look at the probability of eradication, then it is correlated with the testing frequency and the target prevalence during the control phase. The probability of eradication is low in the low hygiene herd, and a test-and-cull strategy should probably not be the primary strategy in this herd. Based on this study we suggest that, in order to control MAP, the standard Danish dairy farm should use an adaptive strategy where a short sampling interval of three months is used when the estimated true prevalence is above 1%, and otherwise use a long sampling interval of one year."
https://openalex.org/W2559286366,"Globular proteins are not permanently folded but spontaneously unfold and refold on time scales that can span orders of magnitude for different proteins. A longstanding debate in the protein-folding field is whether unfolding rates or folding rates correlate to the stability of a protein. In the present study, we have determined the unfolding and folding kinetics of 10 FNIII domains. FNIII domains are one of the most common protein folds and are present in 2% of animal proteins. FNIII domains are ideal for this study because they have an identical seven-strand β-sandwich structure, but they vary widely in sequence and thermodynamic stability. We assayed thermodynamic stability of each domain by equilibrium denaturation in urea. We then assayed the kinetics of domain opening and closing by a technique known as thiol exchange. For this we introduced a buried Cys at the identical location in each FNIII domain and measured the kinetics of labeling with DTNB over a range of urea concentrations. A global fit of the kinetics data gave the kinetics of spontaneous unfolding and refolding in zero urea. We found that the folding rates were relatively similar, ∼0.1–1 s−1, for the different domains. The unfolding rates varied widely and correlated with thermodynamic stability. Our study is the first to address this question using a set of domains that are structurally homologous but evolved with widely varying sequence identity and thermodynamic stability. These data add new evidence that thermodynamic stability correlates primarily with unfolding rate rather than folding rate.

The FN molecule is a dimer of 250,000-Da subunits, which are modular proteins that fold into a string of globular domains. There are three types of domains, which differ in size, structure, and the presence of internal disulfide bonds (1Skorstengaard K. Jensen M.S. Sahl P. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Complete primary structure of bovine plasma fibronectin.Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).

The present study focuses on FNIII domains. The FN monomer contains 15–17 FNIII domains, depending on splicing. The domain structure is a β-sandwich (Fig. 1), with three strands on one side, four on the other, and a compact hydrophobic core (2Leahy D.J. Aukhil I.

First discovered in fibronectin, FNIII domains are incorporated as a folding motif in many animal proteins. Although different FNIII domains share only ∼20% sequence identity, they all fold with the same β-sandwich structure. These domains have been implicated in cell adhesion, matrix assembly and elasticity, and membrane receptors and are the main focus of our present study. FN matrix fibrils are very elastic; those in cell culture are typically stretched up to 4 times their rest length (3Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P.

One hypothesis is “tension-induced domain unfolding,” which proposes that individual FNIII domains unravel when the fibril is under tension (5Erickson H.P.

A folded FNIII domain is 3.5 nm long, and the 90 amino acids of the unfolded polypeptide chain have a contour length of 30.5 nm, providing a potential source of stretch. An alternative model proposes that the stretch involves a conformational change of the FN dimer from a compact pretzel shape to an extended form, without unfolding FNIII domains (8Erickson H.P.

Chem. 2011; 286: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) used the technique of chemical labeling of a Cys buried in a globular domain as an indication of domain unfolding. This technique was previously developed by Johnson et al. (13Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Forced unfolding of proteins within cells.Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) to show that tension can expose buried Cys in two isoforms of spectrin in red blood cells. In fibronectin, only FNIII 7 and 15 have a free Cys (Fig. 1). These two Cys are buried, and with FN in solution, they can only be labeled after denaturation (7Smith M.L. Gourdon D. Little W.C.

When incorporated into cell culture matrix, 6 of the 15 FNIII domains were sufficiently open that their buried Cys could be labeled by 1-h incubation with fluorescein maleimide. The domain unfolding could be due to (a) tension-induced unfolding, (b) unfolding as part of FN–FN bond formation during fibril assembly, or (c) spontaneous unfolding and refolding of domains. Our study addresses quantitatively this third mechanism. All globular proteins and protein domains spontaneously unfold and refold, with a very wide range of kinetics (14Jackson S.E. How do small single-domain proteins fold?.Fold Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The kinetics in dilute aqueous buffer can be described by two rate constants, kuH2O for unfolding and kfH2O for folding. Three FNIII domains have been extensively studied for unfolding-folding kinetics: FNIII 9 and 10 and TNfn3, an FNIII domain from tenascin (15Plaxco K.W. Spitzfaden C. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M.

Biol. 2000; 302: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, the unfolding and refolding kinetics of FNIII 3 have also been studied (18Stine J.M. Sun Y. Armstrong G. Bowler B.E. Briknarová K. Structure and unfolding of the third type III domain from human fibronectin.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 6724-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These studies monitored the unfolding by the increase in fluorescence of the single conserved and buried Trp in most FNIII domains. An alternative to Trp fluorescence is to use a buried Cys and assay its accessibility to a thiol-reactive reagent to measure the population of the unfolded state. This approach has been termed thiol exchange (SX). In SX, the opening and closing kinetics, which are defined by the rate constant of opening (kop) and the rate constant for closing (kcl), determine the accessibility of the Cys to the dye. In many cases, the opening and closing kinetics correspond to global unfolding and folding; then kop = ku and kcl = kf. In other cases, the Cys can be exposed by subglobal or by local opening and closing, and these mechanisms need to be accounted for separately. We will use the terms kop and kcl to describe our kinetic measurements, although most domains fit a two-state global unfolding mechanism. SX was first used by Ballery et al. (19Ballery N. Desmadril M. Minard P. Yon J.M.

They introduced a buried Cys at 10 different sites in the protein, to explore how local unfolding varied over the structure. Malhotra and Udgaonkar (23Malhotra P. Udgaonkar J.B.

They created four single Cys mutants at buried locations of the single-chain protein monellin. In the present study, we have applied SX with a different strategy. We have surveyed the opening-closing kinetics of 10 different protein domains related by homology, specifically the family of FNIII domains. We have included the six domains of FN that were labeled in matrix fibrils and two that were not (12Lemmon C.A. Ohashi T. Erickson H.P.

Chem. 2013; 288: 33738-33744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we engineered a single buried Cys at the same location in each of the FNIII domains, at the site of the natural Cys in FNIII 7 and irisin. The kinetics of Cys labeling were measured in different concentrations of urea. Most domains could be fit to a two-state model of global unfolding, but for three domains, the Cys was partially exposed by a local or subglobal unfolding. Our study provides new evidence that thermodynamic stability correlates most closely with unfolding rates. Conventional protein folding studies use a direct spectroscopic probe to measure the fraction of folded protein in various concentrations of denaturant. Almost all FNIII domains have a single buried Trp at sequence position 22 or 23 in β strand B. In folded FNIII domains, the buried Trp has an emission peak at 320 nm when excited at 280 nm. Solvent exposure of Trp by protein denaturation in urea shifts the emission peak to 350 nm. An example of these changes for FNIII 3C is shown in Fig. 2A. In 0–1 m urea, the emission peak is at 320 nm, and it shifts to 350 nm at 3 m urea, in which it is predominantly unfolded. We determined the thermodynamic stabilities of the 11 domains in this study from Trp fluorescence urea denaturation curves. To eliminate variations due to protein concentration, we used the emission ratio 350/320 nm as a measure of the extent of unfolding. A ratio of 0.3–1.8 indicates a buried Trp; the ratio increases to 1.5–2.8 when the Trp is exposed to the solvent (12Lemmon C.A. Ohashi T. Erickson H.P.

Chem. 2011; 286: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We fit the emission ratio versus urea concentration for each domain to a simple two-state equilibrium (see “Experimental Procedures”). Examples of Trp denaturation curves for three FNIII domains that span the stability range are shown in Fig. 2B. The fitted stabilities and their urea dependence for all 11 domains are listed in Table 3. FNIII 11C is the least stable with ΔGF→UH2O of 1.59 ± 0.65 kcal/mol. FNIII 10C is the most stable, with a ΔGF→UH2O greater than 10 kcal/mol, which was too stable to measure accurately by the non-ionic denaturant urea. FNIII 3C has intermediate stability with a ΔGF→UH2O of 3.3 ± 1.0 kcal/mol.TABLE 3Comparison of thermodynamic parameters obtained from Trp fluorescence and SXFNIII domainTechniqueΔGmeqC1/2kcal/molm1CTrp6.1 (0.1)−1.06 (0.17)5.7 (0.1)2CSX5.9 (0.07)−1.05 (0.02)5.6 (0.1)2CTrp4.7 (0.4)−0.81 (0.07)5.8 (0.04)3CSX3.4 (0.03)−1.39 (0.012)2.5 (0.03)3CTrp3.3 (1.0)−1.16 (0.34)2.8 (0.2)3CTrp (SVD)3.8 (0.2)−1.15 (0.07)3.4 (0.04)6CSX5.6 (0.03)−1.03 (0.0041)5.4 (0.05)6CTrp3.4 (0.8)−0.51 (0.16)6.7 (0.7)7SX5.9 (0.01)−1.3 (0.02)4.6 (0.02)9C*SX3.7 (0.01)−1.0 (0.004)3.6 (0.02)9CTrp3 (1.6)−0.87 (0.44)3.4 (0.4)10C*SX8.2 (0.009)−0.938.810CTrp10.6 (2.1)−1.21 (0.24)8.8 (0.09)11CSX0.78 (0.03)−1.64 (0.002)0.48 (0.03)11CTrp1.6 (0.7)−1.79 (0.66)0.88 (0.1)12CSX4.3 (0.02)−1.45 (0.006)2.96 (0.02)12CTrp5.4 (1.27)−1.47 (0.34)3.7 (0.1)IrisinSX4.1 (0.01)−1.42 (0.02)2.9 (0.01)IrisinTrp3.4 (0.8)−1.41 (0.31)2.4 (0.1)TNfn3SX2.9 (0.04)−1.51 (0.03)1.9 (0.04)TNfn3Trp2.5 (2.4)−0.65 (0.6)3.9 (0.9) Open table in a new tab Our SX assay measures the labeling of the buried Cys and fits it to the general scheme (developed in detail under “Experimental Procedures”).

The Cys is only exposed in PO, so this population was assayed by its reaction with the thiol-reactive reagent: 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The major goal is to extrapolate the data to determine the rates at zero denaturant, indicated by kopH2O and kclH2O.

High-energy intermediates in protein unfolding characterized by thiol labeling under nativelike conditions.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 3608-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These intermediate data were then fit again to obtain thermodynamic and/or kinetic parameters for the conformational reactions. Our approach globally fits all labeling curves over the full range of urea concentrations to a model that includes the urea dependence of opening and closing. Differential equations describing the time dependence of all species were solved either with the kinetic matrix method or by numerical integration in MathematicaTM (see “Experimental Procedures”). Global fitting of SX data can determine both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, provided that there are sufficient data in the so-called EXX regime. In this regime, both the conformational opening and DTNB reactions contribute to the observed kinetics (Equation 16). However, if the conformational opening reaction is rate-determining at all urea concentrations (EX1 regime, Equation 17), kop can be determined, but not kcl or the stability. In contrast, if conformational kinetics at all urea concentrations are much faster than the DTNB reaction (EX2 regime, Equation 18), then the equilibrium constant can be determined, but not kop or kcl. With sufficient data in the EXX regime, the global fitting determines the best values of five parameters: kop, kcl, mop, mcl, and kchem. The complete kinetics data for FNIII 2C at various urea concentrations are shown in Fig. 3 as an example of a data set and the global fitting. To obtain this data set, FNIII 2C was incubated for 10 min in buffers containing 0–8 m urea to establish unfolding equilibrium. DTNB was then added to the protein, and the reaction was monitored by absorbance at 412 nm. At low concentrations of urea, the reaction is slow and was monitored with a spectrophotometer after manual mixing (Fig. 3A), whereas at high urea concentrations, the reaction is much faster and required stopped-flow mixing (Fig. 3B). The data for FNIII 2C follows the EX2 regime from 0 to 1 m urea and the EXX regime from 2 to 6 m urea, where kcl and kint are within a factor of 10 of each other. Above 6 m urea, the domain is predominantly unfolded, and the Cys is completely exposed to the dye. In this regime, no information is provided about the conformational reaction, but the labeling curves help determine kchem, which is another globally fitted parameter. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters extrapolated to 0 m urea and the mop and mcl, fit from the complete data set, are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Parameters extrapolated to 0 m from the global fit for FNIII 2CParameterValueS.E.kopH2O (s−1)*2.67 × 10−41 × 10−5kclH2O (s−1)*4.830.2Closed state half-life (s)2,590100Open state half-life (s)0.1430.007mcl (m−1)*−0.6480.01mop (m−1)*1.110.008kopH2O (kcal mol−1)5.880.04kopH2O*5.52 × 10−53.3 × 10−6meq (m−1)−1.050.008kchemH2O (m−1 s−1)*1,7202KopLH2O*3.21 × 10−57 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab The kinetics data and global fits for all domains are shown in supplemental Figs. 1–11.

The stability (ΔGH2O in 0 m urea) and urea dependence of stability (meq), determined by Trp fluorescence and by SX, are compared in Table 3. SX values are missing for FNIII 1C, which could not be fit to a two- or three-state opening model. FNIII 11C is very unstable and has the lowest ΔGH2O = 0.78 ± 0.03 kcal/mol, whereas FNIII 10C is very stable to global opening and has the highest ΔGH2O = 8.17 ± 0.009 kcal/mol. The SX and Trp data generally agree closely. As an example, for FNIII 3C, ΔGH2O = 3.4 ± 0.03 kcal/mol by SX versus 3.8 ± 0.24 kcal/mol by Trp fluorescence. A value of 4.0 kcal/mol was determined in a separate study of FNIII 3 (without the buried Cys) using Trp fluorescence and denaturation in guanidine HCl (18Stine J.M. Sun Y. Armstrong G. Bowler B.E. Briknarová K. Structure and unfolding of the third type III domain from human fibronectin.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 6724-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A central finding of this study is that the global opening reaction to expose the engineered Cys buried in the FNIII domains is the same as global unfolding. This finding is supported by the good fit to a two-state unfolding mechanism for most domains and the agreement between the stabilities measured by Trp fluorescence and SX (see Table 3). However, it is important to properly model all of the possible routes by which the Cys residues can be exposed to DTNB. In addition to global opening, Cys residues can become exposed through subglobal opening, which corresponds to a partial unfolding reaction, or they could open via local fluctuations in the structure. These three opening mechanisms are distinguishable by their urea dependence, which is greater for global unfolding, lower for subglobal unfolding, and urea-independent for local state fluctuations. The domains whose Cys residues react exclusively via global unfolding include FNIII 3C, 6C, 7, 11C, 12C, irisin, and TNfn3. The SX data for these domains fit well to the simplest model (Equation 11). The key parameters describing the folding and unfolding kinetics of these domains are the rate constants for opening (unfolding) and closing (folding) at 0 m urea (kopH2O and kclH2O, respectively). These parameters, which are listed in Table 2, are also used to determine the global stability of the domain, ΔGopH2O. The SX data for two domains, FNIII 9C and 2C, did not fit well to a global opening alone model but did fit to a model that included an additional local opening reaction (local state fluctuations (22Feng Z. Butler M.C. Alam S.L. Loh S.N. On the nature of conformational openings: native and unfolded-state hydrogen and thiol-disulfide exchange studies of ferric aquomyoglobin.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) that allows the Cys to react without global unfolding. This model is described in Equation 13. For FNIII 2C, the model parameters include the equilibrium constant for local opening (KopL), which is unfavorable and much less than 1 and global opening parameters kopH2O and kclH2O (see TABLE 1, TABLE 2). The SX data for FNIII 10C did not fit well to either of these models. Instead, it was necessary use a model (Equation 14) that includes an additional subglobal opening (unfolding) reaction along with a global opening reaction. The rate constants for subglobal opening (kopSH2O) and closing (kclSH2O) define the rates at 0 m urea for this conformational reaction. The kinetics for labeling for"
https://openalex.org/W2559616809,"Traditional methods for detection and serotyping of enterovirus infections are virus isolation and immunofluorescence assay (VI-IFA), which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recently, VP1 gene has been targeted to develop a CODEHOP-based RT-PCR (VP1-CODEHOP) for the same purpose. In this study, we conducted a 5-year enterovirus surveillance comparing the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests. Throat swabs were collected from 431 pediatric patients and 208(48%) and 250(58%) were tested positive by the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests, respectively. Among the 47 cases who had inconsistent results between the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests and provided paired sera for serological verifications, correct diagnosis for the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP were 5(11%) and 40(85%) cases, respectively. Therefore, the VP1-CODEHOP is more reliable for detection of human enteroviruses than the VI-IFA. Based on serological verifications for the eight cases who had inconsistent serotypes between the two tests and provided paired sera, five and two showed consistent serotypes with the VP1-CODEHOP and VI-IFA tests, respectively. CVA16, CVA6 and EV71 were the most prevalent serotypes in northern Taiwan, 2008~2012. Moreover, variant CVA2, CVA6 and EV71 viruses were further identified based on phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 sequences. In conclusion, the VP1-CODEHOP test could be used as the primary method for enterovirus surveillance to support decision-making for outbreak control."
https://openalex.org/W2949873113,"Despite recent efforts to sample broadly across metazoan and insect diversity, current sequence resources in the Coleoptera do not adequately describe the diversity of the clade. Here we present deep, staged transcriptomic data for two coleopteran species, Atrachya menetriesi (Faldermann 1835) and Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius 1775). Our sampling covered key stages in ovary and early embryonic development in each species. We utilized this data to build combined assemblies for each species which were then analysed in detail. The combined A. menetriesi assembly consists of 228,096 contigs with an N50 of 1,598 bp, while the combined C. maculatus assembly consists of 128,837 contigs with an N50 of 2,263 bp. For these assemblies, 34.6% and 32.4% of contigs were identified using Blast2GO, and 97% and 98.3% of the BUSCO set of metazoan orthologs were present, respectively. We also carried out manual annotation of developmental signalling pathways and found that nearly all expected genes were present in each transcriptome. Our analyses show that both transcriptomes are of high quality. Lastly, we performed read mapping utilising our timed, stage specific RNA samples to identify differentially expressed contigs. The resources presented here will provide a firm basis for a variety of experimentation, both in developmental biology and in comparative genomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2557553606,"5'-nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides as well as complex nucleotides, such as uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, to their corresponding nucleosides plus phosphate. These enzymes have been found in diverse species in intracellular and membrane-bound, surface-localized forms. Soluble forms of 5'-nucleotidases belong to the ubiquitous haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) and have been shown to be involved in the regulation of nucleotide, nucleoside and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pools. Despite the important role of 5'-nucleotidases in cellular metabolism, only a few of these enzymes have been characterized in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the workhorse industrial microorganism included in the Food and Drug Administration’s GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel 5'-nucleotidase gene from B. subtilis, yutF, which comprises 771 bp encoding a 256-amino-acid protein belonging to the IIA subfamily of the HADSF. The gene product is responsible for the major p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity in B. subtilis. The yutF gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product fused to a polyhistidine tag was purified and biochemically characterized as a soluble 5'-nucleotidase with broad substrate specificity. The recombinant YutF protein was found to hydrolyze various purine and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotides, showing preference for 5'-nucleoside monophosphates and, specifically, 5'-XMP. Recombinant YutF also exhibited phosphohydrolase activity toward nucleotide precursors, ribose-5-phosphate and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Determination of the kinetic parameters of the enzyme revealed a low substrate specificity (Km values in the mM concentration range) and modest catalytic efficiencies with respect to substrates. An initial study of the regulation of yutF expression showed that the yutF gene is a component of the yutDEF transcription unit and that YutF overproduction positively influences yutDEF expression."

This study investigated whether TP53 polymorphisms are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with Lynch syndrome and whether TP53 interacts with lifestyle factors to modify CRC risk. Methods We identified 260 MLH1 and MSH2 germline mutation carriers from the Taiwan Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer Consortium. A weighted Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the association of TP53 polymorphisms with CRC development. Results The carriers of the variant C allele of rs1042522 were associated with a decreased CRC risk (GC genotype: HR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14–0.86; CC genotype: HR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.13–0.57). In addition, the dominant model of rs1042522 was associated with a decreased CRC risk (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.15–0.67). The CRC risk was decreased in carriers with the CT and TT genotypes of rs12947788 (HR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.08–0.46 and HR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.09–0.65, respectively). Moreover, the dominant model of rs12947788 was significantly associated with a decreased CRC risk (HR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.09–0.46). A haplotype analysis indicated that compared with the most common GC haplotype, the CT haplotype was associated with a decreased CRC risk (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.11–0.59). However, no significant interaction was observed between TP53 polymorphisms and lifestyle factors. Conclusion The study results revealed that the rs1042522 genotype with the C allele and the rs12947788 genotype with the T allele in TP53 were associated with a decreased CRC risk in patients with Lynch syndrome in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2559256154,"Various systems have been proposed to support biological image analysis, with the intent of decreasing false annotations and reducing the heavy burden on biologists. These systems generally comprise a feature extraction method and a classification method. Task-oriented methods for feature extraction leverage characteristic images for each problem, and they are very effective at improving the classification accuracy. However, it is difficult to utilize such feature extraction methods for versatile task in practice, because few biologists specialize in Computer Vision and/or Pattern Recognition to design the task-oriented methods. Thus, in order to improve the usability of these supporting systems, it will be useful to develop a method that can automatically transform the image features of general propose into the effective form toward the task of their interest. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised feature transformation method, which is formulated as a natural coupling of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the framework of graph-embedding. Compared with other feature transformation methods, our method showed favorable classification performance in biological image analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2558675040,"Cheating is a common phenomenon in high stakes admission, licensing and university exams and threatens their validity. To detect if some exam questions had been affected by cheating, we simulated how data would look like if some test takers possessed item preknowledge: Responses to a small number of items were set to correct for 1–10% of test takers. Item difficulty, item discrimination, item fit, and local dependence were computed using an IRT 2PL model. Then changes in these item properties from the non-compromised to the compromised dataset were scrutinized for their sensitivity to item preknowledge. A decline in the discrimination parameter compared with previous test versions and an increase in local item dependence turned out to be the most sensitive indicators of item preknowledge. A multiplicative combination of shifts in item discrimination, item difficulty, and local item dependence detected item preknowledge with a sensitivity of 1.0 and a specificity of .95 if 11 of 80 items were preknown to 10% of the test takers. Cheating groups smaller than 5% of the test takers were not detected reliably. In the discussion, we outline an effective search for items affected by cheating, which would enable faculty staff without IRT knowledge to detect compromised items and exclude them from scoring."
https://openalex.org/W2557237091,"In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical experience of patients receiving doripenem-containing regimens for the treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in a tertiary care center and assessed the clinical usefulness of doripenem therapy in this clinical setting. In this retrospective study, the medical records of all adult patients who had ever received doripenem-containing therapy for the treatment of HCAIs were reviewed between September 1, 2012 and August 31, 2014, and the following data were extracted: age, gender, type of infection, disease severity, underlying comorbidities or conditions, and laboratory results. Additionally, we also extracted data regarding the rates of mortality and clinical and microbiological response. A total of 184 adult patients with HCAIs who had received doripenem-containing therapy were included in this study. Respiratory tract infections (n = 91, 49.5%) were the most common type of infection, followed by urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections. The mean APACHE II score was 14.5. The rate of clinical success was 78.2%, and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was only 13.0%. Among patients, in-hospital mortality was independently and significantly associated with APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR), 1.2825; 95% CI, 1.1123-1.4788) and achieving clinical success (OR, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.0003-0.409). In conclusion, the overall in-hospital mortality rate was low and the clinical success rate was high among HCAI patients receiving doripenem treatment. These results suggest that doripenem may be judiciously used for the treatment of patients with HCAIs."
https://openalex.org/W2558082784,"Newly manufactured electronic devices are subject to different levels of potential defects existing among the initial parameter information of the devices. In this study, a characterization of electromagnetic relays that were operated at their optimal performance with appropriate and steady parameter values was performed to estimate the levels of their potential defects and to develop a lifetime prediction model. First, the initial parameter information value and stability were quantified to measure the performance of the electronics. In particular, the values of the initial parameter information were estimated using the probability-weighted average method, whereas the stability of the parameter information was determined by using the difference between the extrema and end points of the fitting curves for the initial parameter information. Second, a lifetime prediction model for small-sized samples was proposed on the basis of both measures. Finally, a model for the relationship of the initial contact resistance and stability over the lifetime of the sampled electromagnetic relays was proposed and verified. A comparison of the actual and predicted lifetimes of the relays revealed a 15.4% relative error, indicating that the lifetime of electronic devices can be predicted based on their initial parameter information."
https://openalex.org/W2558007572,"Starch structure strongly influences starch physicochemical properties, determining the end uses of starch in various applications. To produce starches with novel structure and exploit the mechanism of starch granule formation, an (engineered) 4, 6-α-glucanotransferase (GTFB) from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 was introduced into two potato genetic backgrounds: amylose-containing line Kardal and amylose-free mutant amf. The resulting starches showed severe changes in granule morphology regardless of genetic backgrounds. Modified starches from amf background exhibited a significant increase in granule size and starch phosphate content relative to the control, while starches from Kardal background displayed a higher digestibility, but did not show changes in granule size and phosphate content. Transcriptome analysis revealed the existence of a mechanism to restore the regular packing of double helices in starch granules, which possibly resulted in the removal of novel glucose chains potentially introduced by the (engineered) GTFB. This amendment mechanics would also explain the difficulties to detect alterations in starch fine structure in the transgenic lines."
https://openalex.org/W2558488078,"Secreted proteins serve pivotal roles in the development of multicellular organisms, acting as structural matrix, extracellular enzymes, and signal molecules. However, how the secretome is regulated remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate, unexpectedly, that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), a critical transcriptional co-activator of metabolic gene expression, functions to down-regulate the expression of diverse genes encoding secreted molecules and extracellular matrix components to modulate the secretome. Using cell lines, primary cells, and mice, we show that both endogenous and exogenous PGC-1α down-regulate the expression of numerous genes encoding secreted molecules. Mechanistically, results obtained using mRNA stability measurements as well as intronic RNA expression analysis are consistent with a transcriptional effect of PGC-1α on the expression of genes encoding secreted proteins. Interestingly, PGC-1α requires the central heat shock response regulator heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) to affect some of its targets, and both factors co-reside on several target genes encoding secreted molecules in cells. Finally, using a mass spectrometric analysis of secreted proteins, we demonstrate that PGC-1α modulates the secretome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our results define a link between a key pathway controlling metabolic regulation and the regulation of the mammalian secretome."
