https://openalex.org/W2050994990,"The redox state of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was measured with the peptide N-Acetyl-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Cys-NH2. The peptide diffused across cellular membranes; some became glycosylated and thus trapped within the secretory pathway, and its cysteine residue underwent reversible thiol-disulfide exchanges with the surrounding redox buffer. Glycosylated peptides from cells were disulfide-linked to glutathione, indicating that glutathione is the major redox buffer in the secretory pathway. The redox state of the secretory pathway was more oxidative than that of the cytosol; the ratio of reduced glutathione to the disulfide form (GSH/GSSG) within the secretory pathway ranged from 1:1 to 3:1, whereas the overall cellular GSH/GSSG ratio ranged from 30:1 to 100:1. Cytosolic glutathione was also transported into the lumen of microsomes in a cell-free system. Although how the ER maintains an oxidative environment is not known, these results suggest that the demonstrated preferential transport of GSSG compared to GSH into the ER lumen may contribute to this redox compartmentation."

https://openalex.org/W2079384901,"Loss of cell cycle control and acquisition of chromosomal rearrangements such as gene amplification often occur during tumor progression, suggesting that they may be correlated. We show here that the wild-type p53 allele is lost when fibroblasts from patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) are passaged in vitro. Normal and LFS cells containing wild-type p53 arrested in G1 when challenged with the uridine biosynthesis inhibitor PALA and did not undergo PALA-selected gene amplification. The converse occurred in cells lacking wild-type p53 expression. Expression of wild-type p53 in transformants of immortal and tumor cells containing mutant p53 alleles restored G1 control and reduced the frequency of gene amplification to undetectable levels. These studies reveal that p53 contributes to a metabolically regulated G1 check-point, and they provide a model for understanding how abnormal cell cycle progression leads to the genetic rearrangements involved in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2076058809,"Cell surface complexes of class I MHC molecules and bound peptide antigens serve as specific recognition elements controlling the cytotoxic immune response. The 2.1 A structure of the human class I MHC molecule HLA-B27 provides a detailed composite image of a co-crystallized collection of HLA-B27-bound peptides, indicating that they share a common main-chain structure and length. It also permits direct visualization of the conservation of arginine as an ""anchor"" side chain at the second peptide position, which is bound in a potentially HLA-B27-specific pocket and may therefore have a role in the association of HLA-B27 with several diseases. Tight peptide binding to class I MHC molecules appears to result from the extensive contacts found at the ends of the cleft between peptide main-chain atoms and conserved MHC side chains, which also involve the peptide in stabilizing the three-dimensional fold of HLA-B27. The concentration of binding interactions at the peptide termini permits extensive sequence (and probably some length) variability in the center of the peptide, where it is exposed for T cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1992505533,"Two ""attentive"" tracking tasks reveal the existence of an attention-based motion process. In the first task, oppositely rotating luminance and color gratings were superimposed. Because of masking from the color grating, the bars of the luminance grating were not visible; nevertheless, their motion was visible and it determined the perceived direction of the stimulus rotation. On the other hand, the bars of the color grating were visible but they could only be seen to move (in the opposite direction to the overall stimulus rotation) when they were tracked with attention. In a second task, the perceived velocity of a color grating, typically slow at equiluminance, speeded up when individual bars were attentively tracked. These findings demonstrate two independent motion processes: one that is ""low-level"" or automatic in that it signals motion even in the absence of attention to the stimulus, and one that is mediated by attention to visible features and provides accurate velocity judgments independently of the features being tracked."
https://openalex.org/W1996222219,"A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure determination is reported for the polypeptide chain of a globular protein in strongly denaturing solution. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements with a 7 molar urea solution of the amino-terminal 63-residue domain of the 434-repressor and distance geometry calculations showed that the polypeptide segment 54 to 59 forms a hydrophobic cluster containing the side chains of Val54, Val56, Trp58, and Leu59. This residual structure in the urea-unfolded protein is related to the corresponding region of the native, folded protein by simple rearrangements of the residues 58 to 60. Based on these observations a model for the early phase of refolding of the 434-repressor(1-63) is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2081638226,"A link between ABL oncogenes and MYC is suggested by the transformation synergy that is observed when MYC is expressed at high levels. Dominant negative MYC proteins were overexpressed in fibroblasts to determine if MYC complements ABL oncogene transformation or is essential for this process. Transformation by both v-abl and BCR-ABL oncogenes was reduced 5- to 10-fold, whereas transformation by the serine/threonine kinase oncogene v-mos was unaffected. Using a retrovirus construct modified to express BCR-ABL and MYC genes simultaneously, we show that dominant negative MYC suppressed transformation of primary mouse bone marrow pre-B cells by BCR-ABL. These observations demonstrate that c-MYC is essential for transformation and help define the pathway by which these proteins cause transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1982498248,"Deletion of sequences 5' of the human red and green pigment gene array results in blue cone monochromacy, a disorder in which both red and green cone function are absent. To test whether these sequences are required for transcription of the adjacent visual pigment genes in cone photoreceptors, we produced transgenic mice carrying sequences upstream of the red and green pigment genes fused to a beta-galactosidase reporter. The patterns of transgene expression indicate that the human sequences direct expression to both long and short wave-sensitive cones in the mouse retina and that a region between 3.1 kb and 3.7 kb 5' of the red pigment gene transcription initiation site is essential for expression. Sequences within this region are highly conserved among humans, mice, and cattle, even though the latter two species have only a single visual pigment gene at this locus. These experiments suggest a model in which an interaction between the conserved 5' region and either the red or the green pigment gene promoter determines which of the two genes a given cone expresses."
https://openalex.org/W1500101213,"Cell death induced by growth factor withdrawal is a programed event in which gene transcription and translation are required. Thus, it is likely that genes encoding for transcriptional factors can play an important role in this process. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing c-fos and c-jun protooncogene expression and involvement in lymphoid cells deprived of growth factors. Interleukin (IL)-6- and IL-2-dependent mouse cell lines undergo programmed cell death after growth factor deprivation. Northern blot analysis shows that c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes are rapidly induced (within 60 min) after growth factor deprivation in IL-6- and IL-2-dependent mouse cells. Induction is transient, being undetectable at 120 min after deprivation. Induction of these protooncogenes is at the transcriptional level, as demonstrated by actinomycin D and nuclear run-off experiments. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against c-fos and c-jun mRNAs consistently reduced the expression of these genes in treated cells. This reduction was associated with increased survival of growth factor-deprived lymphoid cells, thus suggesting that the expression of c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes may represent an important early event in the activation of the genetic program of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2092862588,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) appears to act as a neurotrophic factor for basal forebrain and caudate-putamen cholinergic neurons. The mechanism by which NGF transduces its signal in these neurons is yet to be defined. Recent data indicate that the product of the trk gene, p140trk is a critical component of the NGF receptor. Herein, we show that p140trk mRNA is highly restricted in its distribution in the adult rat forebrain, that it is present in cholinergic neurons, and that most if not all cholinergic neurons contain p140trk mRNA. Furthermore, induction of trk expression by NGF suggests that neurotrophin-mediated up-regulation of their receptor tyrosine kinases is an important feature of their actions and that neurotrophins may regulate the activity of responsive neurons through increasing the level of their receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2023062131,"Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (GG transferase) from rat brain contains two components, A and B. Component B comprises polypeptides of 60 and 38 kd. Here we report the purification of component A, a single 95 kd polypeptide. The holoenzyme attaches 3H-geranylgeranyl to cysteines in two GTP-binding proteins, Rab3A and Rab1A. The reaction is abolished when both cysteines in the COOH-terminal CysCys sequence of Rab1A are mutated to serines. The mutant protein inhibits transfer of 3H-geranylgeranyl to wildtype Rab1A and Rab3A, suggesting that the enzyme recognizes conserved sequences distinct from the COOH-terminus. Six peptides from rat component A show striking similarity to the product of the defective gene in choroideremia, an X-linked retinal degeneration disease. The choroideremia protein resembles Rab3A GDI, which binds Rab3A. We hypothesize that component A binds conserved sequences in Rab and that component B transfers geranylgeranyl. A defect in this reaction may cause choroideremia."
https://openalex.org/W1972289087,"The recently discovered LIM motif is found in a set of homeodomain-containing proteins thought to mediate the generation of particular cell types. Of the four LIM domain family members described to date, mec-3 and lin-11 determine cell lineages in C. elegans. Isl-1 and Xlim-1 may play similar roles in vertebrates. We have identified a Drosophila member of this class, the product of the apterous (ap) gene. During embryogenesis, ap is expressed in a small subset of fusing mesodermal precursors that give rise to 6 muscles in each abdominal hemisegment and in 5 neurons within each corresponding CNS hemisegment. Lack of ap function results in loss of ap-expressing muscles, while misexpression of ap using a heterologous promoter produces ectopic muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1509371781,"Measurements of water permeability indicate the existence of a facilitated water transporting pathway in erythrocytes, kidney tubules and amphibian urinary bladder. Two lines of evidence suggest that one type of water channel is an approximately 30-kDa protein: the approximately 30-kDa target size determined by radiation inactivation (van Hoek, A. N., Hom, M. L., Luthjens, L. H., de Jong, M. D., Dempster, J. A., and van Os, C. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16633-16635) and the increased water permeability in oocytes that express mRNA encoding a 28-kDa erythrocyte protein (CHIP28, Preston, B. M., Carroll, T. P., Guggino, W. B., and Agre, P. (1992) Science 256, 385-387). We report direct evidence that CHIP28 is the erythrocyte water channel. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) remained high (0.029 cm/s, 37 degrees C) when erythrocyte membranes were stripped of nearly all proteins except for CHIP28. N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the 28-kDa protein was CHIP28. Pf in proteoliposomes reconstituted with solubilized CHIP28 was high (Pf = 0.03 cm/s, 37 degrees C), the activation energy was low (2.2 kcal/mol), and Pf was decreased by greater than 50-fold by mercurial sulfhydryl reagents and Me2SO. The single-channel water permeability was approximately 10(-13) cm3/s, slightly higher than that of the gramicidin A channel. The water channel excluded the small solute urea. These data establish a procedure to reconstitute functional water channels into liposomes and demonstrate that CHIP28 is the erythrocyte water channel."
https://openalex.org/W2043779715,"Our study explores the mechanisms behind neurite galvanotropism. Using phase, differential interference contrast and ratiometric fluorescence microscopy, we reveal four responses of N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells to 0.1-1.0 mV/microns uniform DC electric fields: cathode-directed neurite initiation and elongation, cathode-biased growth cone filopodial protrusions, transient cathode-localized calcium increases, and persistent cathode-localized membrane depolarizations. These newly demonstrated events are temporally and spatially correlated, suggesting that they are causally related. The calcium increases are prevented by calcium channel blockers and by the removal of extracellular calcium. We therefore propose that the observed field-induced membrane depolarizations activate voltage-dependent calcium channels, resulting in cathode-localized calcium influx. This, in turn, may initiate the observed cathode-biased growth cone filopodial protrusions, followed by the cathode-directed neurite elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2096899512,"Physical mapping of the human genome has until now been envisioned through single chromosome strategies. We demonstrate that by using large insert yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) a whole genome approach becomes feasible. YACs (22,000) of 810 kb mean size (5 genome equivalents) have been fingerprinted to obtain individual patterns of restriction fragments detected by a LINE-1 (L1) probe. More than 1000 contigs were assembled. Ten randomly chosen contigs were validated by metaphase chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization, as well as by analyzing the inter-Alu PCR patterns of their constituent YACs. We estimate that 15% to 20% of the human genome, mainly the L1-rich regions, is already covered with contigs larger than 3 Mb."
https://openalex.org/W2040112346,"In Drosophila, sex is determined by the X:A ratio. One major numerator element on the X chromosome is sisterless-b (sis-b), also called scute, which encodes an HLH-type transcription factor. We report here that an essential pan-neural gene, the autosomal HLH gene deadpan (dpn), acts as a denominator element. As revealed by dosage-dependent dominant interactions, males die with too high a ratio of sc+ to dpn+, caused by misexpression of Sex lethal (Sxl) in embryos, and females die with too low a ratio of sc+ to dpn+, because of altered embryonic Sxl expression. In addition, we found that the HLH gene extramacrochaetae (emc), like daughterless (da), is needed maternally for proper communication of the X:A ratio, thus supporting the idea that a set of HLH genes comprises a functional cassette that makes a sensitive and stable genetic switch used in both neural determination and sex determination."
https://openalex.org/W1561243612,"Activation of T cells by specific antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex encoded proteins is mediated by the T cell antigen receptor (TcR), consisting of a variable (Ti) and an invariant (CD3) subunits. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the earliest steps in TcR-mediated signal transduction. There are indications that the p60fyn protein tyrosine kinase is involved in signaling via TcR. However, enzymatic activation of the Src-related tyrosine kinases upon TcR triggering has not been shown yet, therefore the identity of TcR-activated tyrosine kinase(s) remains unclear. We demonstrate that cross-linking of CD3 activates p60fyn and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in human T cells (resting peripheral T cells, a helper T cell clone, a helper T cell clone immortalized with Herpesvirus saimiri, and a leukemic T cell line). Activation of p60fyn was fast, and its maximum (2-4-fold activation as compared with the basal activity) was followed by a decline. The amount of p60fyn in the cells remained unchanged. None of the other T cell Src-related tyrosine kinases was activated after cross-linking of CD3. Activation of p60fyn was induced by anti-CD3, but not by anti-CD4, anti-CD2, or anti-CD28. The activation was correlated with an increase of the phosphotyrosine content of p60fyn. These studies provide direct proof for the functional association between p60fyn and the TcR."
https://openalex.org/W1608856014,"Null mutants of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with a number of biochemical defects. In addition to being hypersensitive to oxygen toxicity, strains containing deletions in both the SOD1 (encoding Cu/Zn-SOD) and SOD2 (encoding Mn-SOD) genes are defective in sporulation, are associated with a high mutation rate, and are unable to biosynthesize lysine and methionine. The sod-linked defect in lysine metabolism was explored in detail and was found to occur at an early step in lysine biosynthesis, evidently at the level of the alpha-amino adipate transaminase. To better understand the role of SOD in cell metabolism, our laboratory has isolated yeast suppressors that have bypassed the SOD defect (bsd strains), that is, S. cerevisiae cells lacking SOD, yet resistant to oxygen toxicity. Two nuclear bsd complementation groups have been identified, and both suppress a variety of biological defects associated with sod1 and sod2 null mutants. These results demonstrate that a single gene mutation can alleviate the requirement for SOD in cell growth. Both bsd complementation groups are unable to utilize many non-fermentable carbon sources, suggesting a possible suppressor-linked defect in electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W2013501967,"The neuroendocrine bag cell neurons of the marine mollusk Aplysia produce prolonged inhibition that lasts for more than 2 hr. We purified a peptide from the abdominal ganglion that mimics this inhibition. Mass spectrometry and microsequence analysis indicate that the peptide is 40 aa long and is amidated at its carboxyl terminus. It is highly homologous to vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) and other members of the pancreatic polypeptide family. As determined from cloned cDNA, the gene coding for the precursor protein shares a common structural organization with genes encoding precursors of the vertebrate family. The peptides may therefore have arisen from a common ancestral gene. Bag cell neurons are immunoreactive for Aplysia NPY, and Northern blot analysis indicates that as with its vertebrate counterparts, the peptide is abundantly expressed in the CNS. This suggests that peptides related to NPY may have important functions in the nervous system of Aplysia as well as in other invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2133963766,"Highly localized changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) can be evoked in neuronal growth cones; these are followed by local changes in filopodia. Focally applied electric fields evoked spatially restricted, high magnitude increases in growth cone [Ca2+]i. The earliest and greatest increases were localized to small regions within a growth cone. Such fields also produced characteristic changes in the disposition of filopodia: both filopodial length and number were significantly increased on the cathode side of growth cones. The requirement for extracellular Ca2+ and the strong correlation between the evoked rise in [Ca2+]i and the changes in filopodia (r = 0.98) indicate that cathode stimulation results in local Ca2+ influx, leading to locally increased [Ca2+]; and local changes in filopodial behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1522304947,"Ceramide is a postulated intracellular modulator of cell growth and differentiation (Okazaki, T., Bielawska, A., Bell, R.M., and Hannun, Y. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15823-15831). In order to determine the structural and stereospecific requirements for ceramide effects on HL-60 cells, N-acyl-phenylaminoalcohol analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to mimic the effects of ceramide on cell proliferation and differentiation. These compounds share with ceramide a similar polar headgroup that allows the investigation of the roles of the primary and secondary hydroxyls, the hydrophobicity of the molecule, and stereospecificity. N-Myristoyl derivatives of phenylamino alcohols showed optimal activity over other chain length analogs and were able to mimic the effects of C2-ceramide on cell growth and differentiation. Neither the primary nor the secondary alcohol was necessary for activity, but the amide-linked acyl chain was required. Stereospecificity of action was demonstrated with an enantiomeric pair: D-erythro-N-myristoyl-2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol (C14-D-e-APP-1) and L-erythro-N-myristoyl-2-amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol (C14-L-e-APP-1). The D stereoisomer was as effective as C2-ceramide in inhibiting HL-60 cell growth and in inducing cell differentiation, whereas the L enantiomer lacked activity in both assays. These results suggest stereospecific action of ceramide and strongly support a physiologic role for ceramide as an intracellular mediator with primary roles in regulation of cell growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1620131620,"Studies of the specificity of phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) for different substrates have usually been carried out in vesicles or mixed micelles, where differences in shape, size, or charge of vesicles formed with different phospholipids may give misleading results. Another factor is binding of the enzyme to the phospholipid surface, which has recently been addressed using vesicles of an anionic phospholipid, dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol (DMPM) to which some extracellular PLA2s were shown to bind with a very high affinity (Jain, M. K., and Berg, O. G. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1002, 127-156). In the present report we have used a similar system to study the substrate preferences of two human PLA2s that are thought to be physiologically relevant in the metabolism of arachidonic acid: a recombinant form of the human synovial fluid (14 kDa) PLA2 and the cytosolic (85 kDa) PLA2 found in monocytic cells. It is shown that both human enzymes bind tightly to DMPM vesicles and follow the basic characteristics of processive hydrolysis in this model using analysis of progress curves and substrate competition experiments. Mixed vesicles containing DMPM with small amounts (3-5 mol%) of other phospholipids have been used to study the substrate selectivity of the two human isoenzymes. The synovial fluid PLA2 shows a clear preference (approximately 7-fold) for sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine over sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Within glycerophosphocholines, this enzyme displays little preference for the sn-2 fatty acyl group, and a slight preference for phospholipids with sn-1-acyl versus sn-1-alkyl substituents. In contrast, the cytosolic PLA2 shows a marked selectivity for arachidonoyl in the sn-2 position and only minor differences in selectivity for the polar head group in the sn-3 position. This enzyme does not distinguish between sn-1-acyl and sn-1-alkyl subclasses of glycerophosphocholines."
https://openalex.org/W1483263363,"NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the native alpha-subunit of the G protein Gq(alpha q) or a mutant (Q209L) form of alpha q. Cells expressing Q209L-alpha q showed greatly enhanced basal phospholipase C activity. Stimulation of phospholipase C activity by prostaglandin F2 alpha or fetal calf serum was increased up to 10-fold in Q209L-alpha q-transfected cells. Continuous expression of Q209L-alpha q or overexpression of alpha q in NIH-3T3 cells resulted in formation of foci after 3 weeks. The number of foci was proportional to the number of transfected cells and was greater in cells expressing the Q209L-alpha q than in cells that overexpressed the wild type alpha q. Q209L-alpha q-transfected NIH-3T3 cells also formed colonies in soft agar indicating their capacity to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Expression of Q209L-alpha q in Rat-1 cells resulted in enhanced basal and fetal calf serum-stimulated phospholipase C activity, but these cells were not transformed as assessed by either the focus formation or the soft agar colony formation assays. These results indicate that expression of continuously activated Gq-alpha can result in transformation in a cell type-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1562562461,"Aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus contains no pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or other cofactors such as FAD, NAD+, and metal ions. It was affected by neither carbonyl reagents such as hydroxylamine nor sodium borohydride but was strongly inhibited by iodoacetamide and other thiol reagents. Aspartate, cysteate, and cysteine sulfinate were the only substrates. The Km values for L- and D-aspartate were 35 and 8.7 mM, respectively. The enzyme catalyzed the exchange of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate with the solvent hydrogen. Racemization of L-aspartate in 2H2O showed an overshooting in the optical rotation of aspartate before the substrate was fully racemized. This shows that the removal of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate is at least partially rate-determining. When L- or D-aspartate was incubated with aspartate racemase in tritiated water, tritium was incorporated preferentially into the product enantiomer. The results strongly suggest that aspartate racemase contains two hydrogen acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2011405524,"To investigate the role of intracellular Ca2+ in the survival of developing neurons before they become neurotrophic factor dependent, we have studied chick embryo nodose neurons, which have a particularly protracted period of neurorophic factor independence. Pharmacological reduction of intracellular free Ca2+ or depletion of either Ca2+-regulated or inositol trisphosphate-regulated intracellular Ca2+ stores kills early neurotrophic factor-independent neurons, but has a negligible effect on older neurons growing in the presence of brain-derived neutrotrophic factor. Shortly before they become dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nodose neurons express L-type Ca2+ channels and their survival can be enhanced by depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx. We conclude that intracellular Ca2+ plays a role in regulating neuronal survival both prior to and after the onset of neurotrophic factor dependence, but does not mediate the survival-promoting effects of neurotrophic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1549163149,"We present evidence that polyamine uptake into rat liver mitochondria is mediated by a specific polyamine uniporter. Polyamine transport is not mediated by the ornithine, lysine, or Ca2+ transporters of mitochondria. Polyamine transport is a saturable process, with apparent Km values of 0.13 mM for spermine, 0.26 mM for spermidine, and 1 mM for putrescine. These substrates are mutually competitive inhibitors, indicating a common transport system. Polyamine transport is strictly dependent on membrane potential and insensitive to medium pH, showing that these polycations are transported electrophoretically. Spermine, spermidine, and putrescine are taken up by rat liver mitochondria at rates that increase with increasing valence of the transported species. The activation enthalpies for transport were 24, 32, and 59 kJ/mol for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, respectively. These values, which amount to about 12 kJ/mol per charge transferred, may be compared to a value of 76 kJ/mol observed for monovalent tetraethylammonium cation. Flux-voltage analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that the mitochondrial polyamine transporter catalyzes transport via a channel mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1988615905,"Earlier work has indicated that the period length of Drosophila circadian behavioral rhythms is dependent on the abundance of the period (per) gene product. Increased expression of this gene has been associated with period shortening for both the circadian eclosion (pupal hatching) rhythm and circadian locomotor activity rhythms of adult Drosophila. In this study it is shown that a wide variety of missense mutations, affecting a region of the per protein consisting of approximately 20 aa, predominantly generate short period phenotypes. The prevalence of such mutations suggests that short period phenotypes may result from loss or depression of function in this domain of the per protein. Possibly mutations in the region eliminate a regulatory function provided by this segment, or substantially increase stability of the mutant protein."
https://openalex.org/W1495469243,"For the elucidation of the mechanism of membrane stabilization by vitamin E, the effects of alpha-tocopherol and its model compounds on either retinol-induced hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes or the permeability and fluidity of liposomal membranes have been studied. Retinol-induced rabbit erythrocyte hemolysis has been found not to be caused by the oxidative disruption of erythrocyte membrane lipids initiated by retinol oxidation, but rather to arise from physical damage of the membrane micelle induced by penetration of retinol molecules. In suppressing hemolysis, alpha-tocopherol was more effective than other naturally occurring tocopherols. alpha-Tocopheryl acetate, nicotinate, and 6-deoxy-alpha-tocopherol were more effective than alpha-tocopherol itself. The inhibitory effects of alpha-tocopherol model compounds having side chains with at least two isoprene units or a long straight chain instead of the isoprenoid side chain were similar to those of alpha-tocopherol. These data suggest that for protection of membranes against retinol-induced damage, the hydroxyl group of alpha-tocopherol is not critical, but rather the chroman ring, three methyl groups on the aromatic ring, and the long side chain are necessary. To verify the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on hemolysis, not only the effect of vitamin E and its model compounds on the membrane permeability and fluidity, but also the mobility of alpha-tocopherol molecule in membranes has been investigated using bilayer liposomes as the model membranes. Addition of alpha-tocopherol to membranes produced a greater decrease in the permeability and fluidity of rat liver phosphatidylcholine liposomes compared with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes. In dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes, however, alpha-tocopherol was less effective, that is, the more unsaturated the lipids, the more they interact with alpha-tocopherol. 2,2,5,7,8-Pentamethyl-6-chromanol with no isoprenoid side chain and phytol without the chromanol moiety had no effect. The measurement of 13C NMR relaxation times revealed that the mobility of methyl groups on the aromatic ring of alpha-tocopherol in membranes is significantly restricted. In contrast, the methyl groups at positions 4'a and 8'a on the isoprenoid side chain have high degrees of motional freedom in the lipid core of membranes. Furthermore, it was found that alpha-tocopherol in membranes interacts with chromate ions added as potassium chromate outside the membranes, resulting in an increase in membrane fluidity. These results are compatible with those of the inhibitory effect on retinol-induced erythrocyte hemolysis. On the basis of the results obtained here, a possible mechanism for membrane stabilization by vitamin E is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1587521815,"The three-dimensional structure of recombinant human muscle fatty acid-binding protein with a bound fatty acid has been solved and refined with x-ray diffraction data to 2.1 A resolution. The refined model has a crystallographic R factor of 19.5% for data between 9.0 and 2.1 A (7243 unique reflections) and root-mean-square deviations in bond length and bond angle of 0.013 A and 2.7 degrees. The protein contains 10 antiparallel beta-strands and two short alpha-helices which are arranged into two approximately orthogonal beta-sheets. Difference electron density maps and a multiple isomorphous derivative electron density map showed the presence of a single bound molecule of a long chain fatty acid within the interior core of the protein. The hydrocarbon tail of the fatty acid was found to be in a U-shaped conformation. Seven ordered water molecules were also identified within the interior of the protein in a pocket on the pseudo-si face of the fatty acid's bent hydrocarbon tail. The methylene tail of the fatty acid forms van der Waals interactions with atoms from 13 residues and three ordered waters. The carboxylate of the fatty acid is located in the interior of the protein where it forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Tyr128 and Arg126 and two ordered water molecules. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of human muscle fatty acid-binding protein and rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein shows strong similarity. Both proteins bind a single fatty acid within their interior cores, but the bound fatty acids are very different in their conformations and interactions. These findings suggest that the intestinal and muscle fatty acid-binding proteins have evolved distinct binding sites in order to satisfy different requirements within the tissues where they are expressed."

These data have permitted the calculation of two active-site ionization constants in the free enzymes (pKe1 and pK32) and in the enzyme-substrate complexes (pKes1 and pKes2). The pKe1 of rhizopuspepsin (2.8) is near that of a normal carboxyl group and near the pKe1 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (3.32) (Ido, E., Han, H. P., Kezdy, F. J., and Tang, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24359-24366). The pKe1 of pepsin (1.57) is thus abnormally low. The pKe2 of rhizopuspepsin (4.44) is lower than that of pepsin (5.02) and HIV protease (6.80). The binding of substrate to rhizopuspepsin causes the lowering of pKes1 to 1.8 and the elevating of pKes2 to above 6. The pK alpha shifts due to substrate binding are much less pronounced in pepsin. Thus, the two enzyme-substrate complexes have similar pK alpha values. For both pepsin and rhizopuspepsin, the removal of hydrogen bonds to the active-site carboxyls by mutagenesis results in negligible changes in the four pK alpha values. The major alteration caused by these mutations is the decrease in kcat values, while there is little change in Km. These observations suggest that these hydrogen bonds to the active-site aspartyls contribute little to the pH-activity relationships of the aspartic proteases. The role of the active-site hydrogen bonds may well be to preserve the conformational rigidity of the catalytic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1489392215,"The GTP-stimulated carboxyl methylation of an M(r) 23,000 protein was investigated in brain homogenates. An M(r) 23,000 methylation substrate was purified from brain homogenates, using an assay for protein methyl-acceptor activity in the presence of a membrane-bound methyltransferase. The M(r) 23,000 methyl-acceptor protein was identified as a soluble form of the GTP-binding protein G25K, based on antibody reactivity and amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides. Two forms of methylated G25K, differing in isoelectric points, were isolated. The soluble G25K could be methylated with a stoichiometry approaching 1 mol of methyl group per mol of G25K, and guanosine 5'-O-3-(thio)triphosphate stimulated the methylation by decreasing the Km for G25K from 0.79 to 0.17 microM. After methylation, the G25K was associated with the membrane fraction. The soluble G25K was isolated as a heterodimer of G25K and an M(r) 28,000 protein. The G25K and M(r) 28,000 protein complex was dissociated with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate detergent, and the subunits were separated by Mono-Q chromatography. The association of the M(r) 28,000 protein with G25K decreased the methylation of G25K and altered the guanine nucleotide specificity, indicating that the M(r) 28,000 protein may regulate the methylation of G25K."
https://openalex.org/W1569446257,"Thioesterase II is a 29-kDa monomer which, in certain specialized tissues, acts as a chain terminator in fatty acid synthesis by hydrolyzing medium-chain fatty acids from the fatty acid synthase. As with serine proteases, hydrolysis appears to involve acylation of the active site serine residue (Ser-101) assisted by a histidine, tentatively identified as His-237. To determine whether in the folded protein His-237 is close enough to accept a proton from the Ser-101 hydroxyl, we have made use of a Ser101Cys mutant which retains up to 90% of catalytic activity. Unlike the wild-type enzyme, the S101C thioesterase is inhibited with stoichiometric amounts of the bifunctional alkylating reagent 1,3-dibromopropanone. To facilitate identification of the alkylated residue(s), the keto group introduced into the dibromopropanone-modified S101C mutant was radiolabeled by reduction with sodium [3H] borohydride. The protein was then digested and the radiolabeled peptides analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. The experimental data unambiguously showed that dibromopropanone cross-linked the active site Cys-101 with His-237, demonstrating that these residues are positioned within 5 A of each other. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in the wild-type thioesterase His-237 accepts a proton from Ser-101, thus increasing its nucleophilic character and improving the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The possibility that exchange of cysteine and serine active site residues has occurred in the evolution of thioesterases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1558949498,"Rab proteins, one of the subfamilies of ras-like small GTP-binding proteins, are attached to cellular compartments or transport vesicles and may determine the specificity of fusion between these compartments and vesicles. It has been proposed that they alternate between a membrane-bound and a cytosolic state during their functional cycle. We have used a photo-crosslinking approach to identify their cytosolic interaction partners. In vitro synthesized rab5 was cross-linked in the presence of ATP mainly to three cytosolic proteins of 52, 65, and 85 kDa. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the cross-linked products suggested that they were part of a 10-14 S complex. Furthermore, rab5 was cross-linked to these and additional cytosolic proteins of 42, 48, and 160 kDa in the absence of ATP. Unexpectedly, upon ATP depletion of the cytosol cross-linked and noncross-linked rab5 was found in a sedimentable high molecular weight structure. Other members of the rab subfamily, but not N-ras, also sedimented under these conditions. Electrophoretic and electron microscopic analysis of the pelleted material revealed that it contained actin filament bundles and intermediate filaments. Our data suggest that cytosolic rab proteins interact with several proteins in a 10-14 S complex, and that the rab proteins may interact directly or indirectly via this complex with the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1675264293,"Almost all biotin enzymes contain the conserved tetrapeptide Ala-Met-Bct-Met (Bct, N epsilon-biotinyl-L-lysine). In the 1.3 S biotinyl subunit of transcarboxylase (TC), this sequence is present between positions 87 and 90. The conserved nature of these amino acids implies a critical role in the function of biotin enzymes. In order to examine the role of these conserved amino acids, point mutations in the gene encoding the 1.3 S subunit have been made by site-directed mutagenesis to generate A87G, M88L, M90L, M88T, M88C, M88A, and a double mutant A87M, M88A in the 1.3 S subunit. TC, a multisubunit enzyme containing 12 S, 5 S, and 1.3 S subunits, catalyzes the transfer of a carboxyl group from methylmalonyl-CoA to pyruvate (overall reaction). TC can be dissociated into individual subunits and also reconstituted by assembling isolated subunits to a fully active form. The mutants of the 1.3 S subunit have been reconstituted with native 5 S and 12 S subunits from Propionibacterium shermanii. The effects of mutations on the activity of TC were compared with that of TC-1.3 S wild type (WT) prepared in a similar manner. The results show that any substitution of a residue in the conserved tetrapeptide causes impairment of the rate of TC activity. Comparison of gel filtration profiles, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron micrographs of the TC assembled with mutant 1.3 S and with wild type 1.3 S subunits showed that the impairment of the overall activity was not due to a failure of the subunits to assemble into complexes. Steady state kinetic analysis using the mutant 1.3 S subunits indicated that the Km for methylmalonyl-CoA or pyruvate did not change significantly indicating that the binding of substrates is not altered. However, the kcat values were significantly lower for mutants at positions 87 and 88 than for those at position 90. The replacement of methionine at position 88 either by hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues significantly altered the activity in the overall reaction, while similar substitution at position 90 did not dramatically alter the kcat. These results suggest that Ala-87 and Met-88 are catalytically critical in the conserved tetrapeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1595510881,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its receptor complex have become one of the most studied members of a growing family of protein hormones characterized by structural similarities in both ligands and their receptors. Structure-function studies of IL-2 have been complicated by the multimeric nature of its receptor. Two receptor subunits (55- and 75-kDa type I cell surface proteins) can participate to form the high affinity binding site. Although the IL-2 is apparently unique in some respects, similar subunit cooperativity has now been shown to be a common feature for other members of this receptor family. The availability of cell lines expressing the individual IL-2 receptor subunits has allowed detailed analysis of subunit binding characteristics. Results regarding the relationship of molecular recognition at each subunit to the mechanism of ligand binding at the high affinity site, however, have led to different interpretations. In this study we have employed previously prepared C-terminal IL-2 mutant proteins to examine receptor binding at all three classes using a variety of equilibrium and kinetic techniques. These results indicate that the high affinity IL-2 receptor complex includes the p55/p75 heterodimer prior to IL-2 binding and that both receptor subunits participate simultaneously in ligand capture."
https://openalex.org/W1527992778,"Secretion of catecholamines from individual bovine adrenal medullary cells grown in primary culture has been investigated with a carbon-fiber microelectrode placed adjacent to the cells. Oxidation of catecholamines at the electrode surface results in changes in current, which give a real-time measure of catecholamine secretion. Chemical agents are introduced to the individual cells by pressure ejection from micropipettes. When incubated in Ca(2+)-containing buffers, secretion is not observed. However, permeabilization of the cell by exposure to 20 microM digitonin for approximately 15 s results in a Ca(2+)-dependent secretion, and the contents of individual vesicles are detected in the form of sharp spikes. The rate at which spikes occur is a function of the Ca2+ concentration in the external media and reaches a maximum at 19 microM Ca2+. The area of the spikes range from 0.1 to greater than 10 picocoulombs, but the majority are less than 2 picocoulombs, corresponding to less than 6 x 10(6) molecules detected per spike. Histograms of the spike areas are essentially independent of the Ca2+ concentration, indicating that the population of vesicles which undergo exocytosis is the same for all concentrations. Exocytotic secretion can be distinguished from nonexocytotic release by analysis of the shape of the spikes."
https://openalex.org/W1545357156,"DNA clones encoding chicken T-protein of the glycine cleavage system were isolated from chicken liver lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. Three overlapping clones provided an open reading frame of 1176 nucleotides that predicts a polypeptide of 392 amino acids (M(r) 42,056) comprised of a 16-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence and a 376-residue mature protein (M(r) 40,292). The amino acid sequence predicted for the mature protein showed 67% identity with that of bovine T-protein. A cDNA encoding mature T-protein was constructed, and the nucleotide sequence just downstream of the initiation codon was modified without amino acid substitution to reduce the free energy of formation for the folded mRNA. Expression plasmids containing these cDNA variants produced large amounts of T-protein in Escherichia coli, while very low expression was observed with a plasmid containing wild type cDNA. Enzymatically active T-protein was obtained when the expression was conducted at 30 degrees C with 25 microM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. Under the full inducing condition (at 37 degrees C and 1 mM inducer), the expressed T-protein was recovered as insoluble and inactive protein. The recombinant T-protein was purified to near homogeneity with a yield of about 30%. Apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is approximately 40,000, similar to the size of T-protein purified from chicken liver. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (9 residues) revealed 100% identity with chicken T-protein determined chemically. The kinetic properties of the recombinant T-protein resembled those of the native chicken T-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1559941460,"Squalene synthase (farnesyldiphosphate:farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.21) converts farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene, the first metabolic step committed solely to the biosynthesis of sterols. Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting technique designed to screen for cells defective in the regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, we isolated a squalene synthase-deficient mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The mutant cell line, designated SSD, exhibits less than 7% of the squalene synthase activity of the parental cell line, CHO-HMGal. Both the SSD and the parental cells stably express HMGal, a model protein for studying the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, which consists of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase fused to bacterial beta-galactosidase (Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841). In this study, the regulatory effects of mevalonate and compactin on the activity levels of HMGal are substantially reduced in SSD cells as compared to the parental cell line. In lipid-poor medium, SSD cell growth is arrested. The rate of [3H]acetate incorporation into cholesterol for the mutant SSD cells is less than 2% of the rate for the parental cells. However, the incorporation of [3H] squalene into sterols is essentially wild type for SSD cells. When the mutant SSD cells are fed [3H]acetate, radioactivity accumulates in farnesol, much of which is secreted into the medium. By growing SSD cells in lipid-poor medium, a revertant cell type, designated SSR, was isolated. In every assay performed the revertant SSR cells exhibited a phenotype that was essentially wild type, demonstrating that the SSD mutant phenotype was the result of a single mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1496843009,"The melibiose carrier of Salmonella typhimurium is under the control of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). We isolated mutants of the melibiose carrier that showed resistance to inhibition via the PTS. Growth of the mutants on melibiose was not inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose, a non-metabolizable substrate of the PTS, although growth of the parent strain was inhibited. Transport activity of the melibiose carrier in the mutants was fairly resistant to inhibition by 2-deoxyglucose, although the activity in the parent was sensitive to inhibition. We cloned the mutated melB gene that encodes the melibiose carrier, determined the nucleotide sequences, and identified replaced nucleotides. The mutations resulted in substitutions of Asp-438 with Tyr, Arg-441 with Ser, or Ile-445 with Asn. All of these residues are in the COOH-terminal region of the carrier. The secondary structure of this region is predicted to be an alpha-helix, and the mutated residues were on the same side of the helix. This region showed sequence similarity to a region of the MalK protein, in which substitution of amino acid residues also resulted in PTS-resistant mutants. Thus the COOH-terminal portion of the melibiose carrier is important for the interaction of dephosphorylated IIIGlc, which is an entity causing reversible inactivation of the carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1533756051,"We studied recognition and binding of synthetic template-primers by Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holoenzyme. The template-primers used contained either mismatched base pairs at various positions in the primer region or exocyclic propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG) adducts at various positions in both template and primer.pol alpha requires primer-terminal complementarity of greater than or equal to 4 base pairs for efficient binding and incorporation. When a mismatched base pair is at the -4 position relative to the 3'-primer terminus, minimal but detectable binding occurs. This is consistent with the ability of pol alpha to incorporate a single nucleotide on a template-primer containing a mismatch at this position, but at a rate of only 7% relative to incorporation on a perfectly matched template-primer. No binding or incorporation (less than 1% of incorporation on a perfectly matched template-primer) was evident when a mismatched base pair was at the -3 position or closer, relative to the 3'-primer terminus. Similar results were obtained when PdG was placed at various positions in the primer region. When a PdG residue was located in the template region (+ 3 position relative to the 3'-primer terminus), single-nucleotide incorporation was stimulated 3-4-fold. These observations suggest that there are intrinsic aspects to the mechanism of nucleotide incorporation by pol alpha which ensure the fidelity of DNA synthesis by this enzyme and may provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanism of polymerase translocation along templates."
https://openalex.org/W1601091237,"A new type of endo-beta-galactosidase acting on the linkage region of peptidochondroitin sulfate was isolated from the mid-gut gland of the mollusk Patinopecten. The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephacryl S-200HR gel filtration, DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, and TSKgel Phenyl-5PW RP high performance liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme was free from exoglycosidases, sulfatases, and phosphatases. The specificity of the enzyme was as follows. 1) It acted on the internal galactoside linkage of sugar chains; 2) it specifically hydrolyzed the galactosylgalactose (Gal beta 1-3Gal) linkage, but not the galactosylxylose (Gal beta 1-4Xyl) linkage in the linkage region of peptidoglycans; 3) the enzyme activity was unaffected by the type of glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate or heparan sulfate used as a substrate; 4) keratan sulfate and some oligosaccharides from glycolipid were not degraded by the enzyme. These properties of the endo-beta-galactosidase characterize it as a new endo-beta-galactosidase with unique specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1522003608,"A novel type of blood group A-active glycosphingo-lipid was isolated from the epithelial cells of the small intestine of one strain of inbred rats. Electron-impact mass spectrometry of the permethylated and LiAlH4-reduced glycolipid indicated that it is a decaglycosylceramide with a branched oligosaccharide chain. Methylation analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy of the partially methylated alditol acetates, sequential degradation by exoglycosidases and characterization of the reaction products by TLC immunostaining with appropriate anti-A and anti-H antibodies, and 1H NMR spectrometry resulted in the characterization of a decaglycosylceramide with two variants in a 7/3 ratio. It was termed AA-10. [formula: see text] The major variant has only type 1 chains, whereas the minor one has type 2 chain in the C6-linked branch. This is a novel type of glycolipid with a blood group A-active tetrasaccharide repeat. Genetic analysis demonstrated that AA-10 is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait."
https://openalex.org/W1602510608,"EcoRI DNA methyltransferase contains tryptophans at positions 183 and 225. Tryptophan 225 is adjacent to residues previously implicated in S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) binding and to cysteine 223, previously shown to be the site of N-ethyl maleimide-mediated inactivation of the enzyme (Reich, N. O., and Everett, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8929-8934; Everett, E. A., Falick, A. M., and Reich, N. O. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17713-17719). The fluorescence spectra of the wild-type enzyme is centered at 338 nm indicating partial tryptophan solvent accessibility. Substitution of tryptophan 183 with phenylalanine results in a 45% drop in fluorescence intensity, but no shift in lambda max. DNA binding to the wild-type methyltransferase caused an increase in the fluorescence intensity, while binding to the tryptophan 183 mutant had a quenching effect, suggesting that DNA binding induces a conformational change near both tryptophans. Binding of AdoMet and various AdoMet analogs to the wild-type methyltransferase results in no change in the fluorescence spectrum when excitation occurs at 295 nm, suggesting that no conformational change occurs, and AdoMet does not interact with either tryptophan. In contrast, quenching was observed when excitation occurred at 280 nm, suggesting that AdoMet and its analogs may be quenching tyrosine to tryptophan energy transfer. Protein-ligand complexes were titrated with acrylamide, and the data also implicate conformational changes upon DNA binding but not upon AdoMet binding, consistent with previous limited proteolysis results (Reich, N. O., Maegley, K. A., Shoemaker, D.D., and Everett, E. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2940-2946)."
https://openalex.org/W1680965092,"HCO3- exit across the basolateral membrane of the kidney proximal tubule cell is mediated via an electrogenic Na+:HCO3- cotransporter. We have studied the effect of pH on the activity of this cotransport system in basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from rabbit renal cortex. At constant internal pH 6.0, increasing the external pH and [HCO3-] increased the rate of 4,4‘-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid-sensitive 22Na+ influx into the vesicles. To determine the role of internal pH on the activity of the Na+:HCO3- cotransport system, the influx of 22Na+ via HCO3-dependent Na(+)-Na+ exchange was measured in the absence of an initial pH and [HCO3-] gradient (pH(i) = pH(o), 5% CO2). Increasing the pH from 6.8 to 7.2 increased whereas, increasing the pH from 7.4 to 8.0 decreased the rate of 22Na+ influx via this exchange. Increasing pH at constant [HCO3-] (pH(i) = pH(o) = 8.0, 1.5% CO2 versus pH(i) = pH(o) = 7.2, 10% CO2) reduced the influx of 22Na+ via HCO3-dependent Na(+)-Na+ exchange. Increasing pH at constant [CO3(2-)](pH(i) = pH(o) = 8.0, 1.5% CO2 versus pH(i) = pH(o) = 7.2, 60% CO2) was associated with reduced 22Na+ uptake. Decreasing the pH (pH(i) = pH(o) = 6.3, 60% CO2 versus pH(i) = pH(o) = 7.2, 5% CO2) was associated with a reduced rate of HCO3(-)-dependent Na(+)-Na+ exchange. We conclude that the Na+:HCO3- cotransporter displays a significant pH sensitivity profile with the cotransporter being more functional at pH 7.0-7.4 and less active at more acid or alkaline pH. In addition, the results suggest that the pH sensitivity arises at the inner surface of the basolateral membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1674157723,"Euglena gracilis chloroplast translational initiation factor 2 (IF-2chl) occurs in several complex forms ranging in molecular mass from 200 to 800 kDa. Subunits of 97 to greater than 200 kDa have been observed in these preparations. Two monoclonal antibodies were prepared against the 97-kDa subunits of IF-2chl. Both of these antibodies recognize all of the higher molecular mass forms of this factor, suggesting that these subunits are closely related. Gel filtration chromatography indicates that the higher molecular mass subunits of IF-2chl are present in the higher molecular mass complexes, whereas the smaller subunits are present in the 200-400 kDa forms of IF-2chl. Probing extracts of light-induced and dark-grown cells with the antibodies indicates that the light induction of this chloroplast factor results from the synthesis of new polypeptide rather than from the activation of an inactive precursor form of the protein. Both the higher and lower molecular mass subunits of IF-2chl are present in 30 S initiation complexes as indicated by Western analysis. The binding of IF-2chl to chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits requires the presence of GTP, but does not require fMet-tRNA, messenger RNA, or other initiation factors. Neither polyclonal nor monoclonal antibodies against E. gracilis IF-2chl cross-react with Escherichia coli IF-2 or with animal mitochondrial IF-2."
https://openalex.org/W1520725720,"The alpha globin gene locus of the common gibbon (Hylobates lar) was isolated, and it contains two closely linked alpha globin genes that share the same arrangement as that found for the homologous genes of other catarrhine primates. The nucleotide sequences of the gibbon alpha globin genes were determined and compared with the alpha globin gene sequences from other primate species (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, baboon, and rhesus); the prosimian primate, galago, alpha A and alpha B globin genes provided the out-group for this analysis. The degree of divergence for both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions among the alpha globin genes are generally smaller for intraspecies than interspecies comparisons, which is indicative of concerted evolution between the paired alpha globin genes of each catarrhine species. The pattern of differences is suggestive of gene conversions. This possibility is supported by both site-by-site and branch-swapping parsimony analyses. The site-by-site parsimony analysis was also used to determine the 3' boundary of each catarrhine species-specific conversion. These alpha globin gene conversion events encompass most of the transcriptional region, including the promoter, exons, introns, and about one-half of the 3'-untranslated region. However, the paired gibbon alpha globin genes show the highest degree of divergence, differing by five nucleotides in their coding regions, three of which encode amino acid replacement substitutions. It appears that the last convergence event between the paired gibbon alpha globin genes is relatively ancient, having occurred approximately 11 million years ago. The remaining 3'-untranslated region and flanking DNAs show no evidence of involvement in any recent conversion event as the parsimony analysis of these sequences group all the alpha 1 globin genes of the different catarrhine species into one clade and all the alpha 2 globin gene of these species into a separate clade. The sequence comparison among the alpha globin genes of different primate species also provides interesting implications regarding the evolution and functional domains of the 3'-untranslated regions."
