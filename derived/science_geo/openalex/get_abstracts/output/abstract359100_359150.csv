The most important details have already been elucidated so far as avian malaria is concerned, but the development of the sporozoites in the prepatent stage in mammalian malaria has remained obscure in spite of the most painstaking and meticulous work in many centres of malaria research."

https://openalex.org/W2021922906,"THE kinetics of urea denaturation of globular proteins has been little investigated. This is surprising in view of the interesting results obtain t d by Hopkins1, who showed that the temperature coefficient of urea denaturation of egg-albumin (60 per cent urea) is negative."

https://openalex.org/W2015003779,"THE free-living nematodes of the sub-order Rhabditina are widespread in the soil1 and relatively easily cultivable2–4 on nutrient agar in the presence of bacteria and have short life-cycles (3–7 days from hatching to sexual maturity), with adult sizes up to 3 mm. in length. They offer, in our estimation, certain very interesting possibilities for the study of basic genetic phenomena—morphological, cytogenetic and physiological."

https://openalex.org/W1976620514,"THE recent paper by Woodward1 records the synthesis of polypeptides of very high molecular weight by the polymerization of N-carbonic anhydrides (I). This reaction is a well-known method of preparing polypeptides2,3,4, and Go and Tani5 prepared both a polyglycine of molecular weight about 6,000, and a co-polymer of L-leucine and glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2008748995,"IN a previous communication1, a preliminary account was given of observations and experiments on the relative edibility of the flesh of birds. Full details of this research have now been published elsewhere2. During the past two years, this work has been extended to an investigation of the relative edibility of ‘birds eggs. Final results of the inquiry, which is still in progress, will not be available for some time; but since, with the exception of a paper by C. F. M. Swynnerton published in 19163, the subject appears hitherto to have remained almost unexplored, it would now seem appropriate to summarize the new observations and to indicate certain conclusions to be drawn from them."
https://openalex.org/W2054277970,"EIGHTY-SEVEN strains of very varied bacteria, comprising common and rare strains from soil, pigmented and non-pigmented ‘‘miscellaneous strains, and a number of plant pathogens, were tested on eight micro-predators belonging to four different groups commonly found in soil. The methods used and the results obtained are given by one of us (B. N. S.) in papers dealing with these groups1-10. It has been shown that soil micro-predators are very selective in their bacterial food requirements ; some bacteria are edible and the others are completely or almost completely inedible. This article deals with the comparative edibility of bacterial strains by these micro-predators, and the probable role of"

https://openalex.org/W2085574830,"DURING the War, when many poor upland areas and commons in Britain were ploughed up for crop production, potatoes were commonly planted as a first crop in view of their tolerance to acid soil conditions. Many failures, however, were experienced where the soils were very strongly acid, with pH values of the order of 4·0, and it was shown that liming was necessary to correct the unfavourable conditions. Plants which survived on these acid soils usually showed pronounced symptoms of calcium deficiency in the haulms, and it was clear that the supply of this element was an important factor in determining success or failure of the crops."

https://openalex.org/W2040314940,"THE theory of primary calcification was advanced in 1928 by Kramer and Shear1 to explain the stages of mineral precipitation in bone in course of formation. If this theory is to apply to the process of ossification submitted by Roche2, it will refer to the beginning of the fourth stage, that of the deposit of salt in organic bone."
https://openalex.org/W2141780357,"FOR all sense-organs there exists a lower limit to the minimum perceptible energy, which is set by the Brownian motion in the sensory equipment itself. The minimum perceptible energy must be so large that only a small number of spontaneous excitations by thermal motion can occur. The quantitative relations have been estimated tentatively in certain cases."

https://openalex.org/W1966887388,MR. A. L. BACHARACH‘s letter1 on the use of the plate-and-cylinder method in reverse for assaying certain growth-factors suggests that it may be of interest to record some very similar experiments which I carried out during 1944–45.

https://openalex.org/W1983511493,"DURING the course of chemotherapeutic experiments on E. histolytica, the need for a suitable laboratory host for this parasite became early-apparent. Jones1 has obtained some interesting results by using young rats weighing 20-33 gm. for this purpose. We were, however, rather perturbed by the degree of infection with amoebae which occurred in the animals of an age suitable for experimental work, when examined by us as a preliminary to their use in experiments of the above nature."
https://openalex.org/W2032111268,"PLEROCERCOID larvæ of Schistocephalus solidus and Ligula intestinalis, when removed aseptically from their respective fish hosts by means of a special technique, develop into sexually mature tapeworms if cultured in vitro in certain nutrient media at 40° C.1,2. The eggs, which were produced in vitro in large numbers, proved on testing to be infertile. It was tentatively suggested that infertility of such eggs was possibly due to failure of normal copulation to take place within the culture tube, although other factors were also considered."

The light transmitted by the red filter from a daylight source was mixed with light transmitted by the Ilford Spectrum Green filter and matched for brightness against light transmitted by the Ilford Spectrum Yellow filter by varying the intensity of the yellow. The mean brightness-level for the eighteen deuteranopes was the same as for normal subjects for all red-green mixtures. For the twelve protanopes the red light was only 15·5 per cent as bright on the average as for normal subjects ; but the brightness-level steadily increased as green was added, until it reached the normal level at the pure green end."
https://openalex.org/W2058228064,"Gutenberg and Richter1 have recently published numerical travel-time data for P waves recorded at eight stations in the United States, following the detonation of an atomic bomb over Bikini on 1946 July 24. They point out the importance of these waves in checking travel-time tables, and use the results to test the accuracy of earlier tables2 published by them. The purpose of this note is to compare the data with the Jeffreys - Bullen tables3 ; and, further, to investigate the precision with which the result of this comparison may be applied to the question of the structure of the Pacific region."

https://openalex.org/W1993782357,"IN the note referring to Lewis‘s paper on mosquitoes and yellow fever in the Sudan which appeared in Nature of August 9, 1947, p. 186, it is stated that the disease has been exterminated from Khartoum as a result of mosquito control measures. This is not entirely correct. Khartoum is some distance north of the northern boundary of the yellow fever endemic area in the Sudan. Yellow fever has never been recorded in Khartoum, and immunity surveys reveal no evidence of the infection having occurred there during the life-time of the present inhabitants. Any suggestion that the disease has ever been identified in Khartoum might greatly increase the confusion of those who are at present devising regulations to prevent the international spread of yellow fever."

https://openalex.org/W2085650357,"KUNSTMANN, in an experiment on himself1, drank 10–20 litres of water daily, with an otherwise normal food intake. He felt fit during the experiment, his urinary output in sodium and chlorine sank to minimal values ; but nevertheless his sodium chloride balance became negative. On about the thirtieth day of the experiment, his chlorine excretion rose to abnormally high values and he felt ill, so he ended the experiment. We attempted to reproduce this experiment with rats. We gave them maize washed out in water, and twice daily 10 ml. of a 5·5 per cent glucose solution subcutaneously. In this way we attained great quantities of a rather dilute urine ; the animals slowly lost weight ; but the output of sodium and chlorine showed no increase, even on the fiftieth day of the experiment, and we failed to obtain a negative salt balance."
https://openalex.org/W2092514738,"IONOSPHERIC observations carried out for more than two decades have clearly established the existence of correlation between the variation of electron contents of the different ionospheric layers and solar activity. It has been found that there is a general increase in the ionization density during the period of maximum sunspot numbers. This general increase, as expected, has also been noticed during the present phase of maximum solar activity in the routine ionospheric observations made at the Wireless Laboratory of the University College of Science, Calcutta. Besides this general increase, however, certain peculiar features of the diurnal variation of the ionization density have also been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2095440946,"THE past year has seen the commemoration of the centenaries of many men and institutions, and thus homage has been paid, memories recalled, interest aroused and history enriched. Notable among commemorations in the realm of science and technology were those associated with the Chemical Society, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Netherlands Institution of Engineers, King‘s College Engineering Society, and with Edison, Graham Bell and Denis Papin. Papin‘s work (see Nature, Sept. 27, 1947, p. 422) belonged mainly to the seventeenth century, which saw the foundation of the Royal Society in 1660 and of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1666. Both these bodies sprang from earlier meetings of men with scientific leanings, and the meetings in France are recalled by the tercentenary of the death of Marin Mersenne, who carried on a large correspondence with men of science and joined with Mydorge, Roberval, Pascal and others in friendly discussions. Born at Souitiere (Sarthe) on September 8, 1588, he was educated at La Fleche, where for a time Descartes was his school-fellow, studied at the Sorbonne and entered the priesthood. He became the superior of a convent of his order in Paris, and he died there on September 1, 1648. An amiable and conciliatory man, he was given to experimenting, translated Galileo‘s mechanics, contributed to mathematics and was much devoted to music."
