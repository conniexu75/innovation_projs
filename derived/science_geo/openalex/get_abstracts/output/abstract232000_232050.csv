https://openalex.org/W2124873881,"The extent to which large duplications and deletions contribute to human genetic variation and diversity is unknown. Here, we show that large-scale copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) (about 100 kilobases and greater) contribute substantially to genomic variation between normal humans. Representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis of 20 individuals revealed a total of 221 copy number differences representing 76 unique CNPs. On average, individuals differed by 11 CNPs, and the average length of a CNP interval was 465 kilobases. We observed copy number variation of 70 different genes within CNP intervals, including genes involved in neurological function, regulation of cell growth, regulation of metabolism, and several genes known to be associated with disease."

To date, however, no commercial vaccine has been available in which the key carbohydrate antigens are produced synthetically. We describe the large-scale synthesis, pharmaceutical development, and clinical evaluation of a conjugate vaccine composed of a synthetic capsular polysaccharide antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The vaccine was evaluated in clinical trials in Cuba and showed long-term protective antibody titers that compared favorably to licensed products prepared with the Hib polysaccharide extracted from bacteria. This demonstrates that access to synthetic complex carbohydrate–based vaccines is feasible and provides a basis for further development of similar approaches for other human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2087519172,"Inherited channelopathies are at the origin of many neurological disorders. Here we report a form of channelopathy that is acquired in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of epilepsy in adults. The excitability of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites was increased in TLE because of decreased availability of A-type potassium ion channels due to transcriptional (loss of channels) and posttranslational (increased channel phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase) mechanisms. Kinase inhibition partly reversed dendritic excitability to control levels. Such acquired channelopathy is likely to amplify neuronal activity and may contribute to the initiation and/or propagation of seizures in TLE."

https://openalex.org/W2089583117,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is associated with RET and NTRK1 rearrangements and BRAF mutations. A series of 60 PTCs collected in a single center from Italian patients were histologically re-examined and subclassified as well differentiated or tall cell variant. The sample collection was analysed for the presence of all the reported PTC-associated genetic alterations through DNA or cDNA amplification, followed by automated sequencing. The analysis of exons 11 and 15 of BRAF gene revealed the T1796A (V599E) mutation in 32% of cases, and this alteration is significantly associated with PTC tall cell variant. Oncogenic rearrangements of RET and NTRK1 receptors were found in 33 and 5% of cases, respectively. No Ras mutations were detected. Overall, genetic alterations were detected in two-thirds of samples, and in no single case more than one mutational event was found simultaneously. Gene expression profiling of a subset of 31 tumors performed using cDNA microarray chips showed no strong differences in global gene expression among the different cases. However, a supervised analysis of the obtained data identified a subset of genes differentially expressed in tumors carrying BRAF mutation or RTK rearrangement."

https://openalex.org/W2076725548,"Current attempts to improve the survival of cancer patients largely depend on strategies to target tumor cell resistance. Naturally occurring dietary compounds such as resveratrol have gained considerable attention as cancer chemopreventive agents. Here, we report that resveratrol acts as potent sensitizer for anticancer drug-induced apoptosis by inducing cell cycle arrest, which in turn resulted in survivin depletion. Concomitant analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis revealed that pretreatment with resveratrol resulted in cell cycle arrest in S phase and apoptosis induction preferentially out of S phase upon subsequent drug treatment. Likewise, cell cycle arrest in S phase by cell cycle inhibitors enhanced drug-induced apoptosis. Resveratrol-mediated cell cycle arrest sensitized for apoptosis by downregulating survivin expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Similarly, downregulation of survivin expression using survivin antisense oligonucleotides sensitized for drug-induced apoptosis. Importantly, downregulation of survivin and enhanced drug-induced apoptosis by resveratrol occurred in various human tumor cell lines irrespective of p53 status. Thus, this combined sensitizer (resveratrol)/inducer (cytotoxic drugs) concept may be a novel strategy to enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapy in a variety of human cancers."

Though physiological role of this reaction is assigned to membrane organization during autophagy, its molecular details are still unknown. Here, we show that Escherichia coli cells coexpressed Atg8p, Atg7p (E1), and Atg3p (E2) allowed to form conjugate of Atg8p with endogenous PE. Further, we established an in vitro Atg8p-PE reconstitution system using purified Atg8pG116, Atg7p, Atg3p, and PE-containing liposomes, demonstrating that the Atg7p and the Atg3p are minimal catalysts for Atg8p-PE conjugate reaction. Efficiency of this lipidation reaction depends on the state of the substrate, PE (phospholipid bilayer and its lipid composition). It is also suggested that the lipidation induces a conformational change in the N-terminal region of Atg8p.

Autophagy, an intracellular bulk degradation system in the lysosomes/vacuoles of eukaryotic cells is necessary for the recycling of cytoplasmic components for survival during nutrient starvation conditions (1Klionsky D.J.

Membrane dynamics in autophagy are distinct from classical membrane trafficking. In particular, the mechanism by which this new double membrane-bounded compartment, the autophagosome, is formed has remained poorly understood. Genetic screens of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have identified 16 genes potentially involved in this process, named ATG genes (formerly APG/AUT) (4Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar).

Atg12p, a ubiquitin-like protein, is covalently linked to Atg5p through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of Atg12p and Lys149 of Atg5p by sequential reactions catalyzed by Atg7p (E1) and Atg10p (E2) (6Mizushima N.

Atg12p-Atg5p conjugates then associate with Atg16p to form a multimeric complex, Atg12p-Atg5p·Atg16p, mediated by Atg16p homo-oligomerization (11Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). The C-terminal arginine of newly synthesized Atg8p (Atg8pR117) is initially removed by the Atg4p protease to expose a C-terminal glycine residue (Atg8pG116) (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H.

Atg8pG116 is then activated by Atg7p (E1) and transferred to Atg3p (E2) (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Finally, the Atg8pG116 conjugates to PE through an amide bond between its C-terminal glycine and the amino group of PE (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Atg8p-PE is tightly associated with membranes, behaving as an integral membrane protein. Notably, the Atg8 conjugation system, while similar to ubiquitination, mechanically utilizes a ubiquitous phospholipid, not a protein, as a target. Liberation of the Atg8p moiety from Atg8p-PE by the action of Atg4p (deconjugation) is required for the normal progression of autophagy (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The mammalian Atg8p homologues, MAP1-LC3, GATE-16, and GABARAP, have been implicated in membrane dynamics, including autophagy, intra-Golgi transport, and GABA receptor sorting to the postsynaptic membrane (14Kabeya Y.

Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Whereas Abeliovich et al. (21Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) reported that significantly smaller vesicles than normal autophagosome were observed in a similar Δatg8 strain. These observations imply that the Atg8p-PE may function in normal development of autophagosomal membrane. In fact, previous immunoelectorn microscopic analyses demonstrated the specific localization of Atg8p to the isolation membrane (intermediate structure of autophagosome) under the starvation conditions (20Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar).The precise roles of the two conjugates during autophagosome formation remain unclear. Atg8p-PE conjugation is severely reduced in the absence of the Atg12p-Atg5p conjugate. Thus, it appears likely that the functions of these two conjugates, Atg8p-PE and Atg12p-Atg5p, are closely related. To identify the molecular events governing autophagosome formation, we need to address not only the function of each of the two conjugates, but also the interrelationship between Ag8p-PE and Atg12p-Atg5p. In this study, to address the molecular machinery involved in membrane dynamics, we focused on Atg8p lipidation, and developed in vitro reconstitution system of Atg8p-PE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Standard Molecular Genetic Methods—The Escherichia coli strains XL1Blue and BL21 (DE3) were used for plasmid construction and protein expression, respectively. Total lipid extracts from the E. coli strain W3011 and a PE-deficient strain, GN10, were used to make liposomes. E. coli transformants were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C, supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/ml). GN10 was grown in LB medium containing 50 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C (22Saha S.K. Nishijima S. Matsuzaki H. Shibuya I. Matsumoto K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates from the S. cerevisiae strain SEY6210 (MATαleu2-3 112 ura3-52 trp1-Δ901 his3-Δ200 ade2-101 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9) and its derivatives (Δatg7::HIS3 and Δatg3::TRP1) were used as Atg8p-PE mobility standards in Western blot analyses. Total lipid extracts from SEY6210 was used for making liposomes. Yeast cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% glucose) at 30 °C. Molecular biological procedures were performed in accordance with standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Plasmid Construction and Protein Expression in E. coli—To construct E. coli expression plasmids encoding Atg7-Myc (C-terminal 3× Myc-tagged Atg7), Atg3, Atg8G116 (C-terminal glycine-exposed form of Atg8), and Atg8R117 (C-terminal arginine-containing form of Atg8), the appropriate genes were amplified from the following plasmids, pRS424-Atg7-Myc, pRS426Atg3, and pRS426Atg8, by PCR using the following primers: (ATG7-MYC) KpnI-S.D. (Fw), 5′-GGGGTACCCCAGGAGGAATTCACCATGTCGTCAGA-3′, SmaI (Rv), 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGAATGCAAAATATTA-3′, (ATG3) SmaI-S.D. (Fw), 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGAAGGAGGAATTCACCATGTTAGATC-3′, BamHI (Rv), 5′-CGGGATCCCGTTACCAACCTTCC-3′, (ATG8G116) BglII-S.D.

(Rv), 5′-CCCAAGTTGGGCTAGCCAAATGTATTTTC-3′. The resulting PCR products all contained a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (S.D.) upstream of the start codon to facilitate efficient translation in E. coli. The amplified genes were subcloned into pUC18 and then inserted into the multiple cloning sites of the arabinose-inducible plasmids, pBAD18 and pBAD33 (24Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3904) Google Scholar). pBAD18 includes gene expression via the PBAD promoter, expresses AraC, confers Ampr (ampicillin resistance), and contains a pBR origin. pBAD33 includes gene expression via the PBAD promoter, expresses AraC, confers Cmr (chloramphenicol resistance), and contains a pACYC origin (diagram showed in Fig. 1A). Atg7C507S-Myc and Atg3C234S mutant forms were encoded by derivatives of the pBAD plasmids, containing single amino acid substitutions from cysteine to serine within the active centers of Atg7 and Atg3, respectively. These plasmids were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following mutagenesis oligonucleotides; (ATG7C507S) (Fw), 5′-ACTTTGGATCAAATGTCGACAGTAACTAGACC-3′, (Rv), 5′-GGGTCTAGTTACTGTCGACATTTGATCCAAAGT-3′, (ATG3C234S) (Fw), 5′-GTTTCCATTCATCCAAGCAAGCATGCTAATGTA-3′, (Rv), 5′-TACATTAGCATGCT TGCTTGGATGAATGGAAAC-3′. BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pBAD-Atg7-Myc and either pBADC-Atg8G116, pBADC-Atg3Atg8R117, or pBADC-Atg3 Atg8G116. Transformed cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.5 prior to the addition of 0.2% arabinose to the cultures. After induction for 1 h, cells were harvested and lysed in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by sonication (2.0 OD unit cells/100 μl). For Western blotting, cell lysates (equivalent to 0.04 OD unit cells) were subjected to SDS-PAGE containing 6 m urea (urea-SDS-PAGE).Protein Purification—To purify the recombinant Atg proteins, we constructed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of the desired Atgs (GST-Atg7-Myc, GST-Atg3, GST-Atg3C234S and GST-Atg8G116) by insertion of PCR products into the cloning site (BamHI/SalI) of pGEX4-T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Following introduction of the obtained plasmids into BL21 (DE3) E. coli, expression of each protein was induced by addition of 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d(-)-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium. After induction, cells were disrupted by sonication in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, obtained cell lysates were incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (50% slurry in TBST) (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C to collect recombinant proteins. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were washed with TBST, then suspended in 400 μl of TBS containing 2 mm DTT. The GST-fused Atg proteins were treated with thrombin (10 units) at 20 °C for 1 h; the glutathione-Sepharose 4B/GST complexes were then removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified Atg proteins were then diluted in TBS containing 50% glycerol for storage at –30 °C.Extraction of Total Lipids and Liposome Preparation—W3011 and GN10 E. coli strains were grown in LB medium containing 50 mm MgCl2 to stationary phase. SEY6210 yeast strain was grown in YEPD to stationary phase. Both types of cells were harvested (cells wet-weight 10 g), and total lipids were extracted by Bligh and Dyer's methods (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The total lipids were dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform, and the concentration of total phospholipids was quantified by a phosphorous assay using the phosphomolybdate reaction (26Bartlett G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1958; 75: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Individual phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, and the composition of phospholipids was determined by the phosphorous assay (W3011; PE/PG/CL/PA = 75.4:16.6:4.3:3.57, GN10; PE/PG/CL/PA = <0.01:52.6:33.6:11.4, SEY6210; PE/PC/PS/PI = 16.6:51.7:13.7:18.0).Total lipids from E. coli and yeast were used to generate E. coli and yeast total lipid liposomes, respectively. To prepare liposomes with various phospholipid compositions, phospholipids were mixed in the appropriate ratios from stocks dissolved in chloroform as described above. PE from E. coli, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphoshatidylcholine (POPC), dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), phosphatidylinositol (PI) from bovine liver, and dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA), dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. After transfer to a glass tube, the chloroform solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. Samples were dried further in a desiccator under vacuum for 12 h. The resulting lipid film was suspended in a buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) at a final concentration of 1 mm phospholipids by vortexing at room temperature. Samples were then subjected to sonication for 5 min to obtain small unilamellar liposomes.Reconstitution of Atg8p-PE Conjugation System in Vitro—In vitro reconstitution of Atg8 system was performed using purified Atg proteins and liposomes. Liposomes were mixed with purified Atg7p-Myc, Atg3p (or Atg3pC234S), and Atg8pG116 in reconstitution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT) in the presence of an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), and 2.5 μg of creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.0). The reaction mixture (with a final pH of 7.6) was incubated at 30 °C for 10–60 min.Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Polyclonal antibodies against full-length Atg3p and against the Atg8p N-terminal peptide have been previously described (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against full-length Atg8p and a monoclonal antibody against Myc (9E10) were purchased from Rockland and BabCo, respectively.SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli's method. SDS-PAGE separation in the presence of 6 m urea (urea-SDS-PAGE gel) was used to distinguish Atg8p and Atg8p-PE conjugates, as described (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). To visualize the protein bands within the gel, SDS-PAGE gels were stained using GelCode Blue (Pierce). For immunoblot analyses, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore). Immunoblotting analysis was performed using rabbit or mouse antibodies against the specified proteins, then visualized using either peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The immunoreactive protein bands were detected using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)Immunoprecipitation—In vitro Atg8p-PE conjugation was performed as described in the above. The Atg8p-PE-bound liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The harvested Atg8p-PE liposomes were mixed with the nearly equal amount of Atg8p, and treated with 2% CHAPS for 1 h on ice. The solubilized Atg8p-PE and Atg8p were suspended in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 150 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (w/w)), and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis according to previously reported methods with the following modifications (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of the anti-N-terminal 14 peptide of Atg8p antibody. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) were subsequently added to the samples and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were washed with TBS containing 2% CHAPS and suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated by urea-SDS-PAGE and visualized by SyproOrange staining (Amersham Biosciences).Trypsin Digestion—In vitro Atg8-PE conjugation was performed as described in the above. Then, Atg8-PE-conjugated liposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and solubilized in TBS containing 1 mm DTT and 1% CHAPS for 1 h on ice. The mixture of Atg8p-PE (2.0 μg) and Atg8p (1.5 μg), or each of them was treated with trypsin (0.01 μg) (Sigma T8802) in 20 μl of TBS containing 1 mm DTT and 1% CHAPS at 30 °C for the indicated time (0, 1, 3, 7, and 15 min). The digestion was stopped by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE and stained by CBB.RESULTSExpression of the Components of Atg8 System in E. coli— Previous studies of the Atg8 system revealed that the C-terminal glycine of Atg8p is covalently conjugated to an amino group of PE through ubiquitination-like reactions requiring Atg7p and Atg3p, functioning as E1- and E2-like enzymes, respectively (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). We have not, however, excluded the possibility that other factor(s), such as an E3, is required for conjugation.To address this issue, we applied an E. coli expression system. For this purpose, expression plasmids encoding the components of the Atg8 system, Atg7p bearing a Myc epitope tag, Atg3p, and either the processed or unprocessed form of Atg8p, under the control of inducible arabinose promoter were constructed (Fig. 1A). E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring these expression plasmids were cultured to logarithmic growth phase, then cultured for an additional 60 min in the presence of 0.2% arabinose. Total cell lysates from the E. coli were then subjected to SDS-PAGE containing 6 m urea (urea-SDS-PAGE). Subsequent immunoblot analyses with anti-Myc and anti-Atg3p antibodies detected Atg7p-Myc and Atg3p at the expected molecular masses of 78 and 36 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). Atg8pR117, the nascent, unprocessed form of Atg8p, was detected as a single band of ∼13.5 kDa, the predicted molecular mass; Atg8pG116, the processed form of Atg8p, migrated similarly to Atg8pR117 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2).Interestingly, only upon simultaneous expression of Atg7p-Myc, Atg3p, and Atg8pG116, an additional Atg8p band appeared (Fig. 1B, lane 3). This band, migrating faster than the Atg8pG116 form, was not observed in E. coli co-expressing the unprocessed Atg8pR117 form of Atg8p (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The faster migrating band is not an Atg8p degradation product, but a modified form, since only one band for Atg8p was observed by conventional SDS-PAGE (data not shown) (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mobility of the modified Atg8p by urea-SDS-PAGE corresponded to that observed for Atg8p-PE derived from yeast cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6).During Atg8p lipidation, the C-terminal glycine of Atg8p first links to Cys507 of Atg7p, then is transferred to Cys234 of Atg3p through generation of a thioester bond (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins Atg7pC507S-Myc and Atg3pC234S possess serine residues at the active site cysteines. Expression of the Atg7pC507S-Myc or Atg3pC234S mutants in E. coli in place of the wild-type Atg7p-Myc or Atg3p, respectively, abolished the appearance of the modified Atg8p form (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Instead, expression of Atg3pC234S generated a novel 50-kDa band, detectable with both anti-Atg8p and anti-Atg3p antibodies (data not shown and Fig. 1C, lane 6). Appearance of the band was resistant to high concentrations of dithiothreitol (100 mm DTT) and dependent upon the Atg8p C-terminal glycine and active Atg7p (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that this species is an Atg8p-Atg3p ester conjugate formed between the C-terminal glycine (Gly116) of Atg8p and the Atg3pC234S serine residue (Fig. 1C, lane 6). We concluded that sequential enzymatic reactions occur in E. coli cells in a manner similar to that observed in yeast cells. Thus, these co-expression experiments indicate that the E1 and E2 enzymes, Atg7p and Atg3p, are sufficient for the modification of the processed form of Atg8p.PE Is the Target of Atg8p in E. coli—The above results prompted us to attempt the complete in vitro reconstitution of Atg8p conjugation using purified Atg proteins and liposomes. Plasmids encoding GST fusions of each of the Atg proteins were constructed using the pGEX4T-1 vector, to produce GST-Atg7-Myc, GST-Atg3, and GST-Atg8G116, then introduced into the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain. The recombinant proteins were induced by IPTG and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified Atg proteins exhibited high purity, as demonstrated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). Liposomes were prepared using E. coli total phospholipids, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After mixing the purified Atg7p-Myc, Atg3p, and Atg8pG116 with E. coli phospholipid-containing liposomes, the mixture was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of an ATP regeneration system. The reaction products were then subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB staining. The modified form of Atg8p was generated in this in vitro reaction in an ATP-dependent manner, as determined by the presence of the faster migrating, Atg8p-specific band (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7).Fig. 2In vitro reconstitution of Atg8 system.A, in vitro assay for Atg8p-PE. E. coli lipid liposomes, an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 1mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 2.5 μg creatine kinase (CK)), and purified Atg proteins were visualized on CBB-stained urea-SDS-PAGE gels (lanes 1–5). The in vitro reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing E. coli lipid liposomes, 1.0 μm Atg7p-Myc, 1.0 μm Atg3p, and 5.0 μm Atg8pG116 were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence (+) or absence (–) of the ATP regeneration system (ATP) (lanes 6 and 7). 20 μl of each sample was then subjected to urea-SDS-PAGE. Separated bands were visualized by CBB staining. Liposomes were prepared from the total lipids isolated from W3011 (wild-type; wt) (lanes 6 and 7), GN10 (ΔpssA; 0% PE) (lane 8), or the mixture of 30% GN10/70% E. coli PE (lane 9). An equal amount of PE (7 nmol), however, was present in each reaction mixture containing PE liposomes. B, Atg8p-PE is generated by the catalytic action of Atg7p and Atg3p. Increasing amounts of Atg8p, ranging from 5.0 to 20 μm, were mixed with a constant quantity of 70% DOPE/30% POPC liposomes (100 μm-400 μm phospholipids) in the presence of 1.0 μm Atg7p-Myc and 1.0 μm Atg3p. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, generated Atg8p-PE was detected by urea-SDS-PAGE with CBB staining. C, lipid bilayer is essential for Atg8p-PE conjugation. 70% DOPE/30% POPC liposomes were suspended in reconstitution buffer in the presence or absence of 20 mm CHAPS on ice for 30 min. Following the addition of 5.0 μm Atg8p, 1.0 μm Atg7p-Myc, and either 1.0 μm Atg3p or Atg3pC234S, the in vitro reaction was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of the ATP regeneration system (ATP). The in vitro products were detected by CBB stained urea-SDS-PAGE gel. Atg8p-Atg3pC234S indicates the ester linkage product.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2014063249,"Doxorubicin is one of the most largely prescribed antitumor drug for the treatment of breast, liver and colon cancers as well as leukemia, but the cardiotoxicity of this anthracycline derivative limits its clinical use. Although doxorubicin is toxic to both cancer and cardiac cells, there are evidences suggesting that the mechanism of cell death is different for the two cell types. To investigate further this issue, we have compared the proapoptotic effects of doxorubicin and the functionally related anthracenedione compound mitoxantrone, which is also used in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. After evaluating the toxicity of the two drugs to mammary adenocarcinoma MTLn3 cells and H9C2 cardiomyocytes, we dissected the drug-induced apoptotic machinery by measuring the effects on the cell cycle progression, DNA condensation and fragmentation, production of endogenous peroxides and caspase activation. Both doxorubicin and mitoxantrone are potent inducers of apoptosis in H9C2 cardiomyocytes and MTLn3 breast cancer cells, but there are significant differences between the two cell types in terms of kinetics and order of the events. In particular, flow cytometry measurements of drug-induced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and mitochondrial mass with different fluorescent probes suggested that the two drugs induced a progressive increase in mitochondrial mass in the cancer cells but not in the cardiac cells. The hypothesis was validated by means of electron microscopy, which revealed a significant increase in the number of mitochondria in drug-treated MTLn3 but not in H9C2 cells. The mitochondrial proliferation precedes the nuclear apoptosis in doxorubicin-treated MTLn3 cells. The changes in the architecture and number of mitochondria are linked to the drug-induced perturbation of the cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The proliferation of mitochondria could explain the higher toxicity of doxorubicin to cancer cells compared to cardiac cells and this suggests novel therapeutic opportunities to better control the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines."

https://openalex.org/W1977687922,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and type III mutation (EGFRvIII), associated with constitutive tyrosine kinase activation and high malignancy, are commonly observed in glioblastoma tumors. The association of EGFR and EGFRvIII with caveolins was investigated in human glioblastoma cell lines, U87MG and U87MG-EGFRvIII. Caveolin-1 expression, determined by RT–PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot, was upregulated in glioblastoma cell lines (two-fold) and tumors (20–300-fold) compared to primary human astrocytes and nonmalignant brain tissue, respectively. U87MG-EGFRvIII expressed higher levels of caveolin-1 than U87MG. In contrast, the expression of caveolin-2 and -3 were downregulated in glioblastoma cells compared to astrocytes. A colocalization of EGFR, but not of EGFRvIII, with lipid rafts and caveolin-1 was observed by immunocytochemistry. Association of EGFR and EGFRvIII with caveolae, assessed in vitro by binding to caveolin scaffolding domain peptides and in vivo by immunocolocalization studies in cells and caveolae-enriched cellular fraction, was phosphorylation-dependent: ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR resulted in dissociation of EGFR from caveolae. In contrast, inhibition of the EGFRvIII constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation by AG1478 increased association of EGFRvIII with caveolin-1. AG1478 also increased caveolin-1 expression and reduced glioblastoma cell growth in a semi-solid agar. The evidence suggests that the phosphorylation-regulated sequestration of EGFR in caveolae may be involved in arresting constitutive or ligand-induced signaling through EGFR responsible for glial cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2051570559,"Overproduction of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) regulatory protein ODC-antizyme has been shown to correlate with cell growth inhibition in a variety of different cell types. Although the exact mechanism of this growth inhibition is not known, it has been attributed to the effect of antizyme on polyamine metabolism. Antizyme binds directly to ODC, targeting ODC for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. We now show that antizyme induction also leads to degradation of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1. We demonstrate that antizyme is capable of specific, noncovalent association with cyclin D1 and that this interaction accelerates cyclin D1 degradation in vitro in the presence of only antizyme, cyclin D1, purified 26 S proteasomes, and ATP. In vivo, antizyme up-regulation induced either by the polyamine spermine or by antizyme overexpression causes reduction of intracellular cyclin D1 levels. The antizyme-mediated pathway for cyclin D1 degradation is independent of the previously characterized phosphorylation- and ubiquitination-dependent pathway, because antizyme up-regulation induces the degradation of a cyclin D1 mutant (T286A) that abrogates its ubiquitination. We propose that antizyme-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 by the proteasome may provide an explanation for the repression of cell growth following antizyme up-regulation.

The regulatory protein antizyme (AZ) 1The abbreviations used are: AZ, antizyme; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase. has been studied primarily in the context of its role in facilitating degradation of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Coffino P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 3Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). AZ is therefore thought to be dedicated principally to the feedback regulation of polyamine levels. AZ synthesis is controlled via an unusual mechanism of translational frameshifting. The ribosomal frameshift required for the translation of full-length AZ is directly induced by polyamines when their levels rise (4Rom E. Kahana C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Polyamines can thus inhibit their own synthesis via AZ-mediated down-regulation of ODC. This mechanism serves to prevent extreme fluctuations in polyamine levels, which are thought to be toxic (6Webber M.M. Chaproniere-Rickenberg D. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Brunson V.G. Grant M.H. Wallace H.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Allen R.D. Roberts T.K. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1987; 13: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite this homeostatic mechanism, the levels of polyamines and ODC vary markedly during the cell cycle, indicating that additional factors control polyamine levels and suggesting a role for this pathway in the regulation of cell proliferation (9Oredsson S.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Overproduction of AZ in a variety of cell types, including malignant oral keratinocytes, hepatoma cell lines, and prostate cancer cells, coincides with growth inhibition (10Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Iwata S. Sato Y. Asada M. Takagi M. Tsujimoto A. Inaba T. Yamada T. Sakamoto S. Yata J. Shimogori T.

Furthermore, overexpression of antizyme in both mouse skin cancer and gastric epithelia models has been shown to result in tumor suppression (15Feith D.J. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6073-6081PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fong L.Y. Feith D.J. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3945-3954PubMed Google Scholar). These and other observations of antiproliferative effects of antizyme prompted us to test whether antizyme may have a specific role in cell cycle regulation, thereby accounting for its potential role as a tumor suppressor. The cell cycle arrest previously seen in prostate carcinoma and malignant oral keratinocyte models and the growth inhibition seen in a variety of cell types upon antizyme overexpression could be explained if antizyme modulated intracellular levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclins, as it does for ODC. We previously showed that treatment of cells with the polyamine spermine resulted in both antizyme up-regulation and cell cycle arrest (14Koike C. Chao D.T. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6109-6112PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we have studied the ability of antizyme to complex with and degrade cyclin D1. We report that antizyme binds to cyclin D1 and facilitates its proteasomal degradation. Using purified components, we find that antizyme-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 proceeds in the absence of ubiquitin. Since the degradation of this cyclin has been previously characterized and found to be dependent on the SCF family of ubiquitin-protein ligases (17Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 18Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the same protein may be delivered to the proteasome via two distinct targeting mechanisms. More generally, our results suggest that antizyme may indeed act as a tumor suppressor by controlling progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle by a novel mechanism. Plasmid Construction—The rat antizyme 1 gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid GST-AZΔT (gift of T. Tsuji) using primers AZHis-FWD (5′-gcgtggacatatggtgaaatcctcc-3′) and AZHis-REV (5′-gcacaatcatgactcgaggacaaaccc-3′). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI enzymes and ligated into plasmid pET-33b(+) (Novagen) digested with the same. The AZ PCR product was also cloned into pCMV-FLAG using the same restriction enzymes. To construct plasmids HKT-D1 and HKT-ODC, cDNAs encoding human cyclin D1 and ODC were PCR-amplified from plasmids pRcCMVD1wt and pODC10/2H, respectively (gifts of M. Ewen and T. Tsuji) using primers D1-FWD (5′-cgaggatccaatggaacaccagctcctgtgctg-3′) and D1-REVB (5′-cgaagctttcagatgtccacgtcccgcacgtc-3′) for cyclin D1 and primers RM-ODC1 (5′-ggaacagagctcaatcatgaacaac-3′) and RM-ODC2 (5′-cagctactcgagtgctatctacac-3′) for ODC. The cyclin D1 PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into plasmid pET-33b(+), whereas the ODC PCR product was digested with SacI and XhoI prior to subcloning into the same vector. Human antizyme 1 cDNA was amplified from a human cDNA library using primers AZHis-FWD and AZHis-REV and cloned into plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen). The cyclin D1 mutant T286A was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. As template, the pcDNA3-HA-CD1 construct (human cyclin D1 with C-terminal HA tag cloned into pcDNA3) was used. The mutagenic primers were 5′-acctggcttgcgcacccaccgacg-3′ (T286A.For) and 5′-cgtcggtgggtgcgcaagccaggt-3′ (T286A.Rev). Cell Culture and Transfection—The AT2.1 cell line derived from the Dunning rat prostate carcinoma (obtained from Dr. John Isaacs) was maintained as described previously (19Isaacs J.T. Isaacs W.B. Feitz W.F. Scheres J. Prostate. 1986; 9: 261-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). For spermine treatment, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/10-cm2 dish in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 250 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) and then incubated overnight. Cells were subsequently washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma). Cells were then incubated in the above medium without serum in the presence or absence of 10 μm spermine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma). For immunoblot analysis, 2.5 × 105 AT2.1 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes. After 16–24 h, cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-HA-CD1, and pcDNA3-HA-CD1 (T286A), respectively using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). After an additional 16–24 h, cells were treated with 10 μm spermine for 8 h. The rat hepatoma HTC cell line (obtained from Dr. John Mitchell) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection for pulse-chase experiments, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/10-cm2 dish 1 day prior to transfection. On the day of transfection, cells were transfected with 7 μg of either FLAG vector or FLAG-AZ plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For additional pulse-chase experiments, HTC cells were transiently transfected with either 7 μg of FLAG vector or FLAG-AZ plasmid DNA in combination with 7 μg of D1(T286A) plasmid DNA. For transient transfection for immunoblot analysis, 2.5 × 105 AT2.1 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes. After 16–24 h, cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-HA-CD1, and pcDNA3-HA-CD1 (T286A), respectively, using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). After an additional 16–24 h, cells were treated with 10 μm spermine for 8 h. Stable transfectants of the hamster malignant oral keratinocyte cell line HCPC containing either pcDNA3 vector alone or pcDNA3/hamster AZ were obtained from Dr. Takanori Tsuji. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml G418. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE; electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell); and probed with either cyclin D1 (HD-11; 1:500), cyclin A (C19; 1:500), or Cdk2 (M2; 1:500) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), pRb (1:500; Pharmingen), ODC (1:500 (gift from P. Coffino) or 1:1000 (Progen)), actin (C4; 1:2500; Roche Applied Science), or antizyme (polyclonal, 1:2000; gift from J. Mitchell). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated proteins, human cyclin D1 and rat antizyme were individually transcribed and translated in vitro from plasmids pD1HA (gift of M. Ewen) and pHKTAZ, respectively, in the presence of [35S]methionine, using the reticulocyte-based TNT transcription/translation system (Promega). The transcription/translation reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA, which also served to prevent protein degradation by inhibiting any remaining ATP-dependent proteasome activity in the reaction mixture. Extracts were mixed in proportions yielding equivalent radioactivity among the in vitro translated proteins. Proteins were then allowed to interact in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 60 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of antibody against antizyme or cyclin D1. After an additional 60-min incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were isolated by the addition of agarose beads conjugated to either protein A or protein G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and additional incubation for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in sample buffer, and boiled prior to separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation-Western blots of FLAG-hAZ or HA-human cyclin D1, 3.5 × 105 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of each plasmid (pcDNA3HA-D1, pCMVFLAG-AZ1, or empty vector) using Fugene 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and lysed by vortexing on ice. The lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate (1 ml) was incubated with 4 μg of antibody against the FLAG epitope of AZ (M2, mouse monoclonal; Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody was precipitated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h using 30 μl of protein A beads (Pierce). The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 60 μl of Laemmli loading buffer, and boiled. Samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using antibody against the HA tag of cyclin D1. 10 μl of preimmunoprecipitation cell lysate was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot as a transfection control. Antisense Inhibition of Antizyme Up-regulation in Vivo—AT2.1 cells were cultured for spermine treatment as described above. Prior to treatment, 0.5 mm standard control (5′-cctcttacctcagttacaatttata-3′) or antizyme-specific (5′-gggtccgaaaccagcaaaaacctcc-3′) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (GeneTools) were delivered into cells using Special Delivery reagent (GeneTools) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after morpholino delivery, cells were treated with spermine as described above for an additional 24 h prior to lysis and immunoblotting. To silence AZ gene expression in HCPC-1 or HTC cells, a 21-nucleotide sequence was designed to target the mRNA sequence 5′-aaccuucagcuuucuuggcuu-3′. The AZ-specific siRNA and negative control siRNA (Scramble II duplex) were from Dharmacon Research. 2 × 105 (HCPC-1) or 3.5 × 105 (HTC) cells were plated per 35-mm well. For each well, 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as transfection reagent to deliver 400 pmol of siRNA duplex. Cells were washed first with serum-free, antibiotic-free medium. The mix containing RNAi and LF2000 was then added. After 4 h of incubation, serum was added to the medium. Cell lysates were collected 2 days after transfection. 35S Labeling and Pulse-Chase—For short metabolic labeling, AT2.1 cells were treated with spermine as described above. 1, 4, 8, and 12 h after spermine addition, cells were washed and starved for 30 min in methionine-free, cysteine-free RPMI (Invitrogen). Subsequently, cells were washed twice in PBS and then incubated for 10 min in the above medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 mCi/ml 35S EXPRESS labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After labeling, cells were washed four times in PBS and lysed in lysis buffer A (see above). Subsequently, lysates were used for immunoprecipitation using antibody against cyclin D1. Purified complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified using a phosphorimaging system (ImageQuant). For pulse-chase analysis, HTC cells were cultured and transiently transfected as described above. Cells were then starved for 30 min in methionine-free, cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 30 min in the above medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi/ml 35S EXPRESS labeling mix. After labeling, cells were washed twice in PBS. The medium was then replaced with growth medium containing 50 μg/ml cysteine (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml methionine (Invitrogen). After rinsing with PBS, cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (see above) for 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 min after the addition of the chase medium. The lysates were then used for immunoprecipitation as described above using antibody against the FLAG epitope of AZ, cyclin D1, or β-actin. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized, and quantitated using a phosphorimaging system. The signal intensity of each band was normalized against that of β-actin. Complex Formation Using Purified Proteins—His-tagged human cyclin D1 and ODC proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Proteins were purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Rat GST-AZ was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. To assay complex formation using GSH resin (Amersham Biosciences), 31 μg of GST or 56 μg of rat GST-AZ proteins were incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of cyclin D1, ODC, or citrate synthase (Roche Applied Science) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 45 min at 30 °C in a volume of 1 ml. To show competition between cyclin D1 and ODC for AZ binding, AZ was preincubated with a 2- or 10-fold molar excess of ODC for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then applied to a GSH resin column at 4 °C for 1 h and subsequently washed with binding buffer lacking bovine serum albumin. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm reduced glutathione. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblotting. In Vitro Protein Degradation in Reticulocyte Lysates—Human cyclin D1 and rat antizyme were synthesized in vitro using reticulocyte lysates as described above. Equal amounts of 35S-labeled cyclin D1 were incubated with antizyme in ATP-regenerating buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.6 mg/ml phosphocreatine kinase) for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol) and then boiled prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Degradation Assay Using Purified Proteasomes—Human 26 S proteasomes were purified from red blood cells as described previously (20Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Purified protein substrates, rat antizyme, and purified proteasomes were incubated in degradation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and an ATP-regenerating system containing phosphocreatine (10 mm), ATP (2 mm), and creatine phosphokinase (3 units) for 0, 2, and 4 h at 30 °C. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-(OBut)-Ala-Leu-H-aldehyde (0.2 mm; Peptide Institute) and apyrase (0.6 units; Sigma) were added where indicated. The reaction volume was 25 μl. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then boiled prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Up-regulation of Endogenous Antizyme in Prostate Cancer Cells Results in Degradation of Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins—The addition of exogenous polyamines has been shown to up-regulate endogenous antizyme levels in a variety of different cell lines. We previously showed that induction of antizyme within 2 h after the addition of the polyamine spermine is followed by G1 growth arrest in prostate carcinoma cell lines (14Koike C. Chao D.T. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6109-6112PubMed Google Scholar). Since cyclins are key determinants of cell cycle transitions, we investigated whether growth arrest was due to a change in the levels of specific cyclins responsible for the G1-S transition. Cyclin levels were measured in cell lines grown in defined media in the presence or absence of 10 μm spermine. After 24 h, we observed a marked decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 in spermine-treated cells relative to untreated controls (Fig. 1a). Under the conditions of this experiment, antizyme is efficiently induced, as previously shown (14Koike C. Chao D.T. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6109-6112PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, ODC levels are reduced following antizyme induction (Fig. 1a). Levels of other cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as Cdk2 and cyclin A, remained unchanged, as did the level of actin (Fig. 1a). Transcriptional regulation could not account for the decrease in cyclin D1 levels in these cell lines, since treated and untreated cells contained equivalent levels of mRNA encoding this protein (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, loss of cyclin D1 could not be attributed to a block in translation, since synthesis of cyclin D1 protein remained constant during spermine treatment in these cell lines (Fig. 1c). A critical function of the cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase complex is phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which is required for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (21Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 22Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louie K. Reed S.I. Arnold A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). After spermine-induced loss of cyclin D1, pRb was found in a hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 1d). By this functional criterion, it is likely that cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes are effectively inhibited by spermine treatment. The loss of G1-specific cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and the resulting decrease in Rb phosphorylation may account for the predominant G1 arrest seen in these cells after spermine treatment (14Koike C. Chao D.T. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6109-6112PubMed Google Scholar). Antizyme Is Required for the Destruction of Cyclin D1—The loss of cyclin D1 seen in spermine-treated prostate carcinoma cells could be a consequence of spermine-induced cell cycle arrest rather than a consequence of antizyme up-regulation. To determine whether antizyme alone is sufficient to promote degradation of cyclin D1, we looked at the effect of blocking antizyme synthesis on the levels of cyclin D1 following spermine treatment. Nonspecific and antizyme-specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were introduced into rat prostatic carcinoma cells and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of spermine prior to analysis of antizyme and cyclin D1 levels. As expected, after 24 h in the presence of spermine, we observed a marked increase in the levels of antizyme in those cells containing the control morpholino (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the addition of the antizyme-specific antisense morpholino inhibited antizyme up-regulation relative to the control. Coincident with this decrease in antizyme levels, we observe increased levels of cyclin D1 in spermine-treated cells in the presence of the anti-antizyme morpholino. Levels of Cdk2 were unaffected under all conditions tested. These results suggest that degradation of cyclin D1 in these cells is not a nonspecific effect of spermine treatment but does depend on the presence of increased levels of antizyme. Whereas our data indicate that spermine-mediated induction of antizyme leads to degradation of cyclin D1, levels of polyamines and antizyme have been shown to fluctuate even in cells growing under normal conditions. To determine whether antizyme has a role in the degradation of cyclin D1 in the absence of spermine treatment, we looked at the effect of blocking endogenous antizyme synthesis on the levels of cyclin D1 in untreated cells. HTC hepatoma cells were grown in routine cell culture medium and were transfected with either scrambled or AZ-specific siRNA and incubated for 24 h. Analysis of the endogenous levels of AZ along with cell cycle regulators indicated that suppression of antizyme expression again coincided with stabilization of cyclin D1 (Fig. 2b). Levels of other cell cycle regulators such as Cdk4 or cyclin A were not affected by ablation of AZ, indicating that antizyme specifically promotes degradation of cyclin D1 even in cells grown under normal cell culture conditions. As expected, levels of ODC, a known target of AZ-mediated degradation, were increased in HCPC malignant oral keratinocytes transfected with AZ-specific siRNA (Fig. 2c). Antizyme Overexpression Leads to Loss of Cyclin D1—Similar to the effects seen in prostate carcinoma cells, stimulation of antizyme expression in rat hepatoma cells has been shown to result in growth inhibition (12Mitchell J.L. Leyser A. Holtorff M.S. Bates J.S. Frydman B. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, overexpression of antizyme in malignant oral keratinocytes and prostate carcinoma has previously been shown to lead to G1 growth arrest and a reversal of the malignant phenotype (13Tsuji T. Usui S. Aida T. Tachikawa T. Hu G.F. Sasaki A. Matsumura T. Todd R. Wong D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Koike C. Chao D.T. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6109-6112PubMed Google Scholar). We overexpressed antizyme in rat hepatoma cells (Fig. 3a) and malignant oral keratinocytes (Fig. 3b) to investigate whether the growth inhibition previously seen in these cell types could be correlated with a change in cyclin D1 levels. Full-length antizyme is efficiently expressed in these transfectants. We observed a marked decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 in cell lines overexpressing AZ as compared with control cells. Levels of another cell cycle regulatory protein, Cdk2, remained unchanged, as did the level of actin. These results show that overexpression of antizyme alone is sufficient to promote specific degradation of cyclin D1 in these cell types. To further investigate the ability of AZ to degrade cyclin D1 and to dissociate this process from the well studied ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway, we employed a mutant form of cyclin D1 (T286A) that cannot be degraded via the ubiquitin pathway (24Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 25Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, levels of this mutant are stable in control AT2.1 cells but fell significantly following spermine-induced up-regulation of antizyme. These results add support for the hypothesis of an alternate pathway for a ubiquitin-independent pathway of cyclin D1 turnover. Taken together, our antizyme ablation and overexpression results show that alteration of antizyme levels leads to changes in cyclin D1 levels, consistent with the hypothesis that antizyme influences cyclin D1 levels in vivo whether levels of AZ are modulated by overexpression, by gene silencing, or by polyamine-mediated induction. Our results in untreated HTC cells confirm a role for endogenous AZ in modulating cyclin D1 levels. During normal cell cycle progression, similar results were obtained using a variety of cell types. This indicates that even low, endogenous levels of antizyme have some capacity to affect cyclin D1 levels in the cell types tested. The Proteasome Mediates Down-regulation of Cyclin D1 via Accelerated Breakdown in a Ubiquitin-independent Manner—To show directly that enhanced protein degradation mediates the decreased levels of cyclin D1 in a ubiquitin-independent manner, we used AZ-overexpressing cells to determine the half-life of the mutant form of cyclin D1 (T286A) that cannot be degraded via the ubiquitin pathway. Hepatoma cells transiently transfected with a plasmid vector expressing the T286A cyclin D1 mutant along with either empty vector or full-length AZ were pulsed with [35S]methionine and then chased with medium contai"

In addition, lysyl oxidase reverts ras-mediated transformation, and lysyl oxidase expression is down-regulated in human cancers. Since suramin inhibits growth factor signaling pathways and induces lysyl oxidase in ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (RS485 cells), we sought to investigate the effects of suramin on the phenotype of transformed cells and the role of lysyl oxidase in mediating these effects. Suramin treatment resulted in a more normal phenotype as judged by growth rate, cell cycle parameters, and morphology. β-aminopropionitrile, the selective inhibitor of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity, was remarkably unable to block suramin-induced reversion. By contrast, ectopic antisense lysyl oxidase demonstrated that lysyl oxidase gene expression mediated phenotypic reversion. Since lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a 50 kDa precursor and processed to a 30 kDa active enzyme and 18 kDa propeptide, the effects of these two products on the transformed phenotype of RS485 cells were then directly assessed in the absence of suramin. Here we report, for the first time, that the lysyl oxidase propeptide, and not the lysyl oxidase enzyme, inhibits ras-dependent transformation as determined by effects on cell proliferation assays, growth in soft agar, and Akt-dependent induction of NF-κB activity. Thus, the lysyl oxidase propeptide, which is released during extracellular proteolytic processing of pro-lysyl oxidase, functions to inhibit ras-dependent cell transformation.

Lysyl oxidase catalyzes oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine and hydroxylysine residues in collagens, and peptidyl lysine residues in elastin. The resulting peptidyl aldehydes spontaneously condense and undergo oxidation reactions to form the lysine-derived covalent cross-links required for the normal structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (1Kagan H.M.

We have recently shown that lysyl oxidase is dramatically up-regulated by suramin in c-Ha-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (RS485 cells) because of its inhibition of an FGF-2-mediated autocrine pathway (29Palamakumbura A.H. Sommer P. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30781-30787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The question is now raised whether suramin causes phenotypic reversion of RS485 cells, and whether this reversion depends on lysyl oxidase expression or activity. In addition, the role of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity in mediating phenotypic reversion was investigated. The results indicate that suramin-induced phenotypic reversion requires lysyl oxidase expression as expected, but reversion surprisingly does not require lysyl oxidase enzyme activity. Data show that reversion is mediated instead by the lysyl oxidase propeptide. The ability of the lysyl oxidase propeptide, and not active lysyl oxidase, to stimulate phenotypic reversion was confirmed in studies of ras-transformed cells performed in the absence of suramin, and data suggest that the lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits the ras-dependent PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway. These findings identify the 18 kDa lysyl oxidase propeptide as a novel inhibitor of ras-mediated transformation of fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Suramin was either kindly provided by the Division of Cancer Treatment Diagnosis and Centers, NCI, National Institutes of Health and Parke-Davis, or was purchased from Sigma.

Lowy D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). PR4 cells are stable phenotypic revertants of RS485 cells obtained after treatment with α/β interferon (31Samid D. Flessate D.M. Friedman R.M. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 100-mm cell culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells in logarithmic growth phase, were dissociated with trypsin/EDTA, and inoculated at a desired density for each experiment.Growth Curves—To study cell growth rates, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 35,000 cells/well and were grown in complete medium containing 10% FBS, as described above. Additions of suramin or β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), when appropriate, were initiated 24 h after plating. Media were changed every 3 days in the continuous presence of suramin or BAPN, as indicated for each experimental design in the “Results.” Cell density was determined in triplicate every day by crystal violet staining, as described (32Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 33Gillies R.J. Didier N. Denton M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 10% formalin in PBS, washed with PBS, and then stained for 30 min with 0.1% crystal violet at room temperature with shaking. Unbound dye was then removed by washing with water until washes were colorless. Bound dye was then eluted with 10% acetic acid, and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm. For quantitative analyses of growth rates, the logarithmic value of absorbance versus time was plotted ± S.D. and the rates were calculated by linear regression analyses. In addition, data were plotted as total absorbance ± S.E. versus time. Experiments were performed three times each with consistent findings.Lysyl Oxidase Enzyme Activity—PR4 cells were plated in 100-mm cell culture plates and then grown and re-fed every 2 days as described above in the constant presence of 0, 200, and 400 μm BAPN for 7 days until visually confluent. Cells were then re-fed with serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin still in the constant presence or absence of BAPN. After 24 h conditioned 0.3-ml aliquots of media samples were assayed in quadruplicate using a tritiated recombinant human tropoelastin as substrate as previously described (4Bedell-Hogan D. Trackman P. Abrams W. Rosenbloom J. Kagan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10345-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 90 min (34Hong H.H. Uzel M.I. Duan C. Sheff M.C. Trackman P.C. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1655-1667PubMed Google Scholar), and data were expressed as total cpm released ± S.E. per culture.Cell Cycle Analysis—RS485, NIH3T3, and PR4 cells were plated on 100-mm plates and were grown until confluent with 0 or 150 μm suramin. Cells (1.5–2 × 106) were then trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed by washing with ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in PBS containing 2% FBS and was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometry with CELLQUEST acquisition and analysis software (BD Biosciences).RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy-RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 10-μg samples of denatured RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 18% formaldehyde. Gels were transferred in 10× SSC by capillary blotting overnight to Gene Screen nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Science, Boston, MA). The membranes were hybridized at 42 °C as previously described (35Feres-Filho E.J. Choi Y.J. Han X. Takala T.E. Trackman P.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar). For normalization and as a measure of constant loading of gels, blots were stripped, and rehybridized with a radiolabeled 18 S rRNA probe (37Hillis D.M. Dixon M.T. Q. Rev. Biol. 1991; 66: 411-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were assessed and normalized by densitometric scanning on a Versa Doc Model 3000 Gel Documentation System and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad).Stable Transfection of RS485 Cells with an Antisense Lysyl Oxidase Expression Vector—Cells were grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes. At ∼70% confluence, they were transfected with the antisense murine lysyl oxidase expression vector pCLO3 (17Giampuzzi M. Botti G. Cilli M. Gusmano R. Borel A. Sommer P. Di Donato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29226-29232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (20 μg DNA/plate) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (38Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). As a control, RS485 cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3). The transfected cells were selected using G418 (geneticin) at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml in the medium. Colonies were isolated from antisense lysyl oxidase and empty vector transfected RS485 cells using cloning cylinders (39Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were then plated onto 100-mm plates (250,000 cells/plate) without G418 and treated with 0 or 150 μm suramin. After 24 h, cells were prepared for cell cycle and Northern analysis as described above.Lysyl Oxidase Propeptide-coated Cell Culture Plates—Rat lysyl oxidase propeptide was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (40Hong H.H. Pischon N. Santana R.B. Palamakumbura A.H. Babakhanlou-Chase H. Gantz D. Guo Y. Uzel M.I. Ma D. Trackman P.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The propeptide (200–400 μg/ml) was then dialyzed against 16 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 for 5 h and 6-well plates were coated with 0, 1, 5, or 10 μg of propeptide in 1 ml of water per well and left overnight under UV light in the cell culture hood to completely dry. AS-3B or RS485 cells were then plated at a density of 35,000 cells per well on the propeptide-coated plates and cultured until visual confluence. Cells were then prepared for cell cycle analysis as described above. To study the effect of propeptide on the growth rate of AS-3B and RS485 cells, 24-well plates were coated with 0, 0.2, 1, 2, or 4 μg of propeptide in 350 μl of water per well, as above, and the cells plated at a density of 7,000 cells/well. Cell density was determined in triplicate every day, by crystal violet staining as described above. In selected experiments, mature 30 kDa lysyl oxidase (36Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar) was dialyzed against 16 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 for 5 h, and 4 μg coated in 24-well plates at the same time as described for the propeptide.Focus Formation Assay in Soft Agar—RS485 cells and Myc-transformed M158 cells were plated, in duplicate, at 104 cells/ml in top plugs consisting of complete Ham F-12 nutrient mixture medium and 0.4% SeaPlaque agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, Maine) in the presence of 2.5 μg of purified bovine aorta lysyl oxidase enzyme (30 kDa form) (41Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), or with 2.5 μg recombinant rat lysyl oxidase propeptide (18 kDa form) (40Hong H.H. Pischon N. Santana R.B. Palamakumbura A.H. Babakhanlou-Chase H. Gantz D. Guo Y. Uzel M.I. Ma D. Trackman P.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or the same volume of vehicle potassium phosphate (16 mm, pH 7.8). After 2 weeks of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, the colonies were stained with 0.5 ml of 0.0005% crystal violet and photographed using a digital camera coupled to a dissection microscope (×50 magnification). Three random fields were counted from each of two duplicate samples, and average values presented ± S.D.Transient Transfections, Luciferase Assays, and Fluorescence Microscopy—NIH3T3 and RS485 cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes. Cells were transfected overnight, in triplicate, with the indicated expression vectors by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS. The plasmids used are pCMVneo-Myr-Akt kindly provided by Z. Luo (Boston University Medical School, Boston, Mass.), NF-κB-luciferase which was a gift from G. Rawadi (Hoechst-Marion-Roussel, Romainville, France), pEGFP-C1-PDK1 kindly provided by J. Chung (Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, Republic of Korea), and pcDNA3.1 (+)/LOPP propeptide and pcDNA4-LO enzyme expression vectors. The expression vector for the lysyl oxidase propeptide pcDNA3.1 (+)/LOPP was generated from pSV40 PolyACOD (5Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR, using forward primer: 5′-ACTGGATCCCGA AGAGGTCTCCCTCCTTCGCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TACGAATTCTCAGCCCACCATGCGATCTACGTGGCTG-3′. The DNA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and gel-purified and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA3.1 (+)/LOPP. This construct contains the rat cDNA sequence (–94 to +486) that includes a portion of the 5′-UTR, the signal peptide, the entire rat lysyl oxidase propeptide coding region and no mature lysyl oxidase sequence. The insert was directly confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vector for mature lysyl oxidase was accomplished by excision of nucleotides encoding amino acid residues 23–157 from a construct of murine lysyl oxidase cDNA –33 to +1234, and then cloned into pcDNA4 as previously reported (42Seve S. Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Farjanel J. Sergeant A. Ricard-Blum S. Sommer P. Connect Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).For luciferase assays, 1 μg of NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pSV40-β-Gal reporter gene were co-transfected with the indicated DNAs. Cells were stimulated with addition of FBS to a final concentration of 10%, and total cell extracts were prepared after 48 h. The resulting extracts were normalized for β-Gal expression and used in a luciferase activity assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega kit). Results are expressed as the fold induction of luciferase activity calculated under stimulation conditions (10% FBS) compared with starvation conditions (0.5% FBS). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were co-transfected with a vector expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged PDK1 protein (GFP-PDK1), and either lysyl oxidase propeptide or lysyl oxidase enzyme expression vectors or parental empty vectors for 48 h. Localization of the GFP-PDK1 was determined using an Anxiovert 200M fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.). Analyses and photographs were performed using Axiovision (v.3.1 software; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.).RESULTSEffect of Suramin on RS485 Cell Phenotype—Treatment of c-Ha-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (RS485 cell line) with suramin leads to the induction of lysyl oxidase (29Palamakumbura A.H. Sommer P. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30781-30787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effects of suramin on the rate of growth and morphology of RS485 cells, as an initial measure of cell phenotype. Cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h and then grown in the continuous presence of 0, 100, 125, or 150 μm suramin. As control, the growth of phenotypically normal NIH3T3 cells in the absence of suramin was analyzed at the same time. Cell growth was determined by daily crystal violet staining of replicate wells (Fig. 1). RS485 cells grew more rapidly than NIH3T3 cells, as expected (30Chang E.H. Furth M.E. Scolnick E.M. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Suramin significantly decreased the growth rate in a dose-dependent manner. Data show that 100, 125, and 150 μm suramin decreased the growth rate by 38, 49, and 56%, respectively, calculated from linear regression analyses of log of absorbance versus time. The growth rate of RS485 cells treated with 150 μm suramin was similar to that of NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, treatment with suramin caused a dose-dependent change in the morphology of RS485 cells with cells appearing less transformed, i.e. flatter and contact inhibited in the presence of 150 μm suramin (inset, Fig. 1).We next determined the effects of suramin on cell cycle progression of RS485 cell cultures. As shown in Table I, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) indicated that treatment with 100 or 150 μm suramin increased the percentage of RS485 cells in G1 and decreased that in S phase in a dose-dependent manner. The proportions of cells in G1 and S phases in cultures treated with 150 μm suramin are nearly identical to untreated phenotypically normal NIH3T3 cells (Table I). Thus, treatment with 150 μm suramin changed the morphology, cell cycle, and growth rate of RS485 cells resulting in a more normal phenotype.Table IEffects of suramin on the cell cycle progression of RS485 cellsCell typeG1SG2M%%%RS48543.3 ± 3.630.8 ± 4.625.8 ± 1.1RS485 with 100 μm suramin59.4 ± 1.321.5 ± 2.419.1 ± 7.9RS485 with 150 μm suramin67.4 ± 0.219.0 ± 1.713.6 ± 1.9NIH3T366.2 ± 2.117.4 ± 0.416.4 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Lysyl Oxidase Expression Reduces Phenotypic Reversion Induced by Suramin—Data presented above indicate that suramin causes phenotypic changes in RS485 cells. To determine that the suramin-induced phenotypic changes depend upon lysyl oxidase expression, we generated stable antisense lysyl oxidase transfected RS485 cell clones. Nine antisense lysyl oxidase transfected clones and six empty vector transfected clones were generated and grown in the presence and absence of 150 μm suramin, and after 24 h cells were fixed and subjected to cell cycle analysis. Non-transfected RS485 cells were analyzed as an additional control. Fig. 2 shows the differences in the percentage of cells in G1 and S phase as a function of suramin treatment. In empty vector transfected clones, suramin increased the average number of cells in G1 by 20.8%, and decreased the average number of cells in S phase by 13.5% (bar N in Fig. 2). As expected, these values are not significantly different from non-transfected cells (Fig. 2, compare V to N). In contrast, antisense lysyl oxidase transfected clones show only a 10.6% increase in the percentage of cells in G1 phase and a 6.9% decrease in the S phase after suramin treatment. These changes are significantly smaller than either of the control groups of cells (Fig. 2, compare L; to V or N, p < 0.01).Fig. 2Effect of suramin on the cell cycle progression of antisense lysyl oxidase transfected RS485 cells. Antisense lysyl oxidase transfected and empty vector transfected cells were grown in the presence of 0 or 150 μm suramin for 24 h. Cells (1.5–2 × 106) were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data shown are the average difference of the percentage of cells in G1 and S phase with suramin treatment of antisense lysyl oxidase transfected cells (L), empty vector-transfected cells (V), or non-transfected cells (N), shown for comparison. Nine and six clones from antisense lysyl oxidase and empty vector-transfected RS485 cells, respectively, were used for the experiment.

The repeated sequence forming a G-overhang is able to adopt a peculiar four-stranded DNA structure in vitro called a G-quadruplex, which is a poor substrate for telomerase. Small molecule ligands that selectively stabilize the telomeric G-quadruplex induce telomere shortening and a delayed growth arrest. Here we show that the G-quadruplex ligand telomestatin has a dramatic effect on the conformation of intracellular G-overhangs. Competition experiments indicate that telomestatin strongly binds in vitro and in vivo to the telomeric overhang and impairs its single-stranded conformation. Long-term treatment of cells with telomestatin greatly reduces the G-overhang size, as evidenced by specific hybridization or telomeric oligonucleotide ligation assay experiments, with a concomitant delayed loss of cell viability. In vivo protection experiments using dimethyl sulfate also indicate that telomestatin treatment alters the dimethyl sulfate effect on G-overhangs, a result compatible with the formation of a local quadruplex structure at telomeric overhang. Altogether these experiments strongly support the hypothesis that the telomeric G-overhang is an intracellular target for the action of telomestatin.

Telomeres are essential DNA-protein structures that cap and protect the end of the eukaryotic chromosome from illegitimate recombination, degradation, and detection as DNA damage (1Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Telomeres are also of particular interest because of their role in maintaining indefinite proliferation of cells (2Shay J.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 3Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In humans, the telomere is composed of tandem repeats of the G-rich duplex sequence 5′-TTAGGG-3′, with a G-rich 3′ strand extending beyond its complement to form an overhang (G-overhang) averaging 130–210 bases in length (4Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 5Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). G-overhangs are present on all chromosomal ends and are formed during S-phase through a complex mechanism that involves cleavage of the C-strand and is independent of telomerase activity (5Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 6Hemann M.T. Greider C.W.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1021-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). G-overhangs may be involved in different DNA conformations such as T-loops or G-quadruplexes. T-loops are created through the strand invasion of the 3′ telomeric overhang into the duplex part of the telomere and are thought to represent a strategy to protect chromosome ends from fusion by an overhang sequestration mechanism (9Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 10De Lange T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Because of the repetition of guanines, the G-overhang is prone to quadruplex formation in which 4 blocks of repeated guanines are engaged into 3 adjacent quartets; each quartet involves 4 guanines stabilized by Hoogsteen bonds (11Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. Mailliet P. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 839-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Neidle S. Parkinson G. Nat. Rev.

The G-overhang can fold into at least two different intramolecular quadruplexes that differ in the position of the adjacent loop regions (14Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Patel D.J. Structure. 1993; 1: 263-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Optimal telomerase activity requires the non-folded single-stranded telomere overhang and G-quadruplex formation has been shown to inhibit telomerase elongation in vitro (16Zahler A.M. Williamson J.R. Cech T.R. Prescott D.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Hence, stabilization of telomeric G-quadruplexes by small molecule ligands has emerged as an original strategy to achieve anti-tumor therapy (12Neidle S. Parkinson G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 13Davies J.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 668-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 17Mergny J.L. Hélène C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1366-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Several classes of ligands are potent inhibitors of telomerase and display strong affinities for G-quadruplex structures (11Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. Mailliet P. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Gilson E.

Telomere shortening is also observed in cells treated with telomestatin but arises earlier than expected for a single mechanism involving telomerase inhibition (19Tauchi T. Shin-Ya K. Sashida G.

Furthermore, the extent of telomere degradation is limited to a few kilobases and is often undetectable in cell lines bearing short telomeres. Recent results indicate that G4 ligands from the triazine series induce short-term apoptotic effects independently of the presence of telomerase activity and that resistance to these agents is associated with telomere capping alterations (28Gomez D.

We have examined here the effect of telomestatin on the conformation and the length of the telomeric G-overhang. Oligonucleotides, Compounds, and Cells—All oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Telomestatin was prepared at 5 mm in methanol, Me2SO (50:50). Additional dilutions were made in water. A549 human lung carcinoma was from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Long-term Growth Assay—A549 cells were seeded at 7.5 × 104 cells/25-cm2 flask in the presence of different concentrations of telomestatin. Cells were passaged every 4 days; viable cells were counted with a hemacytometer, and reseeded at the original density. Results represented the cell survival (in %), as compared with untreated cells at each passage. Solution Hybridization Experiments—The non-denaturing hybridization assay to detect 3′ telomere G-overhang was performed with a modification of the procedure described previously (26Gomez D. Aouali N. Renaud A. Douarre C. Shin-Ya K. Tazi J. Martinez S. Trentesaux C. Morjani H. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6149-6153PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cimino-Reale G. Pascale E. Battiloro E. Starace G. Verna R. D'Ambrosio E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 2.5 μg of undigested genomic DNA were hybridized at 50 °C overnight with 0.5 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled 21C oligonucleotide (5′-CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCC-3′) in sodium/magnesium hybridization buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in a volume of 20 μl. In some experiments MgCl2 was omitted (sodium buffer) and NaCl was replaced by KCl (potassium buffer) or LiCl (lithium buffer), as indicated. For competition with pu22myc (5′-GAGGGTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAAG-3′) the reactions were performed in sodium buffer without MgCl2. To detect the telomere C-overhang, genomic DNA was hybridized overnight in sodium buffer without MgCl2 with 0.5 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled 20G oligonucleotide (5′-GGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3′). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6 μl of loading buffer (20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and samples were size fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels in 1× TBE buffer containing ethidium bromide (EtBr). Gels were dried on Whatman filter paper. EtBr fluorescence and radioactivity were scanned with a phosphorimager (Typhoon 9210, Amersham Biosciences). Results were expressed as the relative hybridization signal normalized to the fluorescent signal of EtBr. Dimethyl Sulfate Treatment—After 24 to 48 h of treatment with telomestatin (1 to 5 μm), cells were washed with fresh medium and were treated with 0.05% DMS 2The abbreviations used are: DMS, dimethyl sulfate; T-OLA, telomeric oligonucleotide ligation assay; TRF2, telomeric repeat factor 2. for 5 to 10 min at 4 °C as described (30Cloutier J.F. Castonguay A. O'Connor T.R. Drouin R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding 1 m β-mercaptoethanol and DNA was purified as usual. T-OLA Analysis—T-OLA was performed as described before (29Cimino-Reale G. Pascale E. Battiloro E. Starace G. Verna R. D'Ambrosio E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 5 μg of DNA were added to a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 pmol of 32P-end-labeled (CCCTAA)4 oligonucleotide for 12 h at 50 °C, followed by ligation with 20 units of Taq ligase at 50 °C for a further 5 h. Reaction products were precipitated, dried, and resuspended in a formamide-based loading buffer and electrophoresed onto 6% acrylamide, 6 m urea gels. Gels were dried and radioactivity was detected with a PhosphorImager. Fluorescence Experiments—The melting behavior of a fluorescent nucleotide F21G (5′-FAM-GGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-DabCyl-3′) was studied alone, and in the presence of 20 μg of genomic DNA and/or 5 μm telomestatin. Assays were performed in a buffer containing 0.5 μm F21G, 10 mm cacodylate, pH 8.0, 0.1 m LiCl, and 5 mm KCl. Excitation wavelength was 470 ± 20 nm and emission of fluorescein was recorded at 530 ± 20 nm using the Roche LightCycler real-time PCR apparatus as described (31Darby R.A. Sollogoub M. McKeen C. Brown L. Risitano A. Brown N. Barton C. Brown T. Fox K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e39Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PCR Stop Assay—The stabilization of G-quadruplex structures by telomestatin was investigated by a PCR-stop assay (32Gomez D. Lemarteleur T. Lacroix L. Mailliet P. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) using a test oligonucleotide and a complementary oligonucleotide that partially hybridizes to the last G-repeat of the test oligonucleotide. Sequences of the test oligonucleotides (Pu22myc and 21G) and the corresponding complementary sequence (RevPu22 and Rev21G) used here are presented in Fig. 4a. Assay reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl, in a 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, buffer with 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 7.5 pmol of each oligonucleotide, 1.5 units of Taq polymerase, and the indicated amount of the ligand. Reaction mixtures were incubated in a thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Amplified products were resolved on 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE and stained with SYBR Green I (Roche). Fluorescence was scanned with a phosphorimager (Typhoon 9210, Amersham). Results represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. G-overhang Signal Is Strongly Decreased in the Presence of Telomestatin—Because senescence might also result from telomere uncapping and the status of the 3′ overhang (33Stewart S.A. Ben-Porath I.

Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), we have examined the effects of the treatment with G-quadruplex ligands on the telomeric G-overhang by using a non-denaturing solution hybridization technique with a complementary oligonucleotide (21C) and native agarose gel electrophoresis without any digestion by restriction enzymes (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The localization of the signal relative to undigested DNA and sensitivity to exonucleases (Ref. 29Cimino-Reale G. Pascale E. Battiloro E. Starace G. Verna R. D'Ambrosio E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and data not shown) supported evidence for the specificity of this assay to G-rich telomeric single-stranded DNA. Continuous treatment of A549 human lung carcinoma cells with 1 or 2 μm telomestatin induced a delayed growth arrest starting at days 16 and 8, respectively, that led to a senescent-like culture in which both apoptotic and SA-β-galactosidase expressing cells were detected (Ref. 26Gomez D. Aouali N. Renaud A. Douarre C. Shin-Ya K. Tazi J. Martinez S. Trentesaux C. Morjani H. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6149-6153PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown, see also Fig. 2a). In the presence of 5 μm telomestatin, growth arrest was observed after only 4 days of exposure (Fig. 2a, squares). DNA extracted from the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line growth arrested by 2 μm telomestatin presented a significant decrease in the G-overhang signal, as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2b). Treatment with 1 and 5 μm telomestatin for a shorter period (24 or 48 h), a time when the ligand has no or reduced impact on cell culture growth (Fig. 2a), also provoked a dramatic decrease in the G-overhang signal with an effect detectable within 24 h (>95% at 5 μm, 70% at 1 μm) (Figs. 2c and 9b).Fig. 9Effect of DMS on telomestatin-induced overhang loss in A549 cells. DMS induced telomeric overhang loss but protected against the telomestatin-induced effect on overhang. Non-denaturing solution hybridization analysis: a, in sodium buffer of the 3′ telomeric overhang in untreated A549 cells (control), cells treated with DMS for 10 min (DMS), cells treated for 48 h with 5 μm telomestatin (Telo) and cells treated with 5 μm telomestatin for and with DMS for 10 min (Telo + DMS). b, quantification of the DMS protection effect (three independent experiments) for A549 cells treated with 1 or 5 μm telomestatin. Hybridization signal of the 21C probe (G-strand) was normalized relative to the ethidium bromide (EtBr) signal and results are expressed relative to the signal from untreated A549 DNA defined as 100%. c, analysis in lithium buffer of the telomeric G-overhang from untreated A549 cells (A549), cells treated with DMS for 10 min (+DMS), cells treated for 48 h with 1 μm telomestatin (+Telo), and cells treated with 1 μm telomestatin for 48 h and with DMS for 10 min (+Telo 1 μm, + DMS). As indicated, telomestatin (0.1, 1, or 10 μm) was added to DNA samples to determine the in vitro inhibition of hybridization by telomestatin. d, analysis in sodium buffer of the telomeric G-overhang from untreated A549 cells (A549) and cells treated with DMS for 10 min (+DMS). As indicated, telomestatin (0.1, 1, or 10 μm) was added to DNA samples to determine in vitro inhibition of hybridization by telomestatin. e, IC50 of telomestatin for in vitro inhibition of hybridization in sodium or lithium buffer for the indicated cellular treatment conditions (see panels c and d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm these findings, we also used the T-OLA assay (29Cimino-Reale G. Pascale E. Battiloro E. Starace G. Verna R. D'Ambrosio E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which measures the G-overhang length (Fig. 2d). Again, telomestatin-treated A549 cells presented a marked shortening of the telomeric G-overhang to 24 nucleotides, as compared with 192 nucleotides in control untreated cells. Both methods indicate that telomestatin is able to induce a rapid and dramatic alteration of the telomeric G-overhang. Surprisingly, the G-overhang loss was found earlier than expected and might represent a rapid degradation process triggered by telomestatin as a consequence of changes in the telomeric overhang configuration. On the other hand, because telomestatin is a potent and specific G-quadruplex ligand, we cannot exclude that the ligand modified the G-overhang in a conformation that further inhibited the hybridization reaction. This would mean that telomestatin tightly binds to the telomeric overhang during DNA extraction and purification. Several experiments were then designed to answer this point. Telomestatin Specifically Binds to the Single-stranded Conformation of G-overhang in Vitro—We first investigated whether telomestatin could stabilize the telomeric overhang in a conformation that impaired hybridization. Previous studies have shown that, under physiological conditions, formation of a G-quadruplex structure delays but does not prevent the hybridization of the complementary C-strand leading to the formation of a (TTAGGG/CCCTAA)n duplex (36Phan A.T. Mergny J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The addition of a specific ligand is expected to shift the equilibrium toward the G-quadruplex folding and therefore to inhibit hybridization. This was initially proposed for a bisacridine dye (37Alberti P. Ren J. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Guittat L. Riou J.F. Chaires J. Hélène C. Vigneron J.P. Lehn J.M. Mergny J.L. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2001; 19: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and recently demonstrated for telomestatin by using short oligonucleotides mimicking four telomere repeats (23Rosu F. Gabelica V. Shin-ya K. De Pauw E. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 2702-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results were obtained with short (21–22 bases long) synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Because of its size, the structure and folding of a 200-base long telomeric overhang into a quadruplex might be qualitatively and quantitatively different from that described with oligonucleotides. The potency or the nature of the ligand, as well as the ionic or protein environment, might also greatly influence this folding and the nature of the complex. We therefore studied the in vitro effect of telomestatin on the G-overhang from purified genomic DNA. Not only is the overhang length different from the model systems mentioned above, but the nature of genomic DNA implies the presence of a huge molar excess of double-stranded sequences that could trap telomestatin if this ligand had an insufficient specificity toward quadruplexes. Overnight incubation of the labeled C-strand (21C) with genomic DNA in the presence of telomestatin induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the hybridization signal in Na+ and K+ salt conditions (Fig. 3, a and b). The presence of Li+ partially released the extent of the inhibition (Fig. 3, a and b), in agreement with the known requirements for G-quadruplex stabilization (13Davies J.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 668-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of Mg2+ that favors duplex hybridization over G-quadruplex folding (38Alberti P. Mergny J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) did not change the extent of the inhibition (Fig. 3, a and b, compare magnesium/sodium and sodium), indicating that telomestatin created a potent and stable interaction at telomeric overhang related to its property of interacting with G-quadruplex. Consistent with these findings, a G4-inactive ligand (formula shown in Fig. 1) was unable to inhibit 21C hybridization under all conditions tested (Fig. 3c and data not shown). For in vitro treatment with telomestatin, the presence of the labeled probe was also observed in the loading well but disappeared after further pretreatment with proteinase K without any change of the telomeric overhang signal (not shown), indicating that it corresponded to aggregation with the remaining proteins from the DNA preparation. c-Myc Quadruplex Competes with the Telomestatin Effect at Telomeric Overhang—Further evidence of the involvement of G-quadruplexes in hybridization inhibition was obtained by using competition experiments with another G-quadruplex forming oligonucleotide (pu22myc) derived from the NHE III1 element of the c-myc promoter (39Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11593-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). This quadruplex was found to be efficiently stabilized by telomestatin in a PCR-stop assay with an IC50 equal to that of the telomeric sequence (Fig. 4b) and presented several mismatches with the 21C oligonucleotide that prevent duplex formation. As shown in Fig. 5a, the addition of 1 μm pu22myc did not interfere with 21C hybridization to the telomeric overhang and abolished the inhibitory effect of telomestatin (up to 1 μm). At a higher telomestatin concentration (10 μm), pu22myc was unable to prevent the loss of the hybridization signal, in agreement with competition between the telomeric overhang and pu22myc G-quadruplexes for telomestatin binding. In the presence of 10 μm pu22myc, the reversion of the telomestatin-induced inhibition was further improved and was complete for a telomestatin concentration up to 2 μm and partial (40%) with 5 μm (Fig. 5, a and c). As a control, hybridization experiments were also performed with the 20G oligonucleotide that probed the transient telomeric C-rich overhang described during the S phase of proliferating cells (40Cimino-Reale G. Pascale E. Alvino E. Starace G. D'Ambrosio E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2136-2140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A very weak hybridization band corresponding to the C-overhang was detected in the absence of treatment. This signal was not modified by the treatment with telomestatin up to a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 6). These in vitro experiments allow us to conclude that telomestatin specifically targets the telomeric G-overhang structure from purified genomic DNA through the formation of stable G-quadruplex structures, as previously reported for oligonucleotides (23Rosu F. Gabelica V. Shin-ya K. De Pauw E. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 2702-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Kim M.Y. Gleason-Guzman M. Izbicka E. Nishioka D. Hurley L.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3247-3256PubMed Google Scholar). Telomestatin Remains Attached to the G-overhang and Prevents Hybridization of a Complementary Probe—We then investigated whether telomestatin might alter the conformation of the telomeric G-overhang and remains tightly bound to the telomeric overhang after cellular treatment. DNA from A549-treated cells (5 μm, 24 h) was incubated in the presence of the quadruplex competitor pu22myc. A partial reversion of the hybridization signal loss was observed in the presence pu22myc (Fig. 5, a and b). The recovery was up to 41% of the G-overhang signal as a function of the pu22myc competitor concentration and slightly decreased to 35% when telomestatin treatment was prolonged to 48 h (Fig. 5d). This suggests that telomestatin was strongly bound to the telomeric overhang in a conformation that impaired 21C hybridization. We conclude that short-term treatment (up to 48 h) with telomestatin did not completely degrade the G-overhang. Such tight binding of telomestatin to the G-overhang implies a very strong selectivity of this ligand for telomeric ends over duplex DNA, in agreement with previous selectivity studies with different oligonucleotides (23Rosu F. Gabelica V. Shin-ya K. De Pauw E. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 2702-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Kim M.Y. Gleason-Guzman M. Izbicka E. Nishioka D. Hurley L.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3247-3256PubMed Google Scholar). This was previously demonstrated by using short oligonucleotides by MS-MSI (23Rosu F. Gabelica V. Shin-ya K. De Pauw E. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 2702-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments using a 26-nucleotide long duplex oligonucleotide as a competitor with the 21G oligonucleotide (the minimal telomeric sequence able to form a quadruplex). In the presence of a 650-base molar excess of the ds26 oligonucleotide, the melting temperature induced by telomestatin was not modified (not shown). Under the same experimental conditions, the stabilization induced by other ligands such as ethidium derivatives was lost (41Rosu F. De Pauw E. Guittat L. Alberti P. Lacroix L. Mailliet P. Riou J.F. Mergny J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10361-10371Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), demonstrating that telomestatin is more selective toward quadruplexes than these derivatives. To investigate the selectivity toward human double-stranded genomic DNA, fluorescence experiments using F21G-Dabcyl in the presence of telomestatin were performed with purified A549 DNA. The melting temperature of the oligonucleotide (74 °C in the presence of 5 μm telomestatin) was not modified up to a 3 × 103 base molar excess of DNA, indicating a very potent selectivity for telomestatin between telomeric G-quadruplex and duplex genomic DNA (Fig. 7). Such tight and specific binding of telomestatin to the G-overhang quadruplex is also in agreement with the results of the in vitro competition experiment with the pu22myc quadruplex. Telomestatin Induces an Effective G-overhang Degradation Associated with the Delayed A549 Growth Arrest—At this point, because of its tight binding to the telomeric overhang, we were unable to conclude whether a short-term exposure of A549 cells to 5 μm telomestatin resulted, at least partially, in a rapid degradation of the telomeric overhang, because the pu22myc competition induced a partial reversion of the hybridization that was nearly equal for in vitro experiments (40%) and cell treatment (35–41%). This ligand concentration also provoked a rapid growth arrest after 4 days of exposure of the cells (Fig. 1a). To determine whether the onset of the delayed growth arrest induced by telomestatin corresponded to an effective degradation of the telomeric overhang, we studied the long-term effect of telomestatin exposure at a lower concentration. After 16 days of treatment with 2 μm telomestatin, the remaining A549 cells were washed in fresh culture medium without telomestatin and maintained for a further 9 days in the absence of the drug to achieve a density suitable for DNA extraction (Fig. 8a, open triangle). During that period, cell population doubling was equal to 3.2, corresponding to a 67-h doubling time, as compared with 22 h for control cells, indicating that these cells have not fully recovered from the effects of the drug. Interestingly, the telomeric G-overhang signal was still found to be decreased by 70% (Fig. 8b), a value suggesting that the G-overhang was substantially degraded. After 4 to 12 days of treatment with 2 μm telomestatin, the telomeric G-overhang signal decreased from 33 to 10%, respectively (Fig. 8c). In vitro, the effect of this telomestatin concentration is fully reversed by the competition with 10 μm pu22myc (Figs. 5c and 8c). DNA from A549-treated cells (4 to 12 days) were incubated in the presence of the pu22myc competitor (10 μm). The recovery was up to 71% of the hybridization at 4 days, but markedly decreased to 48% when telomestatin treatment was prolonged to 12 days (Fig. 8c). Importantly, and contrary to the previous experiments at higher telomestatin concentrations, the addition of pu22myc allowed to determine the effective G-overhang signal. This observation supports the conclusion that telomestatin induced a bona fide and persistent reduction in G-overhang length. In other words, the reduction of the radioactive signal resulting from the stabilization of a quadruplex during hybridization that prevents formation of a duplex with the radiolabeled probe cannot fully account for the reduction observed in Fig. 8. G-overhang degradation correlated with the telomestatin-induced delayed loss of viability of A549 cells. DMS Treatment Alters Telomestatin Effects on G-overhangs—To confirm that the telomeric overhang signal decrease was not the sole result of a tenacious interaction of the ligand with the telomeric overhang during hybridization, we used in vivo protection experiments with DMS. Treatment of A549 cells with DMS before DNA extraction modifies the electrophoretic migration of genomic DNA and creates discrete double-stranded DNA breaks (Fig. 9a, EtBr), as previously described (30Cloutier J.F. Castonguay A. O'Connor T.R. Drouin R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The radioactive band intensity was also reduced to about 70% of the control (Fig. 9, a and b), indicating a rapid decrease in G-overhang size that corresponded to the onset of a rapid endonucleolytic process of the telomeric G-overhang. When telomestatin treatment (24 h, 5 μm) was followed by DMS treatment before DNA extraction, a 2-fold increase in the G-overhang hybridization was observed, as compared with telomestatin treatment alone (Fig. 9, a and b). Similar results were obtained in the presence of 1 μm telomestatin for 24 h (Fig. 9, b and c), suggesting that DMS is able to decrease the effect of telomestatin on the G-overhang. Further in vitro treatment with telomestatin (0.1 to 10 μm, Fig. 9c) was applied to DNA from DMS- and/or telomestatin-treated cells in lithium buffer conditions. In that case, telomestatin-induced inhibition of G-overhang was increased in DNA from DMS-treated cells (IC50 = 0.8 μm), as compared with control cells (IC50 = 1.8 μm), suggesting that DMS-induced overhang shortening facilitated the effect of the ligand in vitro. Similar results were obtained in sodium buffer conditions (Fig. 9d). DNA from cells treated with telomestatin (1 μm, 24 h) provided a stronger inhibition with further in vitro treatment with the ligand (IC50 = 0.5 μm) (Fig. 9c). In contrast, DNA from cells treated with both DMS and telomestatin had a reduced effect on G-overhangs (IC50 = 2 μm) in agreement with a protection of their action (Fig. 9c). Because DMS is applied for a short time after the addition of telomestatin, and as DMS treatment by itself induces a G-overhang decrease, the protection likely resulted from an interaction of telomestatin with the overhang that protected it against the DMS action. This experiment suggests that telomestatin engages the telomeric overhang in vivo in a DNA structure resistant to the action of DMS. Because DMS mostly induces N7-alkG modifications in vivo (30Cloutier J.F. Castonguay A. O'Connor T.R. Drouin R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the protection is compatible with the formation by telomestatin of quadruplex Hoogsteen bonds at the telomeric overhang in vivo. Our data indicate that telomestatin is able to impair the telomeric overhang structure in human cells. A tight and specific interaction of the ligand with telomeric overhang compatible with the formation of a stable G-quadruplex was found, and prolonged treatment of the cells with telomestatin resulted in a marked decrease in the G-overhang signal that correlated with the onset of the delayed growth arrest. Recent reports indicate that TRF2 is essential for protection of the telomeric overhang and prevents the action of the nucleotide excision repair nuclease ERCC1/XPF that participates in the overhang removal (34Zhu X.D. Niedernhofer L. Kuster B. Mann M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We propose that the alteration of the G-overhang conformation by telomestatin might alter its capping by essential factors such as TRF2, therefore leading to its degradation. Our results are also in agreement with the finding that another ligand from the 2,6-pyridocarboxamide series is preferentially associated with mitotic telomeres during metaphase. 3F. Boussin, personal communication. Our results represent the first evidence that telomeric overhangs are an important target for the biological effect of these classes of agents."
https://openalex.org/W2168281793,"Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Two histologically distinct types of gastric carcinoma, 'intestinal' and 'diffuse', have different epidemiological and pathophysiological features that suggest different mechanisms of carcinogenesis. A number of studies have investigated intestinal-type gastric cancers at the molecular level, but little is known about mechanisms involved in the diffuse type, which has a more invasive phenotype and poorer prognosis. To clarify the mechanisms that underlie its development and/or progression, we compared the expression profiles of 20 laser-microbeam-microdissected diffuse-type gastric-cancer tissues with corresponding noncancerous mucosae by means of a cDNA microarray containing 23,040 genes. We identified 153 genes that were commonly upregulated and more than 1500 that were commonly downregulated in the tumors. We also identified a number of genes related to tumor progression. Furthermore, comparison of the expression profiles of diffuse-type with those of intestinal-type gastric cancers identified 46 genes that may represent distinct molecular signatures of each histological type. The putative signature of diffuse-type cancer exhibited altered expression of genes related to cell-matrix interaction and extracellular-matrix (ECM) components, whereas that of intestinal-type cancer represented enhancement of cell growth. These data provide insight into different mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis and may also serve as a starting point for identifying novel diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic targets for diffuse-type gastric cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2054875674,"It was recently reported that RUNX3 gene expression is significantly downregulated in human gastric cancer cells due to hypermethylation of its promoter region or hemizygous deletion (Cell, 109, 2002). To verify the genetic alterations and methylation status of the RUNX3 gene in colorectal carcinogenesis, we analysed for mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and RUNX3 gene promoter hypermethylation, in 32 colorectal cancer cell lines. RT–PCR analysis showed undetectable or low RUNX3 expression in 16 cell lines, and no mutations were found in the RUNX3 gene by PCR-SSCP analysis. Of these 16 cell lines, hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter was confirmed in 12. The following observations were made: (i) RUNX3 was re-expressed after 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment, (ii) the RUNX3 promoter was found to be methylated by MS-PCR, and (iii) hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter was confirmed by direct sequencing analysis after sodium bisulfite modification in the above 12 cell lines. RUNX3 was neither methylated nor expressed in four cell lines. Of these four, microsatellite instability (MSI) at the RUNX3 locus was found in three, SNU-61 (D1S246), SNU-769A, and SNU-769B (D1S199). This study suggests that transcriptional repression of RUNX3 is caused by promoter hypermethylation of the RUNX3 CpG island in colorectal cancer cell lines, and the results of these experiments may contribute to an understanding of the role of RUNX3 inactivation in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1969678475,"CAS (‘Crk-associated substrate’) is an Src substrate found at sites of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and linked to cell motility and survival. In this study, the involvement of CAS in oncogenic transformation was evaluated through analysis of mouse embryo fibroblast populations expressing an activated Src mutant, either in the presence or absence of CAS expression. CAS was not found to be a critical determinant of either Src-mediated morphologic transformation or anchorage-independent growth. However, CAS had a profound effect on other aspects of oncogenic Src function. CAS expression led to a substantial increase in the phosphotyrosine content of FAK and paxillin, supporting a role for CAS as a positive regulator of Src activity at integrin adhesion sites. Importantly, CAS expression resulted in a striking enhancement of the capacity of Src-transformed cells to invade through Matrigel. The increased invasiveness was associated with increased activation of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and formation of large actin-rich podosomal aggregates appearing as ring and belt structures. Thus, elevated CAS-associated tyrosine phosphorylation signaling events occurring at sites of integrin-mediated cell adhesion can have a major role in the development of an invasive cell phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1991119843,"Cbl proteins are ubiquitin protein ligases, which ubiquitinate activated tyrosine kinases and target them for degradation. Both c-Cbl and Cbl-b have an ubiquitin associated (UBA) domain at their C-terminal end. We observed that high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins constitutively coimmunoprecipitated with transfected and endogenous Cbl-b, but not c-Cbl. The binding site for these ubiquitinated proteins was mapped to the UBA domain of Cbl-b (UBAb). GST-fusion proteins containing the UBAb interacted with ubiquitinated proteins and polyubiquitin chains in vitro, whereas those containing the UBA domain of c-Cbl (UBAc) did not. The UBAb had a much greater affinity for polyubiquitin chains than for monoubiquitin. Analysis of the UBAb and UBAc demonstrate that the affinity for ubiquitin is determined by multiple amino-acid differences between the two domains. Overexpression of the UBAb, but not overexpression of the UBAc, inhibited a variety of ubiquitin-mediated processes such as degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (i.e. EGFR, Mdm-2, and Siah-1). This in vivo result is consistent with the differences in ubiquitin binding observed in vitro between the UBAb and UBAc. This difference in ubiquitin-binding may reflect distinct regulatory functions of c-Cbl and Cbl-b."

https://openalex.org/W2013451756,"Recent studies have found a higher frequency of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene alterations in invasive bladder carcinoma than in superficial disease, suggesting that PTEN is important in this process. A role of PTEN in bladder cancer invasion is further suggested by the fact that PTEN is a regulator of cell motility, a necessary component of tumor invasion. However, it is unknown whether PTEN is mechanistically involved in ‘in vivo’ tumor invasion or merely an epiphenomenon and, if the former is true, whether this process is dependent on its protein or lipid phosphatase activities. To address these issues, we stably transfected several commonly used human bladder cancer cell lines with known invasive phenotypes with either wild-type PTEN constructs or those deficient in the lipid phosphatase (G129E) or both protein and lipid phosphatase (G129R) activities. Here we show that chemotaxis was inhibited by both the wild-type and G129E mutant of PTEN but not by G129R-transfected cells. Using a novel organotypic in vitro invasion assay, we evaluated the impact of wild-type and mutant PTEN transgene expression on the invasive ability of T24T, a human bladder cancer cell line with a functionally impaired PTEN. Results indicate that the G129E mutant blocks invasion as efficiently as wild-type PTEN transfection. In contrast to the wild-type gene, this mutant has no effect on cell clonogenicity in agar. To further establish the role of PTEN in tumor invasion, we evaluated vector- and PTEN-transfected T24T cells in an orthotopic in vivo assay that faithfully reproduces human disease. Microscopic examination of murine bladders at the completion of this experiment parallels the results obtained with the organotypic assay. Our results are the first demonstration: (1) that the inhibitory effects of PTEN on cell motility translate into suppression of in vivo invasion; (2) that PTEN can inhibit tumor invasion even in the absence of its lipid phosphatase activity; (3) how organotypic in vitro approaches can be used as surrogates of in vivo invasion allowing rapid dissection of molecular processes leading to this phenotype while reducing the number of animals used in research."

https://openalex.org/W2054141874,"Mesenchymal–epithelial interactions are increasingly considered to be of vital importance for epithelial homeostasis and regeneration. In skin, the transcription factor AP-1 was shown to be critically involved in the communication between keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. After skin injury, the release of IL-1 from keratinocytes induces the activity of the AP-1 subunits c-Jun and JunB in fibroblasts leading to a global change in gene expression. To identify AP-1 target genes in fibroblasts, which are involved in the process of cutaneous repair, we performed gene expression profiling of wild-type, c-jun- and junB-deficient fibroblasts in response to IL-1, mimicking the initial phase of wound healing. Using a 15K cDNA collection, over 1000 genes were found to be Jun-dependent and additional 300 clones showed IL-1 responsiveness. Combinatorial evaluation allowed for the dissection of the specific contribution of either AP-1 subunit to gene regulation. Besides previously identified genes that are involved in cutaneous repair, we have identified novel genes regulated during wound healing in vivo and showed their expression by fibroblasts on wound sections. The identification of novel Jun target genes should provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying mesenchymal–epithelial interactions and the critical contribution of AP-1 to tissue homeostasis and repair."

https://openalex.org/W2028938508,"Opiate abuse has been shown to cause adaptive changes in presynaptic release and protein phosphorylation-mediated synaptic plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neuronal SNARE proteins serve as important regulatory molecules underlying neural plasticity in view of their major role in the process of neurotransmitter release. In the present study, the expression of SNAP-25, a t-SNARE protein essential for vesicle release, was found to be dramatically regulated in hippocampus after chronic morphine treatment, which was visualized with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The spots of SNAP-25 in the gel were shifted along the dimension of isoelectric point, indicating a likely change of the post-transcriptional modification. Immunoblotting analysis with specific antibody to Ser187, a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site of SNAP-25, revealed that the specific phosphorylation was correspondingly decreased, which was correlated with morphine-induced inhibition of PKC activity. Moreover, the level of ternary complex of SNARE proteins in either synaptosomes or PC12 cells was significantly reduced after chronic morphine treatment. This suggests a causal relationship between the inhibition of PKC-dependent SNAP-25 phosphorylation and the down-regulation of SNARE complex formation after chronic morphine treatment. Further analysis of SNARE complex formed by transfection of the wild-type or Ser187 mutants of SNAP-25 showed that only wild-type-formed complex was inhibited by morphine treatment.

Importantly, presynaptic neurotransmitter release, which can be modulated by phosphorylation, serves as a critical element in the regulation of synaptic transmission during opiate abuse. Many protein kinases involved in modulation of transmitter release and synaptic plasticity, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SNAP-25, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25kDa; synaptobrevin, vesicle-associated SNARE synaptobrevin 2; 2-DE, two-dimensional electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), also participate in cellular and synaptic adaptation mediating opiate dependence (3Williams J.T.

Regulated membrane fusion of synaptic vesicles and subsequent transmitter release involves the assembly of ternary complexes from soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (10Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). The ternary complex is formed by the plasma membrane proteins synaptosomal-associated protein of 25kDa (SNAP-25) and syntaxin, and vesicle-associated SNARE synaptobrevin 2 (synaptobrevin) (11Sollner T.

For instance, phosphorylation of SNAP-25 by PKC regulates SNAP-25 localization (13Iwasaki S. Kataoka M. Sekiguchi M. Shimazaki Y. Sato K. Takahashi M. J Biochem.

In addition, many SNARE regulatory proteins have been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro, which may alter the interactions of the proteins with their effectors and binding partners and hence modulate neurotransmitter release (12Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, whether phosphorylation of SNARE proteins is modulated directly by opiate remains unclear, and the significance of phosphorylation of SNARE proteins in vivo during opiate abuse is still poorly understood. In the current study, we showed that chronic morphine treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of SNAP-25, and this was attributable to the down-regulation of PKC activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PKC-dependent phosphorylation participated in a down-regulation of SNARE complex formation during morphine treatment. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of SNARE protein can be modulated in vivo, which may serve as a potential mechanism for the modulation of elementary steps of exocytotic process under opiate abuse. Preparations of Mice Brain Tissue—Male C57BL/6J mice (20–22 g) were obtained from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Mice were housed in groups and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All treatments were strictly in accordance with the National Institutes of Heath Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were treated by repeated intraperitoneal injection of morphine (or saline in control) at an interval of 12 h, over 6 days (20 mg/kg on day 1 to 100 mg/kg on days 5 and 6) (20Ledent C.

Then the brains were removed, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem were rapidly dissected, and the tissue was prepared for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) as mentioned below. The further subcellular fractions were prepared, respectively, according to the standard methods as described previously (21Ortiz J. Harris H.W. Guitart X. Terwilliger R.Z. Haycock J.W. Nestler E.J.

Briefly, brain samples were homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) in a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged (1,000 × g× 10 min; 4 °C), and the supernatants were spun at 10,000 × g× 20 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The pellets constituted the crude synaptosomal fraction (P2). Then the fractions were resuspended in 500 μl of 1× P buffer (5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm HEPES, 130 mm choline chloride, 1 mm bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% CHAPS). Synaptosomes were then solubilized with 3.5 ml of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.5% CHAPS, pH 7.4), stirred at 4 °C for 1.5 h, and further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h. After given a protein concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml that was determined by Bradford methods (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), this suspension was used in Western blot analysis as described below. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2-DE) for Protein Identification—Brain samples were homogenized in ice-cold 2-DE sample buffer (4% CHAPS, 8 m urea, 40 mm Tris, 65 mm dithioerythritol) with protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science), in a glass/Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were sonicated on ice and centrifuged (10,000 × g× 1h) at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Two-DE was performed according to the previous studies (24Genoud S. Pralong W.

Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 100 μg of total protein for analytical 2-DE gel and 1 mg for preparative gel were loaded on nonlinear immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (NL pH 3–10; Amersham Biosciences), respectively, and hydrated in hydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 18 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% IPG buffer, bromphenol blue trace) for 10 h. Isoelectric focusing was performed, at 20 °C, for 1 h at 500 V, for 1 h more at 1,000 V, and then for 12 h at 8,000 V in an IPGphor apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) with a limiting current of 70 μA per strip. Prior to the second dimension, strips were incubated in 50 mm dithioerythritol buffer (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 15 min to reduce S–S bonds. The -SH groups were subsequently blocked for 15 min with the same solution except that the dithioerythritol was replaced by iodoacetamide (2.5%) and a trace of bromphenol blue. Equilibrated strips were inserted onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, sealed with 0.5% agarose, and SDS-PAGE gels were run under constant current 10 mA/gel for 0.5 h and 30 mA/gel for 3.5 h at 10 °C (Bio-Rad). Analytical gels were visualized by silver staining or were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and then incubated with the monoclonal antibody of SNAP-25 as described below. Protein spots excised from 2-DE gels in preparative gel were identified by Western blot analysis visualized with SNAP-25 antibody or were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightmass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and data base searching. PC12 Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum/10% fetal bovine serum/50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (106) were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After chronic treatment with morphine (0.01–10 μm) or saline for the indicated time (1–24 h), the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described below. Transfection—Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-SNAP-25 (Wild-type), EGFP-SNAP-25E (S187E), and EGFP-SNAP-25A (S187A) were kindly provided by Dr. Masakazu Kataoka (Dept. of Environmental Science and Technology, Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan) (14Kataoka M. Kuwahara R. Iwasaki S. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transfection of PC12 cells with eukaryotic expression plasmids was performed by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described (26Itakura M. Misawa H. Sekiguchi M. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with morphine as mentioned above and analyzed by Western blotting. Electrophoretic Procedure and Western Blot Analysis—The samples (20 μg of protein) from brain tissue or cultured cells of control and morphine-treated groups were incubated at 100 °C or 22 °C for 5 min, respectively, before electrophoresis. Then the samples were loaded and subjected to a discontinuous gel, with the upper two-thirds being 8% and the lower one-third being 15% acrylamide, respectively, and were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane by using a minigel and mini transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, 15% nonfat milk) at room temperature for 1 h. Then the membranes were incubated with antibodies of mouse anti-SNAP-25 (1:10,000) or mouse anti-syntaxin1A (1:10,000), or mouse anti-synaptobrevin (1:10,000) from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany), or rabbit antiphosphorylated SNAP-25 (1:1,000; a kind gift from Masami Takahashi, Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan), or mouse anti-GFP (1:1000; Roche Applied Science), respectively, overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (Sigma). Finally, the blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For the quantification of the Western blot data, the developed films were scanned, the immunoreactive bands were digitized, and the densitometry was performed using Scion Image for Windows (Scion, Frederick, MD). The re-electrophoresis in a second dimension for detecting SNARE complexes was carried out as described previously (27Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In brief, after the first dimension, the whole lane containing the separated proteins was excised, soaked for 20 min in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 25% (v/v) isopropanol, washed with H2O for 5 min, and then incubated for 20 min in SDS sample buffer. After heating for 5 min at 100 °C, the strip was mounted on top of a 15% gel, re-electrophoresed, and analyzed by Western blotting as mentioned above. Protein Kinase Activity Assay—PKC and PKA activity was determined essentially according to the method described previously (28Lou L.G. Pei G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Animal was rapidly decapitated, and hippocampus was dissected rapidly and the hippocampal synaptosomal fraction was isolated as described above. The synaptosomes were assayed for PKC and PKA activity using PepTag Nonradioactive PKC/PKA assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All reaction components were added on ice in a final volume of 25 μl of the following mixture: 5 μl of PepTag PKC/PKA reaction 5× buffer, 5 μl of PepTag C1/A1 peptide (0.4 μg/μl), 5 μl of PKC/PKA activator 5× solution, 1 μl of peptide protection solution, and 1 μg of synaptosome for PKC/PKA activity assay. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C for the detection of PKC activity and 30 min at 25 °C for that of PKA activity. The reaction was stopped by placing the tube into a boiling water bath for 10 min, and the samples were loaded onto the gel for electrophoresis. Before loading samples, 1 μl of 80% glycerol was added to the sample to ensure that it remained in the well. The specific peptide substrates used in this experiment were PLSRTLSVAAK for PKC and LRRASLG for PKA, respectively. The assay was based on the changes in the net charge of the fluorescent PKC/PKA substrates before and after phosphorylation. This change allowed the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated versions of the substrate to be rapidly separated on an agarose gel at neutral pH. The phosphorylated species migrated toward the positive electrode, whereas the nonphosphorylated substrate migrated toward the negative electrode. The intensity of fluorescence of phosphorylated peptides, which reflected the activity of PKC/PKA, was scanned by using a bioimaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK) and further quantified by using Scion Image for Windows (Scion). Regulation of SNAP-25 following Chronic Morphine Treatment—To test the potential changes of protein expression in the hippocampus during opiate abuse, mice were injected with morphine in an increasing dose for 6 days, a procedure known to produce significant morphine dependence (20Ledent C. Valverde O. Cossu G. Petitet F. Aubert J.F. Beslot F. Bohme G.A. Imperato A. Pedrazzini T. Roques B.P. Vassart G. Fratta W. Parmentier M. Science. 1999; 283: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), and then the proteome analysis of hippocampal protein expression was conducted. The hippocampal extracts were separated by high resolution 2-DE, and SNAP-25, a t-SNARE protein located within presynaptic terminals and essential for vesicle release (29Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A.

Interestingly, the spots of SNAP-25 in the lower isoelectric points (pIs) were dramatically redistributed to higher pI after the treatment, indicating a likely change of the post-transcriptional modification (Fig. 1A). To further investigate the expression pattern of SNAP-25, the 2-DE gel was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and visualized with antibody to SNAP-25. The expression of phosphorylated SNAP-25 in the 2-DE membrane was also detected with a specific antibody to Ser187 (13Iwasaki S. Kataoka M. Sekiguchi M. Shimazaki Y. Sato K. Takahashi M. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Nagy G. Matti U. Nehring R.B. Binz T. Rettig J. Neher E. Sorensen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9278-9286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a specific phosphorylation site in the C-terminal (15Shimazaki Y. Nishiki T. Omori A. Sekiguchi M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The result of Fig. 1C showed that, following chronic morphine treatment, the relative intensity of the immunoblotting spots visualized with antibody to SNAP-25 was considerably altered. Concretely, the labeling of spots on the left (low pI) became weaker, whereas the spots on the right (high pI) were more intensely labeled (Fig. 1C). No significant change was observed in the total level of SNAP-25 expression. The phosphorylated SNAP-25 mainly distributed in the spots of left part and was significantly decreased in morphine-treated group (Fig. 1D), which was consistent with the redistribution of the spots visualized with antibody to SNAP-25. The expression pattern of SNAP-25 on the blots of the 2-DE was similar to that shown in the previous study in which spots were demonstrated to represent different states of phosphorylation of SNAP-25 by PKC but not by casein kinase II or CaMKII (24Genoud S. Pralong W. Riederer B.M. Eder L. Catsicas S. Muller D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1699-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We also detected the expression pattern of syntaxin1A or synaptobrevin, other SNARE proteins, by using their specific antibodies, and no significant changes were observed after chronic morphine treatment under the same conditions (data not shown). Inhibition of PKC Activity and PKC-dependent Phosphorylation of SNAP-25—To examine the regulation of SNAP-25 at synapses, the synaptosomal fraction of the hippocampus was prepared and the protein expression of total and phosphorylated SNAP-25 was detected, respectively. In agreement with the results of 2-DE gel, the level of phosphorylated SNAP-25 was decreased after chronic morphine treatment, whereas the total SNAP-25 expression was unchanged (Fig. 2A). Moreover, when the morphine-treated mice were injected with naloxone (1 mg/kg), a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist documented to lead to morphine withdrawal (20Ledent C. Valverde O. Cossu G. Petitet F. Aubert J.F. Beslot F. Bohme G.A. Imperato A. Pedrazzini T. Roques B.P. Vassart G. Fratta W. Parmentier M. Science. 1999; 283: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), 2 h after the last morphine administration, the decreased level of phosphorylated SNAP-25 was restored to the normal level (Fig. 2B). We also detected expression of phosphorylated SNAP-25 in synaptosomal fraction of other brain regions under the same condition, and a similar decrease was observed in the brain stem but not in the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting differential sensitivity of brain regions to chronic use of opiate. It is known that SNAP-25 is phosphorylated by PKC (15Shimazaki Y. Nishiki T. Omori A. Sekiguchi M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and PKC expression in hippocampus decreases after chronic morphine treatment in the brain (31Ventayol P. Busquets X. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Escriba P.V. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but how the activity of PKC is regulated in the hippocampus by morphine remains unknown. We found that the PKC activity in hippocampal synaptosomes was significantly decreased 2 h after the last morphine administration, and then recovered 8 h later (Fig. 3B), whereas a significant increase in PKA activity was observed after chronic morphine treatment (Fig. 3D). The time course of changes in PKC activity was parallel with that in levels of phosphorylated SNAP-25 (Fig. 3, F and H). We also detected the effect of acute morphine treatment (10–100 mg/kg) on PKC activity and SNAP-25 phosphorylation, and no obvious change was observed (Fig. 3, A, C, E, and G). Down-regulation of SNARE Ternary Complex after Chronic Morphine Treatment—Because SNAP-25 is a key component of the synaptic vesicle docking/fusion machinery that binds with synaptobrevin and syntaxin to form the SNARE complex, we want to know whether the abundance of the ternary complex of SNARE proteins was also altered after chronic exposure to morphine. The ternary complex is highly stable, such that it resists denaturation by SDS and is disrupted only upon boiling of sample (33Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to detect the signal of SNARE complex by comparing boiled and nonboiled samples. Fig. 4A shows that a high molecular mass band of ternary complex in ∼100 kDa was detected in nonboiled samples. The band disappeared after boiling the samples, which was accompanied with a corresponding increase in the level of monomeric SNAP-25. The band at ∼100 kDa was also detected using antibodies to syntaxin or synaptobrevin (Fig. 4A). Moreover, all the three proteins could be detected when the gel in the position of the band was excised, boiled, and reloaded (data not shown), indicating that the band containing all three proteins is one of the forms of ternary complex. As shown in Fig. 4B, after chronic morphine treatment, a significant decrease in the high molecular mass band at 100 kDa and an increase of monomeric SNAP-25 band was observed, whereas the total expression level of SNAP-25 remained unchanged (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, naloxone-initiated withdrawal could restore morphine-altered SNAP-25 to a high level (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the change of the complex is correlated to the modulation of morphine level in mice. Similar results were also obtained when the antibodies to syntaxin1A and synaptobrevin was applied, respectively (data not shown). SDS-resistant complexes contain large forms with distinct molecular weight (27Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and anti-SNAP-25 antibody may not recognize all the forms of these complexes in the hippocampal samples. Thus it is essential to examine whether the other high molecular weight bands are also altered by chronic morphine treatment. In the present study, the gel lane in saline and morphine groups was excised, respectively, after electrophoresis, heated to 100 °C to disrupt the complexes, and re-electrophoresed under identical conditions in a second dimension. Fig. 4D shows that the SDS-resistant complexes were visualized with any one of the three antibodies. After chronic morphine treatment, the expression level of complexes was significantly down-regulated, which was accompanied with an up-regulation of monomeric proteins, as compared with the saline group (Fig. 4D). This was consistent with previous observations. Regulation of SNARE Complex Formation by PKC-dependent Phosphorylation of SNAP-25—To clarify the possible involvement of PKC-dependent SNAP-25 phosphorylation in the regulation of SNARE complex formation by chronic morphine treatment, PC12 cells were used as a cellular model, in which both μ opioid receptor and δ opioid receptor were e"
https://openalex.org/W1974940854,"Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives, which cause growth inhibition, differentiation and/or apoptosis in various cell types, including some breast cancer cells. In general, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cells are retinoic acid (RA) sensitive, whereas ER-negative cells are resistant. In this report, we show that ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells are strongly growth inhibited by retinoids in combination with a PKC inhibitor. While neither RA nor GF109203X (GF) has a significant growth inhibitory effect in these cells, RA+GF potently suppress proliferation. We found that RA+GF induce apoptosis, as shown by an increase in fragmented DNA, Annexin-V-positive cells and caspase-3 activation. Apoptosis was also induced by GF in combination with two synthetic retinoids. Expression of phosphorylated as well as total PKC was decreased by GF and this was potentiated by RA. In addition, treatment with GF caused a strong and sustained activation of ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK, as well as a weaker activation of JNK. Importantly, inhibition of ERK but not p38 or JNK suppressed apoptosis induced by RA+GF, indicating that activation of ERK is specifically required. In support of this novel finding, the ability of other PKC inhibitors to cause apoptosis in combination with RA correlates with ability to cause sustained activation of ERK."
https://openalex.org/W2040158378,"The Hodgkin cell line HD-MyZ is resistant to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). In the present work, we show that pretreatment with TNFα sensitized the cells to apoptosis induced by antineoplastic agents and ceramide. TNFα pretreatment resulted in enhanced cleavage and activity of caspase-3 upon addition of etoposide, epirubicin or ceramide. No caspase-8 activation was detectable, although caspase-8 could be activated in cell-free extracts. Inhibition of caspase-8 by z-IETD-fmk did not block the sensitizing effect of TNFα. Furthermore, exogenous ceramide, a mediator of TNFα signaling, could not substitute for TNFα in sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis. In contrast, we observed mitochondrial changes following cotreatment of cells with TNFα and drugs. Mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release and subsequent processing of caspase-9 preceded the onset of apoptosis, and were enhanced by TNFα pretreatment. Interestingly, although transcription factor NF-κB protected HD-MyZ cells from drug-induced apoptosis, TNFα-mediated sensitization was independent of NF-κB, since overexpressing a dominant-negative IκB mutant did not alter the TNFα effect. Sensitization for drug-induced apoptosis by TNFα was abrogated by Bcl-xL. Thus, the sensitizing effect of TNFα is mediated by the mitochondrial pathway and involves processing of caspase-2, -3 and -9, but appears to be independent of caspase-8 processing, Bid cleavage and NF-κB signaling. Therefore, sensitization by TNFα is mediated at least in part through different pathways, as reported for TRAIL. There, sensitization occurs through a FADD/caspase-8-dependent mechanism. Regarding TNFα, the sensitizing effect was also observed in myeloid leukemia cells. Therefore, TNFα or alternate molecules activating its pathways might be useful as sensitizers for chemotherapy in hematological malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1981646640,"In the majority of Ewing's family tumors, chromosomal translocation t(11;22) leads to aberrant fusion of RNA-binding protein EWS with DNA-binding ETS transcriptional factor Fli-1. EWS-Fli-1 has altered the transcriptional activity and modulating its downstream target genes through this transcriptional activity is thought to be responsible for this tumor. We have previously shown that both EWS-Fli-1 and Fli-1 have antiapoptotic activity against several apoptotic inducers. Here, we show that the transcriptional activity of EWS-Fli-1 and Fli-1 is not essential for its antiapoptotic activity. We also demonstrate that EWS-Fli-1 and Fli-1 interact with CBP through its amino-terminal region and inhibit the CBP-dependent transcriptional activity of RXR. This activity appears to be independent of DNA-binding activity of EWS-Fli-1. Introduction of the dominant-negative form of CBP into Ewing's sarcoma cells sensitizes these cells against genotoxic or retinoic-acid induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the ability of EWS-Fli-1/Fli-1 to target transcriptional cofactor(s) and modulate apoptotic pathways may be responsible for its antiapoptotic and tumorigenic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2024754812,"The murine and human homologs of the zebrafish pescadillo protein (Pes1 and PES1, respectively) play important roles in ribosome biogenesis and DNA replication. We investigated the effect of Pes1 on the growth of mouse embryo (3T3-like) fibroblasts and conditionally immortalized human fibroblasts expressing the SV40 T antigen (AR5 cells). Increased expression of Pes1 causes transformation of mouse and human fibroblasts in culture (colony formation in soft agar). Although Pes1 can replace the SV40 T antigen in inducing colony formation in soft agar, it cannot substitute the T antigen in the immortalization of human fibroblasts, indicating that it distinguishes between the two functions. As the biological effects of Pes1 are similar to those of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), we investigated the interactions of Pes1 with IRS-1 itself and with the SV40 T antigen. The Pes1 protein (which localizes to the nuclei and nucleoli of cells) interacts with both IRS-1 and the SV40 T antigen, and markedly decreases the interaction of T antigen with p53. Taken together, these results suggest mechanisms for the ability of Pes1 to transform cells, and its failure to immortalize them."

To further study the role of Mitf in committing cells to the melanocyte lineage, we express Mitf in the cultured quail neuroretina cells. This leads to the induction of two types of pigmented cells: neural crest-derived melanocytes, according to their dendritic morphology, physiology, and gene expression pattern are observed together with pigmented epithelial RPE-like cells. The expression of Mitf is lower in pigmented epithelial RPE-like cells than in neural crest-derived melanocytes. Accordingly, overexpression of Mitf in cultured quail RPE causes cells to develop into neural crest-like pigmented cells.

In vertebrates, melanin is synthesized in a specialized lysosome-related organelle, the melanosome, by transmembrane glycoproteins of the tyrosinase family (1Raposo G. Marks M.S. Traffic. 2002; 3: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. 2001; 2: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These organelles are found in two types of cell: the neural crest-derived melanocytes (NC-M) 1The abbreviations used are: NC-M, neural crest-derived melanocytes; RPE, retinal pigmented epithelium; NR, neural retina; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The RPE is a monolayer of cuboidal pigmented cells, involved in the maintenance and function of the vertebrate eye. The RPE and neural retina (NR) are generated from common precursors derived from the proximal part of the budding neural epithelium that retains the capacity to transdifferentiate into each others cell type both in vivo and in vitro (3Martínez-Morales J.R.

Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). The neural crest is a transitory structure that arises from cells of the neuroepithelium as it folds to form the neural tube. Neural crest cells migrate from the neural tube to characteristic peripheral sites, giving rise to diverse cell types. These include melanocytes of the integument, iris, and inner ear (7LeDouarin N. Kalcheim C. The Neural Crest. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1999Crossref Google Scholar). Neural crest-derived cells do not overtly differentiate until after they disperse. Therefore, it is unclear whether the appearance of differentiated cells in a precise location is the result of the differential localization of developmentally distinct precursors or whether factors in these locations instruct developmentally multipotent precursors to adopt specific fates. It has been suggested that at least some neural crest cells become committed to these phenotypes via a series of developmental restrictions, which progressively limit their potential fates (8Henion P.D. Weston J.A. Development. 1997; 124: 4351-4359PubMed Google Scholar, 9Luo R. Gao J. Wehrle-Haller B. Henion P.D.

Clonal analysis of randomly labeled neural crest cells indicated that c-Kit-expressing cells are fate-restricted melanocyte precursors (9Luo R. Gao J. Wehrle-Haller B. Henion P.D. Development. 2003; 130: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, NC-M migrate along the dorsal-lateral pathway, through the space between the ectoderm and dermomyotome of the somite to give rise to the skin melanocytes. These c-Kit-expressing cells respond to the MGF (also known as Kit ligand or stem cell factor), which is required for normal migration and differentiation of melanocyte precursors (11Guo C.S.

In mammals, these cells also express the endothelin receptor B (ETRB). Spontaneous or experimental inactivation of the ETRB gene, as that expressing the endothelin 3 (EDN3) ligand, causes defects in body pigmentation and posterior gut innervations (14Baynash A.G.

In the avian embryo, ETRB starts to be expressed by premigratory neural crest cells. Cells traveling along the dorsal-lateral pathway down-regulate the ETRB gene and switch to express another subtype, EDNRB2 (16Lecoin L. Sakurai T. Ngo M.T. Abe Y. Yanagisawa M. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3024-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). EDN3, a potent mitogen for cultured quail neural crest cells, promotes their differentiation into melanocytes and stimulates EDNRB2 expression, whereas increasing the survival and proliferation of committed melanocytes and glial-melanocytic precursors (17Dupin E. Glavieux C. Vaigot P. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7882-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Other factors from the Wnt and BMP families are also involved in the lineage segregation of NC-M in avian embryos (18Jin E.J. Erickson C.A. Takada S. Burrus L.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). RPE and neural crest-derived melanocytes differ in several important ways. Neural crest-derived melanocytes, but not cuboidal RPE cells, show a dendritic morphology and play an essential role in the delivery of melanosomes to the surrounding keratinocytes (19King R.A. Hearing V.J. Creel D.J. Oetting W.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 4353-4392Google Scholar). The trafficking of melanosomes in the RPE and neural crest-derived melanocytes involves myosin VIIa and myosin Va, respectively (20Liu X. Ondek B. Williams D.S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Provance D.W. James T.L. Mercer J.A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). None of the growth factors required for NC-M development or their receptors are required for RPE differentiation, as shown by the normal eye phenotype of mutant mice (22Mackenzie M.A. Jordan S.A.

Additional NC-M-specific antigens have also been characterized. These include MelEM (25Nataf V. Mercier P. De Nechaud B. Guillemot J.C. Capdevielle J. Lapointe F. Le Douarin N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which encodes the α subunit of the glutathione S-transferase expressed in melanoblasts committed to produce black pigment (26Niwa T. Mochii M. Nakamura A. Shiojiri N. Mech Dev. 2002; 118: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, MelEM is not found in the RPE (25Nataf V. Mercier P. De Nechaud B. Guillemot J.C. Capdevielle J. Lapointe F. Le Douarin N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mice that bear severe mutations in the Mitf gene are completely unpigmented and deaf, because they lack neural crest-derived melanocytes (27Jackson I.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 189-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This shows that Mitf function is required very early in the development of the melanocyte lineage (28Opdecamp K. Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Hodgkinson A.C. Pavan W.J. Arnheiter H. Development. 1997; 124: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice are also microphthalmic because of the abnormal development of the RPE, which appears unpigmented and often pluristratified (23Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Chen C.C. Opdecamp K. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Mech. Dev. 1998; 70: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29Bumsted K.M. Barnstable C.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 903-908PubMed Google Scholar). Mitf encodes the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper family. Mitf is expressed as multiple isoforms termed Mitf-M, Mitf-A, Mitf-D, Mitf-C, and Mitf-H (30Udono T. Yasumoto K. Takeda K. Amae S. Watanabe K. Saito H. Fuse N. Tachibana M. Takahashi K. Tamai M. Shibahara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mitf-M expression is restricted to neural crest-derived melanocytes, whereas Mitf-A is strongly expressed in the RPE (31Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). In line with these observations, Mitf activates the promoter regions of genes involved in terminal differentiation of pigmented cells, including the genes encoding the melanosome glycoprotein QNR71, the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (Tyr), and the tyrosinase-related proteins TRP-1 and TRP-2, by specifically binding to the hexameric motif CATGTG (M-box) present in all these promoters (reviewed in Ref. 31Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Mitf is one of the targets of the signaling cascade initiated by the c-Kit tyrosine kinase (31Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Kit promoter has been shown to be directly regulated by Mitf in mast cells (32Tsujimura T. Morii E. Nozaki M. Hashimoto K. Moriyama Y.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), can result in pigmentation defects (Waardenburg syndromes 1 to 4). Mitf is therefore one of the most important transcription factors governing the development and differentiation of pigment cells in vertebrates. However, its role in the commitment to the melanocyte lineage is unclear because melanoblasts containing Mitf mRNA can appear and survive for 48 h in the absence of a functional Mitf protein (35Hornyak T.J. Hayes D.J. Chiu L.Y. Ziff E.B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Opdecamp K. Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Hodgkinson A.C. Pavan W.J. Arnheiter H. Development. 1997; 124: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that ectopic expression of Mitf led to the appearance of pigmented foci from neuroretina cells (6Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). This study showed that both RPE-like epithelial foci and NC-M-like dendritic foci were produced. NC-M-like cells were MelM-, Steel-, Kit-, Pax3-, and EDNRB2-positive. Their proliferation and pigmentation increased following the addition of EDN3 to the cultures. RPE-like foci expressed lower levels of Mitf protein than NC-M-like foci. To demonstrate that a high level of Mitf could induce an NC-M-like phenotype in RPE, we overexpressed Mitf-M in cultured RPE cells. We observed that Mitf expression, a dendritic morphology, increased pigmentation and MelM staining. We propose that Mitf is probably involved in a common developmental event that precedes cell fate specification and can induce the genesis of RPE- or NC-M-like pigmented cells depending on the level of Mitf protein synthesized in neuroepithelial cells. Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—Dissociated neuroretina cells obtained from 6-day-old quail embryos were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's, F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% minimal essential medium vitamins 100 times, and 10 μg/ml conalbumin (6Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). The pigmented retinal epithelium was dissected from 7-day-old quail embryos. The transfected cells were passaged one time on gelatin-coated dishes (100 mm diameter) and grown for 1 month in medium containing G418 (300 μg/ml) before testing. The pigmentation usually became apparent 10 days after selection. The LE-Mitf-M vector was described previously (36Turque N. Denhez F. Martin P. Planque N. Bailly M. Begue A. Stehelin D. Saule S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3338-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Mitf-A and Mift-M isoforms were inserted into the pVNC3 vector for comparison. The LE and pVNC3 vectors were similarly efficient. Construction of EGFP Fusion Proteins—To visualize Mitf proteins, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, Clontech) was fused to Mitf. The following plasmids were constructed: a BglII-NotI fragment of EGFP was inserted into pVNC3 at the BglII and Bsp120I sites to produce pVNC3EGFP. A 1299-nucleotide XbaI-SalI fragment of Mitf-M was inserted into the XbaI-SalI sites of pVNC3EGFP to give pVNC3Mitf-M-EGFP, with the GFP in-frame with Mitf. To quantify the GFP signal in the Mitf-M-EGFP-expressing cells, fluorescent signals from dendritic or epithelial cell nuclei were captured with a 5-MHz Micromax 1300Y interline CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (Roper Instruments, France) as 16-bit images using identical parameters. The fluorescence content of each nucleus was calculated with the help of the integrated morphometry analysis option of the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) and plotted for each focus. Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with a polyclonal anti-MITF antiserum (6Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar) or with anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary reagent (Jackson ImmunoResearch). c-Kit-expressing cells were detected as described in Ref. 9Luo R. Gao J. Wehrle-Haller B. Henion P.D. Development. 2003; 130: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar using a monoclonal antibody kindly provided by B. Wehrle-Haller. Electron Microscopy—Transfected cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Cells were post-fixed with 2% OsO4 for 60 min, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and then observed under a Philips CM120 Electron Microscope (FEI Company, Eindoven, The Netherlands). In Situ Hybridization—Riboprobes were prepared by in vitro transcription of appropriate plasmids using either T3 or T7 polymerase and incorporation of digoxygenin-labeled UTP. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was performed as described in Ref. 33Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar. The EDNRB2 probe was kindly provided by L. Lecoin. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Assays—Total RNAs were extracted using the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method and then incubated with RQ1 DNase. Total RNA (2–4 μg) was incubated with random hexamer oligonucleotides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or oligo(dT) for 10 min at 70 °C. Murine Moloney leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase was added in the appropriate buffer to a final volume of 20 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 42 °C. After dilution to 100 μl, a 2-μl aliquot was mixed with 0.5 units of Taq polymerase Goldstar (Eurogentec), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μm of each oligonucleotide, and 0.25 mm dNTP in the appropriate buffer and submitted to PCR amplification in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler with the oligonucleotides described in Table I.Table IPrimers used in reverse transcriptase-PCR to detect melanocyte-expressed genesGene (Quail)PositionSequence (5′→3′)Steel562-591CCAGAGAATGATTCCAGAGTCGCTGTCACA817-846CTGCCAGTACATGAAACAGTGTTGc-Kit2492-2520TACACCTTCGAGAGTGATGTCTGGTCTTA2846-2872GCGTACCAGGAGGGGCTGAGTAGATGAEDNRB2953-972TGGTGATCTTCGCACTCTGC1289-1308GGAAGAGCTGTACTTGTTGCPax319-55GATGACCACGCTGGCCGGGGCCGTGCCCAGGATGAT619-654CTGGTTCAGAATCGATATCAGAGCCTTCATCAGACT Open table in a new tab Expression of Mitf in Quail Neuroretina Cells Induces Two Types of Pigmented Foci—Overexpression of the melanocytic isoform of Mitf (Mitf-M) in neuroretina cells is sufficient to induce a pigmented phenotype, suggesting that the protein encoded can activate the genetic network that triggers RPE transdifferentiation alone (6Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar, 37Martinez-Morales J.R. Dolez V. Rodrigo I. Zaccarini R. Leconte L. Bovolenta P. Saule S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21721-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mitf could also induce a neural crest-derived melanocyte phenotype, we stably transfected dissociated cells derived from E6 quail NR with the Mitf-M vector. Cells were also transfected with a vector containing one of the retina Mitf isoforms, Mitf-A (38Amae S. Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Sato S. Yajima I. Yamamoto H. Udono T. Durlu Y.K. Tamai M. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or with the empty vector as a control. After G418 selection, pigmented foci were visible only in Mitf-M- and Mitf-A-transfected cells. Two types of pigmented foci were observed in the Mitf-M-transfected plates: foci with a dendritic appearance (Fig. 1B) and foci with an epithelial morphology (Fig. 1A). Immunocytochemistry detected Mitf in cell nuclei from pigmented foci with a dendritic appearance (Fig. 1D), but detected only a faint signal in the nuclei of epithelial RPE-like cells (Fig. 1C). All the foci that expressed Mitf were pigmented. Half of the foci in the Mitf-M-transfected cells and three foci in the Mitf-A-transfected cells were of dendritic appearance. Analysis of ultrathin sections of these cells embedded in Epon revealed that epithelial cells bore a homogeneous population of round melanosomes (Fig. 1E), whereas the dendritic cells exhibited heterogeneous melanosomes with a characteristic elliptical morphology at distinct stages of maturation (Fig. 1F), which were significantly smaller than those from epithelial cells. Dendritic Pigmented Foci Express Neural Crest-derived Melanocyte Markers—We then asked whether the induction of the dendritic appearance of the pigmented foci was accompanied by the expression of neural crest-specific markers in these cells. We first tested the expression of the MelEM antigen in these cells. As previously reported, the RPE cells were negative for MelEM staining (25Nataf V. Mercier P. De Nechaud B. Guillemot J.C. Capdevielle J. Lapointe F. Le Douarin N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas the choroidal melanocytes, present in this culture of quail RPE cells and easily recognized by their dendritic morphology, were strongly labeled (Fig. 2, A and B). Dendritic foci of transfected QNR cells (Fig. 2C) expressing high levels of Mitf (Fig. 2E) were immunostained with anti-MelEM (Fig. 2G). The pigmented foci with an RPE-like morphology (Fig. 2D) were negative for MelEM (Fig. 2H). We subsequently tested for several neural crest melanocyte-specific markers: growth factors (Steel), growth factor receptors (c-Kit and EDNRB2), and the transcription factor Pax3. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments performed on RNA extracted from the G418-selected Mitf-M-transfected NR cells revealed a specific band with all of the primers used (data not shown). To demonstrate that these genes were specifically expressed in the pigmented foci, we also performed in situ hybridization with digoxygenin-labeled RNA probes onto photobleached foci. This allowed clear detection of the hybridization signal in the cells. The probes derived from the fragments cloned from the reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments detected Steel/MGF RNA (Fig. 3A), EDNRB2 RNA (Fig. 3B), and Pax3 RNA (Fig. 3, C and D, and the Mitf Pax3 plate for a low magnification view of the transfected plate) in the cells of pigmented foci. Non-pigmented G418-resistant foci were negative for these RNAs (data not shown and control plate for Pax3 probe). Panels E and F of Fig. 3 show the Mitf signals in dendritic and epithelial foci, respectively.Fig. 3Expression of neural crest-specific genes in the pigmented G418-resistant QNR cells transfected with the Mitf-encoding vector. Low magnification view of QNRE6 cultures transfected with the empty vector and G418 selected (control), or transfected with Mitf-M and G418 selected.

G and H, a region of living cells immunolabeled with anti-c-Kit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If Steel autocrine regulation was involved in the formation of neural crest-like pigmented foci in response to Mitf, we should be able to detect the c-Kit receptor in these cells. We found that a significant number of pigmented cells were labeled by a monoclonal antibody raised against a peptide within the extracellular domain of c-Kit (9Luo R. Gao J. Wehrle-Haller B. Henion P.D. Development. 2003; 130: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, G and H). A few non-pigmented cells, close to the pigmented foci, were also labeled, but no labeled cells were found in the RPE-like pigmented foci (data not shown). Biological Activity of EDN3—As EDNRB2 was expressed in the dendritic foci of pigmented cells, we asked whether these cells could respond to the addition of EDN3 to the culture medium, as shown for cultured skin-derived pigment cells (17Dupin E. Glavieux C. Vaigot P. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7882-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The addition of 100 nm EDN3 to the culture medium of the G418-resistant foci resulted in a clear increase in the size and the pigment content of the selected foci, but not in the number of pigmented foci (compare Fig. 4A, Mitf with and without EDN3). EDN3 did not induce any pigmentation in control cells transfected with the NeoR-expressing control vector (Fig. 4A, control). To demonstrate that EDN3 increased pigment cell proliferation, we performed a BrdUrd incorporation assay in Mitf-M-transfected cells, with and without EDN3 in the culture medium. In the cells cultured without EDN3, very few nuclei were detected (see arrow, Fig. 4B) and double labeling showed that these cells contained Mitf (Fig. 4D, F, is a merge of B and D). In contrast, in the presence of EDN3, most, if not all, of the Mitf-positive nuclei (Fig. 4E) incorporated BrdUrd (Fig. 4C, G is a merge of C and E). We concluded that the expression of EDNRB2 in Mitf-transfected neuroretina cells is connected to a functional downstream transduction pathway, leading to melanocyte-like proliferation. Quantification of MITF in Pigmented Foci of Quail Neuro-retinaCells—Immunodetection experiments (Figs. 1C and 2D) showed that less Mitf accumulated in the pigmented foci of epithelial appearance than in the dendritic foci. It was not possible to use biochemical techniques to quantify Mitf in the different types of pigmented cells because of the low number of cells present in the foci and the difficulty involved in obtaining pure populations of the two pigmented cell types simultaneously present in every transfected culture. Therefore, to observe the Mitf proteins directly in the nuclei, we used an expression vector encoding the Mitf-M-EGFP fusion protein. This fusion protein activated the QNR-71 promoter as efficiently as did the wild-type form (data not shown) and induced a similar number of pigmented foci in the transfected QNR cells following G418 selection, suggesting that the chimeric protein is fully active (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the GFP signal present in the nucleus, which directly reflects the amount of Mitf protein, could be quantified by use of the integrated morphometry analysis option of the Metamorph software. We recovered the GFP fluorescence of each cell making distinct dendritic or epithelial foci and plotted the fluorescence intensity of each individual nucleus in each pigmented foci. The GFP signal was on average 2-fold (up to 10-fold) higher in the cells making dendritic foci than in the cells of epithelial morphology (Fig. 5B). Representative pigmented foci with dendritic and epithelial morphology are shown in Fig. 5C (panels a and c, respectively), together with the corresponding GFP signal (panels b and d, respectively). Conversion of RPE Cells into NC-M by Mitf—Following the hypothesis that the amount of Mitf determines the type of pigmented cell, we reasoned that the expression of Mitf in RPE epithelial cells would convert these cells into a neural crest-like phenotype. We transfected cells with a Mitf-M-encoding vector, and then selected transfected cells. Cultured RPE cells became depigmented and did not exhibit any Mitf staining. In contrast, pigmented cells containing the Mitf protein (Fig. 6, B and F) were apparent in the transfected culture (Fig. 6, A and E) and were positive for MelEM immunostaining (Fig. 6, D and H). G418-selected cells transfected with an empty control vector did not exhibit such pigmented foci. However, when these control cells were maintained at confluency for several days, they recovered both pigmentation and epithelial morphology. Therefore, expression of Mitf in a differentiated RPE cell is sufficient to trigger NC-M differentiation. Genetic and molecular analyses in different species have shown that Mitf has a key function in the development of melanin-producing cells, including the RPE (31Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Mitf is therefore one of the most important transcription factors governing the development and differentiation of the pigment cells in vertebrates. However, its role in the commitment to the melanocyte lineage is unclear because melanoblasts containing Mitf mRNA can appear and survive for 48 h in the absence of a functional MITF protein, as shown in the mi mutant (28Opdecamp K. Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Hodgkinson A.C. Pavan W.J. Arnheiter H. Development. 1997; 124: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hornyak T.J. Hayes D.J. Chiu L.Y. Ziff E.B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Several other factors required for pigment cell development have been also described based on the phenotypes of mutants. All these factors, which are important at distinct steps of melanocyte development, form a biochemical cascade that ultimately modulates Mitf function (31Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Gain of function studies in avian NR cultures have shown that Mitf-M is sufficient to induce a pigmented phenotype in transfected cells (6Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). Morphological examination revealed two types of pigmented foci. They could be distinguished by the shape of the cells: RPE-like epithelial cells and dendritic cells, reminiscent of the neural crest-derived melanocytes. Very few foci contained both types of cell. Immunodetection of antigens expressed in neural crest melanocytes (c-Kit receptor and MelEM), and in situ hybridization (Steel/MGF, EDNRB2, Pax3) or reverse transcriptase-PCR (not shown) detection of neural crest-specific gene expression, allowed us to demonstrate a neural crest-like pigment cell transdifferentiation in the culture. In addition, we observed that the addition of EDN3 to the culture medium of the Mitf-transfected neuroretina increased both pigment cell proliferation and pigmentation, as already shown for neural crest-derived melanocytes (17Dupin E. Glavieux C. Vaigot P. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7882-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, either multipotent precursors that can differentiate into a neural crest phenotype in response to Mitf exist in the culture, or Mitf is able to trigger the transdifferentiation of neuroretina cells into melanocytic neural crest cells. Multipotent precursors have been found in the ciliary margin of the retina (39Fischer A.J. Reh T.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and glial cells can produce neuronal cells in vivo (40Fischer A.J. Reh T.A. Glia. 2003; 43: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but no differentiation in the neural crest phenotype has been reported so far. Bipotent glial/melanogenic intermediates, cells with latent melanogenic potential, are present in embryonic quail peripheral nerves. Transdifferentiation of these cells into pigment cells could be observed following treatment with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester drug (41Sherman L. Stocker K.M. Morrison R. Ciment G. Development. 1993; 118: 1313-1326PubMed Google Scholar) or EDN3 (42Dupin E. Real C. Glavieux-Pardanaud C. Vaigot P. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5229-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Dupin et al. (42Dupin E. Real C. Glavieux-Pardanaud C. Vaigot P. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5229-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we observed no pigmentation induction in control cells grown in the presence of EDN3, and no MelEM (which labels early NC-derived melanoblasts (43Dupin E. Le Douarin N.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3016-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar))-positive cells were found in the cultured neuroretina prior to transfection (data not shown), suggesting that Mitf is essential for the induction of the pigmented phenotype. As we observed a 10-fold decrease in the number of pigmented foci when the neuroretina was taken from E7 instead of E6 embryos, we favor the hypothesis that Mitf has the potential to induce a transdifferentiated phenotype in undifferentiated neuroblasts. The pigmentation-inducing effect is not a property shared by many genes, as no pigmentation could be observed in NR cultures transfected with the erbB, ras, src, mil, fos, jun, erbA, ski, or E1A genes. However, we recently observed that Otx2-induced pigmented foci expressed Mitf (37Martinez-Morales J.R. Dolez V. Rodrigo I. Zaccarini R. Leconte L. Bovolenta P. Saule S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21721-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and that these Mitf-expressing foci exhibited both a dendritic cell morphology and MelEM staining (data not shown). The NR cells positive for the Mitf-A isoform also exhibited this particular phenotype, albeit at a much lower level than Mitf-M (only three MelEM-expressing foci were recovered after Mitf-A transfection). The two Mitf isoforms display different subcellular locations (44Mouriaux F. Vincent S. Kherrouche Z. Maurage C.A. Planque N. Monte D. Labalette P. Saule S. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); Mitf-A was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Therefore, the different efficiencies of the two Mitf isoforms may be because of the presence of less Mitf-A than Mitf-M in the nucleus. It is note-worthy that considerably less Mitf protein was found in the nuclei of the cells in the RPE-like foci after Mitf-M transfection than in the nuclei of the cells of the dendritic foci obtained in the same plate (as judged by the immunostaining signal intensity, and by measuring the GFP fluorescence fused to Mitf in a biologically active protein). Thus, the genes induced may depend on the amount of Mitf present in the nucleus. It remains possible that low concentrations of Mitf only activate genes involved in pigmentation (high affinity genes), resulting in the appearance of RPE-like cells, but that higher concentrations of Mitf also activate genes involved in neural crest melanocyte differentiation (low affinity genes). It has been demonstrated that E-box flanking sequences play an important role in Mitf recognition and subsequently in promoter activation (45Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-69388Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, an increase in Mitf concentration in RPE cells may well induce a NC-crest melanocyte phenotype in cells expressing only the high affinity targets. This was indeed observed after the introduction of a Mitf-M-encoding vector into pre-differentiated RPE cells. Mitf-induced pigmentation depends on cell type, as shown by in vivo Mitf expression in non-pigmented cells. It has recently been reported that medaka-ES-like cells (46Bejar J. Hong Y. Schartl M. Development. 2003; 130: 6545-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) differentiate into melanocytes in response to this factor. Our data support the hypothesis that Mitf is a master developmental regulator gene, sufficient to initiate and to complete the differentiation of neuroretina cells into melanocytes. They also suggest that the possibility to reprogram neuroretina cells toward distinct differentiation pathways is greater than previously suspected. These findings make this in vitro culture system an attractive model that should provide more insights into this and other differentiation pathways. We thank Laure Lecoin for helpful discussions and for critical reading of the manuscript, and Fabrice Cordelières and the imaging facilities for the quantification of the GFP signal."
https://openalex.org/W2080726128,"The initiation of bud and hyphal growth in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans both involve polarized morphogenesis. However, there are many differences including the function of the septin proteins, a family of proteins involved in membrane organization in a wide range of organisms. Septins form a characteristic ring on the inner surface of the plasma membrane at the bud neck, whereas the septins are diffusely localized across emerging hyphal tips. In addition, septin rings are maintained at sites of septum formation in hyphae rather than being disassembled immediately after cytokinesis. The possibility that C. albicans septins are regulated by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO was examined in this study because the Saccharomyces cerevisiae septins were shown previously to be modified by SUMO (Smt3p). However, SUMO conjugation to septins was not detected during budding or hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans. These results are supported by the lack of conserved SUMO consensus motifs between septins from the two organisms even after adjusting the predicted Cdc3p and Cdc12p septin sequences to account for mRNA splicing in C. albicans. Interestingly, a homolog of the Smt3p SUMO was identified in the C. albicans genome, and an epitope tagged version of Smt3p was conjugated to a variety of proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis showed prominent Smt3p SUMO localization at bud necks and sites of septum formation in hyphae similar to the septins. However, Smt3p was primarily detected on the mother cell side of the septin ring. A subset of these Smt3p-modified proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the septin Cdc11p.

Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 11Kartmann B. Roth D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 839-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J.

Biol. 1999; 169: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The septins were originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as genes affecting cell cycle progression and cytokinesis (14Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 15Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). More recently, they have also been implicated in sporulation and mating pheromone-induced morphogenesis (16De Virgilio C. DeMarini D.J. Pringle J.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Fares H. Goetsch L. Pringle J.R. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One general function of the septins is to act as a scaffold to recruit other proteins to the bud neck including proteins required for chitin ring formation, a check-point for morphogenesis and cell size, regulation of cell cycle progression, and septum formation (10Gladfelter A.S. Pringle J.R. Lew D.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The septins can also act as boundary domains that restrict protein distribution between mother and daughter cells (21Takizawa P.A. DeRisi J.L. Wilhelm J.E. Vale R.D. Science. 2000; 290: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22Barral Y. Mermall V. Mooseker M.S. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The septins have been studied most extensively in S. cerevisiae, where they display distinct patterns of localization during vegetative growth and are often used as a spatial landmark for cell cycle progression (10Gladfelter A.S. Pringle J.R. Lew D.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 12Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. De Virgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In unbudded cells, five septins (Cdc3p, Cdc10p, Cdc11p, Cdc12p, and Sep7p/Shs1p) coalesce into a ring on the inner surface of the plasma membrane at the site where future bud emergence will occur. As budding progresses, the septin ring extends across the mother-bud junction and then appears to split into two rings as the septum forms between the mother and daughter. The septin rings disassemble rapidly after cytokinesis and reassemble at the site of the next bud emergence. An identical pattern of septin localization was observed during budding of C. albicans (9Warenda A.J. Konopka J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Gale C. Gerami-Nejad M. McClellan M. Vandoninck S. Longtine M.S. Berman J. Mol. Biol.

However, septins behave differently during filamentous growth of C. albicans. Rather than forming tight rings, they coalesce into a more diffuse structure at the base of emerging germ tubes and form a cap across growing hyphal tips (9Warenda A.J. Konopka J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Sudbery P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As the hypha matures, characteristic double rings do form at sites of septum formation. Significantly, these rings do not disassemble, as evidenced by the appearance of multiple septin rings along the length of a hypha, each marking a septation site. Septin protein abundance does not change significantly during budding or hyphal growth, indicating that their assembly and disassembly is regulated by other mechanisms. One possibility was suggested by the observation that three S. cerevisiae septins, Cdc3p, Cdc11p, and Sep7p/Shs1p, are modified by the Smt3p late in the budding cell cycle, at the G2/M transition (25Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Smt3p is a member of the SUMO family of small ubiquitin-like proteins that are conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins within the consensus sequence (I/L/V)KX(D/E) (27Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 28Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 29Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitin, SUMO does not promote protein degradation. Rather, it typically affects protein-protein interactions and subcellular distribution (27Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 28Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 29Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutant strain of S. cerevisiae in which the attachment sites in the septins were mutated to prevent sumoylation, septin ring disassembly was delayed, suggesting that SUMO modification affects septin ring stability (25Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was of interest to examine the role of SUMO for cytoplasmic proteins since most research to date has focused on the role of SUMO regulation of nuclear proteins. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether septin sumoylation contributed to the different pattern of septin localization and stability seen during budding versus hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans. Interestingly, septin sumoylation was not detected in C. albicans. However, a SUMO homolog is produced in C. albicans and localizes at septation sites as it does in S. cerevisiae (25Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This suggests that, despite the differences, there is a conserved function for SUMO at bud necks in these two species. Strains and Media—The yeast strains used in this study are described in Table I. Cells were propagated on YPD 1The abbreviations used are: YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein. media supplemented with 80 mg/liter uridine. For cell division arrest studies, cells were grown overnight to saturation and then diluted into fresh YPD plus uridine at a final concentration of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml. At mid-logarithmic phase, nocodazole was added to cultures at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml, and growth continued at 30 °C. After 3 h, 10 ml of culture with or without nocodazole addition were harvested, and the cell pellets were stored at -80 °C for Western blot analysis. The remaining culture was fixed for immunofluorescence by adding 1/10 volume of 37% formaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were induced to form hyphae by diluting fresh overnight cultures into YPD plus uridine containing 5% bovine calf albumin at 2 × 106 cells/ml and growing at 37 °C. 20 ml of culture were harvested at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min of hyphal growth for Western blot analysis.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeBWP17aWilson et al.

Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction and Integration—Plasmid pHA was constructed by inserting the triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope into the SacI (5′) and KasI (3′) sites of pREMI (9Warenda A.J. Konopka J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), excising green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the process. C. albicans septins were amplified from BWP17 genomic DNA and inserted into either the 5′ SmaI (CDC12), 5′ HindIII (CDC11), or 5′ SphI (CDC3, CDC10, and SEP7) sites and the 3′ SacI sites of pHA to create C-terminal fusions. Plasmids were linearized within the septin open reading frame by restriction enzyme digestion and then transformed into wild type BWP17, as previously described (30Wilson R.B. Davis D. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHA-SUMO was created by using PCR to amplify the open reading frame for C. albicans SMT3 and inserting it into the SacI (5′) and KasI (3′) sites of pREMI, thereby excising GFP. The triple-HA epitope was inserted into the SalI (5′) and SacI (3′) sites, creating an N-terminal fusion. The SMT3 promoter (∼500 bp sequence upstream of the initiator ATG) was amplified and inserted into the SphI (5′) and SalI (3′) sites. The plasmid was linearized within the SMT3 open reading frame with BspMI and transformed into BWP17, as described (30Wilson R.B. Davis D. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct genomic tagging of open reading frames with a GFP-URA3 cassette was carried out as previously described (31Gerami-Nejad M. Berman J. Gale C.A. Yeast. 2001; 18: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression vectors for the initial unspliced version of CDC3-HA (pET-CDC3-HA) and the full-length CDC3-HA in which the CDC3 open reading frame was adjusted to account for mRNA splicing (pET-CDC3-HA-corrected) were constructed using PCR amplification to create 5′ NcoI and 3′ SalI sites, which were used to clone the open reading frames into the pET-28a-c(+) vector. A SEP7-HA bacterial expression plasmid was constructed in a similar manner using 5′ NcoI and 3′ EcoRI sites. cDNA Cloning of CDC3—Septin cDNA was cloned by PCR using mRNA harvested from a logarithmic culture as a template in a rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach (32Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In particular, a SMART rapid amplification of cDNA ends cDNA amplification kit was used according to the manufacturer specifications (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR product was purified from a 0.7% agarose gel and inserted into SmaI-digested pBluescript-KS(+). DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism BigDye terminator kit according to manufacturer specifications (Applied Bioystems, Carson City, CA). Bacterial Production of Septin Proteins—pET-CDC3-HA, pET-CDC3-HA-corrected, and pET-SEP7-HA were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). Septin gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 mm for 2 h. Bacterial cells were lysed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5)) and analyzed on a Western blot. Immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblot Analysis—Yeast cell pellets were lysed by agitation with glass beads in 100 μl of lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin-A, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Studies performed in the presence or absence of n-ethylmaleimide to inhibit desumoylation showed very similar patterns of SUMO conjugation in total lysates, indicating that SUMO was not removed from most target proteins under the lysis conditions used. Lysates were centrifuged at low speed to remove glass beads and unbroken cells. Supernatants were diluted 1:1 with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot. For immunoprecipitation, monoclonal anti-HA antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Roche Applied Science), or polyclonal anti-Cdc11p antibodies were added to lysates, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein-A-Sepharose beads were added to anti-Cdc11p immunoprecipitations and allowed to incubate for an additional2hat4 °C. Beads were pelleted, washed three times in lysis buffer, reconstituted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for Western blot analysis. After separation on polyacrylamide gels, samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with either anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science), anti-GFP monoclonal antibody MAb3580 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), or polyclonal anti-Cdc11p (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted in a solution of 1% powdered milk in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using a SuperSignal West Dura kit as specified by the manufacturer (Pierce). Protein concentration of the cell lysates was assayed using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). GFP and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For septin localization studies, a strain expressing SEP7-GFP (Table I) was either grown to mid-log phase or induced to form hyphae as described above. Cell samples were then harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in H2O, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were prepared as described previously (33Pringle J.R. Adams A. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with formaldehyde, treated with zymolyase to remove the cell wall, attached to microscope slides, and then denatured with cold methanol and acetone. The slides were incubated with anti-HA antibodies diluted in a solution of 3% bovine serum albumen in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm KCl, and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)). Cells were then treated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Samples were photographed through an Olympus BH2 microscope using a Zeiss Axio Cam run by Openlab 3.0.8 software from Improvision. C. albicans Septins CDC3 and CDC12 Are Spliced—Comparison of the septin sequences revealed that the predicted C. albicans Cdc3p lacked the N-terminal ∼150 amino acids found in its S. cerevisiae homolog. However, a C-terminally tagged Cdc3-HA protein produced in C. albicans was ∼6 kDa larger than the bacterially produced form of Cdc3p-HA that initiated from the first ATG of the major open reading frame (Fig. 1). N-terminal protein sequencing demonstrated that the bacterially produced protein was not degraded (data not shown), suggesting that the C. albicans CDC3 open reading frame was longer than initially predicted. A portion of the missing N-terminal sequences appeared to be present in an open reading frame upstream of the predicted start site for the C. albicans CDC3. To determine whether the CDC3 open reading frame was extended by mRNA splicing, a cDNA clone of CDC3 was obtained using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”). DNA sequencing indicated that CDC3 mRNA was spliced in a manner that extended the open reading frame at the 5′ end by 50 codons (Fig. 2A). Donor and acceptor consensus splice sites were identified in the genome sequence at positions corresponding to the splice junction detected in the cDNA clone, revealing the presence of a 113-bp intron. Correction of the bacterial expression construct to include the N-terminal extension yielded a Cdc3p-HA that comigrated with the yeast form (Fig. 1). Thus, in contrast to its S. cerevisiae homolog, CDC3 is spliced in C. albicans. Inspection of the other C. albicans septin genes indicated that both CDC12 and SPR28 contained splicing consensus sites. The open reading frame for CDC12 is likely extended at the 5′ end by 31 codons after excision of a 150-bp intron (Fig. 2B). The predicted SPR28 splice sites are in the 5′-untranslated region such that its open reading frame should not be affected if mRNA splicing occurs. SEP7 Is Expressed in C. albicans and Localizes at Bud Necks and Hyphal Septae—Epitope-tagged versions of four C. albicans septins (Cdc3p-HA, Cdc10p-HA, Cdc11p-HA, and Cdc12p-HA) showed gel mobilities consistent with their predicted molecular weight. A fifth septin, Sep7p-HA, migrated ∼40 kDa higher than its predicted molecular mass of 76 kDa (Fig. 3A). Sep7p-HA produced in bacteria also migrated at an unusually high molecular weight (Fig. 3A). Similar unexpected gel mobility was also detected for Sep7-GFP, which was constructed independently by direct tagging of genomic SEP7 at the C terminus with GFP (see “Experimental Procedures”; data not shown). These data suggested that the primary structure of Sep7p caused the aberrant gel mobility. Consistent with this interpretation, Sep7p has an unusual amino acid composition relative to other C. albicans septins, including three stretches of six or more asparagines (see “Discussion”). Although bacterially produced Sep7p-HA exhibited unusually slow migration on polyacrylamide gels, it was still ∼10-kDa smaller than the yeast-produced protein (Fig. 3A). N-terminal protein sequencing indicated that the bacterially produced protein was not degraded (data not shown). One possibility is that Sep7p-HA gel mobility is modified by phosphorylation, although no cell cycle-regulated shift in mobility was observed for Sep7p-HA. Another possibility is that this minor difference is due to the deviation from the standard genetic code in C. albicans in which CUG codons code for serine instead of leucine (34Ohama T. Suzuki T. Mori M. Osawa S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nakase T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Santos M.A. Tuite M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The C. albicans and bacterially produced versions of Sep7p-HA are expected to differ at four positions. Perhaps these differences influence the structural properties that cause the aberrant mobility of Sep7p (see “Discussion”). To determine whether Sep7p localized to the same sites as other septins during budding and filamentous growth of C. albicans, a strain expressing the SEP7-GFP was observed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3B, Sep7p-GFP localized as distinct rings at the necks of budding cells in a pattern identical to that reported for other septins in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae (9Warenda A.J. Konopka J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Gladfelter A.S. Pringle J.R. Lew D.J. Curr. Opin.

In serum-induced hyphal cells, Sep7p-GFP localized as a band at the base of emerging germ tubes in 80% (n = 72) of cells examined (Fig. 3C). Later in hyphal growth, Sep7p-GFP localized as distinct rings at sites of septation in 92% (n = 100) of cells examined (Fig. 3D). Thus, Sep7p localizes in an identical pattern to other septins during filamentous growth (9Warenda A.J. Konopka J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Sudbery P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). C. albicans Septins Are Not Detectably Sumoylated during G2 Arrest—Because previous studies demonstrated that the S. cerevisiae Cdc3p could be sumoylated at four different sites in G2 (25Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we investigated whether C. albicans Cdc3p-HA was also sumoylated under the same conditions. To test this, a logarithmic culture was arrested with nocodazole for 3 h, and then cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot. SUMO is ∼10 kDa, and its conjugation to a target protein is readily detected by a gel mobility shift. Western blot analysis found no evidence for SUMO modification of Cdc3p-HA in nocodazole-arrested cells (Fig. 4A). As a control, we showed that sumoylation of Cdc11p was readily detectable from a nocodazole-arrested culture of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4B), in agreement with previous work. This indicates that the failure to detect sumoylation of C. albicans Cdc3p-HA was not due to an inability to detect SUMO modification. To test whether any of the other C. albicans septins is sumoylated in G2, Western blots were performed to analyze HA-tagged Cdc10p, Cdc11p, Cdc12p, and Sep7p from nocodazole-arrested cultures (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, and in contrast to S. cerevisiae, we did not detect gel mobility shifts large enough to be caused by SUMO for any of the septins tested, even upon overexposure of the blots. Control experiments to assess the sensitivity showed that septin proteins were readily detected on Western blots even after diluting the samples 1:500, indicating that SUMO modification on even a minor fraction of the protein would have been detected (data not shown). Consistent with our inability to detect SUMO modification of C. albicans septins, the SUMO sites used in S. cerevisiae septins are not conserved in the C. albicans homologs (see “Discussion”). C. albicans Septins Are Not Detectably Sumoylated during Hyphal Growth—SUMO modification of septins was next examined during hyphal growth to determine whether this could account for either the diffuse localization of septins at the base of the emerging germ tubes and across the growing hyphal tip or the greater stability of the septin rings at sites of septation in mature hyphae (9Warenda A.J. Konopka J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2732-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Sudbery P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For this analysis, a fresh overnight culture of cells expressing HA-tagged septins was induced with serum to form hyphae at 37 °C for times between 0 and 180 min that correspond to specific stages of hyphal growth and septin localization (Fig. 5). At 0 min, cells have not formed germ tubes, and septin localization was not detectable within the cell. At 30–60 min, most cells formed germ tubes with septins diffusely localized at the base and across the growing hyphal tip. After 90–120 min, most hyphae formed at least one septum marked by a distinct septin ring. By 180 min, mature hyphae with multiple septin rings, each marking a septation site, were present. Western blot analysis of extracts of the corresponding cells did not detect SUMO modification, as measured by gel mobility shift of any of the septins at any of the times examined (Fig. 5). Smaller gel mobility shifts were sometimes observed, particularly at lower exposures of the blots (not shown), suggesting that other modifications such as phosphorylation might occur. C. albicans Smt3p Is Produced and Localizes at the Bud Neck—The lack of detectable septin sumoylation led us to investigate whether SUMO protein was produced in C. albicans. A C. albicans homolog of SMT3, the S. cerevisiae gene encoding SUMO (36Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2046528239,"We have seen that protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is transiently translocated to the plasma membrane by carbachol stimulation of neuroblastoma cells. This is induced by the Ca2+ increase, and PKCα does not respond to diacylglycerol (DAG). The unresponsiveness is dependent on structures in the catalytic domain of PKCα. This study was designed to investigate if and how the kinase activity and autophosphorylation are involved in regulating the translocation. PKCα enhanced green fluorescent protein translocation was studied in living neuroblastoma cells by confocal microscopy. Carbachol stimulation induced a transient translocation of PKCα to the plasma membrane and a sustained translocation of kinase-dead PKCα. In cells treated with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, wild-type PKCα also showed a sustained translocation. The same effects were seen with PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCδ. Only kinase-dead and not wild-type PKCα translocated in response to 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. To examine whether autophosphorylation regulates relocation to the cytosol, the autophosphorylation sites in PKCα were mutated to glutamate, to mimic phosphorylation, or alanine, to mimic the non-phosphorylated protein. After stimulation with carbachol, glutamate mutants behaved like wild-type PKCα, whereas alanine mutants behaved like kinase-dead PKCα. When the alanine mutants were treated with 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, all cells showed a sustained translocation of the protein. However, neither carbachol nor GF109203X had any major effects on the level of autophosphorylation, and GF109203X potentiated the translocation of the glutamate mutants. We, therefore, hypothesize that 1) autophosphorylation of PKCα limits its sensitivity to DAG and 2) that kinase inhibitors augment the DAG sensitivity of PKCα, perhaps by destabilizing the closed conformation.

Only kinase-dead and not wild-type PKCα translocated in response to 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. To examine whether autophosphorylation regulates relocation to the cytosol, the autophosphorylation sites in PKCα were mutated to glutamate, to mimic phosphorylation, or alanine, to mimic the non-phosphorylated protein. After stimulation with carbachol, glutamate mutants behaved like wild-type PKCα, whereas alanine mutants behaved like kinase-dead PKCα. When the alanine mutants were treated with 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, all cells showed a sustained translocation of the protein. However, neither carbachol nor GF109203X had any major effects on the level of autophosphorylation, and GF109203X potentiated the translocation of the glutamate mutants. We, therefore, hypothesize that 1) autophosphorylation of PKCα limits its sensitivity to DAG and 2) that kinase inhibitors augment the DAG sensitivity of PKCα, perhaps by destabilizing the closed conformation. The protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; DOG, 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; KD, kinase-dead; WT, wild-type; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. isoforms constitute a family of closely related serine/threonine kinases that are involved in pathways regulating a large number of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, migration, and neuronal signaling. The PKC family is generally subgrouped in classical, novel, and atypical isoforms based on structural similarities and sensitivity to different activators. The classical PKCs (PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ) are regulated by both Ca2+ and by diacylglycerol (DAG), whereas the novel PKCs (PKCδ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ) are insensitive to Ca2+ and considered to be primarily regulated by DAG. Atypical PKCs (PKCι and -ζ) are neither affected by Ca2+ nor by DAG (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 3Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). When classical or novel PKCs are activated, they frequently translocate to the plasma membrane. The translocation is primarily mediated via two classes of PKC domains, C1 and C2 domains. These domains are targeted to the membrane by DAG and Ca2+, respectively. Structural and mutational analyses of PKCα in vitro have led to the proposal of a model in which an initial Ca2+ increase leads to the interaction of the PKCα C2 domain with Ca2+ and a loose binding of the enzyme to lipids. This interaction leads to a disruption of binding of the C2 domain to the C1a domain, which thereby becomes available for DAG and can be inserted into the membrane (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). According to this model the C1 domain is inaccessible for ligands unless the PKC structure has been at least partially loosened by the interaction of Ca2+ with the C2 domain. We have recently seen that the catalytic domain contributes to the inaccessibility of the C1 domain in the absence of Ca2+ (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a tethering of the C1a domain by the C2 domain is conceivably also dependent on intramolecular bindings that involve the catalytic domain. There are also other mechanisms that may contribute to the regulation of PKCα translocation. PKCα is frequently autophosphorylated on two C-terminal sites, the turn motif (Thr-638 in human PKCα) and the hydrophobic site (Ser-657 in human PKCα). The phosphorylation of these sites has been suggested to be part of the regular maturation process of PKC molecules. Newly synthesized PKC molecules are initially phosphorylated on a threonine residue in the activation loop, a step that is necessary for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Thereafter, the autophosphorylation sites are phosphorylated, completing the maturation of the enzyme (7Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 8Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the turn motif has been shown to be crucial for PKCβII (9Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) but not for PKCα (10Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) activity, whereas phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site is not required for PKC activity (11Bornancin F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation has also been suggested to be of importance for the stability of the PKC molecule (13Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32785-32788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There are also indications that autophosphorylation is a means to directly regulate PKC function. There are findings showing that kinase inhibition or mutation of an autophosphorylation site prolongs the plasma membrane localization of PKC (15Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Hashimoto N. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29054-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and a recent paper demonstrates that only non-phosphorylated PKCα activates phospholipase D1 (17Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (June 8): 35702-35708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A regulatory role for autophosphorylation is further supported by several studies showing that autophosphorylation is influenced by a number of exogenous stimuli (18Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29290-29298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Upla P. Marjomaki V. Kankaanpaa P. Ivaska J. Hyypia T. van der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, it is becoming clear that autophosphorylation of PKC can be a regulated event and that it has significant impact on PKC function. However, it is far from clear how autophosphorylation influences the properties of PKC. We have previously seen that the catalytic domain of PKCα limits the durability of its translocation upon carbachol stimulation and its sensitivity to DAG (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to raise the novel hypothesis that regulating the DAG sensitivity may be the mechanism whereby autophosphorylation influences PKC function. Our data demonstrate that this is indeed the case; autophosphorylation does act as a regulatory switch determining the DAG sensitivity of PKCα. Plasmids—Expression vectors encoding full-length PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδ, and kinase-dead PKCδ, all fused to EGFP, have previously been described (21Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Svensson K. Zeidman R. Trollér U. Schultz A. Larsson C.

PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ were mutated in the autophosphorylation sites using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers were designed to alter threonine or serine in the turn motif to glutamate (αT638E and ϵT710E) or alanine (αT638A and δS643A) and to alter serine in the hydrophobic site to glutamate (αS657E and ϵS729E) or alanine (αS657A and δS662A). Similarly, both autophosphorylation sites were mutated to glutamate (αEDM and ϵEDM) or alanine (αADM and δADM). The primers are listed in Table I. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that they contained the right mutation.Table IPrimers used to generate PKC constructsConstructPrimerPKCα-T638AGACAGCCCGTCTTAGCACCACCTGATCAGCTGGPKCα-T638EGGACAGCCCGTCTTAGAACCACCTGATCAGCTGGPKCα-S657AGTCTGATTTTGAAGGGTTCGCGTATGTCAACCCCCPKCα-S657ECCAGTCTGATTTTGAAGGGTTCGAGTATGTCAACCCCCPKCδ-S643AGGCGCGCCTCGCCTACAGCGACAAGAACCPKCδ-S662AGCATTCGCTGGCTTCGCCTTTGTGAACCCCPKCϵ-T710EGGGAAGAGCCGGTACTCGAGCTTGTGGACGAAGCPKCϵ-S729EGGAGGAATTCAAAGGTTTCGAGTACTTTGGTGAAGACCTGATGCC Open table in a new tab Confocal Microscopy of PKC Translocation—Cells were examined by confocal microscopy on the day after transfection. The coverslips were washed twice with buffer H (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSo4, 2.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and mounted on the heated stage of a Nikon microscope. The cells were examined with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system using a 60× lens (numerical aperture 1.4) with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and emission filter 515HQ30. Images were captured every 5 or 10 s, and five images were taken before the addition of one of the following: 1 mm carbachol, 100 or 5 μm 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DOG), or 2 μm GF109203X or Me2SO as a control. DOG and GF109203X were solubilized in Me2SO at 100 and 10 mm, respectively. Carbachol was solubilized in water. The final Me2SO concentration was 1.2 μl/ml for experiments with the combination of 100 μm DOG and 2 μm GF109203X and respective control. In other experiments the Me2SO concentration was lower. LaserPix software was used to analysis the fluorescence intensity in the cytosol. Because the cells changed shape during the experiment, only a limited section of the cytosol could be quantified. The area to be quantified was carefully chosen to not contain any plasma membrane or intracellular components throughout the entire experiment. The average of the intensities of the five images before the addition of stimulus was used as a base-line value and set to 100%. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-BE(2)C were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. For confocal imaging, cells were trypsinized and seeded with a density of 300,000 cells/35-mm cell culture dish on glass coverslips. 24 h after seeding, cells were transfected in serum-free medium with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.6 μg of DNA according to the supplier's protocol. For Western blot analysis, 100-mm cell dishes were seeded with 1.5 × 106 cells/dish and transfected with 9 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 4.8 μg of DNA. Western Blot—Transfected SK-N-BE(2)C cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 160 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing 40 μl/ml protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). For stimulation experiments, transfected cells were washed twice in buffer H and stimulated with 1 mm carbachol for different time periods or treated with 2 μm GF109203X or equal concentrations of Me2SO for 1 min before being lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on a 10% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For detection, membranes were incubated with polyclonal anti-phospho-PKCα/βII (1:1000), anti-phospho-PKC (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), or polyclonal anti-PKCα (1:200) (Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase was, thereafter, visualized using the SuperSignal system (Pierce) as substrate. The chemiluminescence was detected with a CCD camera (Fujifilm). Band intensities were analyzed with Lab Science software (Fujifilm) Inhibition of the Kinase Activity Makes PKCα Respond with a Sustained Translocation to the Plasma Membrane after Stimulation with Carbachol—We have previously seen that stimulation of SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells with the acetylcholine analogue carbachol gives rise to a transient translocation of PKCα (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relocation to the cytosol was dependent on the presence of the catalytic domain of PKCα. The isolated regulatory domain of PKCα responded with a sustained translocation upon carbachol stimulation. To explore whether inhibition of the catalytic activity of PKC influences the translocation of PKCα, SK-N-BE(2)C cells expressing PKCα-EGFP were treated with 2 μm GF109203X before stimulation with carbachol. The localization of PKCα-EGFP was thereafter examined by confocal microscopy. In cells pretreated with GF109203X for 30 s, there was an immediate and sustained translocation of PKCα-EGFP to the plasma membrane after stimulation with 1 mm carbachol (Fig. 1, B, E, and H). This contrasts the effect in control cells pretreated with Me2SO, in which stimulation with carbachol gave a transient membrane translocation of PKCα-EGFP (Fig. 1, A, D, and G). The effect of GF109203X led us to hypothesize that the kinase activity of PKCα suppresses its plasma membrane localization and leads to a relocation of the protein to the cytosol. To further investigate the role of the kinase activity, the translocation of a kinase-dead PKCα-EGFP, i.e. PKCα with a mutation of Lys-368 in the ATP-binding site to an arginine, was investigated. This PKCα mutant responded with a translocation that was sustained upon carbachol stimulation (Fig. 1, C, F, and I). To estimate the time course of the translocation, the fluorescence intensity of EGFP in the cytosol was quantified. Because the cells change their shape during the experiment, it was impossible to quantify the intensity in the plasma membrane and only possible to quantify a limited section of the cytosol in each cell. These areas were carefully chosen not to contain any plasma membrane or nuclear components during the entire time course of the experiment. The analysis confirmed that PKCαWT-EGFP pretreated with GF109203X and that the kinase inactive variant PKCαKD-EGFP responded with a sustained translocation after carbachol stimulation, whereas carbachol induced a transient translocation of PKCαWT-EGFP to the plasma membrane in cells pretreated with Me2SO (Fig. 1, J and K). Treatment with the PKC Inhibitor GF109203X after a Period of Stimulation with Carbachol Induces a Relocation of PKCα to the Plasma Membrane—Pretreatment with GF109203X suppressed the relocation of PKCα-EGFP to the cytosol after a carbachol-stimulated plasma membrane translocation. We next wanted to investigate whether GF109203X also could reverse the relocation to the cytosol once it had occurred. To do this, SK-N-BE(2)C cells expressing PKCα-EGFP were stimulated with carbachol, and after the translocation, when PKCα-EGFP had returned to the cytosol, 2 μm GF109203X was added (Fig. 2). Stimulation with carbachol led to a translocation of PKCα-EGFP to the membrane within 10 s (Fig. 2, A and B), and when the protein had returned to the cytosol after 90 s (Fig. 2C), GF109203X was added to the cells. This induced a re-translocation of PKCα-EGFP to the plasma membrane, where it also remained throughout the rest of the experiment (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCδ Kinase Activity Leads to a Sustained Translocation of the Proteins to the Plasma Membrane after Stimulation with Carbachol—We have previously seen that carbachol induces a transient translocation to the plasma membrane of PKCβII and to a lesser extent of PKCδ and a sustained translocation of PKCϵ in neuroblastoma cells (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate if kinase inhibition also influences the translocation of other PKC isoforms, SK-N-BE(2)C cells expressing PKCβI, PKCβII, or PKCδ fused to EGFP were treated with 2 μm GF109203X and thereafter stimulated with carbachol. The localization of EGFP-tagged PKC isoforms was thereafter followed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). As seen before, carbachol elicited a transient translocation of PKCβI and PKCβII, and this response was not altered by pretreatment with vehicle, Me2SO. On the other hand, exposure to GF109203X made both PKCβ isoforms respond with a sustained translocation after carbachol stimulation, although in a few cells a small amount of PKCβII relocated to the cytoplasm. The novel isoform PKCδ showed a weaker response to carbachol stimulation, and some cells did not respond at all. However, treatment with GF109203X before stimulation with carbachol potentiated the magnitude of the PKCδ translocation. To further investigate the contribution of kinase inhibition to the response, the carbachol-stimulated translocation of kinase-dead PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCδ was also analyzed. The kinase-dead PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCδ all responded to carbachol and translocated to the plasma membrane and remained there throughout the experiment. Although full-length PKCδ sometimes did not respond to carbachol, kinase-dead PKCδ translocated in all cells. The results were supported by a quantification of the fluorescence intensity of EGFP in the cytoplasm. Thus, a potentiation and prolonging of a translocation by kinase inhibition is an effect that is common for several PKC isoforms. Stimulation with Carbachol Leads to a Sustained Translocation of Non-phosphorylated PKCα—The potentiating effect of kinase inhibition on PKC translocation has previously been observed (15Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Hashimoto N. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29054-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and this has raised the hypothesis that autophosphorylation of PKC would be a negative feed-back signal and lead to a relocation of the protein to the cytosol. We, therefore, set out to investigate if the effects obtained by kinase inhibition could be due to absent autophosphorylation. The C-terminal autophosphorylation sites, the turn motif (PKCαThr-638) and the hydrophobic site (PKCαSer-657), were therefore mutated to alanines or glutamates to mimic the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated states, respectively. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding PKCαWT-EGFP, PKCαKD-EGFP, and constructs encoding PKCα with mutated autophosphorylation sites. Cells were stimulated with 1 mm carbachol, and the localization of the PKCα variants was examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). Wild-type PKCα and the glutamate mutants (PKCαT638E, PKCαS657E, and PKCαEDM, the mutant with both sites mutated) all either responded with a transient translocation to the plasma membrane or did not respond at all. There were some variations in terms of the proportion of cells in which PKCα translocated, but a sustained translocation was not observed except for two cells expressing PKCαS657E. On the other hand, in 100% of the cells that expressed the kinase-dead construct, PKCαKD, carbachol induced a sustained translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane. The same effect was also seen for PKCαADM, a mutant where both autophosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine and, thus, mimicked the non-phosphorylated PKCα. PKCα mutated to alanine either in turn motif, PKCαT638A, or hydrophobic site, PKCαS657A, consistently responded to carbachol, and translocated to the plasma membrane after stimulation. Contrasting the glutamate mutants and wild-type PKCα, a sustained translocation of these mutants was frequently observed, but unlike PKCαADM these mutants, sometimes returned to the cytosol after stimulation with carbachol. Thus, autophosphorylation of the hydrophobic site and the turn motif conceivably contributes to the transient nature of PKCα translocation. However, mutation of the autophosphorylation sites to glutamate does not make PKCα resistant to translocation signals. Mutation of the Autophosphorylation Sites in PKCδ and PKCϵ Do Not Alter Their Sensitivity to Carbachol—We have previously seen that PKCϵ responds with a sustained translocation and that PKCδ responds with a weak and transient translocation upon carbachol stimulation (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see if the effect of autophosphorylation influences the responsiveness of these isoforms as well, we created vectors encoding PKCδ with both autophosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (PKCδADM) and PKCϵ with both sites mutated to glutamate (PKCϵEDM). However, the mutations did not augment the weak response of PKCδ or suppress the sustained PKCϵ response (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to PKCα, the sensitivity of PKCδ and PKCϵ to carbachol-generated second messengers is not regulated by autophosphorylation. Neither Carbachol nor GF109203X Has Major Effects on the Amount of Autophosphorylated PKCα—The previous experiments could have the implication that autophosphorylation of PKCα upon its activation at the plasma membrane is a mechanism to cause its relocation to the cytosol and thereby to turn off the PKC signal. If this hypothesis is true, it would be expected that the levels of autophosphorylation would increase after carbachol stimulation and decrease by treatment with GF109203X. We, therefore, analyzed by Western blots the levels of phosphorylation of the turn motif and the hydrophobic site. Stimulation of cells with carbachol for different time points did not have a major impact on the phosphorylation of either the hydrophobic site (Fig. 5A) or the turn motif (Fig. 5B). There was a slight tendency to increased phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site. The same result was obtained when the phosphorylation of overexpressed PKCα-EGFP was analyzed (data not shown). Thus, carbachol does not increase the autophosphorylation, and this is, therefore, not likely the mechanism that triggers a relocation of PKCα to the cytosol during carbachol stimulation. Similarly, we wanted to investigate whether treatment with GF109203X affected the phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with 2 μm GF109203X did not decrease the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylation of the turn motif (Fig. 5D) was elevated in the presence of Me2SO, but it was clear that GF10203X did not influence the phosphorylation. The same pattern of GF109203X effect was seen when analyzing phosphorylation of PKCα-EGFP (data not shown). We also investigated the autophosphorylation of kinase-dead PKCα and the PKCα variants with autophosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (Fig. 5, E and F). As expected, both kinase-dead PKCα and the alanine double mutant were devoid of phosphate on the two autophosphorylation sites, whereas wild-type PKCα was phosphorylated on both sites. The S657A mutant was at least partially phosphorylated on Thr-638, whereas the Thr-638 was phosphorylated on neither site, confirming previous results with PKCβII, which shows that phosphorylation of the turn motif is a prerequisite for phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site (9Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PKCα with Autophosphorylation Sites Mutated to Glutamate Responds to Carbachol with a Sustained Translocation when Pretreated with GF109203X—The Western blot analyses demonstrated that GF109203X does not influence the autophosphorylation of PKCα, suggesting that an inhibition of autophosphorylation is not the mechanism through which GF109203X potentiates the translocation of PKCα. To further confirm that the GF109203X effect is independent of the phosphorylation status of the turn motif and the hydrophobic site, we investigated the effect of GF109203X on the translocation of PKCα with both sites mutated to glutamate. Stimulation with carbachol induced an immediate translocation of PKCαEDM to the plasma membrane followed by relocation to the cytosol (Fig. 6, A, D, and G), and this was not influenced by Me2SO (Fig. 6, B, E, and H). On the other hand, pre-exposure to 2 μm GF109203X (Fig. 6, C, F, and I) made PKCαEDM respond with a sustained translocation upon carbachol stimulation. Thus, the GF109203X-induced block of PKCα relocation to the cytosol also takes place when the turn motif and hydrophobic site are mutated to glutamate, mimicking the phosphorylated state. Inhibition of the Catalytic Activity Makes PKCα Sensitive to Diacylglycerol—The previously mentioned experiments indicate that autophosphorylation does not make PKCα resistant to receptor-stimulated translocation in general. We, therefore, hypothesized that kinase inhibitors and reduced autophosphorylation may make PKCα sensitive to DAG. We have previously seen that carbachol induces a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and a sustained increase in DAG (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that PKCα is insensitive to DAG (Fig. 7, A and B). An increased sensitivity to DAG may, therefore, explain the observed findings with kinase inhibition. To investigate this we pretreated cells with 2 μm GF109203X for 30 s and thereafter stimulated them with 100 μm DOG. This led to a sustained translocation of PKCα-EGFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7, C and D). DOG did not induce translocation of PKCα when cells were pretreated with Me2SO (data not shown). Similar to what was obtained when PKCαWT was pretreated with GF109203X, 100 μm DOG induced a rapid and sustained translocation of PKCαKD-EGFP to the membrane (Fig. 7, G and H). Both PKCαWT in the presence of GF109203X (Fig. 7, E and F) and PKCαKD (Fig. 3, I and J) also responded to 5 μm DOG. PKCαKD responded to DOG within a few seconds, whereas PKCαWT, inhibited with GF109203X, had a slower response to DOG. This was particularly evident when 5 μm DOG was used. PKCα with Autophosphorylation Sites Mutated to Alanine Is Sensitive to DAG—Because treatment with DOG induced a translocation of kinase-inactive PKCα, but not of wild-type PKCα, to the plasma membrane, we next wanted to investigate if DOG had an effect on the PKCα mutants in which the autophosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine (Fig. 8). In a majority of the cells, PKCαT638A and PKCαS657A both started to translocate within 1 min to the plasma membrane, where they remained throughout the entire experiment. Nearly 100% of the cells responded to the stimulation with 5 μm DOG. PKCαADM responded with an immediate translocation in almost all cells, and this also persisted throughout the experiment. This study reports a novel role for PKCα autophosphorylation as a regulatory switch determining the DAG sensitivity of PKCα. We, therefore, propose a model in which the V5 domain participates in intramolecular interactions that maintain an inaccessibility of the C1a domain of PKCα to DAG. The interaction is dependent on autophosphorylation and can also be disrupted by direct interactions with PKC inhibitors such as GF109203X. Our initial experiments demonstrated that inhibition of PKCα either with application of GF109203X or by a kinase-inactivating mutation of the ATP-binding site resulted in a sustained translocation upon carbachol stimulation. The results may be explained by a model in which an activation of PKCα results in autophosphorylation, which in turn induces a relocation of PKCα to the cytosol. This could function as a negative feedback signal to turn off the activated PKCα. Such a hypothesis is supported by papers which have demonstrated that PKC inhibitors prolong the agonist-induced membrane localization of classical PKC isoforms (15Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Hashimoto N. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29054-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon is common for several PKC isoforms. Both PKCα as well as the PKCβ isoforms are similarly affected by kinase inhibition, and there was also a similar, albeit smaller, effect for PKCδ. If the hypothesis is true, it would be expected that mutation of the C-terminal autophosphorylation sites to alanine, mimicking a dephosphorylated state, would abolish the relocation of PKC to the cytosol during agonist stimulation. This is indeed what we found in our experiments. It would also be expected that mutation of the sites to glutamate, mimicking the phosphorylated state, would result in a PKC that was already desensitized and insensitive to translocation signals. However, our experiments showed that PKCα with both sites mutated to glutamate responded with at least equal prominence as did wild-type PKCα, and pretreatment with GF109203X made the mutant respond with a sustained translocation. Furthermore, treatment with GF109203X did not decrease the amount of phosphorylated PKCα despite the fact that it abolished the relocation of PKCα to the cytosol. Thus, there does not seem to be a correlation between phosphorylation of the C-terminal autophosphorylation sites and insensitivity to a receptor-stimulated translocation signal. It is, therefore, clear that autophosphorylation is not a mechanism for desensitization of the PKC translocation. Our data instead point to other important regulatory functions of autophosphorylation. Both kinase-inactivated PKCα and PKCα with the autophosphorylation sites mutated to alanine responded to exogenous application of DOG. This contrasts the reaction of wild-type PKCα, which is insensitive to DOG. We propose that this difference explains why the former mutants display a sustained translocation upon carbachol stimulation, whereas the translocation of wild-type PKCα is transient. We have previously seen that after the addition of carbachol there is a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, but the DAG levels accumulate gradually and remain elevated for at least several minutes (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, propose that autophosphorylation of the C-terminal sites serves as a regulatory switch determining whether PKCα is sensitive to DAG or not. It is in this context interesting to note that several stimuli and extracellular factors influence the amount of classical PKC isoforms that are autophosphorylated (14Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Our data, therefore, highlight the possibility that regulated phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site and the turn motif serves to alter the DAG sensitivity of PKCα and possibly also of other classical isoforms. The question remains as how phosphorylation of the C-terminal sites alters the DAG sensitivity of PKCα. Previous studies demonstrate that DAG primarily binds the C1a (24Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) domain and that this interaction is suppressed by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and the C1a domain in the inactive PKCα (4Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our previous study (6Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the catalytic domain is necessary to maintain the inaccessibility of the C1a domain, and this study indicates that the autophosphorylation sites are necessary for the effect. It is in this context interesting to note the proposed model for the intramolecular interactions in PKCβ between a receptor for activated C-kinase-binding site and a pseudo-receptor for activated C-kinase motif (25Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Banci L. Cavallaro G. Kheifets V. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12988-12997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The interaction is putatively mediated via the V5 and the C2 domain. Because the autophosphorylation sites are located in the V5 domain of PKCα, our data further support a model in which the V5 domain participates in intramolecular interactions that maintain the PKC molecule in a closed conformation. The strength of these interactions may be influenced by the presence of phosphate on the autophosphorylation sites. Besides influencing the translocation response, phosphorylation of the turn motif and the hydrophobic site have also been suggested to increase the stability of PKC and to prevent it from accumulating in a detergent-insoluble fraction (9Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that the down-regulation of PKC that follows upon prolonged activation of the enzyme is mediated via an initial dephosphorylation of the autophosphorylation sites (14Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Gysin S. Imber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Gysin S. Imber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), perhaps followed by a ubiquitination of the enzyme. However, there are also studies showing that primarily the fully phosphorylated PKC molecule is degraded without an initial dephosphorylation (29Leontieva O.V. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5788-5801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that the mutant with both autophosphorylation sites mutated to alanine had a similar localization pattern as wild-type PKCα, demonstrating that the propensity of the non-phosphorylated variants to accumulate in detergent-insoluble fractions does not translate into an apparent alteration of its localization in the cell. Furthermore, when analyzing the expression of the alanine mutants, we could not detect any degradation products of PKCα. This indicates that the rate of degradation of non-phosphorylated PKCα is slow in the neuroblastoma cells. The kinase-dead PKCα variant was, as expected, not autophosphorylated, which may explain its DOG sensitivity and sustained response to carbachol stimulation. However, the inhibitor GF109203X potentiated the translocation response, but it did not reduce the autophosphorylation. Furthermore, it prolonged the translocation of PKCα with the autophosphorylation sites mutated to glutamate, and it could reverse the relocation of PKCα to the cytosol once it had occurred (Fig. 2). It is, therefore, likely that GF109203X enhances the translocation of PKCα through other means than by suppression of the autophosphorylation of PKCα. We speculate that the inhibitor, by interacting with the ATP-binding site, destabilizes the closed conformation of PKC and thereby exposes the C1a domain and makes it available for interaction with DAG. Both exogenous application of PKC inhibitor and overexpression of a kinase-inactivated PKC mutant are widely used to suppress PKC activity in order to investigate the role for PKC in different cellular processes. Our data clearly show that both methods not only block PKC activity but also have other effects on the protein, such as increasing the amount of PKC molecules, albeit most likely catalytically inactive enzymes, at the plasma membrane. Given the fact that PKC has been shown to exert several effects independently of its kinase activity (21Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2065791754,"Chromosome instability (CIN) is one of the most important phenotypes in tumor progression, introducing multiple mutations required for acquisition of further malignant characteristics. Abnormal amplification of centrosomes, which is frequently observed in human cancer, has been shown to contribute to CIN by increasing the frequency of mitotic defects. Here, we show that transient exposure to subtoxic concentrations of commonly used anticancer drugs that target DNA synthesis induces centrosome amplification in cells lacking p53 tumor suppressor protein, by allowing continuous centrosome duplication in the absence of DNA synthesis. When these cells are released from cell cycle arrest by removal of drugs, cells suffer extensive destabilization of chromosomes. Considering that p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and that CIN is known to be associated with acquisition of malignant phenotypes, our observations may explain why recurrent tumors, after chemotherapy, often exhibit more malignant characteristics than the original tumors. The tumor cells that are exposed to subtoxic levels of DNA synthesis-targeting drugs will be arrested and undergo centrosome amplification. Upon cessation of chemotherapy, these cells will re-enter cell cycling, and experience extensive CIN due to the presence of amplified centrosomes. This in turn promotes generation of tumor cells equipped with further malignant characteristics."

The relative role of peroxisomal β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids and the fate of its oxidation products are poorly understood and are the subjects of our research. In this report we describe a study of β-oxidation of palmitate and stearate using HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of multiple concentrations of [U-13C18]stearate or [U-13C16] palmitate. Using mass isotopomer analysis we determined the enrichments of acetyl-CoA used in de novo lipogenesis (cytosolic pool), in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (glutamate pool), and in chain elongation of stearate (peroxisomal pool). Cells treated with 0.1 mm [U-13C18]stearate had markedly disparate acetyl-CoA enrichments (1.1% cytosolic, 1.1% glutamate, 10.7% peroxisomal) with increased absolute levels of C20:0, C22:0, and C24:0. However, cells treated with 0.1 mm [U-13C16]palmitate had a lower peroxisomal enrichment (1.8% cytosolic, 1.6% glutamate, and 1.1% peroxisomal). At higher fatty acid concentrations, acetyl-CoA enrichments in these compartments were proportionally increased. Chain shortening and elongation was determined using spectral analysis.

The integration of mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation leads to optimal generation of high energy phosphate bonds and the basic two-carbon units (acetyl-CoA) for biosynthesis. These β-oxidation-dependent processes are affected by internal factors such as the expression of specific ligand-activated transcription factors, peroxisome proliferators (1Reddy J.K. Hashimoto T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), and external factors such as nuclear receptor ligands and specific substrate concentrations (2Yu X.X. Drackley J.K. Odle J. Lin X. Biol. Neonate. 1997; 72: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids in isolated tissues is largely unknown. Previous methods of estimating mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation of palmitate and stearate relied on the use of specific 1-14C- or 1-13C-labeled long chain fatty acids as precursors. Because labeled CO2 and acid-soluble organic acids are products common to all forms of β-oxidation, such methods cannot quantitatively distinguish between mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation. Moreover, studies based on these methods cannot differentiate chain shortening from complete oxidation (3Veerkamp J.H. van Moerkerk T.B. Glatz J.F. Zuurveld J.G. Jacobs A.E. Wagenmakers A.J. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1985; 35: 248-259Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, we have developed several mass isotopomer methods to estimate acetyl-CoA enrichment in the mitochondria and cytosol using uniformly labeled stearate (4Ajie H.O. Connor M.J. Lee W-N.P. Bassilian S. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E247-E252PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lee W.N. Lim S. Bassilian S. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20929-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This study was designed to investigate the role of peroxisomal β-oxidation in very long chain fatty acid synthesis. To accomplish this, we extended our previous analysis to determine the contribution of uniformly labeled [U-13C16]palmitate (u-palmitate) 1The abbreviations used are: u-palmitate, [U-13C16]palmitate; u-stearate, [U-13C18]stearate; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy; FNS, fraction of newly synthesized molecules. and [U-13C18]stearate (u-stearate) to the acetyl-CoA pool used in very long chain fatty acid synthesis in HepG2 cells. We estimated the acetyl-CoA enrichments used in de novo lipogenesis (cytosolic pool) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (as reflected by the glutamate pool) and in chain elongation of stearate (peroxisomal pool). Combining these results with analysis of chain shortening and chain elongation, we demonstrated that β-oxidation of palmitate and stearate is compartmentalized and differentially regulated, resulting in disparate acetyl-CoA enrichment in these compartments. Acetyl-CoA derived from peroxisomal chain shortening of stearate is a significant source of carbon units for very long chain fatty acid synthesis. Cell Culture Experiments—Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection, HB-8065) was maintained in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium augmented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1000 mg/liter glucose, and 1% penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) plus amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When the cultures were ∼90% confluent (∼2.5 × 106 cells/plate), the medium was removed, and monolayers were washed 1 time with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated in media enriched with uniformly labeled [13C16]palmitic acid or [13C18]stearic acid (Spectra Stable Isotopes, catalog numbers 52339 and 52349) at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mmol/liter. These compounds were tested for purity by GC/MS and found to have no traces of longer or shorter chain fatty acids. Fatty acids were dissolved in alcohol and added to media (total alcohol equalized in all flasks to 0.1% by volume). Four flasks were prepared for each fatty acid at each enrichment and two for control conditions. Media was changed at 0, 24, and 48 h, and cells were harvested from the plates at 72 h. Lipid Extractions—Lipid extractions were performed using methods described by Lowenstein et al. (6Lowenstein J.M. Brunengraber H. Wadke M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from each plate were harvested, and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) and tricosanoic acid (C23:0) were added as internal standards for fatty acids. The mixture was saponified with 200 μl of 30% KOH-ethanol (1:1 v/v) at 70 °C overnight. The aqueous phase was acidified, and fatty acids were extracted in petroleum ether and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Fatty acids were methylated with 0.5 n HCl in methanol (Supelco) for GC/MS analysis. GC/MS Analysis; Lipids—GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard model 5973 Selective Mass Detector connected to a Model 6890 gas chromatograph using electron impact ionization and selected ion monitoring to follow specific ions. Fatty acid esters were separated using glass capillary column bpx 70 (SGE) measuring 30 m × 250 μm inner diameter. The GC conditions for fatty acids were: carrier gas (helium) flow rate, 1 ml/min; injector temperature, 250 °C; temperature programming, 140 to 230 °C at 5 °C/min. In the following sections, we use m0 or m+0 interchangeably to indicate the base peak and m14 or m+14 to indicate the isotopomer with a mass shift of 14 daltons of myristate. This nomenclature is applied to all fatty acids and metabolites studied. The ions monitored were: myristate (C14:0) m0 cluster, m/z 241–248, and m14 cluster, m/z 253–260; palmitate (C16:0) m0 cluster, m/z 269–76, and m16 cluster, m/z 284–303; heptadecanoate (C17:0), m/z 284; stearate (C18:0), m0 cluster, m/z 297–304, and m18 cluster, m/z 312–318; oleate (C18:1) m0 cluster, m/z 264–269, and m18 cluster, m/z 277–284; arachidate (C20:0) m0 cluster, m/z 325–331, and m18 cluster, m/z 340–348; behenate (C22:0) m0 cluster, m/z 353–360, and m18 cluster, m/z 368–376; tricosanoate (C23:0), m/z 368, lignocerate (C24:0), m0 cluster, m/z 381–388, and m18 cluster, m/z 396–404. Glutamate Extractions—Tissue culture medium was first treated with 6% perchloric acid and centrifuged to remove protein. The supernatant was neutralized with KOH and then passed through 5-cm3 Dowex-50 columns. Amino acids were eluted from the column with 10 ml of 2 n ammonium hydroxide followed by air-drying. To separate glutamine from glutamate, amino acids were dissolved in water and passed on 5-cm3 Dowex-1 columns. Glutamine was washed off with 15 ml of water. Glutamate was eluted with 15 ml of 0.5 n acetic acid and air-dried. Glutamate was derivatized using the method of Leimer et al. (7Leimer K.R. Rice R.H. Gehrke C.W. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 141: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Glutamate was heated to 100 °C for 2 h in 100 μl of HCl in butanol (Regis). Butanol and HCl were removed under a stream of nitrogen, the residue was dissolved in methylene chloride, and 100 μl of trifluoroacetic anhydride was added to complete the reaction. The trifluoroacetamide butyl ester of glutamate was dissolved in methylene chloride for GC/MS analysis. GC/MS Analysis; Glutamate—A Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph connected to a model 5973 mass spectrometer was used. The capillary column was HP5 measuring 30 m × 250 μm. The GC conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 250 °C; temperature programming was 205 to 215 °C at 3 °C/min. Selected ion monitoring was used to follow specific ions. Under EI conditions, ionization of the trifluoroacetamide butyl ester of glutamate gives rise to two fragments, m/z 198 and m/z 152, corresponding to C2-C5 and C2-C4 of glutamate, respectively (8Katz J. Wals P.A. Lee W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25509-25521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data Analysis; Fatty Acids—Mass isotopomer distribution was determined using the method of Lee et al., which corrects for the contribution of derivatizing agent and 13C natural abundance to the mass isotopomer distribution of the compound of interest (9Lee W.N. Edmond J. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The calculated mass isotopomer distribution is expressed as molar fractions (m0, m1, m2, m3, etc.), which are the fractions of molecules containing 0, 1, 2, 3,... 13C substitutions, respectively. Data reduction and regression analyses were performed using the computer software Microsoft Excel® version 5.0 and Wolfram Research Mathematica® version 5.0.1. Determination of Precursor Enrichment—β-Oxidation of palmitate and stearate generates acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently used as a precursor for de novo lipogenesis, chain elongation, and energy production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, β-oxidation can be assessed through the determination of acetyl-CoA enrichment in the different synthetic products. Acetyl-CoA Enrichment for de Novo Synthesis—The enrichment of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool used in de novo fatty acid synthesis was determined from the mass isotopomer distribution in palmitate. De novo synthesis of palmitate produces palmitate with 2, 4, or 6 13C atoms (m2, m4, and m6). The distribution of these mass isotopomers has been previously shown to be a binomial distribution (10Lee W.N. Guo Z.K. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the acetyl-CoA enrichment may be obtained from the consecutive mass isotopomer ratio m4/m2 = (n – 1)p/q = 3.5p/q, where n is the number of acetyl units in palmitate = 8, p is the enrichment of [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA, q is the unenriched acetyl-CoA, and p + q = 1. Acetyl-CoA Enrichment from Mitochondrial β-Oxidation—[1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA produced from β-oxidation combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate in the mitochondria. The citrate participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, eventually forming [α-4,5-13C2]ketoglutarate and glutamate (12Haber S. Lapidot A. Brain Res. 2001; 896: 102-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The enrichment of the m2 component of the C2-C5 fragment generally reflects tricarboxylic acid cycle activity (13Yang D. Brunengraber H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 991-994Crossref Google Scholar, 14Lee W-N. Edmond J. Bassilian S. Morrow J.W. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 18: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, it is well known that contribution from unlabeled glutamate from the cells in culture with glutamine-containing medium can substantially dilute the glutamate enrichment (15Darmaun D. Matthews D.E. Desjeux J-F. Bier D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the enrichment of the [4,5-13C2]glutamate is the lower limit of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool. Acetyl-CoA Enrichment for Chain Elongation—Enzymes involved in chain elongation from palmitate and stearate to longer chain fatty acids are located in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (16Vance D.E. Vance K.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2002: 183-187Google Scholar). Chain elongation of uniformly labeled palmitate and stearate with [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA produces characteristic m+16 and m+18 clusters that can be used to determine the acetyl-CoA enrichment according to the rules of combination of two labeled precursors. The probability of forming m+16 stearate from u-palmitate is the joint probability of combining m+0 acetyl-CoA and m+16 palmitate. Similarly the probability of finding m+18 stearate is the joint probability of combining m+2 acetyl-CoA and m+16 palmitate. Thus, the ratio of m+2 to m+0 acetyl-CoA for chain elongation is given by the ratio of m+18 to m+16 in stearate in u-palmitate experiments and m+20 to m+18 in arachidate in u-stearate experiments. The enrichment of [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA for each step of chain elongation (C16 to C18 in u-palmitate experiments and C18 to C20 in u-palmitate and u-stearate experiments) was determined using the method described in the appendix, which corrects for the fact that 13C enrichment in u-fatty acids is less than 100%. Fatty acid analysis of cell pellets shows two clusters in each spectrum, one “light” cluster representing newly synthesized and preexisting fatty acids and one “heavy” cluster representing fatty acids derived from uniformly labeled precursors (Fig. 1). u-palmitate-enriched cells have a heavy cluster consisting of a very high m+16 peak and a smaller m+15 peak arising from small amounts of 12C (<2%) in u-palmitate (m/z 285–286, Fig. 1b). Similarly, u-stearate-enriched cells have a heavy cluster with a large m+18 peak and smaller m+17 peak (m/z 315–316, Fig. 1e). Chain shortening of added u-stearate produced a small percentage of m+16 palmitate (m/z 286, Fig. 1e), whereas chain elongation of added u-palmitate produced a much larger percentage of m+18 stearate (m/z 314, Fig. 1c). A large fraction of C20:0 is derived from elongation of C16:0 (m/z 342 in u-palmitate cell cultures, Fig. 1d) and C18:0 (m/z 344 in u-stearate cell cultures, Fig. 1g). The impact of added palmitate and stearate on the distribution of fatty acids is shown in Table I. The addition of palmitate did not increase the concentration of C14:0 and resulted in minor increases in stearate and longer chain fatty acids levels. Stearate-enriched cells had no change in C14:0 levels and had lower palmitate concentrations than control cells, presumably due to reduced synthesis secondary to inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by high acyl-CoA levels. The addition of stearate caused a substantial increase in C20:0 and a smaller but still significant increase in C22:0 and C24:0.Table IQuantitation of saturated fatty acidsMedia conditionC14:0C16:0C18:0C20:0C22:0C24:0μg/pelletμg/pelletμg/pelletμg/pelletμg/pelletμg/pellet0.1 mm u-palmitate6.61 ± 0.48288 ± 6.2964.7 ± 2.632.72 ± 0.172.87 ± 0.282.70 ± 0.290.2 mm u-palmitate6.26 ± 0.52411 ± 14.671.2 ± 1.163.25 ± 0.153.02 ± 0.132.80 ± 0.160.5 mm u-palmitate6.39 ± 0.27726 ± 20.277.3 ± 8.904.34 ± 1.763.57 ± 1.023.22 ± 0.800.1 mm u-stearate7.13 ± 1.05160 ± 8.33127 ± 5.149.11 ± 1.044.46 ± 1.514.17 ± 0.210.2 mm u-stearate7.05 ± 0.28149 ± 3.57224 ± 7.0314.0 ± 2.313.98 ± 1.494.92 ± 0.270.5 mm u-stearate6.16 ± 0.45121 ± 9.57438 ± 21.323.9 ± 5.866.25 ± 1.294.09 ± 0.97Control11.3 ± 0.80212 ± 14.467.6 ± 17.92.30 ± 0.052.93 ± 0.072.66 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab The calculated acetyl-CoA enrichments from de novo lipogenesis, chain elongation, and from glutamate are shown in Table II. The acetyl-CoA enrichments for chain elongation of C18 to C20 in u-stearate-treated cells (calculated using the method in the appendix) were 10.1, 14.7, and 21.5%, representing values greater than nine times as high as cytosolic enrichments (p < 0.0001, unpaired t test). Such high enrichments must result from peroxisomal β-oxidation and suggest that chain elongation of stearate is the primary mechanism of very long chain fatty acid synthesis in hepatocytes. In contrast, chain elongation from C18 to C20 in u-palmitate-treated cells showed a significantly lower acetyl-CoA enrichment than the glutamate or cytosolic fractions (p < 0.001, unpaired t test). The C16-C18 enrichments are similar to cytosolic enrichments, implying that stearate synthesis from palmitate takes place in close proximity to the de novo lipogenesis system. Because the glutamate pool may be diluted by the conversion of glutamine present in cell culture media, 2Another potential source of dilution of the mitochondrial pool, the conversion of ethanol to acetate via the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system pathway, was shown to have minimal impact (unpublished results). the glutamate fraction represents a lower limit of the true mitochondrial acetyl-CoA enrichment, and the true mitochondrial enrichment is greater than the cytosolic enrichment for comparable enrichment between glutamate and cytosolic acetyl-CoA at high concentrations of fatty acids.Table IIAcetyl-CoA enrichment contributed by β-oxidation in different cell compartmentsFatty acid concentrationCytosolic acetyl-CoA enrichmentaCytosolic acetyl-CoA enrichment was calculated from consecutive mass isotopomer ratio (m4/m2) in palmitate.Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA enrichmentbMitochondrial acetyl-CoA was estimated from m2 enrichment in glutamate.Acetyl-CoA enrichment for C16-C18 ElongationcEnrichment for chain elongation was estimated from the heavy clusters of C18 and C20 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Acetyl-CoA enrichment for C18-C20 elongationcEnrichment for chain elongation was estimated from the heavy clusters of C18 and C20 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”%%%%0.1 mm u-palmitate1.78 ± 0.051.63 ± 0.081.51 ± 0.101.11 ± 0.130.2 mm u-palmitate2.88 ± 0.133.57 ± 0.122.94 ± 0.072.00 ± 0.160.5 mm u-palmitate5.02 ± 0.085.98 ± 0.265.42 ± 0.043.43 ± 0.170.1 mm u-stearate1.11 ± 0.031.10 ± 0.1510.74 ± 0.450.2 mm u-stearate1.51 ± 0.011.75 ± 0.0514.19 ± 0.120.5 mm u-stearate2.32 ± 0.052.86 ± 0.1221.46 ± 0.47a Cytosolic acetyl-CoA enrichment was calculated from consecutive mass isotopomer ratio (m4/m2) in palmitate.b Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA was estimated from m2 enrichment in glutamate.c Enrichment for chain elongation was estimated from the heavy clusters of C18 and C20 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Analysis of the palmitate and stearate spectra in these experiments allows differentiation between preexisting, newly synthesized, added, and chain-shortened or elongated products (Figs. 2 and 3). Table III shows direct measurements taken from these spectra, which are used as the basis for subsequent calculations. u-palmitate enrichments of 0.1–0.5 mm resulted in a heavy ion percentages of 43.45–82.24%, whereas u-stearate enrichment at the same concentrations resulted in a C18 distribution with 67.67–93.32% heavy ions. De novo lipogenesis introduces m+2 and m+4 ions within the light clusters, which can be used to determine the fraction of newly synthesized molecules (FNS). The FNS for each experimental condition is minimally affected by the added fatty acids.Fig. 3Analysis of stearate spectra.

The addition of u-palmitate did not increase the disappearance of preexisting palmitate nor did it suppress the contribution of de novo lipogenesis (Table IV). Similarly, u-stearate can undergo chain shortening to [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA to form C16 with a high m+16 peak. u-stearate-enriched cells had a relatively small light fraction of palmitate (7–16%), suggesting that chain shortening of stearate was a relatively minor contributor to cellular palmitate.Table IVDistribution of palmitate moleculesNewly synthesized μgaNewly synthesized (calculated from FNS × (1 - % heavy cluster).Added μgbAdded (calculated from % heavy cluster).Preformed μgcPreformed palmitate (total of four classes = 100%).

Open table in a new tab Finally, the results of analysis of light and heavy oleate clusters are shown in Fig. 4. The fraction of oleate molecules containing the perlabeled fatty acids ranged from ∼15 to 35% when u-palmitate was added and from ∼35 to 70% when u-stearate was added. Oleate is the preferred fatty acid for storage in triglycerides, and these results demonstrate that both palmitate and stearate stimulate desaturase activity. Until the recent demonstration of peroxisomal β-oxidation contributing to acetyl-CoA for malonyl-CoA synthesis, peroxisomal β-oxidation has not been considered as a substantial source of acetyl-CoA (17Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study the ability to separate acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of very long chain fatty acid elongation allows us to distinguish the acetyl-CoA from mitochondrial β-oxidation as used in de novo lipogenesis from acetyl-CoA from peroxisomal β-oxidation as used in stearate to C20:0 elongation. Using this novel technique we were able to demonstrate that peroxisomal β-oxidation contributes a substantial fraction of the acetyl-CoA used for fatty acid elongation in HepG2 cells. We also observed that the acetyl-CoA enrichments in u-stearate-treated cells satisfy the relationship cytosolic ≤ mitochondrial < peroxisomal, whereas in u-palmitate-treated cells the relationship is peroxisomal < cytosolic ≤ mitochondrial. Based on the disparate acetyl-CoA enrichments in different pools summarized in Table II and the differences between enrichments of acetyl-CoA from u-stearate and u-palmitate treatments, we propose a model with three specific functional compartments: peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and lipogenic/cytosolic (Fig. 5). Added palmitate or stearate enters the cell and undergoes either mitochondrial or peroxisomal β-oxidation. Mitochondrial β-oxidation of these fatty acids produces acetyl-CoA, which rapidly diffuses to the lipogenic compartment and is incorporated into newly synthesized fatty acids. It is in the peroxisomal compartment that the metabolic fates of stearate and palmitate differ. The acetyl-CoA generated from chain shortening of stearate enriches the peroxisomal compartment. Chain shortening of stearate and longer chain fatty acids is coupled to very long chain fatty acid synthesis, whereas the peroxisomal chain shortening of palmitate has no effect on the same processes. The net effect of this reaction is that the total number of acyl-CoA molecules is conserved, and the fatty acid composition is changed. For every two molecules of stearate entering the peroxisome, one is chain-shortened to palmitate, and the acetyl-CoA generated condenses with the second stearate molecule to form behenate. In theory, the peroxisomal compartment controls the rates of very long chain fatty acid degradation, stearate chain shortening, and very long chain fatty acid synthesis. The regulation of very long chain fatty acid synthesis is poorly understood. The disparity between palmitate and stearate peroxisomal enrichments in our experiments demonstrates substrate-induced elongation; specifically, that stearate stimulates very long chain fatty acid synthesis either directly or through excess acetyl-CoA generation in the peroxisome. An elongase enzyme separate from fatty acid synthase that elongates palmitate to stearate has recently been reported (18Moon Y-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In our cell cultures the enrichment in the C16 to C18 elongation was comparable with the cytosolic enrichment, implying that this elongase pathway is either insignificant in HepG2 cells or that it draws from the same lipogenic pool as fatty acid synthase. The lipogenic compartment has three functions, which are de novo synthesis of palmitate, chain elongation of palmitate to stearate, and desaturation of stearate to oleate for triglyceride synthesis. When excess free fatty acid is presented to a cell, it is apportioned to the mitochondrial, lipogenic, or peroxisomal compartments depending on the functional state of the cell. Because the energy needs of a cell are not driven by the availability of substrates, the excess fatty acid is most likely utilized for triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis through the lipogenic and peroxisomal compartments, respectively. Although most early studies of peroxisomal metabolism focused on very long chain and branched chain fatty acid oxidation, there is increasing evidence that chain shortening of long chain fatty acids plays an important role in a variety of physiologic processes. In this study, peroxisomal chain shortening of stearate was coupled to a 4–10-fold increase in C20:0 concentration. In fetal rabbit lung type II cells, palmitate derived from stearate chain shortening is preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (19Longmuir K.J. Rossi M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 961: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recent studies using uniformly labeled oleate and palmitate showed a substantial contribution of chain shortening to the malonyl-CoA pool of the heart (17Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Human acyl-CoA oxidase 1 has highest activity on medium to long chain substrates, with relative activity of only 6% toward C24:0 compared with 90–100% activity toward C8:0, C12:0, and C16:0 (20Vanhove G.F.

Although this difference may be related to the more general role of the peroxisome in fatty acid oxidation in pre-mitochondrial ancestral organisms, the subsequent lack of evolution toward a more specific enzyme argues for a strong pressure to preserve chain-shortening capabilities. The results of our present study are entirely consistent with this view. The use of C18-C20 chain elongation and other mass isotopomer analysis is the first quantitative method to determine peroxisomal acetyl-CoA enrichment (and therefore peroxisomal β-oxidation). The method should prove useful in the study of both peroxisomal oxidation and very long chain fatty acid synthesis in both cell culture and animal experiments. Our present study did not reveal the fate of acetyl-CoA in other situations, such as peroxisomal palmitate chain shortening. Further studies are necessary to increase our understanding of acetyl-CoA compartmentalization and regulation of chain elongation, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of disease due to inborn errors of fatty acid metabolism. Uniformly labeled palmitate and stearate have spectra which are shifted by 16 and 18 daltons from their unlabeled ions. [1,2-13C]Acetyl-CoA is produced both by oxidation of u-palmitate and by chain shortening of u-stearate to u-palmitate. u-palmitate and u-stearate are elongated with this labeled acetyl-CoA as well as unlabeled acetyl-CoA. Because the 13C enrichment in u-palmitate and u-stearate is not 100%, the impurity from 12C resulted in the presence of m+14 and m+15 in u-palmitate and m+16 and m+17 in u-stearate. The presence of these isotopomers contributed to the complexity of data reduction. The effective acetyl-CoA enrichment in the reaction C(X:0) + acetyl-CoA → C(X + 2:0) is determined from the shifted distributions of C(X:0) and C(X + 2:0). The equation is: F·E = G, where F is the shifted distribution matrix of C(X:0), representing a fatty acid of length X carbons before elongation, E is the acetyl-CoA enrichment vector, and G is the shifted distribution vector of the elongation product fatty acid with length X + 2 carbons. The E vector is determined by linear regression. Because both the fatty acid and its elongation product are derivatized shifted spectra, there is no need to correct for the derivative or natural abundance before regression. An example calculation from the elongation of C18 to C20 is given in Table VI.Table VISample matrices used in the elongation calculation C18·E = C20 Open table in a new tab The enrichment of acetyl-CoA for chain elongation can be determined by linear regression analysis when the spectra of C18 and C20 are known.

The m1 fraction arises from the small amount of 13C in natural acetyl-CoA as well as the small amount of 12C in u-stearate. This method may be generalized to larger elongation vectors. Analysis of C18 to C22 elongation in a similar fashion results in an elongation vector with five isotopomers from m0 to m4 representing a combination of two added acetyl-CoA units. Chain elongation of u-palmitate or u-stearate to longer chain fatty acids such as behenate (C22:0) and lignocerate (C24:0) also resulted in a shifted distribution, with isotopomers at m + 16, m + 18, m + 20, m + 22, and m + 24. Because C18, C20, and C22 can all participate in chain elongation, the elongation of palmitate and stearate to long chain fatty acids by the addition of more than one acetyl unit cannot be explained by a simple binomial chain elongation model (4Ajie H.O.

Strong expression of HER2/neu in cancers has been associated with poor prognosis. Alternative reading frame protein (ARF), a tumor suppressor protein encoded by a gene located in the Ink4a/ARF gene locus, is frequently inactivated in human cancers. Little is known about the tumor suppressor role of ARF in HER2/neu-overexpressing cancers. Here, we applied the ARF gene as a tumor-suppressive agent for HER2/neu-overexpressing cells under the control of a tetracycline (tet)-regulated gene expression system. We found that ARF antagonized protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation and increased p27 stability in HER2/neu-overexpressing cells. ARF expression also led to decreased levels of Cul1 and Skp2, two proteins involved in p27 degradation. We also found that ARF caused apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing cells, and sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agents taxol and 2-methoxyestradiol. Most significantly for clinical application, we found that ARF inhibited HER2/neu-mediated cell growth, transformation, and tumorigenesis. These findings indicate that modulation of ARF activity may be a useful therapeutic intervention in HER2-overexpressing cancers."

Insulin stimulates GLUT4 exocytosis and partially inhibits its endocytosis, resulting in GLUT4 redistribution to the cell surface. Insulin does not stimulate glucose uptake into adipocytes lacking the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) transcription factor. Here we show that these adipocytes do not properly traffic GLUT4.

Insulin regulates whole body glucose homeostasis, in part, by regulating the uptake of glucose into fat and muscle cells. Insulin regulates glucose uptake by modulating the distribution of the GLUT4 glucose transporter between the surface and interior of cells (1Bryant N. Govers R. James D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

GLUT4 is mostly retained intracellularly in basal conditions, and insulin stimulates a redistribution of GLUT4 to the cell surface, where it functions to allow glucose to enter cells by diffusing down the concentration gradient. In basal conditions, GLUT4 is much more rapidly internalized than exocytosed, resulting in its intracellular retention by a dynamic mechanism (3Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol.

In addition to the insulin-regulated pathway being highly selective for cargo molecules (e.g. GLUT4 and IRAP), this specialized trafficking pathway is most highly developed in fat and muscle cells, the two cell types involved in disposal of dietary glucose. The complex intracellular itinerary of GLUT4 has been intensively studied, and although the pathway has not been completely elucidated, it is clear that GLUT4 traffics through both general endosomes and specialized compartments as it cycles between the interior and cell surface (8Zeigerer A.

Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). GLUT4 enters cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is delivered to endosomes along with other proteins internalized by the clathrin pathway (10Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Most membrane proteins are rapidly recycled back to the cell surface from endosomes. GLUT4 does not return directly from endosomes to the cell surface, but rather it is transported to an intracellular compartment that is not along the general endocytic-recycling pathway. Here we refer to this compartment as specialized to distinguish it from general endosomes (3Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, intracellular GLUT4 is nearly equally distributed between endosomes and the specialized compartment, indicating that in unstimulated cells, GLUT4 is stored in both endosomes and the specialized compartment (8Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). GLUT4 is much more slowly exocytosed than membrane proteins that cycle through the general endocytic recycling pathway (3Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol.

Transport of GLUT4 or IRAP to the specialized compartment correlates with their slow, insulin-regulated efflux. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GLUT4 and IRAP are segregated from endosomes and slowly recycled, whereas in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or fibroblast-like cell types, ectopically expressed GLUT4 is not segregated from endosomes and is not as slowly exocytosed as in differentiated cells (8Zeigerer A.

In muscle cells, the other cell type with insulin-regulated glucose uptake, GLUT4 is also partially segregated from endosomes (15Li D. Randhawa V. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol.

The details of how the specialized pathway is formed in differentiated cells and how traffic through this pathway is regulated by insulin are not known.

PPARγ is the more proximal regulator of adipogenesis, since immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PPARγ cannot be differentiated into adipocytes, whereas immortalized embryonic fibroblasts lacking C/EBPα can be differentiated into adipocytes when PPARγ is ectopically expressed (19Rosen E.D.

However, adipocytes lacking C/EBPα are not completely normal, since insulin does not stimulate glucose uptake into these cells (21Wu Z. Rosen E. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A. McKeon C.

The C/EBPα–/– adipocytes exhibit reduced expression of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1, which may partly explain why these cells are insulin-insensitive (21Wu Z. Rosen E. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A. McKeon C. Darlington G. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Here we report on the characterization of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes derived from C/EBPα–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The objectives of these studies were to understand why adipocytes lacking C/EBPα have elevated basal glucose uptake and are not responsive to insulin (21Wu Z. Rosen E. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A. McKeon C. Darlington G. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 22El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We found that adipocytes lacking C/EBPα segregated GLUT4 from endosomes to the same degree as in wild type adipocytes, but unlike wild type adipocytes, GLUT4 is rapidly exocytosed in the basal state. The trafficking of IRAP is also altered in adipocytes lacking C/EBPα, indicating that the insulin-regulated trafficking pathway is perturbed rather than the effects being restricted to GLUT4 behavior. These data demonstrate that C/EBPα controls the expression of proteins that regulate the kinetics of GLUT4 exocytosis, but not the expression of proteins required to make the specialized GLUT4-containing compartment in adipocytes. Thus, in these mutant adipocytes, the formation of the specialized insulin-regulated pathway, characteristic of adipocytes, is uncoupled from the regulation of traffic through this pathway. The failure of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake above basal levels in adipocytes lacking C/EBPα is explained by the accumulation of GLUT4 on the surface in the basal state, establishing that the insulin resistance of these cells is, in part, due to a defect in the basal trafficking kinetics of GLUT4. Ligands and Chemicals—Unless noted otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescent antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunolabs, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11) was purified from ascites (Covance, Berkley, CA) on a protein G affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of the antibody required to saturate the HA epitope of HA-GLUT4-GFP was measured as described previously (3Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and selected for PPARγ with 2 μg/ml puromycin or for C/EBPα with 5 μg/ml hygromycin for a week after infection. Pooled selected cells were used for up to eight passages and then discarded. Selected cells were differentiated and electroporated as previously described (8Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Trafficking Assays—The surface-to-total ratios of HA-GLUT4-GFP, IRAP-transferrin receptor (IRAP-TR), and TR, and the exocytic rate constant measurements for HA-GLUT4-GFP were measured as previously described (3Karylowski O.

Distribution between Endosomes and the Specialized Compartment— The distribution of HA-GLUT4-GFP between endosomes and the specialized compartment was calculated as previously described (3Karylowski O.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1749-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells electroporated with HA-GLUT4-GFP and TR or IRAP-TR were incubated for 6 h with a saturating concentration of HA-11 anti-HA antibody (typically 50 μg/ml) with or without 20 μg/ml HRP-Tf. During this incubation, the complete cellular pool of HA-GLUT4-GFP was bound by HA-11 as the GLUT4 construct cycled between the surface and the interior of cells. After this incubation, the cells were placed on ice, and surface-bound HRP-Tf was removed by washing the cells twice with ice-cold citrate buffer (20 mm sodium citrate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.0), followed by a wash with neutral pH buffer. The cells were incubated for 30 min with 250 μg/ml diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.0025% H2O2 in the dark. The cells were washed twice and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. HA-11 on the surface (bound to HA-GLUT4-GFP) was bound with a saturating concentration of unlabeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody. The cells were refixed, and the amount of intracellular HA-11 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence of saponin-permeabilized cells using donkey anti-mouse IgG directly labeled with Cy3. The Cy3 fluorescence in each cell was measured and normalized to the GFP fluorescence in the cell. The Cy3/GFP ratio normalizes the nonablated Cy3 fluorescence to the total amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed per cell. Fluorescence was also collected from cells that were not incubated with HRP-Tf but were treated with DAB and H2O2. This fluorescence is the total nonablated Cy3/GFP ratio. To calculate the fraction of HA-GLUT4-GFP in the specialized compartment the following was used: fTR – fIRAP-TR/fTOTAL – fIRAP-TR, where fTR is the Cy3/GFP fluorescence remaining after ablation by Tf-HRP taken up via the TR, fIRAP-TR is the fluorescence remaining after ablation by Tf-HRP taken up via the IRAP-TR, and fTOTAL is the fluorescence in cells that were not incubated with Tf-HRP (no ablation). Epitope ablation in undifferentiated cells was measured by growing the cells to 80% confluence on 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were transfected with 3.7 μg of HA-GLUT4-GFP together with either 5.5 μg of TR or IRAP-TR, using LipofectAMINE 2000. The following day, the cells were plated on coverslip dishes, and the epitope ablation assay was performed as described above. Fluorescence Quantification—The images were collected on a DMIRB inverted microscope (Leica Inc., Deerfield, IL) with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., West Chester, PA). All images were taken using a 40 × 1.25 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. The measurements and quantifications were performed as described previously (3Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A.

C/EBPα–/–Adipocytes Do Not Retain GLUT4 Intracellularly in the Basal State—To better understand why insulin does not regulate glucose uptake into C/EBPα–/– adipocytes, we characterized the trafficking behavior of GLUT4 in these cells. C/EBPα–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts, expressing PPARγ by retroviral infection, were differentiated into adipocytes (21Wu Z. Rosen E. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A. McKeon C. Darlington G. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Here we refer to adipocytes derived from C/EBPα–/– fibroblasts expressing exogenous PPARγ by retroviral infection as C/EBPα–/– adipocytes. On day 4 of differentiation, the cells were electroporated with HA-GLUT4-GFP, a GLUT4 construct with an HA epitope inserted in the first exofacial loop and GFP fused to the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 (27Lampson M. Racz A. Cushman S. McGraw T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4065-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dawson K. Aviles-Hernandez A. Cushman S. Malide D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The distributions of HA-GLUT4-GFP in basal and insulin-stimulated conditions were determined on the following day (8Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). HA-GLUT4-GFP on the surface was measured by indirect immunofluorescence of fixed cells using an anti-HA antibody (HA.11), and total expression of the reporter was measured by the GFP fluorescence per cell. HA-GLUT4-GFP, detected by GFP fluorescence, was concentrated in the perinuclear region and in small punctate structures distributed throughout unstimulated C/EBPα–/– adipocytes, a pattern indistinguishable from that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). However, in C/EBPα–/– adipocytes, there was a significant amount of surface HA.11 staining, whereas in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, there was little HA.11 surface staining in basal conditions. Thus, basal C/EBPα–/– adipocytes do not properly retain GLUT4 intracellularly. The expression of HA-GLUT4-GFP on the plasma membranes of the two cell types stimulated with insulin was qualitatively indistinguishable (Fig. 1). Quantification of the HA-GLUT4-GFP surface-to-total distributions revealed a robust translocation to the surface of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and no significant redistribution in the C/EBPα–/– adipocytes (Fig. 2A). The major difference between 3T3-L1 and C/EBPα–/– adipocytes was in the basal state, with the surface-to-total GLUT4 in adipocytes lacking C/EBPα significantly increased relative to 3T3-L1 adipocytes, demonstrating that the mutant adipocytes are defective in the retention of GLUT4 intracellularly. The surface-to-total distribution of HA-GLUT4-GFP in basal adipocytes lacking C/EBPα was similar to that in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Since insulin increases GLUT4 on the surface by recruiting intracellular GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, the elevated amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP on the surface of basal adipocytes lacking C/EBPα necessarily blunts any affect of insulin on HA-GLUT4-GFP surface expression. Throughout this study, we used cells early in differentiation (i.e. on day 5). At this time, 3T3-L1 adipocytes retain and translocate GLUT4 as well as they do at later times of differentiation (8Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13El-Jack A.K. Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, to ensure that the failure of C/EBPα–/– adipocytes to retain GLUT4 was not due to a delay in differentiation, we examined HA-GLUT4-GFP in C/EBPα–/– adipocytes at day 10 of differentiation. The surface-to-total distributions of HA-GLUT4-GFP in C/EBPα–/– adipocytes, both in the basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, were the same at day 10 as at day 5 of differentiation, demonstrating that the failure to retain GLUT4 did not result from a delay in the acquisition of insulin-regulated membrane trafficking in the C/EBPα–/– adipocytes (not shown). C/EBPα–/–Adipocytes Do Not Retain IRAP—We next determined whether the distribution of IRAP, a protein known to traffic by the insulin-regulated pathway in adipocytes, was altered in the C/EBPα knockout adipocytes. We used a chimera containing the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the human TR. We have previously shown that this chimera, IRAP-TR, traffics by the insulin-regulated pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the C/EBPα–/– adipocytes, as compared with 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRAP-TR was not retained intracellularly in the basal state, nor did insulin induce a large redistribution of IRAP-TR to the cell surface (Fig. 2B). Thus, like GLUT4, IRAP is not retained intracellularly in unstimulated C/EBPα–/– adipocytes. This demonstrates that in the absence of C/EBPα, the basal trafficking parameters of the insulin-regulated pathway are affected, rather than the altered trafficking being restricted to GLUT4. Transferrin Receptor Distribution Is Normal in C/EBPα–/–Adipocytes—In unstimulated adipocytes, GLUT4 and IRAP are dynamically retained intracellularly by rapid internalization from the plasma membrane and slow return to the cell surface (e.g. see Refs. 3Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the effect of C/EBPα knockout is restricted to the specialized trafficking of GLUT4 and IRAP, we examined the behavior of the TR, a commonly used marker of the general endocytic recycling pathway. The surface-to-total distribution of the TR in the C/EBPα–/– adipocytes was similar to that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in both the unstimulated and stimulated conditions (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the altered surface-to-total distributions of GLUT4 and IRAP in adipocytes lacking C/EBPα did not result from gross changes in general membrane trafficking, since such changes would probably have altered TR behavior. Because unstimulated C/EBPα–/– adipocytes did not retain GLUT4 and IRAP, insulin had no greater effect on surface expression of GLUT4 and IRAP than it did on the TR (Fig. 2D). The analysis of the HA-GLUT4-GFP surface-to-total distribution indicates that the previously documented failure of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake above basal levels in C/EBPα–/– adipocytes is the result of a defect in insulin-regulated trafficking. Exogenously Expressed C/EBPα Restores GLUT4 Retention and Insulin-stimulated Redistribution to C/EBPα–/–Adipocytes—We next determined whether exogenously expressed C/EBPα would restore intracellular retention of GLUT4 in the C/EBPα–/– adipocytes. C/EBPα–/– embryonic fibroblasts were infected with retroviruses containing C/EBPα and PPARγ. HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed in adipocytes derived from these doubly infected C/EBPα–/– fibroblasts was excluded from plasma membrane in basal conditions, and it was redistributed to the cell surface by insulin (Fig. 3A). Reintroduction of C/EBPα resulted in an about 40% decrease in HA-GLUT4-GFP on the surface of unstimulated cells (Fig. 3B). Coincident with the restored intracellular retention of GLUT4, insulin stimulated a 2–3-fold translocation of HA-GLUT4-GFP to the cell surface (Fig. 3C). The magnitude of translocation of GLUT4 in C/EBPα–/– adipocytes re-expressing C/EBPα was similar to that in adipocytes derived from C/EBPα–/+ mouse embryo fibroblast cells (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the magnitude of the translocation was similar to the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose uptake previously measured in C/EBPα–/– adipocytes ectopically expressing C/EBPα and in adipocytes derived from NIH-3T"
https://openalex.org/W2784021303,"Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or expression of its constitutively activated mutant, ΔEGFR(2–7), in association with the inactivation of the INK4a/Arf gene locus is a frequent alteration in human glioblastoma. The notion of a cooperative effect between these two alterations has been demonstrated in respective mouse brain tumor models including our own. Here, we investigated underlying molecular mechanisms in early passage cortical astrocytes deficient for p16INK4a/p19Arf or p53, respectively, with or without ectopic expression of ΔEGFR(2–7). Targeting these cells with the specific EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 revealed that phosphorylation of ERK was only abrogated in the presence of an intact INK4a/Arf gene locus. The sensitivity to inhibit ERK phosphorylation was independent of ectopic expression of ΔEGFR(2–7) and independent of the TP53 status. This resistance to downregulate the MAPK pathway in the absence of INK4a/Arf was confirmed in cell lines derived from our mouse glioma models with the respective initial genetic alterations. Thus, deletion of INK4a/Arf appears to keep ERK in its active, phosphorylated state insensitive to an upstream inhibitor specifically targeting EGFR/ΔEGFR(2–7). This resistance may contribute to the cooperative tumorigenic effect selected for in human glioblastoma that may be of crucial clinical relevance for treatments specifically targeting EGFR/ΔEGFR(2–7) in glioblastoma patients."
