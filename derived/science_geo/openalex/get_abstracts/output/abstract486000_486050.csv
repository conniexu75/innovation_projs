https://openalex.org/W2076031927,"In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the cell of origin, nature and biological consequences of initiating lesions, and order of subsequent mutations remain poorly understood, as AML is typically diagnosed without observation of a pre-leukaemic phase. Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2166911762,"Hysteresis is observed between circulation states in an ‘atomtronic’ circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose–Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density), and may prove as crucial in future atomtronic devices as it has done in electronic devices. Hysteresis, a phenomenon by which the physical properties of a system depend strongly on the history of the applied perturbation, is widely exploited in electronic circuits including hard disk drives and flux-gate magnetometers and is essential to the function of radio-frequency SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices). Hysteresis is also fundamental to superfluidity and has been predicted to occur in superfluid atomic-gases, such as Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs). Gretchen Campbell and colleagues now report the first direct detection of hysteresis between quantized circulation states in a circuit formed from a ring of superfluid BEC obstructed by a rotating weak link. The presence of hysteresis in this system is of importance in the emerging field of 'atomtronics', in which ultracold atoms have a role analogous to that of the electrons in electronics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices. Atomtronics1,2 is an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to develop new functional methods by creating devices and circuits where ultracold atoms, often superfluids, have a role analogous to that of electrons in electronics. Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits—it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits3 and is essential in radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices4. Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity5 (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents6,7,8, critical velocity9,10,11,12,13,14 and Josephson effects15,16. Nevertheless, despite multiple theoretical predictions5,17,18,19, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose–Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose–Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in which the quantization of flow could not be observed20, and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow21,22. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices, and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting quantum interference devices)."
https://openalex.org/W1984261945,"One of the principal discoveries in modern cosmology is that standard model particles (including baryons, leptons and photons) together comprise only 5% of the mass-energy budget of the Universe. The remaining 95% consists of dark energy and dark matter (DM). Consequently our picture of the universe is known as {\Lambda}CDM, with {\Lambda} denoting dark energy and CDM cold dark matter. {\Lambda}CDM is being challenged by its apparent inability to explain the low density of DM measured at the centre of cosmological systems, ranging from faint dwarf galaxies to massive clusters containing tens of galaxies the size of the Milky Way. But before making conclusions one should carefully include the effect of gas and stars, which were historically seen as merely a passive component during the assembly of galaxies. We now understand that these can in fact significantly alter the DM component, through a coupling based on rapid gravitational potential fluctuations."

https://openalex.org/W2039143660,"The assembly of 30S ribosomes requires the precise addition of 20 proteins to the 16S ribosomal RNA. How early binding proteins change the ribosomal RNA structure so that later proteins may join the complex is poorly understood. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to observe real-time encounters between Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S4 and the 16S 5′ domain RNA at an early stage of 30S assembly. Dynamic initial S4–RNA complexes pass through a stable non-native intermediate before converting to the native complex, showing that non-native structures can offer a low free-energy path to protein–RNA recognition. Three-colour FRET and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how S4 changes the frequency and direction of RNA helix motions, guiding a conformational switch that enforces the hierarchy of protein addition. These protein-guided dynamics offer an alternative explanation for induced fit in RNA–protein complexes. Three-colour fluorescence resonance energy transfer and molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the events occurring early in assembly of the 30S ribosome; within a non-native intermediate S4 ribosomal protein–16S RNA structure, S4 is capable of altering the RNA helix dynamics to facilitate conformation changes that enable subsequent protein binding. The assembly of protein–RNA complexes can involve the sculpting of RNA structure as proteins are sequentially bound, but direct demonstration of the details of these changes has been difficult. Sarah Woodson and colleagues have used sophisticated three-colour fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and modelling to look at the events occurring early in the assembly of the 30S ribosome. They find that when the S4 ribosomal protein interacts with the 16S rRNA, there is a stable, on-path, non-native intermediate, and that the S4 protein can alter the RNA helix dynamics to facilitate conformational changes that enable subsequent protein binding."

https://openalex.org/W1977180007,"An intense stimulus can cause death of odontoblasts and initiate odontoblastic differentiation of stem/progenitor cell populations of dental pulp cells (DPCs), which is followed by reparative dentin formation. However, the mechanism of odontoblastic differentiation during reparative dentin formation remains unclear. This study was to determine the role of β-catenin, a key player in tooth development, in reparative dentin formation, especially in odontoblastic differentiation. We found that β-catenin was expressed in odontoblast-like cells and DPCs beneath the perforation site during reparative dentin formation after direct pulp capping. The expression of β-catenin was also significantly upregulated during odontoblastic differentiation of in vitro cultured DPCs. The expression pattern of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was similar to that of β-catenin. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that Runx2 was also expressed in β-catenin-positive odontoblast-like cells and DPCs during reparative dentin formation. Knockdown of β-catenin disrupted odontoblastic differentiation, which was accompanied by a reduction in β-catenin binding to the Runx2 promoter and diminished expression of Runx2. In contrast, lithium chloride (LiCl) induced accumulation of β-catenin produced the opposite effect to that caused by β-catenin knockdown. In conclusion, it was reported in this study for the first time that β-catenin can enhance the odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs through activation of Runx2, which might be the mechanism involved in odontoblastic differentiation during reparative dentin formation."
https://openalex.org/W2095401087,"Recent years have seen a growing consensus that events during one part of an animal's annual cycle can detrimentally affect its future fitness. Notably, migratory species have been shown to commonly display such carry-over effects, facing severe time constraints and physiological stresses that can influence events across seasons. However, to date, no study has examined a full annual cycle to determine when these carry-over effects arise and how long they persist within and across years. Understanding when carry-over effects are created and how they persist is critical to identifying those periods and geographic locations that constrain the annual cycle of a population and determining how selection is acting upon individuals throughout the entire year. Using three consecutive years of migration tracks and four consecutive years of breeding success data, we tested whether carry-over effects in the form of timing deviations during one migratory segment of the annual cycle represent fitness costs that persist or accumulate across the annual cycle for a long-distance migratory bird, the Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica. We found that individual godwits could migrate progressively later than population mean over the course of an entire migration period, especially southbound migration, but that these deviations did not accumulate across the entire year and were not consistently detected among individuals across years. Furthermore, neither the accumulation of lateness during previous portions of the annual cycle nor arrival date at the breeding grounds resulted in individuals suffering reductions in their breeding success or survival. Given their extreme life history, such a lack of carry-over effects suggests that strong selection exists on godwits at each stage of the annual cycle and that carry-over effects may not be able to persist in such a system, but also emphasizes that high-quality stopover and wintering sites are critical to the maintenance of long-distance migratory populations."
https://openalex.org/W2058381688,"Macronutrient quality and composition are important determinants of energy balance and the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated how changes to protein quality (casein versus whey protein isolate; WPI) and the protein to carbohydrate (P/C) ratio within a high fat diet (HFD) impacts on these parameters. Mice were fed a low fat diet (10% kJ) or a high fat diet (HFD; 45% kJ) for 21 weeks with either casein (20% kJ, HFD) or WPI at 20%, 30% or 40% kJ. In comparison to casein, WPI at a similar energy content normalised energy intake, increased lean mass and caused a trend towards a reduction in fat mass (P = 0.08), but the protein challenge did not alter oxygen consumption or locomotor activity. WPI reduced HFD-induced plasma leptin and liver triacylglycerol, and partially attenuated the reduction in adipose FASN mRNA in HFD-fed mice. High throughput sequence-based analysis of faecal microbial populations revealed microbiota in the HFD-20% WPI group clustering closely with HFD controls, although WPI specifically increased Lactobacillaceae/Lactobacillus and decreased Clostridiaceae/Clostridium in HFD-fed mice. There was no effect of increasing the P/C ratio on energy intake, but the highest ratio reduced HFD-induced weight gain, fat mass and plasma triacylglycerol, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose and leptin levels, while it increased lean mass and oxygen consumption. Similar effects were observed on adipose mRNA expression, where the highest ratio reduced HFD-associated expression of UCP-2, TNFα and CD68 and increased the diet-associated expression of β3-AR, LPL, IR, IRS-1 and GLUT4. The P/C ratio also impacted on gut microbiota, with populations in the 30/40% WPI groups clustering together and away from the 20% WPI group. Taken together, our data show that increasing the P/C ratio has a dramatic effect on energy balance and the composition of gut microbiota, which is distinct from that caused by changes to protein quality."
https://openalex.org/W2127385796,"Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells play important physiological roles in the lung, and abnormal proliferation of ASM directly contributes to the airway remodeling during development of lung diseases such as asthma. MicroRNAs are small yet versatile gene tuners that regulate a variety of cellular processes, including cell growth and proliferation; however, little is known about the precise role of microRNAs in the proliferation of the ASM. Here we report that a specific microRNA (miR-10a) controls ASM proliferation through directly inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Next-generation sequencing identified miR-10a as the most abundant microRNA expressed in primary human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, accounting for > 20% of all small RNA reads. Overexpression of miR-10a reduced mitogen-induced HASM proliferation by ∼50%, whereas inhibition of miR-10a increased HASM proliferation by ∼40%. Microarray profiling of HASM cells expressing miR-10a mimics identified 52 significantly down-regulated genes as potential targets of miR-10a, including the catalytic subunit α of PI3K (PIK3CA), the central component of the PI3K pathway. MiR-10a directly suppresses PIK3CA expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the gene. Inhibition of PIK3CA by miR-10a reduced V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT) phosphorylation and blunted the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases that are required for HASM proliferation. Together, our study identifies a novel microRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for PI3K signaling and ASM proliferation and further suggests miR-10a as a potential therapeutic target for lung diseases whose etiology resides in abnormal ASM proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2093418017,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is essential for prostate cancer development. It is activated by androgens through its ligand-binding domain (LBD), which consists predominantly of 11 α-helices. Upon ligand binding, the last helix is reorganized to an agonist conformation termed activator function-2 (AF-2) for coactivator binding. Several coactivators bind to the AF-2 pocket through conserved LXXLL or FXXLF sequences to enhance the activity of the receptor. Recently, a small compound-binding surface adjacent to AF-2 has been identified as an allosteric modulator of the AF-2 activity and is termed binding function-3 (BF-3). However, the role of BF-3 in vivo is currently unknown, and little is understood about what proteins can bind to it. Here we demonstrate that a duplicated GARRPR motif at the N terminus of the cochaperone Bag-1L functions through the BF-3 pocket. These findings are supported by the fact that a selective BF-3 inhibitor or mutations within the BF-3 pocket abolish the interaction between the GARRPR motif(s) and the BF-3. Conversely, amino acid exchanges in the two GARRPR motifs of Bag-1L can impair the interaction between Bag-1L and AR without altering the ability of Bag-1L to bind to chromatin. Furthermore, the mutant Bag-1L increases androgen-dependent activation of a subset of AR targets in a genome-wide transcriptome analysis, demonstrating a repressive function of the GARRPR/BF-3 interaction. We have therefore identified GARRPR as a novel BF-3 regulatory sequence important for fine-tuning the activity of the AR.

https://openalex.org/W1983706119,"The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most affected by climate change; in particular, winter temperatures and precipitation are predicted to increase with consequent changes to snow cover depth and duration. Whether the snow-free period will be shortened or prolonged depends on the extent and temporal patterns of the temperature and precipitation rise; resulting changes will likely affect plant growth with cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. We experimentally manipulated snow regimes using snow fences and shoveling and assessed aboveground size of eight common high arctic plant species weekly throughout the summer. We demonstrated that plant growth responded to snow regime, and that air temperature sum during the snow free period was the best predictor for plant size. The majority of our studied species showed periodic growth; increases in plant size stopped after certain cumulative temperatures were obtained. Plants in early snow-free treatments without additional spring warming were smaller than controls. Response to deeper snow with later melt-out varied between species and categorizing responses by growth forms or habitat associations did not reveal generic trends. We therefore stress the importance of examining responses at the species level, since generalized predictions of aboveground growth responses to changing snow regimes cannot be made."
https://openalex.org/W1994587623,"The increasing use of manufactured nanoparticles (NP) in different applications has triggered the need to understand their putative ecotoxicological effects in the environment. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NP) are toxic, and induce oxidative stress and other pathophysiological conditions. The unique properties of NP can change depending on the characteristics of the media they are suspended in, altering the impact on their toxicity to aquatic organisms in different environments. Here, Mozambique tilapia (O. mossambicus) were exposed to flame synthesized CuO NP (0.5 and 5 mg · L(-1)) in two environmental contexts: (a) constant freshwater (FW) and (b) stepwise increase in environmental salinity (SW). Sublethal effects of CuO NP were monitored and used to dermine exposure endpoints. Fish exposed to 5 mg · L(-1) CuO in SW showed an opercular ventilation rate increase, whereas fish exposed to 5 mg · L(-1) in FW showed a milder response. Different effects of CuO NP on antioxidant enzyme activities, accumulation of transcripts for metal-responsive genes, GSH ∶ GSSG ratio, and Cu content in fish gill and liver also demonstrate that additive osmotic stress modulates CuO NP toxicity. We conclude that the toxicity of CuO NP depends on the particular environmental context and that salinity is an important factor for modulating NP toxicity in fish."

Evidence over the last years strongly indicates the involvement of malformation and dysfunction of neuromuscular junctions in the development of such medical conditions. Stabilization of NMJs thus seems to be a promising approach to attenuate the disease progression of muscle wasting diseases. An important pathway for the formation and maintenance of NMJs is the agrin/Lrp4/MuSK pathway. Here we demonstrate that the agrin biologic NT-1654 is capable of activating the agrin/Lrp4/MuSK system in vivo, leading to an almost full reversal of the sarcopenia-like phenotype in neurotrypsin-overexpressing (SARCO) mice. We also show that injection of NT-1654 accelerates muscle re-innervation after nerve crush. This report demonstrates that a systemically administered agrin fragment has the potential to counteract the symptoms of neuromuscular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1994807100,"The majority of prevention and intervention research in problem gambling (PG) has focused on identifying negative risk factors. However, not all at-risk individuals go on to develop anticipated disorders and many thrive in spite of them. In healthcare settings, PG and other disorders are typically conceptualized from the biomedical perspective that frame disorders as something negative residing within the individual and reduction in negativity is seen as success. Indeed, this problem-focused conceptualization may be adequate in many cases as reducing PG behaviour is undoubtedly an important outcome, but the focus on negativity alone is too narrow to capture the complexity of human behaviour. Hence, this study attempts to bridge the gap in literature by providing an evaluation of the predictive ability of the positive dispositions on problem gambling severity, gambling-related cognitions, and gambling urges. The positive psychological dispositions examined were curiosity, gratitude, hope, personal growth initiative, and mindfulness. Participants consisted of 801 Taiwanese Chinese students and community individuals (Mean age = 25.36 years). Higher levels of gratitude and hope have been found to predict lower PG, gambling-related cognitions, or gambling urges. Meanwhile, higher mindfulness predicted lower PG, but only among Chinese males. However, lower personal growth initiative predicted lower PG, gambling-related cognitions, and gambling urges. These analyses have small to medium effect sizes with significant predictions. Findings of this study have essential implications in understanding and treating Chinese problem gamblers. These positive dispositions should be addressed by mental health professionals in preventative and treatment programs among Chinese individuals. Further implications and suggestions for future research are discussed."

In this study, we examined the interaction between Cu+/Cu2+ and Aβ fibrils by solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and other spectroscopic methods. Our photometric studies confirmed the production of ∼60 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from a solution of 20 μm Cu2+ ions in complex with Aβ(1–40) in fibrils ([Cu2+]/[Aβ] = 0.4) within 2 h of incubation after addition of biological reducing agent ascorbate at the physiological concentration (∼1 mm). Furthermore, SSNMR 1H T1 measurements demonstrated that during ROS production the conversion of paramagnetic Cu2+ into diamagnetic Cu+ occurs while the reactive Cu+ ions remain bound to the amyloid fibrils. The results also suggest that O2 is required for rapid recycling of Cu+ bound to Aβ back to Cu2+, which allows for continuous production of H2O2. Both 13C and 15N SSNMR results show that Cu+ coordinates to Aβ(1–40) fibrils primarily through the side chain Nδ of both His-13 and His-14, suggesting major rearrangements from the Cu2+ coordination via Nϵ in the redox cycle. 13C SSNMR chemical shift analysis suggests that the overall Aβ conformations are largely unaffected by Cu+ binding.

Studies were performed in rats fed a high fat diet or standard chow. AGM was added to drinking water for 4 or 8 weeks. We used 13C or 15N tracers to assess metabolic reactions and fluxes and real time quantitative PCR to determine gene expression.

The changes in gene expression were coupled with improved tissue and systemic levels of carnitine and short chain acylcarnitine, increased β-oxidation but diminished incomplete fatty acid oxidation, decreased fat but increased protein mass, and increased hepatic ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis but decreased glycolysis. These metabolic changes were coupled with reduced weight gain and a curtailment of the hormonal and metabolic derangements associated with high fat diet-induced obesity.

The ζ subunit causes full inhibition of the sulfite-activated PdF1-ATPase with an apparent IC50 of 270 nM by a mechanism independent of the 8 subunit. The inhibitory region of the ζ subunit resides in the first 14 N-terminal residues of the protein, which protrude from the 4-α-helix bundle structure of the isolated ζ subunit, as resolved by NMR. Cross-linking experiments show that the ζ subunit interacts with rotor (γ)and stator (α, β) subunits of the F1-ATPase, indicating that the ζ subunit hinders rotation of the central stalk. In addition, a putatively regulatory nucleotide-binding site was found in the ζ subunit by isothermal titration calorimetry.

https://openalex.org/W1999726176,"Vision impairment caused by loss of retinal neurons affects millions of people worldwide, and currently, there is no effective treatment. Müller glia of mammalian retina may represent an under-recognized and potential source for regeneration of a wide range of retinal cell types, including retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors. Here, we demonstrated that mouse Müller glia cells have the capacity to be reprogrammed into the retinal neuronal cell fate and are competent to give rise to photoreceptors under a defined culture condition. Inactivation of p53 released proliferation restriction of Müller glia and significantly enhanced the induction of retinal progenitor from Müller glia in culture. Moreover, following the ocular transplantation, the Müller glia-derived progenitors were differentiated toward the fates of photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of using Müller glia as a potential source for retinal repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2049739645,"We describe the first in vitro model of dormancy in Staphylococcus aureus, showing that cells are generated which can be resuscitated by addition of spent medium supernatant taken from cultures of the same organism. Over 30 days, culturable counts in dormant cultures of S. aureus SH1000 fell from 106–107 cfu/ml to <10 cfu/ml as measured by the Most Probable Number method in liquid culture, while total counts as determined by microscopy, and supported by data from RT-qPCR, remained around 106–107 cells/ml. Supplementing cultures with 25–50% spent medium resulted in a >600-fold increase in bacterial growth. Resuscitation was a specific effect, greatly reduced by boiling or addition of trypsin to the spent supernatant. Supernatant also effected a reduction in lag phase of dormant cultures. SEM demonstrated the presence of small coccoid cells in dormant cultures. The results are similar to those seen with resuscitation promoting factors (Rpfs) in actinobacteria. This is the first time resuscitation has been demonstrated in Staphylococcus aureus, which is an important human pathogen. A better understanding of control and reactivation of dormant cells could lead to major improvements in managing staphylococcal infections; resuscitation could be an important step in restoring susceptibility to antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2092227668,"In the acute phase of the inflammatory response, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) reaches its maximum levels in plasma, where it is mostly associated with high density lipoproteins (HDL). Overexpression of human sPLA2 in transgenic mice reduces both HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) plasma levels through increased HDL catabolism by an unknown mechanism. To identify unknown PLA2-mediated activities on the molecular components of HDL, we characterized the protein and lipid products of the PLA2 reaction with HDL. Consistent with previous studies, hydrolysis of HDL phospholipids by PLA2 reduced the particle size without changing its protein composition. However, when HDL was destabilized in the presence of PLA2 by the action of cholesteryl ester transfer protein or by guanidine hydrochloride treatment, a fraction of apoA-I, but no other proteins, dissociated from the particle and was rapidly cleaved. Incubation of PLA2 with lipid-free apoA-I produced similar protein fragments in the range of 6-15 kDa, suggesting specific and direct reaction of PLA2 with apoA-I. Mass spectrometry analysis of isolated proteolytic fragments indicated at least two major cleavage sites at the C-terminal and the central domain of apoA-I. ApoA-I proteolysis by PLA2 was Ca(2+)-independent, implicating a different mechanism from the Ca(2+)-dependent PLA2-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis. Inhibition of proteolysis by benzamidine suggests that the proteolytic and lipolytic activities of PLA2 proceed through different mechanisms. Our study identifies a previously unknown proteolytic activity of PLA2 that is specific to apoA-I and may contribute to the enhanced catabolism of apoA-I in inflammation and atherosclerosis."

In other cells, Ca2+ transport is regulated by 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. 1,25(OH)2D3 formation is inhibited by klotho and excessive in klotho-deficient mice (kl/kl). The present study explored the effect of klotho deficiency on platelet Ca2+ signaling and activation. Platelets and megakaryocytes isolated from WT and kl/kl-mice were analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blotting, confocal microscopy, Fura-2-fluorescence, patch clamp, flow cytometry, aggregometry, and flow chamber. STIM1/Orai1 transcript and protein levels, SOCE, agonist-induced [Ca2+]i increase, activation-dependent degranulation, integrin αIIbβ3 activation and aggregation, and thrombus formation were significantly blunted in kl/kl platelets (by 27–90%). STIM1/Orai1 transcript and protein levels, as well as CRAC currents, were significantly reduced in kl/kl megakaryocytes (by 38–73%) and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated WT megakaryocytes. Nuclear NF-κB subunit p50/p65 abundance was significantly reduced in kl/kl-megakaryocytes (by 51–76%). Transfection with p50/p65 significantly increased STIM1/Orai1 transcript and protein levels in megakaryocytic MEG-01 cells (by 46–97%). Low-vitamin D diet (LVD) of kl/kl mice normalized plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration and function of platelets and megakaryocytes. Klotho deficiency inhibits platelet Ca2+ signaling and activation, an effect at least partially due to 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent down-regulation of NF-κB activity and STIM1/Orai1 expression in megakaryocytes.—Borst, O., Münzer, P., Schmid, E., Schmidt, E.-M., Russo, A., Walker, B., Yang, W., Leibrock, C., Szteyn, K., Schmidt, S., Elvers, M., Faggio, C., Shumilina, E., Kuro-o, M., Gawaz, M., Lang, F. 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3-dependent inhibition of platelet Ca2+ signaling and thrombus formation in klotho-deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W1972546985,"Microglial activation plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, anti-inflammatory agents that control microglial activation can serve as potential therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we designed and synthesized α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) analogs to exert anti-inflammatory effects in activated microglia. We performed biological evaluations of 25 α-GalCer analogs and observed an interesting preliminary structure-activity relationship in their inhibitory influence on NO release and TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. After identification of 4d and 4e as hit compounds, we further investigated the underlying mechanism of their anti-inflammatory effects using RT-PCR analysis. We confirmed that 4d and 4e regulate the expression of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 at the mRNA level and the expression of TNF-α at the post-transcriptional level. In addition, both 4d and 4e inhibited LPS-induced DNA binding activities of NF-κB and AP-1 and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK without affecting other MAP kinases. When we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, on microglial activation, we observed an identical inhibitory pattern as that of 4d and 4e, not only on NO and TNF-α production but also on the DNA binding activities of NF-κB and AP-1. Taken together, these results suggest that p38 MAPK plays an important role in the anti-inflammatory effects of 4d and 4e via the modulation of NF-κB and AP-1 activities."
https://openalex.org/W2041387803,"The P23H mutation in rhodopsin (RhoP23H) is a prevalent cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. We examined the role of the ER stress proteins, Chop and Ask1, in regulating the death of rod photoreceptors in a mouse line harboring the RhoP23H rhodopsin transgene (GHL+). We used knockout mice models to determine whether Chop and Ask1 regulate rod survival or retinal degeneration. Electrophysiological recordings showed similar retinal responses and sensitivities for GHL+, GHL+/Chop−/− and GHL+/Ask1−/− animals between 4–28 weeks, by which time all three mouse lines exhibited severe loss of retinal function. Histologically, ablation of Chop and Ask1 did not rescue photoreceptor loss in young animals. However, in older mice, a regional protective effect was observed in the central retina of GHL+/Chop−/− and GHL+/Ask1−/−, a region that was severely degenerated in GHL+ mice. Our results show that in the presence of the RhoP23H transgene, the rate of decline in retinal sensitivity is similar in Chop or Ask1 ablated and wild-type retinas, suggesting that these proteins do not play a major role during the acute phase of photoreceptor loss in GHL+ mice. Instead they may be involved in regulating secondary pathological responses such as inflammation that are upregulated during later stages of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2116554971,"The AKT/PKB kinase is essential for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation; however, aberrant AKT activation leads to the aggressiveness and drug resistance of many human neoplasias. In the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, nuclear AKT activity increases during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated differentiation. As nuclear AKT activity is associated with differentiation, we sought to identify the nuclear substrates of AKT that were phosphorylated after ATRA treatment. A proteomics-based search for nuclear substrates of AKT in ATRA-treated NB4 cells was undertaken by using 2D-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with an anti-AKT phospho-substrate antibody. Western blot analysis, an in vitro kinase assay, and/or site-directed mutagenesis were performed to further characterize the MS findings. MS analysis revealed prohibitin (PHB)-2, a multifunctional protein involved in cell cycle progression and the suppression of oxidative stress, to be a putative nuclear substrate of AKT. Follow-up studies confirmed that AKT phosphorylates PHB2 on Ser-91 and that forced expression of the PHB2(S91A) mutant results in a rapid loss of viability and apoptotic cell death. Activation of nuclear AKT during ATRA-mediated differentiation results in the phosphorylation of several proteins, including PHB2, which may serve to coordinate nuclear–mitochondrial events during differentiation.—Bavelloni, A., Piazzi, M., Faenza, I., Raffini, M., D'Angelo, A., Cattini, L., Cocco, L., Blalock, W.

MINDy uses the difference between conditional mutual information at low and high modulator expression and has been applied to identify genome-wide modulators of MYC. However, it has a major limitation in that it cannot identify modulators with more than one mode of activity (activator or repressor). MIMOSA applies a mixture model and maximum expectation method to predict modulators of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1). The method is computationally intensive and cannot differentiate between modulators and targets of the TF. Finally, MONSTER only considers kinases as potential modulator candidates. Neither MIMOSA nor MONSTER has been experimentally validated. GEM (19.Babur O. Demir E. Gönen M. Sander C. Dogrusoz U. Discovering modulators of gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5648-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) aims to identify modulators of the androgen receptor by constructing a non-linear model of the three-way interaction between the activity levels of the two “inputs” (TF and M) and the “output” (TG). In this work, we predicted modulators and the corresponding TGs of the NF-κB/RelA transcription factor based on the approach described previously (19.Babur O. Demir E. Gönen M. Sander C. Dogrusoz U. Discovering modulators of gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5648-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As input for modulatory triplet inference, we used de novo identified RelA-binding proteins and its target genes identified, respectively, by affinity tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The new data were supplemented with published data on binding proteins and target genes of the NF-κB/RelA pathway. The probabilistic model is similar to Babur et al. (19.Babur O. Demir E. Gönen M. Sander C. Dogrusoz U. Discovering modulators of gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5648-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The expected expression of the target gene TG, E(TG), in continuous value is modeled as follows. E(TG)=Hc+Hf(F)+Hm(M)+G(M, F)(Eq. 1) Here, F, M, and TG are the transcription factor, its modulator, and the affected target gene, respectively. Hc is the basal expression level of the TG, Hf and Hm represent the effect of F and M alone on TG, respectively. G represents the effect of interaction between M and F on TG and varies for different genes. Its magnitude may be interpreted as the modulation effect. Our task was to find genes with G significantly different from zero. Accordingly, we approximated the probability that TG is highly expressed, p(TG = 1), as follows. P(TG=1)=αc+αfF+αmM+ γM×F(Eq. 2) where αc represents the basal expression of TG, αf is the effect of F only (when M is low), αm is the effect of M only (at low F), and γ is the interaction effect of F and M when both are highly expressed. F, M, and TG are equal to 1 if the ranked expression of the corresponding gene is in the upper tertile. Conversely, if it is in the lower tertile, F, M, and TG are set to zero. If γ is not statistically significantly different from zero, the data do not have enough evidence to support the hypothesis that M modulates the effect of F on the target TG. To estimate αc, αf, αm, and γ, we first calculated p(TG = 1|M, F), the proportions of TG = 1 with different combination of states of M and F. Specifically, p(TG = 1|M = 1, F = 1) where TG = 1 with M = 1 and F = 1 serves as the observed case, whereas p(TG = 1|M = 1, F = 0), p(TG = 1|M = 0, F = 1), and p(TG = 1|M = 0, F = 0) are the respective control cases with low M, F, or both. α, β, and γ were then estimated by Equation 3. α^c=p(TG=1|M=0, F=0)(Eq. 3) Here, α̂c corresponds to the proportion of TG = 1 to TG = 1 plus TG = 0 when expression of both M and F is low. α^f=p(TG=1|M=0, F=1)−p(TG=1|M=0, F=0)(Eq. 4) α^m=p(TG=1|M=1, F=0)−p(TG=1|M=0, F=0)(Eq. 5) β^f=p(TG=1|M=1, F=1)−p(TG=1|M=1, F=0)(Eq. 6) β^m=p(TG=1|M=1, F=1)−p(TG=1|M=0, F=1)(Eq. 7) γ^=β^m−α^m=β^f−α^m=p(TG=1|M=1, F=1)−p(TG=1|M=0, F=1)−p(TG=1|M=1, F=0)+p(TG=1|M=0, F=0)(Eq. 8) Estimation of the above parameters can be found in Babur et al. (19.Babur O. Demir E. Gönen M. Sander C. Dogrusoz U. Discovering modulators of gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5648-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Assuming that M influences TG via M, M must act on TG when F is highly expressed; i.e. γ̂ and β̂m must be non-zero, whereas β̂m is greater in absolute value or has a different sign than α̂m. H1, γ^=0; H2, β^m=0; H3, α^mβ^m≥1(Eq. 9) The estimation of the variance and p value for rejecting the above three null hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 can be found in Babur et al. (19.Babur O. Demir E. Gönen M. Sander C. Dogrusoz U. Discovering modulators of gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5648-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The predicted triplets are ordered according to the p values of γ̂ and β̂m; the smaller the p value, the higher the significance of the predicted triplet. The requirement for a significant γ̂ is crucial for detecting the interaction effect as opposed to a combination of independent actions of M and F separately. Unmodulated TF activity was classified into three categories according to α̂f: activation if positive, inhibition if negative, and inactive if zero. By comparing α̂and β̂, modulators are also classified into three categories of action: enhance, attenuate, or invert the activity of the TF. Specifically, if α̂f is non-negative and the β̂f value is greater than α̂f, the action mode is activation enhancement. If α̂f is positive and β̂f is less than α̂f and non-negative, it signifies activation attenuation, and if α̂f is positive and β̂f is negative, it signifies activation inversion. If α̂f is non-positive and the β̂f value is smaller than α̂f, the action mode is inhibition enhancement. If α̂f is negative and β̂f is greater than α̂ and non-positive, the action mode is inhibition attenuation, and if α̂f is negative and β̂f is positive, the action mode is inhibition inversion (see Table 1).TABLE 1Interpretation of the categories of modulation and the constraints that the categories satisfyModulation classificationExplanationγ̂α̂fβ̂fβ̂mα̂f + β̂mInhibition attenuationTF, alone, inhibits TG; M attenuates TF activity+−0/−−/+0/−Inhibition enhancementModulated TF inhibits TG−0/−−−−Inhibition inversionTF, alone, inhibits TG; M inverts TF activity+−+++Activation inversionTF, alone, activates TG; M inverts TF activity−+−−−Activation enhancementModulated TF activates TG+0/++++Activation attenuationTF, alone, activates TG; M attenuates TF activity−+0/++/−0/+ Open table in a new tab We further filtered the predicted modulators by the Shannon entropy of the distribution across the six action modes by each modulator respectively predicted from binding data. Modulators with Shannon entropy significantly smaller than expected from random distribution were classified as specific. The null distribution of the Shannon entropy depends on the number of targets and is obtained by generating the six action modes given the number of TGs in a simulation repeated 10,000 times. The modulators were ranked according to the largest number of TGs. The calculation of the Shannon entropy of the action mode distribution for each modulator is as follows. H=−∑i=16pilogpiforpi=pi∑i=16pi(Eq. 10) where pi is the proportion of the number of targets in each action mode i, and H is the entropy of action mode distribution for each modulator. To identify the modules of the network composed by RelA modulators and their affected target genes, we applied hierarchical clustering (24.Girvan M. Newman M.E. Community structure in social and biological networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (10823) Google Scholar) to matrices of modulator-target interactions. Hierarchical clustering has been chosen to reflect the coincidence between the modular structure of the modulation network and the multiple levels of functional annotations of the genes involved (see also “Results”). The matrix entries correspond to the value of γ̂, which represents the effect of M when F is highly expressed, and β̂m, the interaction effect of M and F when both are highly expressed. Here we used the Matlab clustergram function with default parameters and parsed the M-TG network into a hierarchy of groups according to the similarity of the value of γ̂ (the effect of M-F interaction) and the value of β̂m (the effect of M when F is high) that measures the common neighbors of M and T, respectively. The hierarchical clustering is agglomerative because we proceeded through the algorithm by adding links to the network. We applied the clustering procedure to triplets satisfying (−log10 p value of γ̂) > 4 and (−log10 p value of β̂m) > 4. To obtain the clustering presented in Fig. 4, we only used the modulators and TGs involved in significant predicted interactions and not involved in feedback loops. Specifically, we only used the 861 TGs for which there was at least one triplet satisfying the p value thresholds. The modulators have been selected analogously with at least one significant triplet, giving 493 candidate modulators of RelA. We used gene expression profiles of 2158 tumor samples published by the Expression Project for Oncology (expO) to characterize each gene. expO is based on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array platform. The variety of the tumor samples guarantees enough perturbation for studying three-point (M, NF-κB/RelA, TG) interaction. Because gene expression is noisy as reported (25.Li Y. Liu L. Bai X. Cai H. Ji W. Guo D. Zhu Y. Comparative study of discretization methods of microarray data for inferring transcriptional regulatory networks.BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11: 520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), unsupervised discretization methods were usually used to discretize the gene expression profiles in gene regulatory network construction including equal width discretization, equal frequency discretization, K-means, column K-means discretization, and bidirectional K-means discretization. We discretized the expression values by rank ordering across genes and dividing the ranked 2158 expression values of each gene across experiments into three bins, labeled as “1” (upper 719 experiments where the gene ranked highest), “0” (lower 719 experiments where the gene ranked lowest), and “middle” (720 remaining experiments). Based on the areas under receiver-operator curve and precision-recall curve in predicting RelA modulators (see Fig. 1), we found that varying the bin size only weakly affected the prediction of RelA triplets. Thus, we used tertiles as bins. Unless specified otherwise, we predicted triplets from probe set profiles with the above discretization. For some of the genes, multiple probe sets are available on the U133 Plus 2.0 microarray. Because the individual probe sets may correspond to different isoforms of the gene and thus be responsible for different functions, we treated each probe set of modulators and target genes separately in the prediction algorithm. Also, there are three probe sets corresponding to RelA on the array platform: 201783_s_at, 209878_s_at, and 230202_at. We considered the first two individually and ignored the third one, 230202_at, because of its low expression in the expO experiments. We have obtained the list of RelA-binding proteins from the Protein Interactions and Network Analysis (PIANA) database. 287 of those 297 proteins (supplemental Data File S1, Sheet 1) have probe sets available in the expO database. Here, we refer to these previously reported binding proteins as “existing” as opposed to the newly identified proteins that bind to RelA. Similarly, the existing RelA targets (TGs) were collected. 3T. Gilmore, personal communication. 424 TGs (supplemental Data File S2, Sheet 2) have been obtained with available probe sets and expression values in the expO database. These existing binding proteins and TGs combined with the newly detected proteins serve as our primary set of candidate genes involved in the modulatory network of RelA-regulated transcription. The functional annotations of the modulators and TGs were characterized using BiNGO software (26.Maere S. Heymans K. Kuiper M.

Although there are several risk factors associated with cancer, one area that remains poorly understood is the impact of infectious disease. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the herpesvirus family that is highly prevalent in the population. HCMV usually causes clinical disease only in immune compromised individuals, but recent evidence suggests that HCMV may be strongly associated with some forms of cancer, particularly glioblastoma and breast cancer. We investigated the possibility that cmvIL-10, a viral cytokine with homology to human IL-10 that is secreted from infected cells, could act in a paracrine manner to alter the tumor microenvironment, induce cell signaling, and increase the invasive potential of cancer cells. We found that human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express the IL-10 receptor and that exposure to cmvIL-10 results in activation of Stat3, a transcription factor strongly associated with enhanced metastatic potential and chemo-resistance. In addition, cmvIL-10 stimulated an increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, protected MDA-MB-231 cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis, and also greatly enhanced chemotaxis toward epidermal growth factor (EGF). These results suggest a significant and wide-ranging role for cmvIL-10 in the progression of breast cancer and could have broad implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in HCMV-positive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2014220057,"The ability to decode an individual's intentions in real time has long been a 'holy grail' of research on human volition. For example, a reliable method could be used to improve scientific study of voluntary action by allowing external probe stimuli to be delivered at different moments during development of intention and action. Several Brain Computer Interface applications have used motor imagery of repetitive actions to achieve this goal. These systems are relatively successful, but only if the intention is sustained over a period of several seconds; much longer than the timescales identified in psychophysiological studies for normal preparation for voluntary action. We have used a combination of sensorimotor rhythms and motor imagery training to decode intentions in a single-trial cued-response paradigm similar to those used in human and non-human primate motor control research. Decoding accuracy of over 0.83 was achieved with twelve participants. With this approach, we could decode intentions to move the left or right hand at sub-second timescales, both for instructed choices instructed by an external stimulus and for free choices generated intentionally by the participant. The implications for volition are considered."

However, biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of action of porcine endometrial CSF2 in peri-implantation events have not been elucidated. The aim of present study was to determine changes in cellular activities induced by CSFs and to access CSF2-induced intracellular signaling in porcine primary trophectoderm (pTr) cells. Differences in expression of CSF2 mRNA in endometrium from cyclic and pregnant gilts were evaluated. Endometrial CSF2 mRNA expression increases during the peri-implantation period, Days 10 to 14 of pregnancy, as compared to the estrous cycle. pTr cells obtained in Day 12 of pregnancy were cultured in the presence or absence of CSF2 (20 ng/ml) and LY294002 (20 µM), U0126 (20 µM), rapamycin (20 nM), and SB203580 (20 µM). CSF2 in pTr cell culture medium at 20 ng/ml significantly induced phosphorylation of AKT1, ERK1/2, MTOR, p70RSK and RPS6 protein, but not STAT3 protein. Also, the PI3K specific inhibitor (LY294002) abolished CSF2-induced increases in p-ERK1/2 and p-MTOR proteins, as well as CSF2-induced phosphorylation of AKT1. Changes in proliferation and migration of pTr cells in response to CSF2 were examined in dose- and time-response experiments. CSF2 significantly stimulated pTr cell proliferation and, U0126, rapamycin and LY294002 blocked this CSF2-induced proliferation of pTr cells. Collectively, during the peri-implantation phase of pregnancy in pigs, endometrial CSF2 stimulates proliferation of trophectoderm cells by activation of the PI3K-and ERK1/2 MAPK-dependent MTOR signal transduction cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2097869486,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of metabolism. While muscle-specific AMPK β1β2 double-knockout (β1β2M-KO) mice display alterations in metabolic and mitochondrial capacity, their severe exercise intolerance suggested a secondary contributor to the observed phenotype. We find that tibialis anterior (TA), but not soleus, muscles of sedentary β1β2M-KO mice display a significant myopathy (decreased myofiber areas, increased split and necrotic myofibers, and increased centrally nucleated myofibers. A mitochondrial- and fiber-type-specific etiology to the myopathy was ruled out. However, β1β2M-KO TA muscles displayed significant (P<0.05) increases in platelet aggregation and apoptosis within myofibers and surrounding interstitium (P<0.05). These changes correlated with a 45% decrease in capillary density (P<0.05). We hypothesized that the β1β2M-KO myopathy in resting muscle resulted from impaired AMPK-nNOSμ signaling, causing increased platelet aggregation, impaired vasodilation, and, ultimately, ischemic injury. Consistent with this hypothesis, AMPK-specific phosphorylation (Ser1446) of nNOSμ was decreased in β1β2M-KO compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The AMPK-nNOSμ relationship was further demonstrated by administration of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) to β1β2-MKO muscles and C2C12 myotubes. AICAR significantly increased nNOSμ phosphorylation and nitric oxide production (P<0.05) within minutes of administration in WT muscles and C2C12 myotubes but not in β1β2M-KO muscles. These findings highlight the importance of the AMPK-nNOSμ pathway in resting skeletal muscle."

The number of AMI cases was calculated on a monthly basis. The risk of AMI was estimated for the pre-CSB period (January 2006 to April 2008) and was used as a reference point. Three post-intervention periods were examined: (1) post-CSB from May 2008 to April 2009 (12 months); (2) post-CSB from May 2009 to November 2009 (7 months); and (3) post-TTI from December 2009 to December 2010 (13 months). Relative risks (RR) of AMI were estimated for each post intervention periods by using a Poisson regression model. Mortality registries for the country attributed to myocardial infarction (MI) were obtained from January 2001 to December 2012. The annual percentage change (APC) of the number of deaths from MI was calculated using Joinpoint regression analysis.A total sample size of 2191 AMI cases was selected (monthly mean number of cases 36.52 ± 8.24 SD). Using the pre-CSB as a reference point (RR = 1.00), the relative risk of AMI during the first CSB period, the second CSB period and post-TTI were 0.982, 1.049, and 0.985, respectively. The APC of deaths from MI from January 2001 to April 2008 was 0.5%. From January 2001 to June 2010 the APC trend was 0.47% and from July 2010 to December 2012 the APC was -0.3%.The implementation of a CSB and TTI in Panama were associated with a decrease in tobacco consumption and a reduction of the RR of AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2018444430,"Research suggests that anxiety is maintained by an attentional bias to threat, and a growing base of evidence suggests that anxiety may additionally be associated with the deficient attentional processing of positive stimuli. The present study sought to examine whether such anxiety-linked attentional biases were associated with either stimulus driven or attentional control mechanisms of attentional selectivity. High and low trait anxious participants completed an emotional variant of an antisaccade task, in which they were required to prosaccade towards, or antisaccade away from a positive, neutral or threat stimulus, while eye movements were recorded. While low anxious participants were found to be slower to saccade in response to positive stimuli, irrespectively of whether a pro- or antisaccade was required, such a bias was absent in high anxious individuals. Analysis of erroneous antisaccades further revealed at trend level, that anxiety was associated with reduced peak velocity in response to threat. The findings suggest that anxiety is associated with the aberrant processing of positive stimuli, and greater compensatory efforts in the inhibition of threat. The findings further highlight the relevance of considering saccade peak velocity in the assessment of anxiety-linked attentional processing."

The results showed that exposure of the cells to BP-C1 for 48 h, significantly (P<0.001) reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis and activated caspase 8 and caspace 9. Moreover, gene expression experiments indicated that BP-C1 increased the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (CASP8AP1, TNFRSF21, NFkB2, FADD, BCL10 and CASP8) and lowered the level of mRNA transcripts of inhibitory apoptotic genes (BCL2L11, BCL2L2 and XIAP.

https://openalex.org/W2113180056,"Starch is the most important long-term reserve in trees, and the analysis of starch is therefore useful source of physiological information. Currently published protocols for wood starch analysis impose several limitations, such as long procedures and a neutralization step. The high-throughput standard protocols for starch analysis in food and feed represent a valuable alternative. However, they have not been optimised or tested with woody samples. These have particular chemical and structural characteristics, including the presence of interfering secondary metabolites, low reactivity of starch, and low starch content. In this study, a standard method for starch analysis used for food and feed (AOAC standard method 996.11) was optimised to improve precision and accuracy for the analysis of starch in wood. Key modifications were introduced in the digestion conditions and in the glucose assay. The optimised protocol was then evaluated through 430 starch analyses of standards at known starch content, matrix polysaccharides, and wood collected from three organs (roots, twigs, mature wood) of four species (coniferous and flowering plants). The optimised protocol proved to be remarkably precise and accurate (3%), suitable for a high throughput routine analysis (35 samples a day) of specimens with a starch content between 40 mg and 21 µg. Samples may include lignified organs of coniferous and flowering plants and non-lignified organs, such as leaves, fruits and rhizomes."

https://openalex.org/W2069130875,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) is an ATP-binding cassette drug pump that protects us from toxic compounds and confers multidrug resistance. Each homologous half contains a transmembrane domain with six transmembrane segments followed by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The drug- and ATP-binding sites reside at the interface between the transmembrane domain and NBDs, respectively. Drug binding activates ATPase activity by an unknown mechanism. There is no high resolution structure of human P-gp, but homology models based on the crystal structures of bacterial, mouse, and Caenorhabditis elegans ATP-binding cassette drug pumps yield both open (NBDs apart) and closed (NBDs together) conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that the NBDs can be separated over a range of distances (over 20 Å). To determine the distance that show high or low ATPase activity, we cross-linked reporter cysteines L175C (N-half) and N820C (C-half) with cross-linkers of various lengths that separated the halves between 6 and 30 Å (α-carbons). We observed that ATPase activity increased over 10-fold when the cysteines were cross-linked at distances between 6 and 19 Å, although cross-linking at distances greater than 20 Å yielded basal levels of activity. The results suggest that the ATPase activation switch appears to be turned on or off when L175C/N820 are clamped at distances less than or greater than 20 Å, respectively. We predict that the high/low ATPase activity switch may occur at a distance where the NBDs are predicted in molecular dynamic simulations to undergo pronounced twisting as they approach each other (Wise, J. G. (2012) Biochemistry 51, 5125-5141)."

Better understanding of the phenotype and function of circulating CD8 cells in HIV patients will contribute to new targeted therapies directed at increasing CD8 T cell lytic effector function and destruction of the viral reservoir. We show that CD8 T cells from ART treated patients had sharply reduced expression of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule-1), a marker associated with cytolytic function whereas elite patients who control HIV in the absence of ART had CD56+ CD8 T cell levels similar to uninfected controls. The CD56+ CD8 T cells had higher perforin upregulation as well as degranulation following stimulation with HIV gag peptides compared with CD56 negative CD8 T cells. Elite patients had the highest frequencies of perforin producing CD56+ CD8 T cells among all HIV+ groups. In patients receiving ART we noted high levels of the exhaustion marker TIM-3 on CD56+ CD8 T cells, implying that defective effector function was related to immune exhaustion. CD56+ CD8 T cells from elite or treated HIV patients responded to PMA plus ionomycin stimulation, and expressed transcription factors T-bet and EOMES at levels similar to uninfected controls. Consequently, the lytic effector defect in chronic HIV disease is due to immune exhaustion and quantitative loss of CD56+ CD8 T cells and this defect is not repaired in patients where viremia is suppressed and CD4 T cells are recovered after ART. Reconstituting the cytotoxic CD56+ subset of CD8+ T cells through new interventions might improve the lytic effector capacity and contribute to reducing the viral reservoir. Our initial studies indicate that IL-15 treatment partly reverses the CD56 defect, implying that myeloid cell defects could be targeted for immune therapy during chronic HIV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2046892904,"Disease module is a group of molecular components that interact intensively in the disease specific biological network. Since the connectivity and activity of disease modules may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and disease progression, their identification becomes one of the most important challenges in network medicine, an emerging paradigm to study complex human disease. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, DiME (Disease Module Extraction), to identify putative disease modules from biological networks. We have developed novel heuristics to optimise Community Extraction, a module criterion originally proposed for social network analysis, to extract topological core modules from biological networks as putative disease modules. In addition, we have incorporated a statistical significance measure, B-score, to evaluate the quality of extracted modules. As an application to complex diseases, we have employed DiME to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the progression of glioma, the most common type of brain tumour. We have built low (grade II)--and high (GBM)--grade glioma co-expression networks from three independent datasets and then applied DiME to extract potential disease modules from both networks for comparison. Examination of the interconnectivity of the identified modules have revealed changes in topology and module activity (expression) between low- and high- grade tumours, which are characteristic of the major shifts in the constitution and physiology of tumour cells during glioma progression. Our results suggest that transcription factors E2F4, AR and ETS1 are potential key regulators in tumour progression.

https://openalex.org/W2004262699,"Background The existence of Tc17 cells was recently shown in several types of infectious and autoimmune diseases, but their distribution and functions in uterine cervical cancer (UCC) have not been fully elucidated. Methods The frequency of Tc17 cells in peripheral blood samples obtained from UCC patients, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients and healthy controls was determined by flow cytometry. Besides, the prevalence of Tc17 cells and their relationships to Th17 cells and Foxp3-expressing T cells as well as microvessels in tissue samples of the patients were assessed by immunohistochemistry staining. Results Compared to controls, patients with UCC or CIN had a higher proportion of Tc17 cells in both peripheral blood and cervical tissues, but the level of Tc17 cells in UCC tissues was significantly higher than that in CIN tissues. Besides, the increased level of Tc17 in UCC patients was associated with the status of pelvic lymph node metastases and increased microvessel density. Finally, significant correlations of infiltration between Tc17 cells and Th17 cells or Foxp3-expressing T cells were observed in UCC and CIN tissues. Conclusions This study indicates that Tc17 cell infiltration in cervical cancers is associated with cancer progression accompanied by increased infiltrations of Th17 cells and regulatory T cells as well as promoted tumor vasculogenesis."

In this study, we focused on plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), and chemically synthesized novel plumbagins conjugated with C2:0 to C22:6 fatty acids (5-O-acyl plumbagins). These chemically modified plumbagins enhanced mammalian pol inhibition and their cytotoxic activity. Plumbagin conjugated with chains consisting of more than C18-unsaturated fatty acids strongly inhibited the activities of calf pol α and human pol γ. Plumbagin conjugated with oleic acid (C18:1-acyl plumbagin) showed the strongest suppression of human colon carcinoma (HCT116) cell proliferation among the ten synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins. The inhibitory activity on pol α, a DNA replicative pol, by these compounds showed high correlation with their cancer cell proliferation suppressive activity. C18:1-Acyl plumbagin selectively inhibited the activities of mammalian pol species, but did not influence the activities of other pols and DNA metabolic enzymes tested. This compound inhibited the proliferation of various human cancer cell lines, and was the cytotoxic inhibitor showing strongest inhibition towards HT-29 colon cancer cells (LD50 = 2.9 µM) among the nine cell lines tested. In an in vivo anti-tumor assay conducted on nude mice bearing solid tumors of HT-29 cells, C18:1-acyl plumbagin was shown to be a promising tumor suppressor. These data indicate that novel 5-O-acyl plumbagins act as anti-cancer agents based on mammalian DNA replicative pol α inhibition. Moreover, the results suggest that acylation of plumbagin is an effective chemical modification to improve the anti-cancer activity of vitamin K3 derivatives, such as plumbagin."

We propose a very simple characterization of both local and global structural identifiability based on identifiability tables, with the purpose of providing a guideline for constructing arbitrarily complex, identifiable spring-dashpot networks. We illustrate how to use our results in a number of examples and point to some applications in cardiovascular modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2023056404,"Dihydromethanopterin reductase (Dmr) is a redox enzyme that plays a key role in generating tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) for use in one-carbon metabolism by archaea and some bacteria. DmrB is a bacterial enzyme understood to reduce dihydromethanopterin (H2MPT) to H4MPT using flavins as the source of reducing equivalents, but the mechanistic details have not been elucidated previously. Here we report the crystal structure of DmrB from Burkholderia xenovorans at a resolution of 1.9 Å. Unexpectedly, the biological unit is a 24-mer composed of eight homotrimers located at the corners of a cubic cage-like structure. Within a homotrimer, each monomer-monomer interface exhibits an active site with two adjacently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) ligands, one deeply buried and tightly bound and one more peripheral, for a total of 48 ligands in the biological unit. Computational docking suggested that the peripheral site could bind either the observed FMN (the electron donor for the overall reaction) or the pterin, H2MPT (the electron acceptor for the overall reaction), in configurations ideal for electron transfer to and from the tightly bound FMN. On this basis, we propose that DmrB uses a ping-pong mechanism to transfer reducing equivalents from FMN to the pterin substrate. Sequence comparisons suggested that the catalytic mechanism is conserved among the bacterial homologs of DmrB and partially conserved in archaeal homologs, where an alternate electron donor is likely used. In addition to the mechanistic revelations, the structure of DmrB could help guide the development of anti-obesity drugs based on modification of the ecology of the human gut."

CGNs that fail to receive excitatory inputs will die by apoptosis. This process could be mimicked in culture by exposing CGNs to either a physiological concentration of KCl (5 mm or K5) plus N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or to 25 mm KCl (K25). We have previously described that a 24-h exposure to NMDA (100 μm) or K25 at 2 days in vitro induced long term survival of CGNs in K5 conditions. Here we have studied the molecular mechanisms activated at 2 days in vitro in these conditions. First we showed that NMDA or K25 addition promoted a rapid stimulation of PI3K and a biphasic phosphorylation on Ser-473 of Akt, a PI3K substrate. Interestingly, we demonstrated that only the first wave of Akt phosphorylation is necessary for the NMDA- and K25-mediated survival. Additionally, we detected that both NMDA and K25 increased ERK activity with a similar time-course. Moreover, our results showed that NMDA-mediated activation of the small G-protein Ras is necessary for PI3K/Akt pathway activation, whereas Rap1 was involved in NMDA phosphorylation of ERK. On the other hand, Ras, but not Rap1, mediates K25 activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways. Because neuroprotection by NMDA or K25 is mediated by Ras (and not by Rap1) activation, we propose that Ras stimulation is a crucial event in NMDA- and K25-mediated survival of CGNs through the activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2155286804,"Approximately 15-30% of all breast cancer tumors are estrogen receptor negative (ER-). Compared with ER-positive (ER+) disease they have an earlier age at onset and worse prognosis. Despite the vast number of risk variants identified for numerous cancer types, only seven loci have been unambiguously identified for ER-negative breast cancer. With the aim of identifying new susceptibility SNPs for this disease we performed a pleiotropic genome-wide association study (GWAS). We selected 3079 SNPs associated with a human complex trait or disease at genome-wide significance level (P<5 × 10(-8)) to perform a secondary analysis of an ER-negative GWAS from the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), including 1998 cases and 2305 controls from prospective studies. We then tested the top ten associations (i.e. with the lowest P-values) using three additional populations with a total sample size of 3509 ER+ cases, 2543 ER- cases and 7031 healthy controls. None of the 3079 selected variants in the BPC3 ER-GWAS were significant at the adjusted threshold. 186 variants were associated with ER- breast cancer risk at a conventional threshold of P<0.05, with P-values ranging from 0.049 to 2.3 × 10(-4). None of the variants reached statistical significance in the replication phase. In conclusion, this study did not identify any novel susceptibility loci for ER-breast cancer using a ""pleiotropic approach""."
https://openalex.org/W2071676558,"The northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NGSL) stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), historically the second largest cod population in the Western Atlantic, has known a severe collapse during the early 1990 s and is currently considered as endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. As for many fish populations over the world which are currently being heavily exploited or overfished, urgent management actions in the form of recovery plans are needed for restoring this stock to sustainable levels. Stochastic projections based on a statistical population model incorporating predation were conducted over a period of 30 years (2010–2040) to assess the expected outcomes of alternative fishing strategies on the stock recovery under different scenarios of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) abundance and environmental conditions. This sensitivity study shows that water temperature is key in the rebuilding of the NGSL cod stock. Model projections suggest that maintaining the current management practice under cooler water temperatures is likely to maintain the species in an endangered status. Under current or warmer conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, partial recovery might only be achieved by significant reductions in both fishing and predation pressure. In the medium-term, a management strategy that reduces catch could be favoured over a complete moratorium so as to minimize socio-economic impacts on the industry."
