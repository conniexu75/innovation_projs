https://openalex.org/W2169224393,"PPARγ is a member of the PPAR subfamily of nuclear receptors. In this work, the structure of the human PPARγ cDNA and gene was determined, and its promoters and tissue-specific expression were functionally characterized. Similar to the mouse, two PPAR isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, were detected in man. The relative expression of human PPARγ was studied by a newly developed and sensitive reverse transcriptase-competitive polymerase chain reaction method, which allowed us to distinguish between PPARγ1 and γ2 mRNA. In all tissues analyzed, PPARγ2 was much less abundant than PPARγ1. Adipose tissue and large intestine have the highest levels of PPARγ mRNA; kidney, liver, and small intestine have intermediate levels; whereas PPARγ is barely detectable in muscle. This high level expression of PPARγ in colon warrants further study in view of the well established role of fatty acid and arachidonic acid derivatives in colonic disease. Similarly as mouse PPARγs, the human PPARγs are activated by thiazolidinediones and prostaglandin J and bind with high affinity to a PPRE. The human PPARγ gene has nine exons and extends over more than 100 kilobases of genomic DNA. Alternate transcription start sites and alternate splicing generate the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 mRNAs, which differ at their 5′-ends. PPARγ1 is encoded by eight exons, and PPARγ2 is encoded by seven exons. The 5′-untranslated sequence of PPARγ1 is comprised of exons A1 and A2, whereas that of PPARγ2 plus the additional PPARγ2-specific N-terminal amino acids are encoded by exon B, located between exons A2 and A1. The remaining six exons, termed 1 to 6, are common to the PPARγ1 and γ2. Knowledge of the gene structure will allow screening for PPARγ mutations in humans with metabolic disorders, whereas knowledge of its expression pattern and factors regulating its expression could be of major importance in understanding its biology.

White adipose tissue is composed of adipocytes, which play a central role in lipid homeostasis and the maintenance of energy balance in vertebrates. These cells store energy in the form of triglycerides during periods of nutritional affluence and release it in the form of free fatty acids at times of nutritional deprivation. Excess of white adipose tissue leads to obesity (1Auwerx J. Martin G. Guerre-Millo G. Staels B. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Flier J.S.

Med. 1991; 325: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In contrast to the development of brown adipose tissue, which mainly takes place before birth, the development of white adipose tissue is the result of a continuous differentiation/development process throughout life (2Flier J.S.

S29–S37.Google Scholar). During development, cells that are pluripotent become increasingly restricted to specific differentiation pathways. Adipocyte differentiation results from coordinate changes in the expression of several proteins, which are mostly involved in lipid storage and metabolism, that give rise to the characteristic adipocyte phenotype. The changes in expression of these specialized proteins are mainly the result of alterations in the transcription rates of their genes. Several transcription factors including the nuclear receptor PPARγ (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

In contrast to the wide tissue distribution of the various C/EBPs, PPARγ has been shown to have an adipose-restricted pattern of expression in mouse. The currently favored hypothesis is that C/EBPβ and δ induce the expression of PPARγ (11Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), which then triggers the adipogenic program. Terminal differentiation then requires the concerted action of both PPARγ, C/EBPα, and ADD-1/SREBP1 (7Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar,15Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Several arguments support the important role of PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation. First, overexpression of PPARγ by itself can induce adipocyte conversion of fibroblasts (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARγ together with C/EBPα can induce transdifferentiation of myoblasts into adipocytes (19Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Second, the description of functional PPREs in the regulatory sequences of several of the genes that are induced during adipocyte differentiation, such as the genes coding for adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, aP2 (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (20Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) (21Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J.

Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), is consistent with the crucial role attributed to PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation. Finally, PPAR activators, such as fibrates (24Brandes R. Hertz R. Arad R. Naishtat S. Weil S. Bar-Tana J. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Gharbi-Chibi J.

In this context, it is interesting to note that prostanoids, which are potent inducers of adipose differentiation programs (30Gaillard D. Negrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Negrel R. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Aubert J. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), may be one of the natural ligands of PPARγ. In addition to PPARγ, PPARα, but not PPARδ, has been shown to have some, albeit weaker, adipogenic activity (33Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To better understand the physiological role of PPARγ in human physiology, it is crucial that we gain insight into the regulation of PPARγ gene expression in man. Therefore, we cloned the human PPARγ cDNAs, determined the structure of the human PPARγ gene, and studied the expression of the PPARγ mRNAs and the regulation of their promoter. Both PPARγ1 and 2 are produced in human tissues but PPARγ2 appears to be the minor isoform in man. In addition to adipose tissue, which contains high levels of PPARγ, we demonstrate high level expression of human PPARγ in the colon. The structure of the gene encoding the mouse and human PPARγs is highly conserved. Furthermore our results demonstrate that 3 and 1 kb of DNA upstream of the transcription start sites of PPARγ1 and γ2, respectively, are sufficient to control basal and tissue-specific PPARγ gene expression.

After hybridization, filters were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 20 °C and twice for 30 min in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (X-OMAT-AR, Kodak). Of several positive clones, one clone 407 was characterized in detail. The insert of this clone, starting ±90 bp upstream of the ATG start codon and extending downstream into the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) sequence, was subcloned in the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK− to generate clone 407.2. Sequence analysis of 407.2 confirmed it as being the human homologue of the mouse PPARγ2 cDNA. While this work was in progress, other groups also reported the isolation of human PPARγ2 cDNA clones (34Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M.D. Moller D.E. Berger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 35Lambe K.G. Tugwood J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To isolate genomic P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones containing the entire human PPARγ gene, the primer pair LF-3 and LF-14 was used to amplify an 86-bp probe with human genomic DNA as template. This fragment was then used to screen a PAC human genomic library from human foreskin fibroblasts. Three positive clones, P-8854, P-8855, and P-8856, were isolated. Restriction digestion and Southern blotting were performed according to classical protocols as described by Sambrook et al. (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing reactions were performed, according to the manufacturer instructions, using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The oligonucleotide LF-35 was32P-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Life Science, Inc) to a specific activity of 107 dpm/50 ng and purified by gel electrophoresis. For primer extension, 105dpm of oligonucleotide was added in a final volume of 100 μl to 50 μg of adipose tissue total RNA isolated from different patients. Primer extension analysis was performed following standard protocols utilizing a mixture of 1.25 units of avian mycloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A sequencing reaction and molecular mass standards were used to map the 5′-end of the extension products. The Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) was used to obtain a library of adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA from human adipose tissue. 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was used as a template for the first strand synthesis, with the 52-mer CDS primer and 100 units of the MMLV reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 10 μl. Synthesis was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h. Next, the second strand was synthetized at 16 °C for 90 min in a total volume of 80 μl containing the enzyme mixture (RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and E. coli DNA ligase), the second strand buffer, the dNTP mix, and the first strand reaction. cDNA ends were then made blunt by adding to the reaction 10 units of T4 DNA polymerase and incubating at 16 °C for 45 min. The double-stranded cDNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 10 μl of water. Half of this volume was used to ligate the adaptor to the cDNA ends (adaptor sequence CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT) in a total volume of 10 μl using 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase. The ligation reaction was incubated 16 h at 16 °C. The resulting cDNA library was diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The 5′-end of PPARγ1 was PCR-amplified using 5 μl of the library as a template with the oligonucleotides AP-1 (binding to the adaptor) and LF-45 (binding antisense to the 5′-end of the PPARγ1). After an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles were done at the following conditions: 10 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The resulting PCR product was reamplified for 30 additional cycles at the same conditions using the nested oligonucleotides AP2 (nested to AP1) and LF-2 (nested to LF-45). The PCR product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, treated withPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript SK+. A total of 20 white colonies were grown and sequenced from both ends using the oligonucleotides T3 and T7 (Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit, Applied Biosystems). For the determination of the 5′-end of PPARγ2, the same procedure was followed except that the oligonucleotide LF-14 (specific for the PPARγ2 5′-UTR) was used in the first round PCR, and the oligonucleotide LF-35 (nested to LF-14) was used in the second round PCR with the same cycling conditions. Omental adipose tissue, small and large intestine, kidney, muscle, and liver biopsies were obtained from non-obese adult subjects undergoing elective surgery or endoscopy. All subjects had fasted overnight before surgery (between 8.00 p.m. and 10 a.m.) and received intravenous saline infusion. They had given informed consent, and the project was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Lille. All tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA preparation. Standard cell culture conditions were used to maintain 3T3-L1 (obtained from ATCC), CV-1 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), and Hep G2 cells (ATCC). BRL-49,653, supplied by Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA (in DMSO) and fatty acids (in ethanol) were added to the medium at the concentrations and times indicated. Control cells received vehicle only. Fatty acids were complexed to serum albumin contained in delipidated and charcoal-treated fetal calf serum by preincubation for 45 min at 37 °C. RNA preparation of total cellular RNA was performed as described previously (37Saladin R. De Vos P. Guerre-Millo M. Leturque A. Girard J. Staels B. Auwerx J. Nature. 1995; 377: 527-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The absolute mRNA concentration of the differentially spliced PPARγ variants was measured by reverse transcription reaction followed by competitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-competitive PCR) in the presence of known amounts of competitor DNA yielding amplicons of different size allowing the separation and the quantification of the PCR products. The competitor was constructed by deletion of a 74-bp fragment (nucleotides +433 to +507 by HindIII digestion) of PPARγ1 cloned into pBluescript KS+, yielding pBSCompPPARγ. Working solution of the competitor was prepared by in vitro transcription followed by serial dilution in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA buffer. For RT-competitive PCR, the antisense primer hybridized to the 3′-end of exon 3 (γAS:5′-GCATTATGAGCATCCCCAC-3′, nt +600 to +620) and the sense primer to exon 1 (γS:5′-TCTCTCCGTAATGGAAGACC-3′, nt +146 to +165) or to the B exon (γ2S:5′-GCGATTCCTTCACTGATAC-3′, nt +41 to +59). Therefore, the same competitor served to measure either total PPARγ mRNAs (γ1 + γ2; with primers γAS and γS) or, specifically, PPARγ2 mRNA (with primers γAS and γ2S). The γAS/γS primer pair gave PCR products of 474 and 400 bp for the PPARγ mRNAs and competitor, respectively. The primer pair γAS/γ2S gave 580 bp for PPARγ2 mRNA and 506 bp for the competitor. For analysis of the PCR products, the sense primers γS and γ2S were 5′-end labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy-5 (Eurogentec, Belgium). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed from total RNA (0.1 μg) in the presence of the antisense primer γAS (15 pmol) and of thermostable reverse transcriptase (2.5 units; Tth DNA polymerase, Promega) as described (38Vidal H. Auboeuf D. De Vos P. Staels B. Riou J.P. Auwerx J. Laville M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After the reaction, half of the RT volume was added to the PCR mix (90 μl) containing the primer pair γAS/γS for the assay of PPARγ total mRNA, whereas the other half was added to a PCR mix (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 mm KCl, 0.75 m EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm dNTP, 5 units of Taq polymerase) containing the primer pair γAS/γ2S for the assay of PPARγ2 mRNA. Four aliquots (20 μl) of the mixture were then transferred to microtubes containing a different, but known, amount of competitor. After 120 s at 95 °C, the samples were subjected to 40 PCR cycles (40 s at 95 °C, 50 s at 55 °C, and 50 s at 72 °C). The fluorescent-labeled PCR products were analyzed by 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an automated laser fluorescence DNA sequencer (ALFexpress, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and integration of the area under the curve using the Fragment manager software (Pharmacia) was performed as described (38Vidal H. Auboeuf D. De Vos P. Staels B. Riou J.P. Auwerx J. Laville M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To validate this technique, human PPARγ2 mRNA was synthesized byin vitro transcription from the expression vector pSG5hPPARγ (Riboprobe system, Promega) and quantified by competitive PCR over a wide range of concentrations (0.25–25 attomole (amol) added in the RT reaction). Standard curves obtained when assaying PPARγ total mRNA or PPARγ2 mRNA are shown in Fig. 2 C. The linearity (r = 0.99) and the slopes of the standard curves (0.98 and 1.11) indicated that the RT-competitive PCR is quantitative and that all the mRNA molecules are copied into cDNA during the RT step. The lower limit of the assay was about 0.05 amol of mRNA in the RT reaction, and the interassay variation of the RT-competitive PCR was 7% with six separated determinations of the same amount of PPARγ mRNA. Cells and tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Tissues were homogenized in extraction buffer containing PBS and 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), 0.1% SDS (Sigma). Fresh mixture protease inhibitor (ICN) was added (100 mg/ml AEBSF, 5 mg/ml EDTA, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin). Protein extracts were obtained by centrifugation of the lysate at 4 °C, and concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad DC Protein colorimetric assay system. Protein (100 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Life Science, Inc.), and blocked overnight in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Tween-20, 10% skim milk). Filters were first incubated for 4 h at room temperature with rabbit IgG anti-mPPARγ (10 mg/ml), raised against an N-terminal PPARγ peptide (amino acids 20–104), and next developed for 1 h at room temperature with a goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) diluted at 1/500. The complex was visualized with 4-chloro-1-naphtol as reagent. To test the activity of the human PPARγ promoters several reporter constructs were made. A 1-kb fragment of PAC clone 8856 was isolated by PCR using the oligonucleotides LF-35 (binding antisense in the PPARγ2 5′-UTR) and the oligonucleotide LF-58 (binding sense at position -1000 of the PPARγ2), was sequenced, and was inserted intoEcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After digestion of plasmid pBSγ2p1000 with SmaI andKpnI, the insert was cloned into the reporter vector pGL3 (Promega), creating the expression vector pGL3γ2p1000. To isolate the PPARγ1 promoter, an 8-kb EcoRI fragment, which hybridized with the oligonucleotide LF-2 (corresponding to the 5′-UTR of γ1), was cloned into pBluescript. Partial mapping and sequencing of this clone revealed the presence of a 3-kb fragment upstream of the transcription initiation site. To test for promoter activity, aSacI/XhoI digestion of this clone containing the 3-kb promoter was inserted in the same sites of pGL3, resulting in the final vector pGL3γ1p3000.

https://openalex.org/W2035508242,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and caveolin-1 are associated within endothelial plasmalemmal caveolae. It is not known, however, whether eNOS and caveolin-1 interact directly or indirectly or whether the interaction affects eNOS activity. To answer these questions, we have cloned the bovine caveolin-1 cDNA and have investigated the eNOS-caveolin-1 interaction in an in vitro binding assay system using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin-1 fusion proteins and baculovirus-expressed bovine eNOS. We have also mapped the domains involved in the interaction using an in vivo yeast two-hybrid system. Results obtained using both in vitro and in vivo protein interaction assays show that both N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains of caveolin-1 interact directly with the eNOS oxygenase domain. Interaction of eNOS with GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins significantly inhibits enzyme catalytic activity. A synthetic peptide corresponding to caveolin-1 residues 82-101 also potently and reversibly inhibits eNOS activity by interfering with the interaction of the enzyme with Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM). Regulation of eNOS in endothelial cells, therefore, may involve not only positive allosteric regulation by Ca2+/CaM, but also negative allosteric regulation by caveolin-1."

Transepithelial excretion of organic anions occurs via their accumulative transport from the blood into the proximal tubule cells across the basolateral membrane and subsequent secretion into the urine through the apical membrane. Here we report on the isolation of a novel complementary DNA from rat kidney that encodes a 551-amino acid residue protein (OAT1) with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. When expressed in Xenopus laevisoocytes, OAT1 mediated sodium-independent para-aminohippurate (PAH) uptake (K m = 14.3 ± 2.9 μm). The uptake rate of PAH was increased by the outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient, consisting with the idea that OAT1 is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger. OAT1 displayed remarkably wide substrate selectivity, covering endogenous substrates such as cyclic nucleotides, a prostaglandin and uric acid, and a variety of drugs with different structures (e.g. antibiotics, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diuretics, an antineoplastic drug, and a uricosuric drug). The Northern blot analysis and in situhybridization revealed that OAT1 is exclusively expressed in the particular segment of the proximal tubule in the kidney. These data suggest that OAT1 is a multispecific organic anion transporter at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule.

These data suggest that OAT1 is a multispecific organic anion transporter at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule. Isolation of OAT1 will facilitate elucidation of the molecular basis of drug kinetics and the development of new drugs lacking unwanted side effects. The kidney plays an essential role in the elimination of numerous organic anions including endogenous compounds, xenobiotics, and their metabolites (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 2Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moller J.V. Sheikh M.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1983; 34: 315-358Google Scholar). The proximal tubule cells actively secrete them into the urine. The first step of this secretion is the extraction of organic anion from the peritubular blood plasma by the proximal tubule cells through the basolateral membrane. This basolateral uptake of organic anions has been extensively investigated using para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) 1The abbreviations used are: PAH, para-aminohippuric acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; kb, kilobase(s); oatp, organic anion transporting polypeptide. as a test substrate. The most striking feature of this organic anion transport system is its extremely wide substrate selectivity, covering not only endogenous anionic substrates but also a number of clinically important drugs (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 3Moller J.V. Sheikh M.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1983; 34: 315-358Google Scholar). Because of its importance in renal physiology and pharmacology, cloning of the organic anion transporter has been attempted by many investigators using different approaches; however, the molecular structure of the responsible transporter has not yet determined. For the last decade it has been proposed that the basolateral uptake of organic anion is mediated by organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar,4Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient is essential to express the transport activity of this exchanger. In the present study, we isolated first rat sodium dicarboxylate transporter (rNaDC-1) and then co-expressed it together with rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA in Xenopus oocytes to energize organic anion transport in oocytes. We describe here functional expression cloning of an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger (OAT1) and its characteristics as a multispecific organic anion transporter. A nondirectional cDNA library was prepared from rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA using Superscript Choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was ligated to λZipLox EcoRI arms (Life Technologies, Inc.). A polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to nucleotides 1323–1763 of the rabbit sodium dicarboxylate transporter (NaDC-1) (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was labeled with [32P]dCTP. A rat cDNA library was screened with this probe at low stringency. Hybridization was done overnight in the hybridization solution at 37 °C, and filters were washed finally at 37 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The hybridization solution contains 5 × SSC, 3 × Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide, 0.01% Antifoam B, 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 25 mm MES, pH 6.5. cDNA inserts in positive λZipLox phage were recovered in plasmid pZL1 by in vitro excision and further subcloned into pBluescript II SK− (Stratagene) for sequencing and in vitro transcription. Xenopus laevis oocyte expression studies and uptake measurements were performed as described elsewhere (6Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with in vitro transcribed cRNA and/or rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA as indicated in each experiment. In vitro transcription was done by using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of cap analog. After incubation of oocytes at 18 °C for 2–3 days, uptake studies were performed in sodium uptake solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing radiolabeled substrates as indicated in each experiment. Four-hundred μg of rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA was size-fractionated as described elsewhere (6Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar) using preparative gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, model 491 Prep cell). Then we co-injected poly(A)+ RNAs of each fraction together with rNaDC-1 cRNA into oocytes. Before the uptake study, the oocytes were routinely preincubated for 2 h in sodium uptake solution containing 1 mm glutarate. [14C]PAH (50 μm) uptake was measured in sodium uptake solution without glutarate for 1 h. A directional cDNA library was constructed from fractions showing the highest rate of [14C]PAH uptake (1.8–2.4-kilobase (kb) poly(A)+ RNA) using Superscript Plasmid system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was ligated into theSalI and NotI site of pSPORT 1. Recombinants were electroporated into Electro Max DH10B competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 500 colonies were grown on nitrocellulose membrane. Plasmid DNA was purified from colonies of each plate. Capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro after linearization of each plasmid DNA with NotI. Then we co-injected cRNA synthesized from each filter together with 2 ng of rNaDC-1 cRNA into oocytes. When [14C]PAH uptake was detected on a particular group, it was subdivided into several groups and further screened. Eight-thousand clones were screened until a single clone was isolated. Deleted clones obtained by Kilo-Sequence deletion kit (Takara, Japan), or specially synthesized oligonucleotide primers were used for sequencing of rNaDC1 and OAT1 cDNA. rNaDC1 and OAT1 were sequenced by dideoxytermination method using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Corp.) or dye primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The functional characterization of OAT1 was analyzed without co-expression of rNaDC-1 except for the experiment of which the results are shown in Fig.1 c. In experiments of Fig. 1, d and e, and Fig. 4, a and b, oocytes expressed with OAT1 were preincubated with 1 mm glutarate for 2 h before uptake studies were performed. For the determination of the sodium dependence of OAT1 transport activity, [14C]PAH uptake was measured either in sodium uptake solution or in choline chloride uptake solution (96 mm NaCl of sodium solution was replaced by 96 mm choline chloride, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris). For kinetic analysis, [14C]PAH influx was measured for 3 min. For inhibition study, 2 μm[14C]PAH uptake via OAT1 was measured in the absence or presence of 2 mm nonradiolabeled compounds in sodium uptake solution.Figure 4Substrate selectivity of OAT1. a, inhibition of OAT1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake by various drugs and endogenous substrates.

The filter was hybridized at 42 °C overnight in the hybridization solution with full-length OAT1 cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP. The filter was washed finally in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. In situ hybridization was performed as described elsewhere (7Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1087-F1092PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, after perfusion fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, rat kidney was excised and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Five-μm cryostat sections of rat kidney were used in situ hybridization.35S-Labeled sense and antisense cRNA were synthesized from the full-length OAT1 cDNA (in pBlueScript SK−) using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase after linearization of plasmid DNA withSpeI or XhoI, respectively. RNA probe was degraded by partial hydrolysis for 45 min. The cryosections were hybridized with the probe overnight in the hybridization solution and washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC at 37 °C for 30 min. Using an approach based on homology to rabbit sodium dicarboxylate transporter (NaDC-1) (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we isolated rNaDC-1 (rat sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter-1: accession number for the nucleotide sequence of cDNA: AB001321; DDBJ, EBI, and GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bases). When expressed inX. laevis oocytes, rNaDC-1 mediates sodium-dependent [14C]glutarate uptake (Fig.1 a). Then we co-injected X. laevisoocytes with rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA and cRNA of rNaDC-1 and preincubated them with 1 mm glutarate to induce generation of an outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient. These “co-expressed” oocytes exhibited [14C]PAH uptake, whereas oocytes injected with only rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA exhibited no detectable [14C]PAH uptake (Fig.1 b). Using a functional expression method together with this co-expression system, we isolated a 2294-base pair cDNA encoding an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger (OAT1: organic anion transporter 1). Fig. 1 c shows the dependence of OAT1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake on the intracellular dicarboxylate (glutarate) concentration. The rate of [14C]PAH uptake by oocytes via OAT1 is increased by preincubation of the oocytes with 1 mm glutarate. When oocytes co-expressing rNaDC-1 and OAT1 are preincubated with glutarate, they showed a further increase in the rate of [14C]PAH uptake. Thistrans-stimulative effect of glutarate indicates that OAT1 is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger. As shown in Fig.1 d, replacement of extracellular sodium with choline had no effect on the rate of [14C]PAH uptake. Because [14C]PAH (1 mm) uptake via OAT1 was linearly increased until 5 min under this condition (data not shown), we performed the kinetic study for 3 min. [14C]PAH uptake via OAT1 follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1 e), and the estimated K m value (14.3 ± 2.9 μm: mean ± S.E., n = 3) is similar to that previously reported for the basolateral organic anion transport system (80 μm) (2Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar). OAT1 cDNA consists of 2294 nucleotides, and contains an open reading frame encoding a 551-amino acid residue protein (Fig.2 a). Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (8Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of OAT1 predicts 12 putative membrane-spanning domains (Fig.2 b). Four N-glycosylation sites are predicted in the first hydrophilic loop. There are four putative protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites in the hydrophilic loop between sixth and seventh transmembrane domains. Under high stringency Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+RNA from rat various tissues, a strong 2.4-kb mRNA band and two bands corresponding to longer transcripts (3.9 and 4.2 kb) were detected predominantly in the kidney (Fig.3 a). Upon longer exposure, a faint 2.4-kb mRNA band was detected in the brain. No hybridization signals were obtained with mRNA isolated from other tissues. In the kidney, expression of OAT1 mRNA is strong in the cortex and outer medulla (cortex > outer medulla) and very weak in the inner medulla. In situ hybridization of rat kidney coronal sections (Fig.3 b) revealed that OAT1 mRNA is expressed in renal cortex and outer medulla, especially in the medullary rays of the cortex. Expression of OAT-1 was not found in the inner medulla. No significant hybridization signal was detected in control experiments using sense OAT1 cRNA as a probe (data not shown). This overall pattern of in situ hybridization suggests that OAT1 is most strongly expressed in the middle portion of the proximal tubule (S2). This intrarenal localization is in good agreement with the previous studies, which demonstrate that the highest PAH transport activity were seen in S2 of rat proximal tubule (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To evaluate the substrate selectivity of OAT1, we examined the levels of the inhibition of OAT1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake by various compounds (Fig. 4 a).cis-Inhibitory effects were observed for structurally unrelated drugs. Cephaloridine (β-lactam antibiotic), nalidixic acid (“old” quinolone), furosemide and ethacrynic acid (diuretics), indomethacin (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), probenecid (uricosuric drug), and valproic acid (antiepileptic drug) potently inhibited (>85%) OAT1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake by the oocytes. An antineoplastic drug, methotrexate, moderately inhibited the [14C]PAH uptake. Endogenous compounds, such as prostaglandin E2, cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, and uric acid also inhibited [14C]PAH uptake. We examined several radiolabeled compounds in terms of whether they are taken up into oocytes via OAT1. As Fig. 4 b shows, [3H]methotrexate, [3H]cAMP, [3H]cGMP, [3H]prostaglandin E2, [14C]urate and [14C]α-ketoglutarate were transported into the oocytes. No uptake of [14C]tetraethylammonium and [3H]taurocholic acid were detected (data not shown). The present study describes the isolation of cDNA encoding a rat renal organic anion transporter, OAT1. The results indicate that OAT1 possesses the same characteristics as the predicted organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger responsible for multispecific organic anion transport at the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubules. The anion exchange model of the renal organic anion transporter has been proposed within the last decade (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 4Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, organic anions are transported into the cell in exchange for intracellular dicarboxylates, which are subsequently returned into the cell via sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter. In the present report, we directly demonstrate the validity of this exchange model. Accumulated glutarate via sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter (rNaDC-1) stimulates [14C]PAH uptake via anion exchanger (OAT1) in Xenopus oocytes. These data explain indirect sodium coupling of renal organic anion transporter. Unexpectedly, a search of EBI/GenBank™ data base (January 31, 1997) revealed that the amino acid sequence of OAT1 shows weak (38%) identity to organic “cation” transporter (OCT1) (9Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The sequence of OAT1 shows no significant similarity with the members of the inorganic anion exchanger (AE) family. OCT1 is considered to be a facilitated transporter, and substrates transported by OCT1 are different from those of OAT1. Although OAT1 and OCT1 transport substrates having opposite charges, there is a common feature in which these two transporters interact with molecules possessing a certain size of hydrophobic cores. This common aspect may be relevant to the weak homology between OAT1 and OCT1. Structure function analysis of OAT1 and OCT1 may provide some clues as to the sites of proteins that recognize the charge(s) of the substrates. To date, at least two multispecific transporter families were identified. One is the ABC superfamily, which includes P-glycoprotein (10Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar), a multidrug resistance associated protein (11Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance associated protein extrude a range of anticancer drugs from cells via ATP hydrolysis and confer multidrug resistance on cancer cells. cMOAT is considered to mediate hepatobiliary excretion of organic anions; however, its functional characteristics have not yet been analyzed in detail. Another is the oatp (organic anion transporting polypeptide) superfamily, which includes a Na+-independent oatp isolated from rat liver (14Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar). We found no significant sequence similarity between OAT1 and other multispecific organic anion transporters, including cMOAT, oatp, and prostaglandin transporter. The structural and transport characteristics of OAT1 are distinct from those of the members of these two multispecific transporter superfamilies. Further investigation is required for clarification of the individual roles of the members of these three multispecific transporter superfamilies in drug delivery to and elimination from the body. Similar to the case in the kidney, anionic substrates should be transported in other organs, including liver and brain. In high stringency Northern blot analysis, however, no signals were detected except for the kidney and the brain. The liver plays a key role in the detoxification of many endogenous and exogenous compounds. Lipophilic xenobiotics are transported into hepatocytes and extensively biotransformed by P450- and transferase-mediated reactions. As a result, negatively charged amphiphilic compounds are produced, which must be secreted from the hepatocytes. Thus, the liver needs multispecific transporter(s) of anionic compounds (18Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G801-G812PubMed Google Scholar, 19Petzinger E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 47-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cMOAT and oatp may play certain roles in organic anion transport in the liver; however, the multiplicity of drug transport has never been fully explained (20Weinman S.A. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 21Horz J.A. Honscha W. Petzinger E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange systems in the liver and brain have been identified (22Boelsterli U.A. Zimmerli B. Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G797-G805PubMed Google Scholar, 23Adkison K.D. Shen D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1189-1200PubMed Google Scholar), and a search of a data base revealed the existence of a liver protein that is structurally related to OAT1 but whose function has not been determined (24Simonson G.D. Vincent A.C. Roberg K.J. Huang Y. Iwanij V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). Isoform(s) of OAT1 serving as organic anion transporters possibly exist in several organs. Identification of isoforms of OAT1 in other organs will facilitate the understanding of drug delivery and excretion system of the body and should provide useful tools for developing drugs that show desirable distribution in the body. The original role of OAT1 is presumed to be mediation of transport of endogenous anionic compounds, such as cyclic nucleotides, prostaglandin E2, and uric acid. A variety of anionic xenobiotics, such as drugs and food additives, are newly synthesized and administered to the body, which must be excreted. Because of its wide substrate selectivity, OAT1 fits the role of a xenobiotic transporter and can serve as an essential multispecific anionic drug transporter. Practically, expression of OAT1 in epithelial cell lines is expected to be useful for the development of in vitro assay systems for drug elimination and drug/drug interaction studies. Furthermore, such systems could be used for screening of drugs for nephrotoxicity, which is one of the most critical points in drug administration to the body. Many drugs that can cause acute renal failure, such as β-lactam antibiotics, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (25Walker R.J. Duggin G.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven, New York1992: 3571-3595Google Scholar), are transported by the organic anion transport system. One reason why such drugs are nephrotoxic may be related to their accumulation via OAT1. Isolation of OAT1, therefore, will facilitate elucidation of the molecular basis of pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics."

In this study we investigated the effect of Zn2+ on an earlier event in the apoptotic process, the proteolysis of the “death substrate” poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Pretreatment of intact Molt4 leukemia cells with micromolar concentrations of Zn2+caused an inhibition of PARP proteolysis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Using a cell-free system consisting of purified bovine PARP as a substrate and an apoptotic extract or recombinant caspase-3 as the PARP protease, Zn2+ inhibited PARP proteolysis in the low micromolar range. To rule out an effect of Zn2+ on PARP, a protein with two zinc finger domains, we used recombinant caspase-3 and a chromogenic tetrapeptide substrate containing the caspase-3 cleavage site. In this system, Zn2+ inhibited caspase-3 with an IC50 of 0.1 μm. These results identify caspase-3 as a novel target of Zn2+ inhibition in apoptosis and suggest a regulatory role for Zn2+ in modulating the upstream apoptotic machinery.

Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Normal development and tissue remodeling of multicellular organisms are dependent on apoptosis, whereas defects in this process have been implicated in a number of pathological conditions. The agents which induce cells to undergo apoptosis are diverse and include extracellular agents such as TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ICE, interleukin-1β converting enzyme; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ac-DEVD-pNA,N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ICE, interleukin-1β converting enzyme; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ac-DEVD-pNA,N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide. the Fas ligand, and chemotherapeutic agents. Intracellular agents which regulate apoptosis include proteases, phosphatases, and kinases, products of lipid metabolism, and the cations Ca2+ and Zn2+.The influence of Zn2+ on apoptosis is a well known phenomenon (2Sunderman F.W. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 25: 134-142Google Scholar). In both in vitro and in vivomodels, Zn2+ supplementation prevents apoptosis induced by a variety of agents (3Thomas D.J. Caffrey T.C. Toxicology. 1991; 68: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Matsushita K. Kitagawa K. Matsuyama T. Ohtsuki T. Taguchi A. Mandai K. Mabuchi T. Yagita Y. Yanagihara T. Matsumoto M. Brain Res. 1996; 743: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells grown under conditions of Zn2+ deficiency will undergo spontaneous apoptosis (5McCabe M.J. Jiang S.A.

Immunol. 1991; 83: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The protective effect of Zn2+ has been attributed to its inhibition of a Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (8Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar), thereby causing inhibition of DNA fragmentation, a terminal step and hallmark of apoptosis. However, a number of observations suggest the existence of other and perhaps more relevant targets for Zn2+. First, the concentrations of Zn2+ used to demonstrate anti-apoptotic effects in either intact cells or isolated nuclei have ranged from micromolar to millimolar levels. However, the concentrations of Zn2+ used for inhibition of the purified Ca2+-dependent endonuclease were in the millimolar range (9Gaido M.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18580-18585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, it has recently been reported that in L929 cells, Zn2+ inhibited both TNF-α- and etoposide-induced cytotoxicity, as assessed by methylene blue staining, prior to effects on DNA fragmentation (10Fady C. Gardner A. Jacoby F. Briskin K. Tu Y. Schmid I. Lichenstein A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, it is becoming more evident that the endonuclease functions in the “execution” rather than “regulation” phase of apoptosis, and therefore its inhibition may not prevent cell death. Fourth, Zn2+ has been demonstrated to inhibit the protease responsible for cleavage of lamins in cell-free extracts (11Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).Recent studies have pointed to a role for a family of caspase proteases (formerly the ICE/Ced-3 proteases) (12Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar) in apoptosis that act upstream of the endonuclease. Proteases in apoptosis came to the forefront with studies on the proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), initially described in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by various chemotherapeutic agents, including etoposide (13Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Dev I.K. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4895-4903PubMed Google Scholar). This event was later determined to be catalyzed by the protease resembling ICE (16Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). The human homolog of this protease has been cloned and is now known as caspase-3 (CPP32/yama/apopain).To determine if Zn2+ inhibits an event upstream of endonuclease activation, we investigated the effect of Zn2+on etoposide-induced apoptosis using PARP proteolysis as an indicator of this process. We show that Zn2+ is a potent inhibitor of PARP proteolysis in intact cells. We also demonstrate in a cell-free system that Zn2+ potently inhibits PARP proteolysis induced both by a caspase-3-containing apoptotic extract and by purified recombinant caspase-3. These results identify caspase-3 as a novel and proximal site of Zn2+ inhibition in the apoptotic pathway. Moreover, in light of results demonstrating a labile pool of Zn2+ in cells which is in rapid equilibrium with the extracellular medium (17Pattison S.E. Cousins R.J. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar), these findings raise the possibility that the cell may utilize Zn2+ as a regulator of the upstream apoptotic machinery.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine the effect of Zn2+ on etoposide-induced PARP proteolysis in intact cells, Molt4 culture medium was supplemented with varying doses of ZnCl2 prior to treatment of the cells with etoposide. The data in Fig. 1 indicate that Zn2+ caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PARP proteolysis with complete inhibition occurring at 100 μmZnCl2. Zn2+ treatment alone had no effect on PARP proteolysis (data not shown).To ascertain if the inhibitory action of Zn2+ was directly on PARP proteolysis, we used a cell-free system consisting of a soluble extract from etoposide-treated cells and bovine PARP as a substrate. We have previously used this system to study PARP proteolysis (19Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The soluble extract contains processed caspase-3 as shown by the data in Fig. 2. Caspase-3 is synthesized as an inactive 32-kDa zymogen (20Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During activation, the zymogen is cleaved to yield two subunits of 17 and 12 kDa which dimerize to form an active enzyme (21Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Using an antibody which recognizes both the zymogen and the 17-kDa subunit, the immunoblot in Fig. 2 demonstrates that processing of the zymogen was initiated between 2 and 3 h of etoposide treatment as assessed by the appearance of the 17-kDa subunit. This closely correlates with the induction of PARP proteolysis by etoposide in this cell line (19Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Figure 2Processing of pro-caspase-3 by etoposide. Molt4 cells of 5 × 105/ml were treated with 20 μm etoposide. At the indicated times, the cells were harvested and lysed, and the 100,000 × gsupernatant was analyzed for caspase-3 processing by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using an apoptotic extract from cells that had been treated for 6 h with etoposide, the results of Fig. 3 show that Zn2+ and Cu2+ caused complete inhibition of PARP proteolysis at a concentration of 10 μm. The effect was independent of the counter- ion as both ZnCl2 and ZnSO4, as well as CuCl2 and CuSO4, gave identical results. Furthermore, other cations including Ba2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ had no effect on PARP proteolysis. These results strongly suggest that the means by which Zn2+ inhibits PARP proteolysis is by acting directly on the PARP proteolysis step, either by inhibiting the protease(s) or by rendering PARP insensitive to proteolysis.Figure 3Cation effects on PARP proteolysis catalyzed by an apoptotic extract. Ten μg of an apoptotic extract (active cytosol) from cells treated with etoposide for 6 h were added to cell-free buffer containing the respective cations at the indicated concentrations. The reactions were then initiated by the addition of 25 ng of bovine PARP and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and processed for PARP proteolysis by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition and its target of action, we examined the effects of Zn2+ and other cations on PARP proteolysis catalyzed by purified recombinant caspase-3. The results in Fig. 4 indicate that the extent of inhibition of recombinant caspase-3 by Zn2+ is similar to the extent of inhibition observed on PARP protease activity using the apoptotic extract and that the cation profile is identical to that obtained in the apoptotic extract (Fig.3). 2We have also observed that the thiols dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol attenuate the inhibition observed with Zn2+. This is presumably due to the ability of these reagents to act as Zn2+ chelators (33Powers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11160-11165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition was also obtained with Cd2+ and Hg2+ (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Zn2+ directly inhibits PARP cleavage induced by caspase-3.Figure 4Cation effects on PARP proteolysis catalyzed by caspase-3. Forty ng of recombinant caspase-3 were added to cell-free buffer containing the respective cations at the indicated concentrations. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 25 ng of bovine PARP and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and processed for PARP proteolysis by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PARP is a nuclear enzyme that contains two zinc finger domains near its amino terminus. It has been demonstrated that Zn2+ is required for PARP binding to damaged DNA (22Mazen A. Menissier de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Gradwohl G. Poirier G. de Murcia G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, the influence of Zn2+ on the ability of PARP to serve as a substrate for caspase-3 has not been investigated. To eliminate the possibility that Zn2+ binding to the zinc finger domains of PARP may render it insensitive to proteolysis, we utilized a chromogenic tetrapeptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-pNA, containing the caspase-3 cleavage site in PARP and lacking the zinc finger domains. The results from Fig.5 demonstrate that Zn2+ inhibited the cleavage of this substrate by the apoptotic extract with an IC50 value of nearly 1 μm (filled circles). A more potent inhibition by Zn2+(IC50 ≈0.1 μm) was observed when recombinant caspase-3 was used as the protease (open circles). These results provide strong evidence that the Zn2+ inhibition of PARP proteolysis is due to its inhibition of caspase-3 and not to a modification of the PARP substrate.Figure 5Zn2+ effects on Ac-DEVD-pNA proteolysis catalyzed by an apoptotic extract or by recombinant caspase-3. Twenty μg of an apoptotic extract from etoposide-treated cells (filled circles) or 280 ng of recombinant caspase-3 (open circles) were added to buffer containing the indicated concentrations of ZnCl2. Reactions were then initiated by the addition of Ac-DEVD-pNA to a final concentration of 200 μm and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Product formation (protease activity) was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mechanism by which Zn2+ inhibits caspase-3 awaits further studies. However, investigations on the crystal structure of ICE have suggested that His-237 and Cys-285 are involved in catalysis (23Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Hackett M.C. Hammill L.D. Herzog L. Hugunin M. Houy W. Mankovich J.A. McGuiness L. Orlewicz E. Paskind M. Pratt C.A. Reis P. Summani A. Terranova M. Welch J.P. Xiong L. Moller A. Tracey D.E. Kamen R. Wong W.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in all the caspase family members identified to date (24Kamens J. Paskind M. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Allen H. Banach D. Bump N. Hackett M. Johnston C.G. Li P. Mankovich J.A. Terranova N. Ghayur T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15250-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Given the affinity of these amino acids for Zn2+, it is possible that Zn2+ inhibits caspase-3 by coordinating with one or both of these conserved sites. Moreover, Zn2+ inhibition of caspase-3 in the mid-nanomolar to low micromolar range is indicative of Zn2+ binding to a single (or perhaps two) amino acid residue, whereas the tetrahedral coordination of Zn2+ found in many Zn2+ finger domains is characterized by a much greater affinity (k d ≈10−9–10−12m).It has previously been reported that Zn2+ does not inhibit caspase-3 activity (11Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The reason(s) for the discrepancy with our results is unclear but a possible explanation is that we have used purified recombinant caspase-3 in our study, whereas in the referred study an E. coli lysate containing the recombinant enzyme was used. Therefore, it is possible that the lysate contained factors which were responsible for mitigating the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on caspase-3.In the family of caspase proteases, caspase-3 has the highest homology to the Ced-3 protease which is required for developmental cell death inCaenorhabditis elegans (20Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also activated by a variety of agents that induce apoptosis including TNF-α (25Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), Fas (26Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and chemotherapy agents such as etoposide (27Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in a cell-free system comprised of apoptotic extracts and healthy nuclei, the presence of caspase-3 in the apoptotic extract was necessary to induce apoptotic changes in the nuclei (21Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Also, it has recently been demonstrated that knockout mice which are lacking caspase-3 incur severe abnormalities in the development of the nervous system (28Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S.Q. Kuan C.Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Thus, the relevance of these data in demonstrating a novel inhibitory site for Zn2+ in apoptosis is underscored by the fact that caspase-3 is both an important and common effector of the apoptotic machinery.The question arises as to whether the concentrations of Zn2+ required to inhibit caspase-3 in this study are attainable within the cell. It has been determined that serum Zn2+ concentrations are 10–15 μm (29Failla M.L. Cousins R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 538: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and that the free Zn2+ concentration in serum is approximately 1 μm (30Lentner C. Scientific Tables. 8th Ed. CIBA-Geigy, Ardsley, NY1981: 79-88Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular Zn2+ concentration has been estimated at 100 μm (17Pattison S.E. Cousins R.J. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly 10% of this (≈10 μm) exists in a labile pool which is in equilibrium with various Zn2+-binding proteins. Therefore, the intracellular levels of free Zn2+ may be in the range necessary to inhibit caspase-3. Currently, little is known about changes in intracellular Zn2+ or its movement between compartments, but new classes of Zn2+-responsive fluorophores appear to be promising in gaining new insight into this area (31Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 557-578Google Scholar).The results reported herein, in conjunction with a recent report demonstrating that treatment of T cells with a Zn2+chelator is able to induce caspase-3 activation (32Jiang S. Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Gahm A. Chow S.C. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggest that physiologic modulation of intracellular Zn2+ may have important consequences for the regulation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a genetically programmed process of cell death characterized by a series of distinct morphological changes (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Normal development and tissue remodeling of multicellular organisms are dependent on apoptosis, whereas defects in this process have been implicated in a number of pathological conditions. The agents which induce cells to undergo apoptosis are diverse and include extracellular agents such as TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ICE, interleukin-1β converting enzyme; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ac-DEVD-pNA,N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ICE, interleukin-1β converting enzyme; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ac-DEVD-pNA,N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide. the Fas ligand, and chemotherapeutic agents. Intracellular agents which regulate apoptosis include proteases, phosphatases, and kinases, products of lipid metabolism, and the cations Ca2+ and Zn2+. The influence of Zn2+ on apoptosis is a well known phenomenon (2Sunderman F.W. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 25: 134-142Google Scholar).

However, the concentrations of Zn2+ used for inhibition of the purified Ca2+-dependent endonuclease were in the millimolar range (9Gaido M.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18580-18585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, it has recently been reported that in L929 cells, Zn2+ inhibited both TNF-α- and etoposide-induced cytotoxicity, as assessed by methylene blue staining, prior to effects on DNA fragmentation (10Fady C. Gardner A. Jacoby F. Briskin K. Tu Y. Schmid I. Lichenstein A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, it is becoming more evident that the endonuclease functions in the “execution” rather than “regulation” phase of apoptosis, and therefore its inhibition may not prevent cell death. Fourth, Zn2+ has been demonstrated to inhibit the protease responsible for cleavage of lamins in cell-free extracts (11Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Recent studies have pointed to a role for a family of caspase proteases (formerly the ICE/Ced-3 proteases) (12Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar) in apoptosis that act upstream of the endonuclease. Proteases in apoptosis came to the forefront with studies on the proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), initially described in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by various chemotherapeutic agents, including etoposide (13Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Dev I.K. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4895-4903PubMed Google Scholar). This event was later determined to be catalyzed by the protease resembling ICE (16Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). The human homolog of this protease has been cloned and is now known as caspase-3 (CPP32/yama/apopain). To determine if Zn2+ inhibits an event upstream of endonuclease activation, we investigated the effect of Zn2+on etoposide-induced apoptosis using PARP proteolysis as an indicator of this process. We show that Zn2+ is a potent inhibitor of PARP proteolysis in intact cells. We also demonstrate in a cell-free system that Zn2+ potently inhibits PARP proteolysis induced both by a caspase-3-containing apoptotic extract and by purified recombinant caspase-3. These results identify caspase-3 as a novel and proximal site of Zn2+ inhibition in the apoptotic pathway. Moreover, in light of results demonstrating a labile pool of Zn2+ in cells which is in rapid equilibrium with the extracellular medium (17Pattison S.E. Cousins R.J. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar), these findings raise the possibility that the cell may utilize Zn2+ as a regulator of the upstream apoptotic machinery. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine the effect of Zn2+ on etoposide-induced PARP proteolysis in intact cells, Molt4 culture medium was supplemented with varying doses of ZnCl2 prior to treatment of the cells with etoposide. The data in Fig. 1 indicate that Zn2+ caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PARP proteolysis with complete inhibition occurring at 100 μmZnCl2. Zn2+ treatment alone had no effect on PARP proteolysis (data not shown).To ascertain if the inhibitory action of Zn2+ was directly on PARP proteolysis, we used a cell-free system consisting of a soluble extract from etoposide-treated cells and bovine PARP as a substrate. We have previously used this system to study PARP proteolysis (19Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The soluble extract contains processed caspase-3 as shown by the data in Fig. 2. Caspase-3 is synthesized as an inactive 32-kDa zymogen (20Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During activation, the zymogen is cleaved to yield two subunits of 17 and 12 kDa which dimerize to form an active enzyme (21Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Using an antibody which recognizes both the zymogen and the 17-kDa subunit, the immunoblot in Fig. 2 demonstrates that processing of the zymogen was initiated between 2 and 3 h of etoposide treatment as assessed by the appearance of the 17-kDa subunit. This closely correlates with the induction of PARP proteolysis by etoposide in this cell line (19Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Using an apoptotic extract from cells that had been treated for 6 h with etoposide, the results of Fig. 3 show that Zn2+ and Cu2+ caused complete inhibition of PARP proteolysis at a concentration of 10 μm. The effect was independent of the counter- ion as both ZnCl2 and ZnSO4, as well as CuCl2 and CuSO4, gave identical results. Furthermore, other cations including Ba2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ had no effect on PARP proteolysis. These results strongly suggest that the means by which Zn2+ inhibits PARP proteolysis is by acting directly on the PARP proteolysis step, either by inhibiting the protease(s) or by rendering PARP insensitive to proteolysis.Figure 3Cation effects on PARP proteolysis catalyzed by an apoptotic extract. Ten μg of an apoptotic extract (active cytosol) from cells treated with etoposide for 6 h were added to cell-free buffer containing the respective cations at the indicated concentrations. The reactions were then initiated by the addition of 25 ng of bovine PARP and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and processed for PARP proteolysis by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition and its target of action, we examined the effects of Zn2+ and other cations on PARP proteolysis catalyzed by purified recombinant caspase-3. The results in Fig. 4 indicate that the extent of inhibition of recombinant caspase-3 by Zn2+ is similar to the extent of inhibition observed on PARP protease activity using the apoptotic extract and that the cation profile is identical to that obtained in the apoptotic extract (Fig.3). 2We have also observed that the thiols dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol attenuate the inhibition observed with Zn2+. This is presumably due to the ability of these reagents to act as Zn2+ chelators (33Powers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11160-11165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition was also obtained with Cd2+ and Hg2+ (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Zn2+ directly inhibits PARP cleavage induced by caspase-3.Figure 4Cation effects on PARP proteolysis catalyzed by caspase-3. Forty ng of recombinant caspase-3 were added to cell-free buffer containing the respective cations at the indicated concentrations. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 25 ng of bovine PARP and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and processed for PARP proteolysis by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PARP is a nuclear enzyme that contains two zinc finger domains near its amino terminus. It has been demonstrated that Zn2+ is required for PARP binding to damaged DNA (22Mazen A. Menissier de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Gradwohl G. Poirier G. de Murcia G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, the influence of Zn2+ on the ability of PARP to serve as a substrate for caspase-3 has not been investigated. To eliminate the possibility that Zn2+ binding to the zinc finger domains of PARP may render it insensitive to proteolysis, we utilized a chromogenic tetrapeptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-pNA, containing the caspase-3 cleavage site in PARP and lacking the zinc finger domains. The results from Fig.5 demonstrate that Zn2+ inhibited the cleavage of this substrate by the apoptotic extract with an IC50 value of nearly 1 μm (filled circles). A more potent inhibition by Zn2+(IC50 ≈0.1 μm) was observed when recombinant caspase-3 was used as the protease (open circles). These results provide strong evidence that the Zn2+ inhibition of PARP proteolysis is due to its inhibition of caspase-3 and not to a modification of the PARP substrate.Figure 5Zn2+ effects on Ac-DEVD-pNA proteolysis catalyzed by an apoptotic extract or by recombinant caspase-3. Twenty μg of an apoptotic extract from etoposide-treated cells (filled circles) or 280 ng of recombinant caspase-3 (open circles) were added to buffer containing the indicated concentrations of ZnCl2. Reactions were then initiated by the addition of Ac-DEVD-pNA to a final concentration of 200 μm and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Product formation (protease activity) was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mechanism by which Zn2+ inhibits caspase-3 awaits further studies. However, investigations on the crystal structure of ICE have suggested that His-237 and Cys-285 are involved in catalysis (23Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R.

Moller A. Tracey D.E. Kamen R. Wong W.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in all the caspase family members identified to date (24Kamens J. Paskind M. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Allen H. Banach D. Bump N. Hackett M. Johnston C.G. Li P. Mankovich J.A. Terranova N. Ghayur T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15250-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Given the affinity of these amino acids for Zn2+, it is possible that Zn2+ inhibits caspase-3 by coordinating with one or both of these conserved sites. Moreover, Zn2+ inhibition of caspase-3 in the mid-nanomolar to low micromolar range is indicative of Zn2+ binding to a single (or perhaps two) amino acid residue, whereas the tetrahedral coordination of Zn2+ found in many Zn2+ finger domains is characterized by a much greater affinity (k d ≈10−9–10−12m).It has previously been reported that Zn2+ does not inhibit caspase-3 activity (11Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The reason(s) for the discrepancy with our results is unclear but a possible explanation is that we have used purified recombinant caspase-3 in our study, whereas in the referred study an E. coli lysate containing the recombinant enzyme was used. Therefore, it is possible that the lysate contained factors which were responsible for mitigating the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on caspase-3.In the family of caspase proteases, caspase-3 has the highest homology to the Ced-3 protease which is required for developmental cell death inCaenorhabditis elegans (20Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also activated by a variety of agents that induce apoptosis including TNF-α (25Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar), Fas (26Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in a cell-free system comprised of apoptotic extracts and healthy nuclei, the presence of caspase-3 in the apoptotic extract was necessary to induce apoptotic changes in the nuclei (21Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Also, it has recently been demonstrated that knockout mice which are lacking caspase-3 incur severe abnormalities in the development of the nervous system (28Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S.Q. Kuan C.Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Thus, the relevance of these data in demonstrating a novel inhibitory site for Zn2+ in apoptosis is underscored by the fact that caspase-3 is both an important and common effector of the apoptotic machinery.The question arises as to whether the concentrations of Zn2+ required to inhibit caspase-3 in this study are attainable within the cell. It has been determined that serum Zn2+ concentrations are 10–15 μm (29Failla M.L. Cousins R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 538: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and that the free Zn2+ concentration in serum is approximately 1 μm (30Lentner C. Scientific Tables. 8th Ed. CIBA-Geigy, Ardsley, NY1981: 79-88Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular Zn2+ concentration has been estimated at 100 μm (17Pattison S.E. Cousins R.J. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly 10% of this (≈10 μm) exists in a labile pool which is in equilibrium with various Zn2+-binding proteins. Therefore, the intracellular levels of free Zn2+ may be in the range necessary to inhibit caspase-3. Currently, little is known about changes in intracellular Zn2+ or its movement between compartments, but new classes of Zn2+-responsive fluorophores appear to be promising in gaining new insight into this area (31Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 557-578Google Scholar).The results reported herein, in conjunction with a recent report demonstrating that treatment of T cells with a Zn2+chelator is able to induce caspase-3 activation (32Jiang S. Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Gahm A. Chow S.C. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggest that physiologic modulation of intracellular Zn2+ may have important consequences for the regulation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis.

We found that glutamate stimulated activation of p38 and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)), two subgroup members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily in matured cerebellar granule cells. The p38 activation was largely mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, we have revealed a novel signaling pathway, that is, Ca2+-mediated activation of p38 in glutamate-treated granule cells. The glutamate concentration effective for inducing apoptosis correlated with that for inducing p38 activation. SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38, inhibited glutamate-induced apoptosis. Thus p38 might be involved in glutamate-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells.

The p38 activation was largely mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, we have revealed a novel signaling pathway, that is, Ca2+-mediated activation of p38 in glutamate-treated granule cells. The glutamate concentration effective for inducing apoptosis correlated with that for inducing p38 activation. SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38, inhibited glutamate-induced apoptosis. Thus p38 might be involved in glutamate-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells. l-Glutamic acid (glutamate) is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamate not only mediates excitatory neurotransmission but also is involved in other phenomena such as neuronal plasticity and cell death (neuroexcitotoxicity) (1Gasic G.P. Hollmann M. Annu. Rev.

Cell death induced by glutamate is believed to be involved in neuronal loss associated with both acute (e.g. stroke) and chronic (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) neurodegenerative insults (6Olney J.W.

Glutamate receptors are classified into metabotropic and ionotropic receptors, and ionotropic glutamate receptors are further categorized into N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; dl-AP5,dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; VSCC, voltage-sensitive Ca2+channel. 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; dl-AP5,dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; VSCC, voltage-sensitive Ca2+channel. receptors and non-NMDA receptors. In many cases, glutamate toxicity (especially later phases of neuronal degeneration) can be attributed to excessive stimulation of NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor (9Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Peters S. J.

In cultured chick fetal forebrain neurons, p38 activity was down-regulated by insulin, which can support survival of these cells (33Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).These previous reports prompted us to examine whether the activities of p38 and SAPK are regulated by glutamate in cultured granule cells and whether they are correlated with the death-inducing effects of glutamate. In this study we have shown, for the first time, that p38 is activated by glutamate and NMDA. In addition, we have shown evidence suggesting an essential role of p38 in mediating death-promoting activity of glutamate.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe utilized primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells from neonatal rats as a model system to investigate the intracellular signal transductions of glutamate stimulation, since previous studies have shown that glutamate can induce cell death of these cells (38Cox J.A. Felder C.C. Henneberry R.C. Neuron. 1990; 4: 941-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Bessho Y. Nawa H. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We added triiodothyronine to the medium to reduce apoptotic cells under unstimulated conditions. In this medium, granule cells were well differentiated 8 days after plating as described in the previous report (40Heisenberg C.P. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since recent reports have shown that p38 and SAPK, two members of the MAPK superfamily, may be involved in apoptosis in some cases (see introduction), it is an intriguing question if p38 and/or SAPK is activated downstream of glutamate. Immunoblotting with either anti-p38 antibody or anti-SAPK antiserum revealed that p38 and 54-kDa and 46-kDa SAPKs were expressed in the granule cells (Fig.1 A). Then we tested whether p38 and SAPK can be activated by glutamate in the granule cells. The activity of p38 was detected by an immune complex assay using ATF2 as a substrate, and the activity of SAPK was detected by an in-gel assay using c-Jun as a substrate. p38 was markedly activated within 5 min after the addition of 500 μm glutamate in granule cells, and the activity remained higher than basal levels for more than 1 h (Fig.1 B). SAPK was activated slightly but reproducibly (about 1.5-fold) by glutamate treatment (Fig. 1 C). This relatively weak activation of SAPK may be partially due to the high basal activity of SAPK in granule cells in the absence of glutamate (see Fig.1 C, inset). Since the medium may contain a low level (∼50 μm) of glutamate, it is possible that the endogenous glutamate contributes to the basal activation of SAPK.Since previous reports showed that Ca2+ influx triggered by glutamate treatment plays a major role in glutamate toxicity (7Choi D.W. Rothman S.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar, 41Manev H. Favaron M. Guidotti A. Costa E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 106-112PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the role of Ca2+ in glutamate-induced activation of p38. An influx of Ca2+ from extracellular medium was required for the glutamate-induced activation of p38, because addition of 5 mm EGTA to the medium inhibited the activation (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, addition of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 induced activation of p38 in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 2 B). Thus Ca2+ influx may be sufficient for activating p38 in granule cells. The slight activation of SAPK induced by glutamate was also blocked by the addition of EGTA and thus dependent on Ca2+ influx (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Role of Ca2+ influx in glutamate-induced activation of p38 and SAPK. A, effect of EGTA on glutamate-induced activation of p38 and SAPK in cerebellar granule cells. Eight days after plating, granule cells were pretreated with (right panel) or without (left panel) 5 mm EGTA for 5 min, followed by treatment with 500 μm glutamate for 5 min. p38 activity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay with anti-p38 antibody. SAPK activity was measured by in-gel kinase assay containing c-Jun as a substrate, and the 54-kDa SAPK activity is shown. B, activation of p38 by Ca2+ ionophore. Granule cells were treated with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (5 μm) for 5 min, and p38 activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ca2+ influx is mediated by several proteins such as NMDA receptor and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel (VSCC) (42Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of VSCC in glutamate-induced p38 activation, an impermeant cation NMDG was used to substitute for Na+ to prevent membrane depolarization. In this experiment, the medium was replaced by the modified Locke's solution with either NaCl or NMDG (35Resink A. Hack N. Boer G.J. Balazs R. Brain Res. 1994; 655: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The level of p38 activation by glutamate in modified Locke's solution with NMDG was almost the same as that in modified Locke's solution with Na+ (Fig. 3 A). In addition, pretreatment of granule cells with l-type VSCC inhibitors, nifedipine or verapamil, did not inhibit the glutamate-induced p38 activation (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that VSCC contributes little, if any, to the glutamate-induced p38 activation in cerebellar granule cells.Figure 3Role of voltage-sensitive Ca2+channel in glutamate-induced activation of p38. A, the medium was replaced by modified Locke's solution with NaCl (left panel) or modified Locke's solution with NMDG (right panel). In modified Locke's solution with NMDG, NMDG substituted for Na+ to prevent membrane depolarization by glutamate treatment. After 5 min, granule cells were treated with 500 μm glutamate for 5 min, and p38 activity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay. B, granule cells were pretreated with 30 μm nifedipine or 10 μmverapamil for 10 min and treated with 500 μm glutamate for 5 min. The p38 activity was measured as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NMDA type of glutamate receptor is thought to play a crucial role in neurotoxicity (9Choi D.W.

Especially glutamate-induced apoptosis was completely blocked by NMDA antagonist in cerebellar granule cells (13Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). When granule cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of an NMDA antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (dl-AP5), glutamate-induced p38 activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.4 A). Moreover, addition of NMDA to granule cells induced activation of p38 (Fig. 4 B). This NMDA-induced activation of p38 was also inhibited by dl-AP5 dose dependently (Fig. 4 C) and was completely inhibited by addition of EGTA to the medium (data not shown). Taken together, Ca2+ influx through NMDA type of glutamate receptor might be important for glutamate-induced p38 activation.Figure 4Effect of NMDA antagonist on glutamate- or NMDA-induced activation of p38. A, granule cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of NMDA antagonistdl-AP5 for 10 min and followed by treatment with 500 μm glutamate. p38 activity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay.

C, granule cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of dl-AP5 for 10 min and followed by treatment with 500 μm NMDA. p38 activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then investigated the correlation between the glutamate toxicity and the activity of p38 in granule cells. Glutamate can induce either early necrosis or delayed apoptosis in cultures of cerebellar granule cells (13 and references therein). In this study we counted the number of neurons displaying cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and formation of typical apoptotic nuclei which are characteristics of apoptotic cell death. Under unstimulated conditions, the number of granule cells on the 9th day after plating was 97 ± 4.39% of that on the 8th day, suggesting that the cells were not dying at the time the experiments were being done. The number of apoptotic cells increased by glutamate treatment in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 A) although the maximal level of population of cells that underwent apoptosis varied among experiments (from 30% to 95%). In all experiments EC50(50% effective concentration) of glutamate to induce apoptosis was about 500 μm, and 100 μm glutamate had a marginal effect on the viability of the granule cells. Interestingly, the extent of p38 activation was correlated with the degree of apoptosis (Fig. 5 A), suggesting possible involvement of p38 in the glutamate-induced apoptosis.Figure 5Inhibition of p38 activation attenuates glutamate-induced apoptosis. A, correlation between glutamate-induced apoptosis and activation of p38 in cerebellar granule cells. Eight days after plating, granule cells were treated with various concentrations of glutamate. Five minutes after the addition of glutamate, the cells were extracted and subjected to an immune complex kinase assay with anti-p38 antibody. Twenty-four hours after the addition of glutamate, the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI for quantitation of apoptotic cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, effect of SB203580 on glutamate-induced apoptosis of granule cells. Eight days after plating, granule cells were pretreated with or without 1 μm or 10 μm SB203580 for 1 h. Then the cells were treated with 500 μm glutamate for 24 h and stained with DAPI for quantitation of apoptotic cells. At least 500 cells were counted at each point. We here showed four typical independent experiments in which glutamate effectively induced apoptosis. Values represent the average of data from 10 independent experiments. SB203580 had little effect on untreated granule cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the significance of p38 activation in the glutamate-induced apoptosis, we tested the effect of SB203580, a p38 inhibitor (24Lee J.C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). SB203580 inhibited p38 with an IC50 of 0.6 μm, and even at 100 μm had no effect on the activities of 12 other protein kinases tested, including MAPK or SAPK (43Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that 10 μm SB203580 did not inhibit MAPK activity and SAPK activity (data not shown). Granule cells were pretreated for 1 h with or without 1 μm or 10 μm SB203580, followed by incubation with 500 μm glutamate for 24 h. The apoptosis induced by glutamate was partially inhibited by the treatment with SB203580 (Fig.5 B). The extent of the inhibition appeared to depend on the degree of apoptosis induced by glutamate; SB203580 tended to inhibit apoptosis more effectively when glutamate induced apoptosis efficiently. On the average of 10 independent experiments SB203580 at 10 μm inhibited the glutamate-induced apoptosis by about 70%. In contrast, PD98059, a MAPKK inhibitor, did not inhibit the neurotoxic effect of glutamate at all (data not shown). These data suggest that p38 may mediate the glutamate-induced cell death.Taken together, we assume that p38 is involved in glutamate neurotoxicity in cerebellar granule cells based on the following reasons. First, glutamate was a potent activator for p38 in cerebellar granule cells which are sensitive to glutamate toxicity. Second, not only glutamate but also NMDA could activate p38 efficiently. Third, glutamate-induced activation of p38 was largely Ca2+-dependent. Fourth, the level of p38 activation correlated with the degree of apoptosis in matured granule cells treated with glutamate. While 1–100 μm glutamate weakly activated p38, it did not induce apoptosis. It is possible that there is a threshold of p38 activity required for glutamate-induced apoptosis. Fifth, SB203580 partially inhibited the glutamate toxicity, although the level of inhibition varied among experiments. Apparently SB203580 tended to inhibit glutamate toxicity more efficiently when granule cells were sensitive to glutamate toxicity. The sensitivity might depend on both the cell density and the population of contaminated glial cells which may support neuronal survival. The fold increase of SAPK activation by glutamate or by NMDA was not remarkable. But it is possible that the high basal activity of SAPK is important for glutamate toxicity.Our results have clearly shown that p38 and SAPK can be activated through the elevation of intracellular Ca2+, but the molecular mechanisms of Ca2+-induced activation of SAPK and p38 are largely unknown. It has previously been shown that several signaling molecules including PYK2, Src, and RasGRF could transduce Ca2+ signaling to the Ras-MAPK cascade (44Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E.

Most recently, ultraviolet- and high osmolarity-induced activation of SAPK was reported to depend partially on Ca2+ and PYK2 (48Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These molecules might be involved in glutamate-induced activation of p38 and/or SAPK.There are several molecules that have been implicated in mediating apoptosis-promoting effects of glutamate. For example, nitric-oxide synthetase and its product NO, and other reactive oxygen species are implicated as important downstream mediators of NMDA-induced toxicity (49Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M.

Here we have provided evidence that two members of the MAPK superfamily could also be involved in the glutamate-triggered signal transduction. It is possible that p38 is activated downstream of reactive oxygen species, since NO and H2O2 are good activators for p38 (53Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E.

Cell death induced by glutamate is believed to be involved in neuronal loss associated with both acute (e.g. stroke) and chronic (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) neurodegenerative insults (6Olney J.W.

Glutamate receptors are classified into metabotropic and ionotropic receptors, and ionotropic glutamate receptors are further categorized into N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; dl-AP5,dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; VSCC, voltage-sensitive Ca2+channel. 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; dl-AP5,dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; VSCC, voltage-sensitive Ca2+channel. receptors and non-NMDA receptors. In many cases, glutamate toxicity (especially later phases of neuronal degeneration) can be attributed to excessive stimulation of NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor (9Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Peters S. J.

https://openalex.org/W1987417071,"Previous studies in rat islets have suggested that anaplerosis plays an important role in the regulation of pancreatic β cell function and growth. However, the relative contribution of islet β cells versus non-β cells to glucose-regulated anaplerosis is not known. Furthermore, the fate of glucose carbon entering the Krebs cycle of islet cells remains to be determined. The present study has examined the anaplerosis of glucose carbon in purified rat β cells using specific 14C-labeled glucose tracers. Between 5 and 20 mm glucose, the oxidative production of CO2 from [3,4-14C]glucose represented close to 100% of the total glucose utilization by the cells. Anaplerosis, quantified as the difference between14CO2 production from [3,4-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose, was strongly influenced by glucose, particularly between 5 and 10 mm. The dose dependence of glucose-induced insulin secretion correlated with the accumulation of citrate and malate in β(INS-1) cells. All glucose carbon that was not oxidized to CO2 was recovered from the cells after extraction in trichloroacetic acid. This indirectly indicates that lactate output is minimal in β cells. From the effect of cycloheximide upon the incorporation of 14C-glucose into the acid-precipitable fraction, it could be calculated that 25% of glucose carbon entering the Krebs cycle via anaplerosis is channeled into protein synthesis. In contrast, non-β cells (approximately 80% glucagon-producing α cells) exhibited rates of glucose oxidation that were 13 to16 those of the total glucose utilization and no detectable anaplerosis from glucose carbon. This difference between the two cell types was associated with a 7-fold higher expression of the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase in β cells, as well as a 4-fold lower ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to FAD-linked glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in β cells versus α cells. Finally, glucose caused a dose-dependent suppression of the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway in β cells. In conclusion, rat β cells metabolize glucose essentially via aerobic glycolysis, whereas glycolysis in α cells is largely anaerobic. The results support the view that anaplerosis is an essential pathway implicated in β cell activation by glucose.

Pancreatic β cells are equipped with a sensing device that measures the levels of circulating nutrients by processes requiring cellular uptake and metabolism (Refs. 1Hellman B. Sehlin J.

This feature has been largely attributed to the enzyme glucokinase, which is rate-limiting for overall glucose consumption in β cells from rat (7Liang Y. Najafi H. Smith R.M. Zimmerman E.C. Magnuson M. Tal M. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 792-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and human (8De Vos A. Heimberg H. Quartier E. Huypens P. Bouwens L. Pipeleers D. Schuit F.

Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and mutations in human diabetes (10Vionnet N. Stoffel M. Takeda J. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Zouali H. Lesage S. Velho G. Iris F. Passa P. Froguel P. Cohen D. Nature. 1992; 356: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) have strengthened the concept that glucokinase is a glucose-sensing protein, the following evidence indicates that (post)mitochondrial events are important for glucose signaling (4Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Newgard C.B. McGarry D.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). First, up to 80% of glucose carbon is oxidized in β cells; this is a very high fraction when compared with other cell types (11Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the fraction of total glucose utilization that is further oxidized to CO2 increases in rat β cells (13De Vos A. Schuit F.C. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 117-121PubMed Google Scholar) or isolated islets (14Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Biochem J. 1987; 246: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) when glycolysis accelerates, whereas this ratio decreases in most cell types (the Crabtree effect; see Ref. 14Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Biochem J. 1987; 246: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Second, glucose utilization in β cells does not accelerate under anaerobic conditions (the Pasteur effect), which has been explained by low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1The abbreviations used are: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; mGPDH, FAD-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCA, trichloroacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; mGPDH, FAD-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCA, trichloroacetic acid. and high mitochondrial FAD-linked glycerol-3- phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) expression (12Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Third, the dimethyl ester of succinate, which is converted to succinate and oxidized in the Krebs cycle, is a potent “anaplerotic” secretagogue (4Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 997-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fourth, islets cultured at low glucose levels (17MacDonald M.J. Kaysen J.H. Moran S.M. Pomije C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22392-22397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the presence of palmitate (18Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) exhibited parallel suppression of glucose-induced insulin release and down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Moreover, PDH activity is acutely responsive to glucose (19McCormack J.G. Longo E.A. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fifth, glucose signaling in the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 is severely blunted by knocking out its mitochondrial genome (20Soeijma A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The nature of the metabolic signals required for the activation of insulin release remains largely unknown. An increase in glucose metabolism causes a rise in islet [ATP]/[ADP] (2Ashcroft S.J.H. Weerasinghe L.C.C. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This results in the closure of KATP channels (21Ashcroft F.M. Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J.H. Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), membrane depolarization, and influx of Ca2+, which is required for exocytosis (3Henquin J.C. Kahn C.R. Weir G.C. Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus. Lea & Febiger, Malvern, PA1994: 56-80Google Scholar). Nonetheless, electrophysiological studies have suggested that other glucose-derived signals are required for exocytosis as well (22Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This study explores the concept that anaplerosis is one of the KATP-independent signal-generating pathways for glucose-induced insulin release (4Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anaplerosis,i.e. filling up the Krebs cycle with intermediates that are channeled into anabolic pathways (4Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), requires conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Metabolic flux through this enzyme is quantitatively important in rat islets (25MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) due to the abundant expression of PC (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulated flow of intermediates from the Krebs cycle into synthesis of coupling factors or macromolecules is believed to sustain stimulus-secretion coupling and β cell growth. One of the hypothetical coupling factors is malonyl-CoA, which is produced by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Glucose rapidly increases citrate content of the cells, which in turn may activate ACC (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Chronic stimulation with glucose increases ACC mRNA abundance in INS-1 cells (26Brun T. Roche E. Kim K.-H. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18905-18911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because ACC activity in islets is ten times higher than fatty acid synthase activity (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), malonyl-CoA accumulates rapidly in the cells (27Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, malonyl-CoA, the physiological inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (28McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), may act as a metabolic coupling factor in β cell signaling (4Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Newgard C.B. McGarry D.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 29Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Anaplerosis might also be instrumental in accelerating the pyruvate/malate shuttle (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results in the formation of cytosolic NADPH. Finally, because glucose acutely enhances both transcription and translation in β cells, anaplerosis is expected to be required for de novo synthesis of metabolic precursors for regulated gene expression and growth. Our recent work (31Heimberg H. De Vos A. Pipeleers D. Thorens B. Schuit F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8971-8975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Heimberg H. De Vos A. Moens K. Quartier E. Bouwens L. Pipeleers D. Van Schaftingen E. Madsen O. Schuit F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7036-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) has shown that glycolysis accelerates proportionally to extracellular glucose between 1 and 10 mmin purified β cells and non-β cells. Moreover, when differences in cellular volume are taken into account, the rate of glycolysis is similar in β cells and non-β cells (31Heimberg H. De Vos A. Pipeleers D. Thorens B. Schuit F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8971-8975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This similarity can be explained by the presence of glucokinase in both β cells and α cells (32Heimberg H. De Vos A. Moens K. Quartier E. Bouwens L. Pipeleers D. Van Schaftingen E. Madsen O. Schuit F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7036-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and by the fact that glucose transport is not rate-limiting for glucose metabolism (31Heimberg H. De Vos A. Pipeleers D. Thorens B. Schuit F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8971-8975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). How can glucose, which is metabolized similarly in glycolysis, activate β cells while it inhibits α cell function? Part of the answer to this question may be found by considering anaplerosis in α cells and β cells. Indeed, it is intriguing that about 40% of glucose-derived carbon entering the citric acid cycle is carboxylated in rat islets (33Khan A. Ling Z.C. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2539-2542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This extent of anaplerotic input is unusually high for a non-gluconeogenic (34MacDonald M.J. Chang C.-M. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and non-lipogenic (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) tissue. Thus, approximately 40% of the carbons of glucose that enter the krebs cycle must leave it for a non-oxidative fate, which remains to be assessed. This consideration and the fact that the major anaplerotic enzyme PC is expressed at very high levels in rat islets (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and β(INS-1) cells (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggest an important function for pyruvate carboxylation in the β cell. To further extend our understanding of the role of anaplerosis in islet tissue, we have endeavored to provide answers to the following three questions: (i) is glucose-induced anaplerosis a unique property of β cells or is it also present in islet non-β cells? (ii) Can the magnitude of glucose-induced anaplerosis in β cells be quantified? (iii) What is the fate of the glucose carbon entering the mitochondria as pyruvate but escaping the Krebs cycle? We addressed these questions by comparing glucose regulation of anaplerosis in fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified β cells and non-β cells (approximately 80% glucagon-producing α cells; Ref. 36Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that glucose metabolism distal from pyruvate differs markedly in β cells versus non-β cells. Labeled compounds were purchased from Amersham Corp. (d-[5-3H]glucose (13 Ci/mmol),d-[U-14C]glucose (292 mCi/mmol),d-[1-14C]glucose (54 mCi/mmol),d-[6-14C]glucose (56 mCi/mmol),l-[3,5-3H]tyrosine (52 Ci/mmol), NaH14CO3 (54 mCi/mmol), and3H2O (5 mCi/ml)) or from NEN Life Science Products (d-[3,4-14C]glucose (54 mCi/mmol)). Other chemicals were from Sigma or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Rat islet β and non-β cells were purified from adult male Wistar rats by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting, as has been described previously (36Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Purity of the β cell preparations was more than 90%, as determined by immunocytochemistry for insulin or by electron microscopical analysis. Non-β cells were composed of >80% α cells, 5–10% β cells, and 10–15% other cells. INS-1 cells (37Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) were cultured at 37 °C in 95% air-5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom), 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The attached cells were harvested from culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) by a 5-min treatment with Mg2+/Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.025% (w/v) trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). Glucose metabolism was measured in batches of freshly isolated cells (5 × 104 β cells and 1 × 105 non-β cells) over 2-h incubations at 37 °C in 100 μl of Earle's-Hepes buffer (36Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) containing the indicated concentrations of glucose. Conversion of [5-3H]glucose (50 μCi/ml; specific activities, 1.3–25 Ci/mol) to 3H2O was measured simultaneously with production of CO2 from 14C-labeledd-glucose tracers (11Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Total radioactivity added to the cells was 50 μCi/ml for [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose, 25 μCi/ml for [U-14C]glucose, and 2–5 μCi/ml for [3,4-14C]glucose, resulting in specific activities of 0.1–50 Ci/mol. Cellular metabolism was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.4 mol/liter citrate buffer, pH 4.9, containing 5 mm KCN, 10 μm antimycin A, and 10 μm rotenone. Hydroxyhyamine (Hewlett-Packard) was used to capture the produced 14CO2. Tritiated water and14CO2 production were measured via liquid scintillation counting. Calculations of glucose oxidation took into account the CO2 recovery (89 ± 1%), which was assessed by adding 0.05 μCi NaH14CO3 to separate incubation vials without cells. The contribution of the pentose phosphate pathway to total glucose utilization was calculated from the specific yields of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose oxidation as has been explained in detail in Ref. 38Katz J. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 517-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The flux of glucose-related anaplerosis was quantified as the difference between [3,4-14C]glucose oxidation and [6-14C]glucose oxidation, which reflects the amount of glucose carbon entering the Krebs cycle without being oxidized to CO2 (25MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cellular radioactivity accumulating during a 2-h incubation of β cells with [U-14C]glucose was measured after the cells were washed four times with 0.8 ml of incubation medium, sonication in either 1 m perchloric acid or 10% TCA, and liquid scintillation counting of radioactivity in the acid-soluble and acid-precipitable fractions. Cells were grown in 21-cm2 Petri dishes in regular RPMI medium at 11 mm glucose. They were then preincubated for 3 days in culture medium at 5 mm glucose because we have previously shown that such protocol allows a robust secretory response to high glucose (26Brun T. Roche E. Kim K.-H. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18905-18911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium was removed, and attached cells (8 × 106) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (KRB) containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.07% bovine serum albumin, and 4 mm glucose. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min in KRB-Hepes medium containing 0.07% bovine serum albumin and different glucose concentrations. Incubation media were collected to determine insulin release (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For measurements of citrate and malate accumulation, cells were scraped from the dishes after addition of 10% TCA. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were extracted five times with ether. Samples were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. The assays of citrate and malate are described in detail in Ref. 39Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 434-509Crossref Scopus (761) Google Scholar. The expression level of PC was measured as described previously (23Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by direct streptavidin blotting. Samples corresponding to 25 μg of protein from INS-1 cells, 2 × 105flow-sorted β cells, and 6.6 × 105 non-β cells were loaded per lane on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. As verified in each experiment by Ponceau red staining, the amount of total protein load per lane was similar for the three cell types. The effect of cycloheximide (40 μm) on total protein synthesis was assessed by incubating purified β cells for 2 h at 10 mm glucose in the presence of l-[3,5-3H]tyrosine (250 μCi/ml; 4.8 μm). The amount of newly synthesized protein was assessed by precipitating cellular extracts in 10% TCA followed by liquid scintillation counting (40Schuit F.C. Kiekens R. Pipeleers D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into proteins, batches of 1.5 × 105 β cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of Earle's-Hepes buffer containing 25 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose (concentration, 10 mm; specific activity, 2.5 Ci/mol) either without or with 40 μm cycloheximide. Cells were washed four times with incubation medium to remove the excess of extracellular tracer and homogenized in 10% TCA. The amount of newly synthesized protein was assessed by liquid scintillation counting of the TCA precipitates (40Schuit F.C. Kiekens R. Pipeleers D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and calculated as the difference between control cells and cells incubated with cycloheximide. Measurement of LDH activity in purified β and non-β cells was done as described by Sekine et al. (12Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Pellets from 3 × 105 cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing. Enzymatic activity was determined in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation (2 min at 104 ×g) at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, in the presence of 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma), 20 μm NADH, and 2 mm pyruvate (monosodium salt, freshly prepared solution); the consumption of NADH was measured in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 340/460 nm. Determination of mGPDH (EC 1.1.99.5) was performed as described by MacDonald (15MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using batches of 2 × 105 β cells and non-β cells. Glucose utilization in β cells, as assessed from the production of 3H2O from [5-3H]glucose, was markedly dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration (Fig.1 A). Confirming our previous observations in flow-sorted β cell subsets (11Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the fraction of total glucose utilization that was further oxidized to CO2 was high using [U-14C]-labeled glucose as substrate: 69% at 1 mm glucose, 75% at 5 mm glucose, and 82% at 10 mm glucose. Because data obtained with this tracer reflect mean oxidation rates of all six carbon atoms of glucose, no information can be retrieved about oxidative pathways that are preferentially used by the cells. We therefore incubated β cells with glucose tracers that were labeled at specific carbon atoms. Oxidation of [6-14C]glucose to 14CO2, reflecting Krebs cycle activity at the level of isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, increased 30 times when medium glucose was raised from 1 to 20 mm (Fig.1 B). However, the specific yield of14CO2 from [6-14C]glucose was much lower than that of [U-14C]glucose. To explain this difference, we considered two possibilities. First, oxidative pathways in addition to the Krebs cycle, in particular the pentose phosphate pathway, contribute to total glucose oxidation in β cells. Second, high anaplerotic input into the cycle provides a possible explanation for this phenomenon. Thus, with respect to glucose labeled in position 6, anaplerosis allows dilution of the [14C] tracer among Krebs cycle intermediates at a carbon position that does not yield14CO2 during the first and second round in the cycle. In addition, some labeled intermediates escape the cycle (cataplerosis; Fig. 2 A) during the first two rounds. By contrast, uniformly labeled glucose yields labeled CO2 during the first two cycle rounds. To examine the first possibility, we compared [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose oxidation. Whereas both [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose enter the citric acid cycle as [2-14C]acetyl-CoA, only [1-14C]glucose produces 14CO2 during the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway (38Katz J. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 517-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that the specific yield of 14CO2 obtained after incubating the cells with [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose was almost the same over the whole tested range of glucose concentrations. This indicates that the oxidative flux through the pentose phosphate pathway is very low and is detectable only when cells were exposed to 5 mm substrate or less (range between 0.3 and 0.6 pmol of glucose equivalents/2 h/103 cells). The contribution of the pentose phosphate pathway to overall glucose utilization declined with rising glucose levels: 18 ± 4%, 10 ± 3%, and 6 ± 5% at 1, 2.5, and 5 mm glucose, respectively, and below detection limit at 7.5 mm glucose or higher. Low contribution of the pentose phosphate pathway to overall glucose utilization has been described in rodent islets (25MacDonald M.J. Arch."
https://openalex.org/W2016392505,"Retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and its stereoisomer 9-cis-RA play important roles in regulating gene expression, through interactions with nuclear receptors, during embryonic development and in the maintenance of adult epithelial tissues (Chambon, P. (1995) Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 50, 317–32; Mangelsdorf, D. J., and Evans, R. M. (1995)Cell 83, 841–850; Petkovich, M. (1992) Annu. Rev. Nutr. 12, 443–471). Evidence suggests that 4-hydroxylation of RA inside the target cell limits its biological activity and initiates a degradative process of RA leading to its eventual elimination. However, 18-hydroxylation and glucuronidation may also be important steps in this process. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of the first mammalian retinoic acid-inducible retinoic acid-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (hP450RAI), which belongs to a novel class of cytochromes (CYP26). We demonstrate that hP450RAI is responsible for generation of several hydroxylated forms of RA, including 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, and 18-OH-RA. We also show that hP450RAI mRNA expression is highly induced by RA in certain human tumor cell lines and further show that RA-inducible RA metabolism may correlate with P450RAI expression. We conclude that this enzyme plays a key role in RA metabolism, functioning in a feedback loop where RA levels are controlled in an autoregulatory manner. Retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and its stereoisomer 9-cis-RA play important roles in regulating gene expression, through interactions with nuclear receptors, during embryonic development and in the maintenance of adult epithelial tissues (Chambon, P.

We conclude that this enzyme plays a key role in RA metabolism, functioning in a feedback loop where RA levels are controlled in an autoregulatory manner. Regulation of retinoid signaling may be controlled by a number of coordinated mechanisms, including retinoid synthesis, cell-specific expression of retinoid-binding proteins and nuclear receptors, and metabolism of retinoids (for review see Refs. 1Chambon P.

Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 229-255Google Scholar, 5Fiorella P.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins may also play a role in establishing this balance by sequestering high levels of RA (6Zheng W.L. Bucco R.A. Schmitt M.C. Wardlaw S.A. Ong D.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5028-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence to suggest that 4-OH-, 4-oxo-, and 18-OH-RA are polar intermediates in the catabolism and eventual elimination of RA (5Fiorella P.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Frolik C.A. Roberts A.B. Tavela T.E. Roller P.P. Newton D.L. Sporn M.B.

Thus both sequestration and metabolism may function to protect RA-sensitive tissues from deleterious concentrations of RA. We have cloned and characterized cDNAs corresponding to a retinoic acid-inducible gene encoding a human cytochrome P450-related hydroxylase (P450RAI) responsible for generation of multiple hydroxylated products of RA. hP450RAI appears to be the human ortholog of the previously characterized zebrafish P450RAI (zP450RAI) (9White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.-D. Dilworth F.J. Bonasoro J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), indicating that this important cytochrome is highly conserved structurally and functionally across species. We also demonstrate that hP450RAI is inducible by RA in a number of different cell types. We speculate that this enzyme plays a key role in determining the metabolic fate of endogenous retinoids and may also be implicated in the clearance of exogenous retinoids administered therapeutically. A NTERA2-D1 cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 1.0 × 10−6 independent plaques were screened using a random-primed, α-[32P]dATP-labeled full-length zP450RAI cDNA. Filters were prehybridized for 4 h at 37 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 1 × Denhardt's (without bovine serum albumin), 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed overnight at 37 °C. Filter were washed two times for 20 min in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature followed by one 10-min wash in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then exposed to Kodak XAR film overnight at −70 °C. Positive plaques were rescreened until purified. pBluescript-containing colonies, generated using the in vivo excision protocol (Stratagene) were plated onto LB + ampicillin plates and grown overnight at 37 °C. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiaprep Mini-Plasmid prep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Sequence data analyses were performed with the Geneworks software package (Intelligenetics). Cells were transfected with 3 μg of hP450RAI in pTL1 or the empty vector control pTL1, together with 1 μg each of ferridoxin and ferridoxin reductase expression vectors (10Brentano S.T. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3010-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Media from transfected cells incubated with 575 pm [11,12-3H]RA (Fig. 2, A andB) or 1 μm RA (Fig. 2 C) for 24 h were acidified with 0.1% acetic acid. All incubations were performed in the presence of fetal calf serum. For the analysis of RA metabolism, untransfected MCF7 (Fig. 3 C) and MCF10A cells (Fig.3 B) were incubated in the presence of 10−6m RA or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin five times to remove as much RA as possible, and then analyzed for their ability to metabolize [11,12–3H]RA as described below, except that cells were incubated with [11,12-3H]RA for only 4 h. Lipid-soluble metabolites were separated from aqueous-soluble metabolites using a total lipid extraction of the medium (11Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1957; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Metabolism of [11,12-3H]RA to total aqueous-soluble metabolites was measured using β-scintillation of aliquots of the aqueous phase of media extracts (Figs. 2 B and3 D). Lipid-soluble extracts were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 93.5:5:1:0.5 hexane/isopropanol/methanol/acetic acid. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using a Zorbax-CN column (6 μm, 0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent system of 93.5:5:1:0.5 hexane/isopropanol/methanol/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. All metabolism experiments were performed at least three times and each trial in triplicate.Figure 3Expression and metabolic activity of P450RAI in cultured human cells. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of all-trans-RA, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared, and expression of P450RAI was assessed by Northern analysis.A, in some cell lines there is no expression of P450RAI, but in others it can be expressed constitutively or RA-induced. HEK293 is from embryonic kidney; EL-E, MCF10A, and MCF7 are breast epithelial cell lines; LC-T and SK-LC6 are from nonsmall cell lung carcinomas (19Campling B.G. Sarda I.R. Baer K.A. Pang S.C.

Comparison of the retinoic acid-inducible all-trans-RA metabolism in MCF10A and MCF7 cells. B–D, MCF10A cells, which do not show induction of hP450RAI by Northern blot analyses, fail to show production of RA metabolites when cultured with RA. MCF7 cells, on the other hand, which show marked induction of hP450RAI in the presence of RA, exhibit a metabolite profile similar to that observed in hP450RAI-transfected COS-1 cells, inducing the production of 4-oxo- and 4-OH-RA. D, RA treatment of MCF7, but not MCF10A, induces an increase in total aqueous-soluble RA metabolites. The standards RA, 4-OH-RA, and 4-oxo-RA eluted at 4.65, 10.28, and 11.86 min, respectively. Results shown are representative of data from four (B–D) individual experiments. Error bars in D are standard deviation of the mean from triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells were grown to about 80% confluence in T75 flasks in the following media: HEK293, DMEM + 10% FCS + glutamine; EL-E, RPMI 1640 + 7% FCS; MCF10A, DMEM:F-12 (1:1) + 5% horse serum + glutamine + 10 μg/ml insulin + 0.2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor + 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone; LC-T and SK-LC6, RPMI 1640 + 5% FCS; MCF7, MEM + 10% FCS + nonessential amino acids + 0.5% sodium pyruvate + 10 μg/ml insulin; NB4 and U937, RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS + glutamine; HepG2, MEM + 10% FCS. Cells were then treated for 24 h with 10−6mall-trans-RA (induced) or Me2SO (control). Me2SO was present at 10−4m in both. Northern analysis was done as described previously (12Jones B.B. Ohno C.K. Allenby G. Boffa M. Levin A.A. Grippo J.F. Petkovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5226-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using 2.5–4.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation kit (Promega). Northern blots were probed with random-primed, full-length zebrafish P450RAI cDNA, human P450RAI cDNA, or GAPDH to assess the amount of RNA present. We probed a panel of mRNAs from human cell lines with cDNA from zebrafish cytochrome P450 (zP450RAI) previously shown to be involved in RA-inducible RA metabolism (9White J.A. Beckett-Jones B.

Strong cross-hybridization was observed with RNA from RA-treated teratocarcinoma cells (NTERA2-D1) (13Moasser M.M. DeBlasio A. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). A cDNA library from RA-treated NTERA2-D1 (Stratagene) was screened with the zP450RAI cDNA, and a full-length human cDNA was isolated. A high degree of amino acid identity (68%) was observed between hP450RAI and zP450RAI (Fig.1 A). We also have recently cloned the murine P450RAI, which is 89% conserved with the human counterpart (data not shown). In contrast, there was less than 30% amino acid identity between the P450RAIs and other cytochromes listed in GenBank™, suggesting that zP450RAI and hP450RAI comprise a new class of cytochromes designated CYP26. We have identified five conserved regions (CR1-CR4, Fig. 1 A), with amino acid identity greater than 80%; and the heme binding motif located at the C-terminal end of all cytochrome P450s. The Kyte-Doolittle (14Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17169) Google Scholar) hydrophobicity plots for hP450RAI and zP450RAI are essentially superimposable (Fig. 1 B) with the exception of one short region located in the middle of the protein between CR3 and CR4, suggesting that these homologs share a similar protein structure. Both zP450RAI and hP450RAI sequences have hydrophobic regions at the N termini, characteristic of microsomally located cytochrome P450s (15Gonzales F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 243-288Google Scholar). This is consistent with the microsomal location of previously characterized RA-inducible RA metabolic activities (16Roberts A.B. Frolik C.A. Nichols M.D. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6303-6309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gubler M.L. Sherman M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Han I.S. Choi J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 2069-2075PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether hP450RAI could metabolize RA, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with a hP450RAI expression vector, pTL1-hP450RAI, and cell extracts were analyzed as described previously (9White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.-D. Dilworth F.J. Bonasoro J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of the lipid-soluble extracts from the media of pTL1-hP450RAI-transfected cells indicates a P450RAI cDNA-dependent increase in metabolism of [11,12-3H]RA and the generation of RA metabolites, including those which comigrate with 4-OH- and 4-oxo-RA standards on two HPLC systems (Fig.2 A). Using picomolar concentrations of RA (575 pm), we found the percent reduction in retinoic acid occurring in control transfections to be maximally 29.6%, whereas in P450RAI-transfected cells it is 69.5% (based on retinoic acid recovered as a percent of total recovered radioactivity; total recoveries averaged 70–74% of added radioactivity). This percent metabolism is equivalent to a rate of disappearance of retinoic acid of 75 fmol/μg of protein/24 h in control transfected cells, compared with 158 fmol/μg of protein/24 h in P450RAI transfected cells. The rate of RA metabolism due to P450RAI activity is remarkable, since in our transfection system the percentage of cells transfected is rarely greater than 10% (data not shown). The decreases in the amount of RA substrate and production of 4-OH- and 4-oxo-RA metabolites by hP450RAI is accompanied by the formation of aqueous-soluble radioactive metabolites (Fig. 2 B). We calculate the rate of formation of aqueous soluble radioactivity, by analyzing the aqueous-soluble fraction isolated from the experiment in (Fig. 3 A), to be 8 fmol/μg protein/24 h in control as compared with 39.5 fmol/μg of protein/24 h in P450RAI-transfected cells. When cells were incubated with 1 μm RA (Fig.2 C), two major peaks retaining the spectral properties of RA were generated, which comigrated with 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA (λmax = 340 nm for 4-OH RA; λmax = 360 nm for 4-oxo-RA), and were increased in hP450RAI-pTL1-transfected, as compared with control, cells. A third peak with spectral properties and retention time characteristic of RA is observed, but its identity has not been determined. It is likely that hP450RAI may catalyze hydroxylations other than 4-hydroxylation, resulting in production of some of these additional metabolic products. Again the substrate peak of RA is greatly reduced in hP450RAI-pTL1-transfected cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2 C). We have studied the expression of hP450RAI mRNA in a variety of human cells lines by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). Poly(A)+mRNAs from RA-treated and control cells show several different expression profiles: constitutive expression (embryonic kidney HEK293 and small cell lung carcinoma SK-LC6 (19Campling B.G. Sarda I.R. Baer K.A. Pang S.C. Baker H.M. Lofters W.S. Flynn T.G. Cancer. 1995; 75: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)), inducible expression (nonsmall cell lung carcinoma LC-T, breast adenocarcinoma MCF7, acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 (20Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Ballerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hepatocarcinoma HepG2), or a complete lack of expression (breast carcinoma-derived EL-E and nontransformed breast MCF10A). Inducible P450RAI expression was also observed in the human keratinocyte-derived cell lines HPK1A and HPK1A-ras (21Sebag M. Henderson J. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). These findings suggest that P450RAI expression is regulated by multiple factors in a cell-specific manner. It is notable that P450RAI expression is highly inducible in the acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived cell line NB4 since 1) increased RA metabolic activity of the type demonstrated by P450RAI has been implicated in the acquired clinical resistance to RA (22Muindi, J. R., Young, C. W., and Warrell, R. J. (1994)Leukemia (Baltimore) 1807–1812.Google Scholar), and 2) NB4 cells have been shown to have inducible RA metabolism following pretreatment with RA (23Taimi M. Breitman T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The diversity of cell types exhibiting P450RAI expression suggests that, if P450RAI induction is indeed responsible for conferring clinical RA resistance, induced metabolism in both the leukemic cells and other tissues where P450RAI is induced would contribute collectively to lowering the therapeutic efficacy of RA. RA-inducible RA metabolism has been previously characterized in a number of cell lines and tissues, including the breast epithelial cell line MCF7 (24Wouters W. van D.J. Dillen A. Coene M.C. Cools W. De C.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2841-2846PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the inducibility of P450RAI expression, which we have observed in this cell line (see Fig. 3 A), correlates with RA metabolic activity, MCF10A and MCF7 were incubated with or without RA for 24 h and then tested for their ability to metabolize [11,12-3H]RA. Interestingly, in MCF10A, where there is no inducible expression of hP450RAI, there is also no detectible production of 4-oxo- or 4-OH-RA in either control or RA-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, MCF7 cells, which contain highly inducible P450RAI expression, do produce these metabolites in response to RA (Fig.3 C). Analysis of the aqueous-soluble fractions shows a 3.5-fold increase in aqueous-soluble radioactivity only in the induced MCF7 cells (Fig. 3 D), which correlates with the ability of the cells to convert RA to 4-hydroxylated derivatives. 4-Hydroxylation of RA may be an obligatory step in the production of these aqueous soluble products. However, we note that the 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA peaks observed in MCF7 cells are broad, suggesting that they may contain multiple metabolic products. These products may arise from alternate hydroxylations or isomers, suggesting that if P450RAI is responsible for all the metabolism in MCF7 cells that it can perform metabolic steps other than 4-hydroxylation. These experiments are consistent with the possibility that P450RAI plays a major role in RA metabolism. In summary, we have cloned and characterized a human cytochrome P450, which is very highly conserved between zebrafish and human, constituting a novel family, CYP26, of cytochromes P450. P450RAI is able to metabolize all-trans-RA, and Northern blot analysis of its expression in a number of human cell lines shows that it can be induced in response to RA treatment, expressed constitutively, or not expressed at all, suggesting its regulation is complex and may be tissue type-dependent. Several additional findings (not presented in this paper) support our hypothesis that this enzyme is specific for RA and is responsible for RA catabolism. Preliminary enzyme kinetic studies on whole cells indicate a relativeK m less than 1 μm in accordance with the K m of microsomal cytochrome preparations shown to hydroxylate RA in vitro (5Fiorella P.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Leo M.A. Iida S. Lieber C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and in the same range as retinoid metabolizing activity defined in T47D cells (18Han I.S. Choi J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 2069-2075PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we find that 9-cis-RA is a good substrate for hP450RAI, while retinol, even at micromolar concentrations, is not. In our studies we find that expression of the P450RAI message and RA metabolic activity appear to be correlated implicating P450RAI in the observed RA metabolism. The identification of P450RAI, its inducibility by RA, and its RA metabolic activity define a feedback loop, which may be critical in regulating both normal and therapeutic RA levels. Other autoregulatory feedback loops, such as that described for conversion of retinol to retinoic acid, contribute to controlling overall levels of active retinoid (26Kurlandsky S.B. Duell E.A. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15346-15352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This emphasizes the importance of maintaining stable physiological levels of RA. Inhibitors designed to block P450RAI function may therefore be useful in elevating normal tissue RA levels or maintaining high therapeutic levels of RA (22Muindi, J. R., Young, C. W., and Warrell, R. J. (1994)Leukemia (Baltimore) 1807–1812.Google Scholar, 27De Coster R. Wouters W. Bruynseels J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since RA has proven useful in the treatment of a number of cancers, premalignancies, and skin disorders, an understanding of the role of hP450RAI in regulating RA levels in normal and disease states will be important clinically.

FLAME-1, although most similar in structure to Mch4 and Mch5, does not possess caspase activity but can interact specifically with FADD, Mch4, and Mch5. Interestingly, FLAME-1 is recruited to the Fas receptor complex and can abrogate Fas/TNFR-induced apoptosis upon expression in FasL/tumor necrosis factor-sensitive MCF-7 cells, possibly by acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor.

The CYP superfamily is large, with at least 74 families, and each mammalian species is estimated to have between 60 and 200 distinct superfamily members (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamatak T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). The mammalian enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are typically expressed in the liver and exhibit broad substrate specificity. Other CYPs participate in a number of specific anabolic reactions, such as the synthesis of several steroid hormones (2Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev.

Although generally expressed in the liver, CYPs have also been found in extrahepatic sites such as the kidney, lung, mucosa of the gut, placenta, reproductive organs, embryonic tissues, and the brain (3Burke M.D. Orrenius S.

The functions of CYPs in the brain are not completely understood but may include production of neurosteroids (9Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G.M. Lathe R. J. Biol.

RA is a potent teratogen (10Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 10: 169-184Google Scholar), and conversely, vitamin A deficiencies lead to severe developmental defects. During development, RA is a suspected morphogen (11Means A.L. Gudas L.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 201-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For example, it is thought to be involved in the induction of polarity in developing limb buds in the chick (12Noji S. Nohno T. Koyama E. Ide H. Taniguchi S. Saito T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. Spec. 1992; 10: 481-484Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), forming anterior-posterior gradients of gene expression in the Xenopus nervous system (13Durston A.J. Timmermans J.P.M. Hage J.W.

Dev. 1992; 36: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and is known to influence the expression of Hox genes in the mouse and in other systems (15Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RA signaling is mediated through a set of nuclear hormone receptors that bind RA and subsequently alter the expression of target genes (16Pemrick S.M. Lucas D.A. Grippo J.F. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 1797-1806PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions of certain combinations of these receptors lead to developmental defects resembling vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy (17Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Decimo D. LeMeur M. Dierich A. Gorry P. Chambon P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RA and similar derivatives are detectable in embryonic tissues (19Horton C. Maden M. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but neither the production nor the catabolism of retinoids are well understood. Additionally, RA is employed in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (20Tallman, M. S. (1996) Leukemia , 10, (suppl.) 12–15.Google Scholar). Understanding RA metabolism is, therefore, an important problem.RA has profound effects on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, a cell line resembling the totipotent cells of the inner cell mass of the preimplantation embryo (21Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6360) Google Scholar, 22Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 81: 7634-7638Crossref Scopus (4246) Google Scholar). ES cells are known for their totipotency, as evidenced by their use in generating gene-targeted mice. These cells also differentiate into a number of cell typesin vitro (23Snodgrass H.R. Schmitt R.M. Bruyns E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Nisitani S. Tsubata T. Honjo T. Int.

RA induces efficient neural differentiation of ES cells (26Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) while repressing spontaneous mesodermal differentiation (27Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ES cells thus provide an opportunity to study the effects of RA on totipotent cells. We screened for genes which are induced during RA-induced neural differentiation. One such gene, CYP26, defines a novel family of CYPs, and its expression is regulated in vitro and in vivo by RA.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, CYP26, which is expressed in the early mouse embryo, brain, and liver. CYP26 was isolated as a cDNA fragment from a subtractive hybridization scheme designed to identify genes up-regulated during RA-induced differentiation of mouse ES cellsin vitro. Northern analysis shows that CYP26 is an mRNA of 1.9 kb, induced during ES neural differentiation. Full-length cDNA contains an ORF predicted to encode a 497-amino acid protein with homology to members of the cytochrome P450 family. The putative protein of 56.1 kDa contains a membrane anchoring domain, a proline-rich region, an oxygen-binding domain, and a heme-binding region, all characteristic of CYPs. While there was strong homology in highly conserved regions to other CYP members, there were no existing CYP members with extensive overall homology, suggesting that CYP26 defines a novel family. This analysis was confirmed by the P450 Nomenclature Committee (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamatak T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a novel CYP in Zebrafish has been identified, CYPRA1, and appears to be the homolog of CYP26 (37White J.A. Guo Y-.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilwirth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, CYP26 and CYPRA1 represent a new family of cytochrome P450 enzymes.The expression of CYP26 suggests that this enzyme may respond to RA or be involved in RA metabolism in vivo. First, CYP26 is expressed in ES cells, an in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation. In this system, transcript abundance increases with differentiation, an effect enhanced by RA administration. Additionally, administration of all-trans-RA leads to a substantial increase in the levels of CYP26 transcript in the mouse liver within 24 h. This induction did not occur in the brain, suggesting a tissue-specific response. The induction of CYP26 transcript abundance after RA treatment suggests a number of possibilities. One, many CYP enzymes display broad substrate selectivity, as their function is to catabolize xenobiotics of a general class. Some of these enzymes are known to be induced by their substrate at the level of transcription, as in the cases of polycyclic aromatic compounds, phenobarbitol, and ethanol (2Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). It is suspected that all-trans-RA is converted to 4-OH-RA by an unidentified cytochrome in the liver (36Leo M.A. Iida S. Lieber C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Perhaps CYP26 is induced by retinoids and participates in this or other related activities. A second possibility is that CYP26 is specifically up-regulated after a RA dose to increase synthesis or degradation of specific responder molecules. It has recently been shown that CYPRA1 promotes the degradation of all-trans-RA into 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA when transfected into COS-1 cells, supporting the first possibility (37White J.A. Guo Y-.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilwirth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if this activity is a result of direct catalysis and if CYP26 performs a similar function in mammals.The presence of CYP26 transcript in ES, P19, and F9 cells suggested an embryonic expression of CYP26. RT-PCR data, as shown in Fig. 6, confirm that CYP26 is expressed by embryos as early as E8.5 and is detectable in the E5.5 deciduum although expression by uterine tissues in those samples is not excluded. Embryonic expression levels are likely to be low, since no CYP26 expression was detected in 5 day exposures of E12.5 body or head RNA samples using RPA, but is readily detectable by RT-PCR from the same RNA sample.RA, a derivative of vitamin A, is well known as a teratogen (10Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 10: 169-184Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that RA functions normally in development as well, possibly acting as a morphogen (15Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Perhaps CYP26 functions in some aspect of retinoid signaling or metabolism in the embryo. Interestingly, two of the plant homologs of CYP26 are involved in development. CYP90 from Arabidopsis is essential for normal development and participates in the synthesis of the steroid hormone brassinolode (38Szekeres M. Nemeth K. Koncz-Kalman Z. Mathur J. Kauschmann A. Altmann T. Redei G.P. Nagy F. Schell J. Koncz C. Cell. 1996; 85: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Dwarf3 from Zea mays is required for proper growth and development in that species (39Winkler R.G. Helentjaris T. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1307-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These relationships, along with the embryonic expression and potential RA catabolizing activity, warrant investigation of CYP26 in mammalian embryogenesis.CYP26 is somewhat unusual among the CYP superfamily in that it is expressed in the brain. RT-PCR data from regions of the human brain suggest that part of the reason that the expression levels are low is that expression is regionally restricted in the CNS. Some CYP family members participate in the synthesis of neurosteroids, which are known to affect brain function in a variety of ways (40Baulieu E.E. Biol. Cell. 1991; 71: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to identify the precise locations of CYP26 expression and determine if CYP26 has an important role in brain physiology.In summary, the expression of CYP26, which represents a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme family, implicates the putative enzyme in a number of physiological systems, such as development, brain function, and retinoid metabolism in mammals. Given that RA is a known teratogen, a possible morphogen, and a chemotherapeutic agent for some forms of leukemia (20Tallman, M. S. (1996) Leukemia , 10, (suppl.) 12–15.Google Scholar), the understanding of enzymes acting downstream of RA or on RA directly will be of considerable interest.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RA and similar derivatives are detectable in embryonic tissues (19Horton C. Maden M. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but neither the production nor the catabolism of retinoids are well understood. Additionally, RA is employed in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (20Tallman, M. S. (1996) Leukemia , 10, (suppl.) 12–15.Google Scholar). Understanding RA metabolism is, therefore, an important problem. RA has profound effects on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, a cell line resembling the totipotent cells of the inner cell mass of the preimplantation embryo (21Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6360) Google Scholar, 22Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 81: 7634-7638Crossref Scopus (4246) Google Scholar). ES cells are known for their totipotency, as evidenced by their use in generating gene-targeted mice. These cells also differentiate into a number of cell typesin vitro (23Snodgrass H.R. Schmitt R.M. Bruyns E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Nisitani S. Tsubata T. Honjo T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Klung M.G. Soonpaa M.H. Koh G.Y. Field L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). RA induces efficient neural differentiation of ES cells (26Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) while repressing spontaneous mesodermal differentiation (27Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ES cells thus provide an opportunity to study the effects of RA on totipotent cells. We screened for genes which are induced during RA-induced neural differentiation. One such gene, CYP26, defines a novel family of CYPs, and its expression is regulated in vitro and in vivo by RA. DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, CYP26, which is expressed in the early mouse embryo, brain, and liver. CYP26 was isolated as a cDNA fragment from a subtractive hybridization scheme designed to identify genes up-regulated during RA-induced differentiation of mouse ES cellsin vitro. Northern analysis shows that CYP26 is an mRNA of 1.9 kb, induced during ES neural differentiation. Full-length cDNA contains an ORF predicted to encode a 497-amino acid protein with homology to members of the cytochrome P450 family. The putative protein of 56.1 kDa contains a membrane anchoring domain, a proline-rich region, an oxygen-binding domain, and a heme-binding region, all characteristic of CYPs. While there was strong homology in highly conserved regions to other CYP members, there were no existing CYP members with extensive overall homology, suggesting that CYP26 defines a novel family. This analysis was confirmed by the P450 Nomenclature Committee (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamatak T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a novel CYP in Zebrafish has been identified, CYPRA1, and appears to be the homolog of CYP26 (37White J.A. Guo Y-.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilwirth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, CYP26 and CYPRA1 represent a new family of cytochrome P450 enzymes.The expression of CYP26 suggests that this enzyme may respond to RA or be involved in RA metabolism in vivo. First, CYP26 is expressed in ES cells, an in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation. In this system, transcript abundance increases with differentiation, an effect enhanced by RA administration. Additionally, administration of all-trans-RA leads to a substantial increase in the levels of CYP26 transcript in the mouse liver within 24 h. This induction did not occur in the brain, suggesting a tissue-specific response. The induction of CYP26 transcript abundance after RA treatment suggests a number of possibilities. One, many CYP enzymes display broad substrate selectivity, as their function is to catabolize xenobiotics of a general class. Some of these enzymes are known to be induced by their substrate at the level of transcription, as in the cases of polycyclic aromatic compounds, phenobarbitol, and ethanol (2Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). It is suspected that all-trans-RA is converted to 4-OH-RA by an unidentified cytochrome in the liver (36Leo M.A. Iida S. Lieber C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Perhaps CYP26 is induced by retinoids and participates in this or other related activities. A second possibility is that CYP26 is specifically up-regulated after a RA dose to increase synthesis or degradation of specific responder molecules. It has recently been shown that CYPRA1 promotes the degradation of all-trans-RA into 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA when transfected into COS-1 cells, supporting the first possibility (37White J.A. Guo Y-.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilwirth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if this activity is a result of direct catalysis and if CYP26 performs a similar function in mammals.The presence of CYP26 transcript in ES, P19, and F9 cells suggested an embryonic expression of CYP26. RT-PCR data, as shown in Fig. 6, confirm that CYP26 is expressed by embryos as early as E8.5 and is detectable in the E5.5 deciduum although expression by uterine tissues in those samples is not excluded. Embryonic expression levels are likely to be low, since no CYP26 expression was detected in 5 day exposures of E12.5 body or head RNA samples using RPA, but is readily detectable by RT-PCR from the same RNA sample.RA, a derivative of vitamin A, is well known as a teratogen (10Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 10: 169-184Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that RA functions normally in development as well, possibly acting as a morphogen (15Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Perhaps CYP26 functions in some aspect of retinoid signaling or metabolism in the embryo. Interestingly, two of the plant homologs of CYP26 are involved in development. CYP90 from Arabidopsis is essential for normal development and participates in the synthesis of the steroid hormone brassinolode (38Szekeres M. Nemeth K. Koncz-Kalman Z. Mathur J. Kauschmann A. Altmann T. Redei G.P. Nagy F. Schell J. Koncz C. Cell. 1996; 85: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Dwarf3 from Zea mays is required for proper growth and development in that species (39Winkler R.G. Helentjaris T. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1307-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These relationships, along with the embryonic expression and potential RA catabolizing activity, warrant investigation of CYP26 in mammalian embryogenesis.CYP26 is somewhat unusual among the CYP superfamily in that it is expressed in the brain. RT-PCR data from regions of the human brain suggest that part of the reason that the expression levels are low is that expression is regionally restricted in the CNS. Some CYP family members participate in the synthesis of neurosteroids, which are known to affect brain function in a variety of ways (40Baulieu E.E. Biol. Cell. 1991; 71: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to identify the precise locations of CYP26 expression and determine if CYP26 has an important role in brain physiology.In summary, the expression of CYP26, which represents a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme family, implicates the putative enzyme in a number of physiological systems, such as development, brain function, and retinoid metabolism in mammals. Given that RA is a known teratogen, a possible morphogen, and a chemotherapeutic agent for some forms of leukemia (20Tallman, M. S. (1996) Leukemia , 10, (suppl.) 12–15.Google Scholar), the understanding of enzymes acting downstream of RA or on RA directly will be of considerable interest.

https://openalex.org/W2066072183,"We describe a dominant negative (DN) to activation protein-1 (AP1) that inhibits DNA binding in an equimolar competition. AP1 is a heterodimer of the oncogenes Fos and Jun, members of the bZIP family of transcription factors. The DN, termed A-Fos, consists of a newly designed acidic amphipathic protein sequence appended onto the N-terminus of the Fos leucine zipper, replacing the normal basic region critical for DNA binding. The acidic extension and the Jun basic region form a heterodimeric coiled coil structure that stabilizes the complex over 3000-fold and prevents the basic region of Jun from binding to DNA. Gel shift assays indicate that A-Fos can inactivate the DNA binding of a Fos:Jun heterodimer in an equimolar competition. Transient transfection assays indicate that A-Fos inhibits Jun-dependent transactivation. Both the acidic extension and the Fos leucine zipper are critical for this inhibition. Expression of A-Fos in mouse fibroblasts inhibits focus formation more than colony formation, reflecting the ability of A-Fos to interfere with the AP1 biological functions in mammalian cells. This reagent is more potent than a deletion of either the Fos or Jun transactivation domain, which has been used previously as a dominant negative to AP1 activity.

Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the bZIP domain is amphipathic, containing a heptad repeat of leucines that is critical for the dimerization of bZIP proteins (12Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

The N-terminal half of the long bipartite α-helix is the basic region that is critical for sequence-specific DNA binding (14Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L.

To dissect the function of the AP1 complex in cellular processes, investigators have used dominant negatives (DNs) to AP1 consisting of a deletion of the transactivation domain of either a Jun family member (17Akira S.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar) or a Fos family member (20Wick M. Lucibell F. Muller R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar, 21Brown P. Chen T. Birrer M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). These truncated Fos or Jun proteins dimerize with endogenous transcription factors, which results in the loss of AP1 activity (21Brown P. Chen T. Birrer M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). A conceptual disadvantage with this strategy is that the heterodimer between the endogenous transcription factor and the dominant negative still binds DNA, which makes it difficult to document a change in DNA occupancy that correlates with the expression of the dominant negative. A dominant negative that is deleted for the DNA binding domain would overcome this type of problem, but such potential dominant negatives do not work well because of the stabilization that occurs when bZIP proteins bind DNA (16Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Patel L.R. Curran T. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7360-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We are interested in developing DNs (24Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) that stoichiometrically inhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding of the AP1 complex. These reagents should inhibit AP1 DNA binding in vivo, thus allowing us to monitor occupancy of AP1 ciselements in vivo (25Mueller P. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the DNA binding of the bZIP protein C/EBP could be inhibited stoichiometrically by appending an amphipathic acidic extension to the N-terminus of the C/EBP leucine zipper (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We explored the generality of this strategy by appending the same acidic extension onto the Fos leucine zipper. This construct (4H-Fos) was not able to inhibit AP1 DNA binding in an equimolar competition. This paper describes a newly designed amphipathic acidic extension (termed A- or N4H-), which, when appended onto the N-terminus of the Fos leucine zipper, is able to inhibit the DNA binding of AP1 in an equimolar competition. When expressed in mammalian cells, A-Fos inhibits Jun-dependent transactivation and dramatically reduces Ha-ras-mediated cellular transformation in a leucine zipper-dependent fashion. The Fos, Jun, VBP, and CREB bZIP domains were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pT5 as NdeI-HindIII fragments (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of the proteins have a 13-amino acid N-terminal ∅10 leader ASMTGGQQMGRDP. The human Fos bZIP domain spans from Lys128 to Asp208; chicken Jun bZIP domain spans from Ser222 to Phe310, the natural COOH terminus; chicken VBP bZIP domain spans from Lys232 to Leu311, the COOH terminus; mouse CREB bZIP domain spans from Leu274 to Asp341, the COOH terminus. The C/EBP bZIP domain has been described previously (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The protein sequences of the acidic extensions of the dominant negatives are as follows. The last L in the following sequences is the first d position (see Fig. 1) of the Fos leucine zipper (14Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), and for cloning convenience, the Q following the first L of the Fos leucine zipper has been changed to an E to produce aXhoI site: 4H-Fos, DLEQRAEELARENEELEKEAEELEQENAE L E; A-Fos, DLEQRAEELARENEELEKEAEELEQE L AELE. L is the amino acid changed in the new acidic extension. The following VBP, CREB, and C/EBP leucine zippers have been cloned downstream the acidic extension as XhoI-HindIII fragments. The construct A-VBP contains Asp in the a position of the acidic extension. The acidic extensions fused to the leucine zippers have been cloned as NdeI-HindIII fragments by polymerase chain reaction into the pT5 vector. The construct 0H-Fos contains the Fos leucine zipper that spans from Leu165 to Asn208 and also has the mutation Q to E mentioned above. Proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, and those capable of binding DNA were purified over a heparin column as described previously (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C.

The proteins lacking DNA binding domains were purified over a hydroxylapatite column, eluted with 200 mmphosphate, and subsequently purified on a Rainin HPLC system as just described. The protein purification protocol was modified to purify the Jun bZIP protein. The initial pellet of the Jun sample was resuspended in 1 m KCl and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm. The pellet was gently brought to 5 m urea, sonicated, heated at 65 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was isolated. The proteins were dialyzed to 50 mm KCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA and loaded onto a heparin column as described before (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The molar concentrations were calculated as described previously (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The AP1 complex was purified from T cells as described previously (45Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol.

All thermal melts were reversible. The spectra were recorded in a 0.5-cm cuvette. Proteins (2 μl of 5 × 10−6m dimer) were heated for 10 min at 65 °C in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol and added to 20 μl of the gel shift reaction buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol), incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, and then mixed with 8 pg of the probe (32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the AP1 site). The binding complexes were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE buffer at room temperature. The sequence of the AP1 probe is GTCAGTCAGTGACTCAATCGGTCA. The sequence of the CREB probe is GTCAGTCAGTGACGTCAATCGGTCA. The sequence of the VBP probe is GTCAGTCAGATTACGTAATATCGGTCA. The DNA binding sites are in boldface type. The conditions used for the DNA binding assay of the AP1 complex purified from T cells have been described previously (34Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supershift analysis was performed using 3 μl of anti-JunD antibody (34Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-NFκB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) added to the binding reactions for 30 min before adding the AP1 probe. Transient transfections by calcium phosphate were carried out in HepG2 cells as described previously (47Olive M. Williams S. Dezan C. Johnson P. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2040-2047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA consisting of 10 μg of reporter, 3 μg of Jun transactivator, and 3 μg of dominant negative and salmon sperm DNA. After 2 days, cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. CAT activities were normalized to protein concentration and represented as -fold activation over the reporter plasmid alone. The conditions for transfecting the C/EBPα transactivator and the C/EBP reporter gene were identical except that 0.3 μg of transactivator and 0.3 μg of dominant negative were transfected (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (107cells) were suspended in 225 μl of RPMI complete medium containing 20% fetal calf serum at 4 °C. The addition of 8 μg of the reporter construct p10, 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase, and different concentrations of the dominant negative 4H-Fos was followed by electroporation (200 V, 1180 microfarads) (48Wano Y. Feinberg M. Hosking J.B. Bogerd H. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9733-9737Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 2 h in complete medium and then stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (2 μg/ml) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml), and the cells were harvested after 18 h. CAT assays were performed in triplicate. The HepG2 cells were transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmid and 10 μg of carrier DNA. The cells were harvested in 250 mm Tris, pH 8, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin A, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm EGTA), the extract was freeze-thawed three times, and 30 μg of extract were run on a 16% acrylamide gel. After transfer, the membrane was probed with the FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The ECL kit from Amersham Corp. was used for SDS polyprotein detection. HepG2 cells were cultured in 1-ml slide flasks (Nunc). Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature followed by methanol for 10 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature, slides were incubated with a 1:200 FLAG M2 antibody and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h, followed by incubation for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody used at a 1:200 dilution in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After each incubation with antibodies, cells were extensively washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 twice for 10 min each at room temperature. The eukaryotic expression plasmid containing chicken Jun is driven by the CMV promoter and has been described elsewhere (21Brown P. Chen T. Birrer M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). The CAT reporter plasmid containing a single AP1 binding site has been constructed by inserting the AP1 consensus site AGCTTGGATCCAGATCGAGCCCCAATGACTCATCATAGA in front of a minimal promoter p-35 Alb CAT described previously (47Olive M. Williams S. Dezan C. Johnson P. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2040-2047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and has been used for transfection in HepG2 cells. The CAT reporter plasmid p10 used for transfection experiments in Jurkat cells consists of a chimeric c-fos promoter gene fusion carrying the Gibbon ape leukemia virus-TPA-responsive element enhancer and has been described previously (49Farina A.R. Davis-Smyth T. Gardner K. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26466-26475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dominant negative coding sequences (0H-Fos, 4H-Fos, A-Fos, A-VBP, 4H-CREB, A-CREB) were cloned as NdeI-HindIII fragments into pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) modified to contain a N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope (MYPYDVPDYA) pRc/CMV566 or an N-terminal FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDK) and a new polylinker. TheNdeI-HindIII fragments were obtained from the prokaryotic expression vector pT5 in which the dominant negatives had been cloned previously (see “Proteins”). Stable transfection of the murine fibroblast cell line C3H10T1/2 (ATCC number CCL226) was performed as described previously (29Taparowsky E.J. Heaney M.L. Parsons J.T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4125-4129PubMed Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. Individual precipitates containing 200 ng of pT24 Ha-ras (30Taparowsky E. Suard Y. Fasano O. Shimizu K. Goldfarb M. Wigler M. Nature. 1982; 300: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and 600 ng of each pRc/CMV566 construct were added to two 100-mm tissue culture dishes, each seeded 24 h prior to transfection with 5 × 105 cells and treated 2 h before the addition of precipitates with medium containing 10 μg/ml chloroquine (Sigma). To assess focus formation, 24 h after transfection, the cultures were split 1:3 and maintained in basal modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. To assess colony formation, 16 of the cell suspension obtained from both plates was further divided 1:6 and maintained in basal modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G-418 sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 14 days, the plates were stained with Giemsa (EM Diagnostic Systems, Darmstadt, Germany), and the efficiency of both focus formation and colony formation was determined by visual inspection. The efficiency of focus formation was calculated for each experimental group based on the number of foci obtained from a parallel group transfected with either Ha-ras or with Ha-ras plus pRc/CMV566 DNA, which is set at 1.00. The efficiency of colony formation was calculated for each group based on the number of colonies obtained from a group transfected with Ha-ras plus pRc/CMV566, which is set at 1.00. The values reported (in most instances) have been calculated from the numbers obtained from multiple, independent experiments. The ratio of colony forming efficiency (CE) to focus formation efficiency (FFE) assesses the relative contribution of a decrease in CE to the observed level of FFE. CE/FFE values greater than 1.0 are considered significant. Previously, we showed that three bZIP basic regions from C/EBP, VBP, and GBF1, when appended onto the N-terminus of the C/EBP leucine zipper, were able to form a heterodimeric coiled coil structure with a designed acidic amphipathic protein sequence. The acidic amphipathic extension had been appended onto the N-terminus of a leucine zipper designed to preferentially interact with the C/EBP leucine zipper (Fig. 1) (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,27Vinson C.R. Hai T.W. Boyd S.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This acid amphipathic extension (4H-) of the leucine zipper created a potent DN that heterodimerized with the bZIP protein C/EBP and prevented DNA binding. We explored the generality of this method by appending the acidic amphipathic extension onto the Fos leucine zipper in an attempt to inhibit Fos:Jun DNA binding. The rationale was that the acidic extension would electrostatically mimic DNA and provide the Jun basic region with an alternate interaction surface. The Jun basic region, instead of binding in the major groove of DNA, would form a heterodimeric coiled coil structure with the acidic amphipathic protein sequence. The above strategy was unsuccessful because the Jun basic region is different from the three basic regions examined previously (Fig. 1). There is a hydrophobic amino acid (isoleucine) in the aposition immediately N-terminal of the first d position of the Jun leucine zipper, while the three previous basic regions (C/EBP, VBP, and GBF1) contained a polar amino acid (asparagine, glutamate, or cysteine) in this position. Previously, we placed an asparagine in the corresponding position of the acidic extension (4H-) to create a polar interaction in the hydrophobic interface as is seen in the leucine zipper, which also contains an N in the a position (28O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). In the new acidic extension (N4H-) (Fig. 1), we have replaced this polar asparagine within 4H- with a hydrophobic leucine, reasoning that the hydrophobic isoleucine of the Jun basic region would interact more favorably with a leucine than an asparagine. For simplicity, we refer to N4H-Fos as A-Fos, where A refers to acidic extension. The thermal stability of mixtures of the Jun and Fos bZIP domains and the Jun bZIP domain with different potential dominant negatives was monitored using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2, Table I). The dissociation constants were calculated at 37 °C because they provide information about dimerization in vivo. The Fos bZIP domain is so unstable that we were unable to determine reliably a dissociation constant. The Jun bZIP domain, however, does produce an interpretable thermal melt with a K d (37Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) = 10−5m (Table I). The mixture of Fos and Jun forms a heterodimer. This is demonstrated by the greater stability of the mixture (K d (37Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) = 9 × 10−8m), which is greater than the sum of the individual Fos and Jun thermal melts (solid line) (Fig.2 A). The deduced K d (25Mueller P. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) for a Fos and Jun mixture is 1.3 × 10−8m, which is similar to the value ofK d (25Mueller P. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) = 2.3 × 10−8m reported earlier using fluorescence energy transfer assay (23Patel L.R. Curran T. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Open table in a new tab Presented below are the melting temperature (T m, °C), ΔG, and K d at 37 °C or 25 °C for CD thermal melts of a variety of proteins either as homodimers or an equimolar mixture of two proteins. If the mixture has a higher melting temperature than either homodimer alone, we infer that the mixture sample is composed of heterodimers. The root mean square error in ΔG is 0.2 kcal/mol and 0.5 kcal/mol for homo- and heterodimers, respectively. We then examined the thermal stability of the Jun bZIP domain mixed with three potential dominant negatives: the Fos leucine zipper without the basic region or the Fos leucine zipper with one of two different acidic extensions appended onto the N-terminus (Fig. 2 A, Table I). The mixture of Jun with Fos without a basic region (Jun + 0H-Fos) is twice as stable (ΔΔG = −0.4 kcal/mol) as the Jun + Fos mixture, indicating that the basic regions are repulsive; a similar result was seen with the C/EBP basic region. (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) A surprising result was that the ellipticity at 6 °C for the Fos + Jun mixture was greater than for the mixture of Fos without the basic region (0H-Fos) and Jun. This suggests that the basic regions are helical in the absence of DNA, an observation that is not seen for C/EBP. (26Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) The addition of the acidic amphipathic extension to the N-terminus of the Fos leucine zipper dramatically stabilizes the interaction with Jun. Using the previously described acidic extension (4H-Fos), we observe a 30-fold increase (ΔΔG = −1.8 kcal/mol) in the stability of the Jun bZIP domain. The new acidic extension containing the single Asn → Leu change (A-Fos) is 3000-fold more stable (ΔΔG = −4.6 kcal/mol) than the Jun + 0H-Fos mixture (Fig. 2, A and B, Table I). The single amino acid change increased the heterodimer stability 2.8 kcal/mol. The specificity of the interaction of A-Fos with additional bZIP domains was determined by CD thermal denaturation. The VBP bZIP domain and A-Fos were thermally denatured, either alone or together, and no interaction was observed (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained for the mixture of 4H-Fos and C/EBP (data not shown). This suggests that the acidic extension is only able to interact with the basic region if the leucine zippers themselves are physically interacting. To determine if the new acidic extension containing the Asn → Leu change (A-) stabilized other bZIP basic regions or was specific for a basic region containing a hydrophobic residue in the aposition, we appended the new acidic sequence onto the C/EBP leucine zipper (A-C/EBP) and determined the thermal stability of mixtures with C/EBP (Table I). C/EBP interacts similarly with both acidic extensions with the following dissociation constants:K d (37Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) = 7 × 10−10m for 4H-C/EBP and 8 × 10−10m for A-C/EBP. In the context of the C/EBP leucine zipper, the new acidic extension only contributes to a 0.1 kcal/mol increase in stability, which is negligible. These data demonstrate that the Asn → Leu change produces a new acidic extension that interacts well with all bZIP basic regions examined but prefers to interact with basic regions containing a hydrophobic residue in the a position,e.g. the Jun basic region. A puzzling result from the thermal denaturation experiments was the amount of ellipticity at 222 nm indicative of α-helical structure seen at low temperatures when the samples are dimeric.

Methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), a charged, hydrophilic, lipophobic, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, had no effect on the binding of agonist or antagonist to wild-type β2 receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells. This suggested that no endogenous cysteines are accessible in the binding site crevice. In contrast, in a constitutively active β2 receptor, MTSEA significantly inhibited antagonist binding, and isoproterenol slowed the rate of reaction of MTSEA. This implies that at least one endogenous cysteine becomes accessible in the binding site crevice of the constitutively active β2receptor. Cys-285, in the sixth membrane-spanning segment, is responsible for the inhibitory effect of MTSEA on ligand binding to the constitutively active mutant. The acquired accessibility of Cys-285 in the constitutively active mutant may result from a rotation and/or tilting of the sixth membrane-spanning segment associated with activation of the receptor.

The interaction of a diverse array of signals, including neurotransmitters, peptides, hormones, light, and odorants, with G-protein-coupled receptors results in a conformational change which enhances their interaction with heterotrimeric G-proteins and thereby promotes GDP release and subsequent GTP binding and G-protein activation (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). In rhodopsin, for example, photoisomerization of retinal leads to rigid body movements of the third (M3) 1The abbreviations used are: M3, the third membrane-spanning segment; M5, the fifth membrane-spanning segment; M6, the sixth membrane-spanning segment; M7, the seventh membrane-spanning segment; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, MTS ethylammonium; CAM, constitutively active mutant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IANBD,N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol4-yl)ethylenediamine; ANOVA, analysis of variance. and sixth (M6) membrane-spanning segments relative to each other (2Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Moreover, disulfide cross-linking of these membrane-spanning segments prevents the activation of transducin, the G-protein associated with rhodopsin, further supporting the relevance of their movement in the activation of rhodopsin. The generality of this movement to other G-protein-coupled receptors, however, is not known. Moreover, additional details of the structural mechanisms of receptor activation are necessary to better understand this process. The binding sites of the β2 adrenergic receptor and of the homologous receptors for other biogenic amines are formed among their seven, mostly hydrophobic, membrane-spanning segments (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 3Oprian D.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and are accessible to charged, water-soluble agonists like norepinephrine. Thus, for each of these receptors, the binding site is contained within a water-accessible crevice, the binding site crevice, extending from the extracellular surface of the receptor into the plane of the membrane. The surface of this crevice is formed by residues that can contact specific agonists and/or antagonists and by other residues that may play a structural role and affect binding indirectly. To identify the residues that form the surface of the binding site crevice in the dopamine D2 receptor and the β2adrenergic receptor, we have used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (4Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 5Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 692-698PubMed Google Scholar). Consecutive residues in the membrane-spanning segments are mutated to cysteine, one at a time, and the mutant receptors are expressed in heterologous cells. If ligand binding to a cysteine substitution mutant is near-normal, we assume that the structure of the mutant receptor, especially around the binding site, is similar to that of wild type, and thus, that the substituted cysteine lies in a similar orientation to that of the wild-type residue. In the membrane-spanning segments, the sulfhydryl of a cysteine can face either into the binding site crevice, into the interior of the protein, or into the lipid bilayer; sulfhydryls facing into the binding site crevice should react much faster with charged, hydrophilic, lipophobic, sulfhydryl-specific reagents. For such polar sulfhydryl-specific reagents, we use derivatives of methanethiosulfonate (MTS). These reagents form mixed disulfides with the cysteine sulfhydryl, covalently linking –SCH2CH2 X, where X is NH3+ in the case of MTS ethylammonium (MTSEA) (11Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The reagents reportedly react with the ionized thiolate (RS−) more than a billion times faster than with the unionized thiol (RSH) (12Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and only cysteines accessible to water are likely to ionize. We use two criteria for identifying an engineered cysteine as forming the surface of the binding site crevice: (i) the reaction with an MTS reagent alters binding irreversibly and (ii) this reaction is retarded by the presence of agonists or antagonists. To identify activation-induced structural changes in the residues forming the surface of the binding site crevice, we sought to determine the rates of reaction of MTSEA with a series of engineered cysteines in the resting and activated receptor. Agonist cannot be used to activate receptor, however, because the presence of a ligand within the binding site would interfere with access of the MTSEA to the engineered cysteines. Alternatively, the activated state of the receptor can be achieved by using a constitutively active mutant (CAM) β2adrenergic receptor as a background for further cysteine substitution. The CAM used here, L266S/K267R/H269K/L272A, has been well characterized previously (13Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and is intrinsically active and has a higher affinity for agonist than does the wild-type receptor. The high affinity state for agonist is typically associated with the activated receptor-G-protein complex. That agonist affinity is higher in the CAM even in the absence of G-protein suggests that the structure of the binding site of the CAM is likely to be similar to that of the agonist-activated wild-type receptor binding site. Thus, using wild-type β2 receptor and the CAM, we can compare the resting and active forms of the receptor by determining the accessibility of residues in the binding site crevice in these two states. To determine the accessibilities of substituted cysteines, the background receptor into which we substitute cysteines must be unaffected by our sulfhydryl reagents. Although we find here that ligand binding to the wild-type β2 adrenergic receptor was unaffected by MTSEA, surprisingly, MTSEA inhibited antagonist binding to the CAM form of the β2 receptor. We identify Cys-285 in M6 as the sole cysteine responsible for this susceptibility of CAM. Because this Cys is protected by ligand, it is likely accessible within the binding site crevice in the CAM, but not in wild-type β2 receptor. The DNA sequence encoding the human β2 adrenergic receptor, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with the cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the “FLAG”-epitope (IBI, New Haven, CT) and tagged with six histidines at the carboxyl terminus, was a gift from Dr. B. Kobilka (Stanford, CA) (15Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This DNA was subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pcin4 (16Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. S. Rees (Glaxo, UK), thereby creating the vector pcin4-SFβ2H. The CAM β2receptor (13Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (L266S/K267R/H269K/L272A) was a gift from Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz (Durham, NC). A fragment encoding the CAM mutation was subcloned into pcin4-SFβ2H to create the vector pcin4-SFCAMβ2H. Mutations of endogenous cysteines were generated using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants are named as (wild-type residue) (residue number) (mutant residue), where the residues are given in the single-letter code. Plasmids containing the mutations C77V and C116V were a gift from Dr. B. Kobilka (Stanford, CA), and fragments containing these mutations were subcloned into the pcin4-SFCAMβ2H plasmid as were fragments encoding the mutations C125V, C285S, and C327S. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 3.15 g/liter glucose in 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Thirty-five mm dishes of 293 cells at 60–80% confluence were transfected with 2 μg of wild-type or mutant pcin4-SFβ2H using 9 μl of LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 ml of Opti-MEMTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Five hours after transfection, the medium was changed. For transient transfection, the medium was changed after 24 h, and the cells were harvested after 48 h. For stable transfection, 24 h after transfection the cells were split to a 100-mm dish, and 700 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to select for a stably transfected pool of cells. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (8.1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2), briefly treated with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA (no trypsin), and then dissociated in PBS. Cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended for binding or treatment with MTS reagents. Whole cells from a 35-mm dish were suspended in 400 μl of buffer (140 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.006% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). [3H]CGP-12177 (NEN Life Science Products) binding was performed as described previously (17Staehelin M. Simons P. Jaeggi K. Wigger N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3496-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For isoproterenol competition, triplicate polypropylene minitubes contained five different concentrations of isoproterenol between 10 nm and 100 μm, 0.4 nm[3H]CGP-12177, and 300 μl of a 20-fold dilution of cell suspension in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and then filtered using a Brandel cell harvester through Whatman 934AH glass fiber filters (Brandel). The filter was washed 3 times with 1 ml of 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Specific [3H]CGP-12177 binding was defined as total binding less nonspecific binding in the presence of 1 μmalprenolol (Research Biochemicals). Whole cells from a 35-mm dish were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A. Aliquots (50 μl) of cell suspension were incubated with freshly prepared MTSEA (Toronto Research Biochemicals) at the stated concentrations at room temperature for 2 min. Cell suspensions were then diluted 20-fold, and 300-μl aliquots were used to assay for [3H]CGP-12177 (400–800 pm) binding in triplicate as described above. The fractional inhibition was calculated as 1 − [(specific binding after MTS reagent)/(specific binding without reagent)]. We used the SPSS for Windows (SPSS, Inc.) statistical software to analyze the effects of MTSEA reagents by one-way ANOVA according to Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc test (p < 0.05). MTSEA, at concentrations as high as 100 mm for 2 min, had no significant effect on [3H]CGP-12177 binding to wild-type β2 receptor (Fig.1 A). This finding is consistent with previous observations that even the less polar N-ethylmaleimide had no effect on antagonist binding to the β2 receptor (18Dohlman H.G. Caron M.G. DeBlasi A. Frielle T. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). MTSEA also had no effect on the affinity of isoproterenol in competition with [3H]CGP-12177 binding (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that none of the 13 endogenous cysteine residues is accessible for reaction in the binding site crevice of wild-type β2 receptor. In contrast, MTSEA did inhibit [3H]CGP-12177 binding in the CAM β2 receptor up to 46 ± 8% (mean ± S.E., n = 6) at the highest concentration of MTSEA tested (Fig. 1 A). Because the CAM mutation does not add cysteines, an endogenous cysteine likely became accessible for reaction with MTSEA in the CAM. 2An alternative, less likely explanation is that the endogenous cysteine reacted with MTSEA in the wild-type receptor without exerting an effect on binding, but that, because of a conformational change in the CAM, the covalently attached ethylammonium group inhibited antagonist binding. Nonetheless, either explanation requires a motion of the Cys relative to the binding site crevice. Isoproterenol retarded the reaction of MTSEA with the CAM (Fig. 1 B), consistent with access to the endogenous cysteine being through the binding site crevice. The β2 receptor contains five cysteines in the putative membrane-spanning segments. These include Cys-77 in M2, Cys-116 and Cys-125 in M3, Cys-285 in M6, and Cys-327 in M7. To determine which cysteine was responsible for the MTSEA inhibition in the CAM, we created a series of mutations in the CAM background in which we substituted the endogenous cysteines, one at a time or in combination. Mutation of Cys-285 to serine decreased the inhibitory effect of MTSEA on binding to the CAM receptor to a level indistinguishable from that observed in wild-type receptor (Fig. 2). In contrast, substitution of Cys-77, Cys-116, Cys-125, or Cys-327 had no significant effect on the inhibition of binding caused by MTSEA (Fig. 2). There are two ways in which the mutation of Cys-285 to serine could abolish the inhibitory effect of MTSEA on binding to the CAM receptor. If MTSEA reacts with Cys-285 to inhibit binding, then mutation of this residue to serine would abolish the inhibition. Another possibility, however, is that mutation of Cys-285 to serine might act as a second site revertant and eliminate the CAM phenotype. In this case, Cys-285 need not be the reactive cysteine. We investigated the phenotype of the CAM/C285S mutant by determining the affinity of isoproterenol in competition with [3H]CGP-12177 binding. As described previously (13Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the affinity of isoproterenol for the CAM is approximately 20-fold higher than for the wild-type receptor (Fig.3). This affinity was not altered significantly in the CAM/C285S mutant (Fig. 3); thus the phenotype of this receptor was still CAM-like. Cys-285, therefore, was responsible for the inhibitory effect of MTSEA on ligand binding to the CAM, and its substitution by serine abolished this inhibition. The region in M6 which contains Cys-285 is highly conserved in the β2 and dopamine D2 receptors. In the D2 receptor, Cys-385 (the cysteine which aligns with β2 Cys-285) is inaccessible to reaction with MTSEA (6Javitch J.A. Li X. Kaback J. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On a helical wheel plot, however, Cys-385 is within about 40 degrees of Phe-389 (also conserved), which is accessible to MTSEA when substituted with cysteine. 3J. A. Javitch and J. Chen, manuscript in preparation. Because we have not yet determined the accessibility of multiple cysteine substitutions in M6, we cannot yet define the specific conformational change responsible for the increased accessibility of Cys-285 in the β2 CAM. Based on our findings in the D2 receptor, however, a rotation of less than 40 degrees and/or a tilting of M6 might be sufficient to make Cys-285 accessible in the binding site crevice (Fig.4). It is not clear whether the CAM represents the active form of the receptor or a form of the receptor that can more readily assume the active conformation. The change in MTSEA accessibility in the CAM may thus reflect the increased frequency with which the receptor attains the active state. The rate of reaction of Cys-285 in the CAM with MTSEA was 0.18 ± 0.02 m−1 s−1(mean ± S.E., n = 3). In contrast, the rate of reaction of the endogenous Cys-118 accessible in the binding site crevice of the dopamine D2 receptor was approximately 40m−1 s−1(7Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). 4The rate of reaction of a sulfhydryl with MTSEA will be influenced by its water accessibility, by steric and electrostatic factors, and by ionization of the sulfhydryl. Moreover, if the position of the sulfhydryl is not static, an increase in the portion of time the sulfhydryl is in the accessible state will be reflected as an increase in the rate of reaction. Thus, while Cys-285 is much more reactive in the CAM than in the wild-type receptor, it is not likely to be freely accessible in the binding site crevice but rather intermittently accessible at the margin of the crevice. A possible mechanism for the movement of Cys-285 might involve the highly conserved Pro-288 in M6 of the β2 receptor. Mobility about proline kinks (9Fu D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Chen J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) has been implicated in the mechanism of activation of a number of membrane proteins (23Karle I.L. Flippen-Anderson J.L.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, highly conserved Pro residues are found in M2, M5, M6, and M7 of G-protein-coupled receptors. A possible mechanism of receptor activation utilizing proline kink flexibility in M6 of a G-protein-coupled receptor has been demonstrated (25Zhang D. Weinstein H. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Luo X. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1441-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Flexibility about the proline kink in M6 might allow rotation and/or tilting of Cys-285 toward the binding site crevice in the CAM. 5U. Gether, S. Lin, P. Ghanouni, J. A. Ballesteros, H. Weinstein, and B. K. Kobilka, submitted for publication. Other findings are consistent with such a conformational change being part of the normal mechanism of receptor activation. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to monitor structural changes in the β2 receptor in response to agonist binding (27Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Reaction of the cysteine-reactive, fluorescent probeN,N′dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD) with purified β2 receptor did not affect ligand binding, consistent with the absence of endogenous cysteines in the binding site crevice. Addition of agonist elicited a dose-dependent decrease in fluorescence in IANBD-labeled β2 receptor, consistent with movement of the probe toward a more polar environment. Cys-125 and Cys-285 are responsible for this agonist-induced fluorescence decrease.5 Increased polarity could come about by movement of the probe closer to the binding site crevice and/or to another membrane spanning segment. Our results suggest that Cys-285 moves closer to the binding site crevice in the CAM than in the wild-type receptor. Thus, the conformational change observed in the CAM is consistent with the rearrangement induced by agonist in wild-type receptor. In contrast, Cys-125 was not accessible to reaction with MTSEA. A rotation and/or tilting of M6 that would make Cys-285 accessible (Fig. 4) is also consistent with the rotational-translational motion predicted by spin labeling studies in rhodopsin (2Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the distance between a particular pair of cysteines at the cytoplasmic ends of M3 and M6 decreased with activation, while the distances between other pairs increased. To explain these findings, the authors proposed that M6 tilts away from M3 and rotates in an anti-clockwise direction (when viewed from the extracellular face). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the proposed rotation would reposition Cys-285 toward the water-accessible surface of the binding site crevice where it could react with MTSEA, thus accounting for our observations in the CAM β2 receptor. Moreover, flexibility around the proline kink, as discussed above, could facilitate the observed rotation and tilting in the cytoplasmic half of the membrane-spanning segment (20Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2480) Google Scholar) without requiring movement of the entire segment. The systematic application of the substituted cysteine accessibility method with both the wild-type receptor and CAM/C285S mutant as backgrounds should allow us to detect other conformational changes which accompany β2 receptor activation. We are grateful to Drs. Brian Kobilka, Robert Lefkowitz, and Stephen Rees for gifts of the epitope-tagged β2 receptor DNA, the CAM β2 DNA, and the pcin4 plasmid, respectively.

We have previously demonstrated that the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2/megalin (LRP-2), which is expressed by choroid plexus epithelium and ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles and neural tube, binds and mediates cellular uptake of apoJ (Kounnas, M. Z., Loukinova, E. B., Stefansson, S., Harmony, J. A., Brewer, B., Strickland, D. K., and Argraves, W. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13070–13075). In the present study, we evaluated the ability of apoJ to mediate binding of Aβ1–40-apoJ complex to LRP-2 in vitro. Immunoblot analysis showed that incubation of apoJ with Aβ1–40 resulted in the formation of Aβ1–40-apoJ complex and the inhibition of the formation of Aβ1–40 aggregates. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, an estimated dissociation constant (K d) of 4.8 nm was derived for the interaction between Aβ1–40 and apoJ. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was also used to study the interaction of the Aβ1–40-apoJ complex with LRP-2. The results showed that Aβ alone did not bind directly to LRP-2; however, when Aβ1–40 was combined with apoJ to form a complex, binding to LRP-2 took place. The binding interaction could be blocked by inclusion of the receptor-associated protein, an antagonist of apoJ binding to LRP-2. When LRP-2-expressing cells were given125I-Aβ1–40, cellular uptake of the radiolabeled peptide was promoted by co-incubation with apoJ. When the cells were provided purified125I-Aβ1–40-apoJ complex, the complex was internalized and degraded, and both processes were inhibited with polyclonal LRP-2 antibodies. Furthermore, chloroquine treatment inhibited the cellular degradation of the complex. The data indicate that apoJ facilitates Aβ1–40 binding to LRP-2 and that the receptor mediates cellular clearance of Aβ1–40-apoJ complex leading to lysosomal degradation of Aβ1–40. The findings support the possibility that LRP-2 can act in vivoto mediate clearance of the complex from biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and thereby play a role in the regulation of Aβ accumulation.

The accumulation takes the form of spherical extracellular deposits of Aβ fibrils in the vicinity of morphologically abnormal axons and dendrites. Associated with these so-called plaques are microglia and astrocytes. The mechanisms that lead to accumulation of Aβ are still obscure but represent an area of intense investigation. Whereas much emphasis is currently placed on trying to determine the mechanism(s) of Aβ biosynthesis from amyloid β-precursor protein processing (3Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B.

Catabolic processes may prevent the extracellular accumulation of Aβ that is expressed under normal physiological conditions yet does not accumulate to the extent seen in Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome.

Unincorporated [125I]iodine was removed by Sepharose G-15 chromatography using a 0.7 × 18-cm column equilibrated with dPBS. Radioiodinated Aβ1–40 peptide (100 μg) was combined with apoJ (50 μg in dPBS) at a 30:1 molar ratio and incubated for 36 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation, radiolabeled Aβ-apoJ complex was separated from free 125I-labeled Aβ by gel filtration chromatography using a model 650E Waters protein purification system (Waters, Milford, MA) and a Superdex-200HR column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with dPBS. The integrity of the complex was evaluated by electrophoresis under non-denaturating conditions on 4–12% polyacrylamide, Tris/glycine-containing gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) followed by autoradiography. Microtiter wells were coated with LRP-2, Aβ, or BSA (each at 3 μg/ml) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (TBS) containing 5 mm CaCl2 for 18 h at 4 °C. Unoccupied sites were either blocked with TBS containing 3% nonfat milk or treated with PBS containing 0.1%N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) (Calbiochem). For those wells that were blocked with TBS containing 3% nonfat milk, all subsequent incubations were carried out in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk plus 0.1% OG. For wells treated with PBS containing 0.1% OG, all subsequent incubations were carried out in PBS containing 0.1% OG. Bound proteins were detected using mouse monoclonal antibodies, sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK), and the chromogenic substrateo-phenylenediamine (Sigma) (1 mg/ml in 12 mmcitric acid monohydrate, 25 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, 0.0014% hydrogen peroxide). Binding data from ELISA were analyzed using a form of the binding isotherm as described by Ashcom et al. (15Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To analyze Aβ-apoJ complexes by SDS-PAGE, samples were electrophoresed on 10–20% acrylamide gradient, Tricine-containing gels (Novex) in the presence of SDS. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to ProtranTMnitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in Tris/glycine-methanol buffer for 2 h at 70 V. After transfer, the membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (pH 7.4). The membranes were then incubated with monoclonal Aβ or apoJ antibodies followed by sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) diluted in 5% nonfat milk, TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. To detect bound antibodies, the membranes were incubated with ECLTM Western blotting chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham) and exposed to BiomaxTM MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To evaluate the effect of apoJ on the internalization of125I-Aβ, mouse teratocarcinoma F9 cells (ATCC CRL 1720) were treated for 6 days with retinoic acid (RA) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) as described previously (30Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), released by trypsin-EDTA, and reseeded onto gelatin-coated 383-mm2wells of 12-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and no RA/Bt2cAMP. The cells were cultured for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2and then washed with serum-free DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin. 125I-Aβ (70 nm) in DMEM, 1.5% BSA, 1% Nutridoma serum substitute (Boehringer Mannheim) (DMEM/BSA/SS) containing various amounts of apoJ (1–40 nm) was added to the cells and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The amount of radiolabeled Aβ that was internalized by cells was defined as the amount of radioactivity that remained associated with the cell pellets following trypsin/proteinase K/EDTA treatment (11Kounnas M.Z. Loukinova E.B. Stefansson S. Harmony J.A. Brewer B.H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of LRP-2 in the cellular internalization and degradation of 125I-Aβ-apoJ complex, RA/Bt2cAMP-treated mouse teratocarcinoma F9 cells were cultured as described above. 60 min prior to the addition of125I-Aβ-apoJ complex, the medium was removed and the cells were treated with DMEM/BSA/SS containing either anti-LRP-2 IgG (200 μg/ml), control rabbit IgG (200 μg/ml), or chloroquine (0.1 mm). 125I-Aβ-apoJ complex (10 nm) in DMEM/BSA/SS or in DMEM/BSA/SS containing anti-LRP-2 IgG (200 μg/ml), rabbit IgG (200 μg/ml), or chloroquine (0.1 mm) was then added and incubated with the cells for 5 or 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The amount of radiolabeled complex that was internalized was measured as described above. Radioactivity released into the conditioned culture medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid was taken to represent degraded ligand. Total ligand degradation values were corrected for non-cellular mediated degradation by subtracting the amount of degradation that occurred when the radiolabeled complex was incubated in wells lacking cells. ELISAs were used to determine whether synthetic Aβ1–40 peptide was capable of binding directly to purified LRP-2. As shown in Fig.1 A, LRP-2 did not bind to microtiter wells coated with Aβ1–40. Likewise, Aβ1–40 (at concentrations up to 125 nm) did not bind to LRP-2-coated wells (Fig. 1 B). In parallel assays, Aβ1–40was shown to bind to apoJ in a dose-dependent manner, either when Aβ1–40 was coated onto microtiter wells and apoJ was introduced in solution phase (Fig. 1 A) or when apoJ was coated and Aβ1–40 was introduced in solution phase (Fig. 1 B). The data for solution-phase apoJ binding to immobilized Aβ1–40 (Fig. 1 A) were fit using a hyperbolic function (16Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the half-saturating level of binding (estimated K d) was determined to be 4.8 nm. This value is in good agreement with the value of 2.0 nm reported by Matsubara et al. (6Matsubara E. Frangione B. Ghiso J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7563-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding of solution-phase Aβ1–40 to immobilized apoJ was not saturable (Fig. 1 B). Such non-saturable binding can be expected given that Aβ1–40has the ability to self-associate (17Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The results indicate that Aβ1–40 does not bind to LRP-2 but does bind with high affinity to apoJ. To generate Aβ-apoJ complex, Aβ1–40 was incubated with apoJ for 24 h at 37 °C, and complex formation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, this incubation resulted in the formation of an approximately 70-kDa band, immunoreactive with monoclonal Aβ antibody (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). The anti-Aβ-reactive 70-kDa band displayed a similar electrophoretic mobility to the 70-kDa apoJ (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 4 and 6). Incubation of Aβ with ovalbumin did not produce a band having a similar molecular mass (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). Coomassie Blue staining showed that in the lane containing Aβ, which had been incubated alone for 24 h at 37 °C, there was a single band having a mobility corresponding to ∼4 kDa (Fig. 2 A,lane 3), consistent with M r of 4392. However, immunoblot analysis of this lane (Fig.2 B, lane 3) using monoclonal Aβ antibody revealed several immunoreactive species havingM r values of ∼8000 and ∼12,000 and a high molecular mass band that just entered the gel. These species likely correspond to Aβ dimer, trimer, and aggregate, respectively. Although the dimer, trimer, and aggregated species were not detectable by Coomassie Blue staining, they were immunoreactive with Aβ antibody, indicative perhaps of its preference for multimerized peptideversus the monomeric form. Each of these immunoreactive species was also present in the profile of the Aβ incubated with ovalbumin. However, the Aβ aggregate was missing in thelane containing Aβ incubated with apoJ (Fig.2 B, lane 4). The data indicated that incubation of apoJ with Aβ under the conditions that we described resulted in the formation of a complex of Aβ and apoJ that is stable in SDS. The conditions of SDS-PAGE were insufficient to permit resolution of the Aβ-apoJ complex as a discrete species having aM r ∼4000 greater than apoJ. The results also showed that apoJ inhibited the formation of aggregated Aβ while not perturbing the formation of Aβ dimer and trimer. To evaluate the ability of Aβ-apoJ complex to interact with LRP-2, microtiter wells coated with LRP-2 were incubated with mixtures of Aβ and apoJ or Aβ and ovalbumin that had been preincubated for 24 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Aβ binding to immobilized LRP-2, as detected by Aβ monoclonal antibody, occurred when Aβ was preincubated with apoJ but not with ovalbumin. Experimental controls showed that neither of the mixtures, Aβ and apoJ or Aβ and ovalbumin, bound to wells coated with BSA (Fig.3 B). When monoclonal antibody to apoJ was used to detect apoJ binding to LRP-2, the half-saturating level of binding of apoJ to LRP-2 was not significantly modified by the inclusion of Aβ (Fig.3 C). The results indicate that apoJ mediates binding of Aβ to LRP-2 and that the affinity of the Aβ-apoJ complex for LRP-2 does not appear to be different from that of apoJ alone. RAP has been shown to inhibit the binding of apoJ to LRP-2 (11Kounnas M.Z. Loukinova E.B. Stefansson S. Harmony J.A. Brewer B.H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13070-13075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of Aβ-apoJ complex with RAP completely blocked the binding of the complex to immobilized LRP-2. This, taken together with the above data, indicates that apoJ can function to bridge the interaction of Aβ with LRP-2. To determine whether apoJ might facilitate cellular internalization of Aβ, 125I-Aβ was administered to cultured LRP-2-expressing cells in the presence of varying concentrations of apoJ. As shown in Fig. 5, exogenously added apoJ promoted the internalization of 125I-Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. We next examined the cellular clearance of Aβ-apoJ complex and evaluated the role of LRP-2 in the process. Radioiodinated Aβ was combined with unlabeled apoJ, and the resulting complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography. Fig.6 A shows the chromatographic profiles of the individual components and the complex-containing mixture. Native gel electrophoretic analysis of the complex-containing fraction is shown in the inset of Fig. 6 A. The results indicated that the chromatography procedure permitted isolation of the125I-labeled complex from the bulk of the unincorporated Aβ; however, free radiolabeled peptide did copurify with the complex. Equimolar amounts of 125I-Aβ or125I-Aβ-apoJ were administered to LRP-2-expressing cells, and the level of internalization of each was measured. As shown in Fig.6 B, there was a 2-fold higher level of125I-Aβ-apoJ complex internalized as compared with125I-Aβ alone. In separate experiments, the amount of125I-Aβ internalized was unchanged by the inclusion of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled peptide (data not shown). Complex internalization was also measured in the presence of function blocking LRP-2 antibodies or control IgGs. As shown in Fig. 6 B (and Fig. 7 A), anti-LRP-2 IgG inhibited125I-Aβ-apoJ complex internalization by 59% as compared with treatment with control rabbit IgGs. The results indicate that Aβ-apoJ complex is internalized by LRP-2-expressing cells to a greater extent than Aβ alone and that the internalization of the complex can be inhibited by LRP-2 antibodies, implicating LRP-2 in the clearance process. We also evaluated whether the internalized complex was lysosomally degraded as is the case for other LRP-2 ligands including apoJ (11Kounnas M.Z. Loukinova E.B. Stefansson S. Harmony J.A. Brewer B.H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13070-13075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, administration of 125I-Aβ-apoJ complex to LRP-2-expressing cells resulted in the internalization and degradation of the complex. Degradation was evidenced by the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the conditioned culture medium that could be blocked by treatment with chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteinase activity (Fig. 7 B). Both internalization and degradation of the complex were also inhibited with LRP-2-antibodies. Taken together, the findings indicate that LRP-2 mediates endocytosis of Aβ-apoJ complex leading to its degradation in lysosomes. In this study, we document the ability of the Aβ-apoJ complex to bind to the endocytic receptor LRP-2 in both cell-free and cultured cell assays. Although the physiological relevance of this interaction remains to be established, we have previously hypothesized that it is part of a mechanism in which LRP-2-expressing epithelial cells, such as those of the choroid plexus and ependyma, can clear the Aβ-apoJ complex from the cerebrospinal fluid (11Kounnas M.Z. Loukinova E.B. Stefansson S. Harmony J.A. Brewer B.H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13070-13075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In support of such a hypothesis is the fact that both apoJ and LRP-2 are expressed at high levels in the choroid plexus epithelium as well as ependymal cells that line the ventricles of the brain and neural tube (12Kounnas M.Z. Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo ( Athens ). 1994; 8: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ahuja H.S. Tenniswood M. Lockshin R. Zakeri Z.F. Biochem. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and are therefore in direct contact with cerebrospinal fluid. In addition to LRP-2 having a possible role in clearance of Aβ-apoJ complex from the cerebrospinal fluid, there is evidence that LRP-2 may have a role in uptake of the complex from the blood by cells of the cerebral vascular endothelium (14Zlokovic B.V. Martel C.L. Matsubara E. McComb J.G. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Zlokovic B.V. Martel C.L. Mackic J.B. Matsubara E. Wisniewski T. McComb J.G. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Following our previous report on the identification of LRP-2 as the receptor for apoJ, Zlokovic et al. (14Zlokovic B.V. Martel C.L. Matsubara E. McComb J.G. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) introduced radiolabeled Aβ-apoJ complex into rat brain vasculature and observed that RAP or monoclonal antibody to LRP-2 decreased the brain uptake of the radiolabeled complex. Whereas these findings indirectly implicate LRP-2 as being responsible for the observed vascular clearance, evidence is needed to show that LRP-2 is indeed expressed by brain vascular endothelial cells. Nevertheless, the results presented in the present study provide direct evidence that LRP-2 is a receptor for the Aβ-apoJ complex, thus establishing that it could serve to mediate Aβ-apoJ endocytosis in any LRP-2-expressing tissue. Our results also indicate that apoJ inhibits the formation of high molecular weight aggregates of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 2). This activity is consistent with observations made using a sedimentation assay (10Oda T. Pasinetti G.M. Osterburg H.H. Anderson C. Johnson S.A. Finch C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and with the hypothesis that apoJ serves to maintain Aβ in a soluble form, preventing it from forming insoluble amyloid filaments. Such filaments are the hallmark component of the senile plaque found in brain parenchyma and deposited in the cerebrovasculature of patients with Alzheimer's disease (21Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4244) Google Scholar, 22Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). In addition, the Aβ-apoJ interaction may have a cytoprotective effect given that the insoluble aggregated form of Aβ has been shown to be toxic to cultured neuronal cells (23Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast to the anti-amyloidogenic and cytoprotective actions of apoJ, apoE has been shown to promote the formation of Aβ fibrils (7Ma J. Yee A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1994; 372: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 9Wisniewski T. Castano E.M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1030-1035PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are required to understand the factors that affect the in vivo interaction of Aβ with apoJ or apoE. It is possible that under normal physiological conditions, the interaction between apoJ and Aβ is favored over that of apoE to prevent amyloidogenesis. Moreover, clearance of Aβ-apoE by endocytic apoE receptors such as LRP-1 and LRP-2 may also function to limit the extracellular level of complex as we have proposed for the Aβ-apoJ complex. In this regard, the endocytic action of LRP-1 and the recently described low density lipoprotein receptor family member termed apoER2 (24Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.J. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8373-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) may be more relevant to clearance of Aβ-apoE complex from brain parenchyma than LRP-2 since LRP-1 and apoER2 have widespread expression in the parenchyma (24Kim D.H.

Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo ( Athens ). 1994; 8: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar,28Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J.

Virchows Arch. 1986; 408: 541-553Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Herein, evidence is presented indicating that one consequence of LRP-2-mediated endocytosis of Aβ-apoJ is that Aβ is targeted for lysosomal degradation. This is the end result for other LRP-2 ligands following their endocytosis (e.g. urokinase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, low density lipoprotein, and apoJ (11Kounnas M.Z. Loukinova E.B. Stefansson S. Harmony J.A. Brewer B.H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). It may, however, seem paradoxical that Aβ could be degraded in lysosomes, considering that a number of studies indicate that it can be created in lysosomes as a result of proteolytic processing of amyloid β-precursor protein (33Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 34Tsuzuki K. Fukatsu R. Takamaru Y. Fujii N. Takahata N. Brain. Res. 1994; 659: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is possible that the lysosomal presentation of Aβ in the form of a complex with apoJ may make it more susceptible to proteinase degradation. It is important to note that LRP-2 is apparently not the only means by which extracellular Aβ can be internalized. For example, fibroblasts presumably lacking LRP-2 can internalize exogenously added125I-Aβ1–42 (35Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This internalization pathway was shown to lead to intracellular accumulation of Aβ in the form of aggregates that are resistant to lysosomal proteinase degradation. LRP-2-mediated internalization may avoid this outcome by both preventing intracellular aggregate formation and promoting lysosomal degradation of Aβ."

Healthy bone results from balanced ongoing bone formation and resorption. Normal bone resorption is carried out by osteoclasts, which are terminally differentiated cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. This resorption of bone is absolutely dependent on the osteoclasts' ability to generate an acid compartment on the surface of bone (1Blair H.C. Schlesinger P.H. Rifkin B.R. Gary C.V.

The osteoclast cytoplasm is rich in carbonic anhydrase (10Gay C.V. Mueller W.J. Science. 1974; 183: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), providing a continuous supply of protons and bicarbonate. Osteoclast plasma membrane within the sealing zone develops into the ruffled border. Protons are transported across this membrane into the bone resorption compartment by a V-type H+-ATPase (11Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S.

Chloride ions passively follow the protons through conductive anion channels (19Blair H.C. Schlesinger P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combined activities of the proton pump and chloride channel acidify the resorption compartment and alkalinize the cytoplasm. Bicarbonate exits the cell into the extracellular space in exchange for chloride via a basolateral electroneutral anion exchanger, correcting the cytoplasmic alkalinization and compensating for cytoplasmic chloride loss (21Teti A. Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Kahn A.J. Koziol C. Konsek J. Zambonin-Zallone A. Schlesinger P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The net result of these coordinated transport activities is the transcellular movement of HCl into the bone resorption compartment. This model predicts that both the ruffled border proton pump and chloride channel play key roles in bone resorption. The proton pump provides the proton-motive force necessary to generate a pH gradient. However, the pump is electrogenic. The chloride channel short-circuits the electrogenic pump and allows maximal proton transport. It follows that limitation of the chloride conductance could inhibit acid transport independently of the intrinsic activity of the proton pump. Analogous to a current model for regulation of the pH of some intracellular organelles (22Al-Awqati Q. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), regulation of the anion conductance rather than proton pump activity could be the key point at which the rate of osteoclast acid transport, and hence bone resorption, is governed. Thus, molecular characterization of the ruffled border chloride channel may provide insight into regulation of osteoclast bone resorption and could define a pharmacologic target for the treatment of metabolic bone disease. We sought to determine whether the ruffled border chloride channel activity controls osteoclast acid transport. We have used the differentiation of bone marrow monocytes in culture as a model system. Bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from calcium-deprived hens have been shown to differentiate in culture spontaneously into multinucleated cells expressing markers of the osteoclast phenotype, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphate, carbonic anhydrase, and the αvβ3 integrin (23Alvarez J.I.

However, these cells poorly resorb bone until cultured with devitalized bone for at least 24 h, consistent with prior observations on the importance of bone in osteoclast development (10Gay C.V.

Thus, it appears that in a final step, exposure to bone induces a transition from morphologically differentiated but inactive osteoclasts into bone-resorbing cells. In this study, we assess the expression of the chloride channel and proton pump as bone marrow mononuclear cells differentiate in culture into bone-resorbing osteoclasts. We demonstrate that induction of the chloride channel rather than the proton pump is the critical step in development of acid transport when these cells are exposed to bone. Furthermore, we show that the ruffled border chloride channel is related to the bovine microsomal chloride channel, p64, and that novel p64-related protein and mRNA are induced as the differentiating cells are exposed to bone. Finally, we characterize the single channel properties of the ruffled border chloride channel incorporated in planar lipid bilayers. Osteoclasts and bone marrow cells were isolated from the long bones of calcium-deprived laying hens (Gallus domesticus) (30Blair H.C. Kahn A.J. Crouch E.C. Jeffrey J.J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1122-1164Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles from mature osteoclasts were prepared as described (20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These vesicles contain all the known subunits of the proton pump as well as the chloride channel required for acidification (2Schlesinger P.H. Mattsson J.P. Blair H.C. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1994; 20: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cultured cells were scraped from dishes and suspended in buffer at 4 °C as described (20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disrupted in a tight-fitting glass Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm to remove unbroken cells and bone particles. This supernatant was then spun at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to sediment all the cellular membranes. The supernatant was removed, and the membrane pellet was frozen at −70 °C for later analysis. Membranes prepared as described above were suspended in 300 μl of 140 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and allowed to re-form vesicles for 30 min on ice prior to assay. The protein concentration of this suspension was determined using the BCA protein assay method (Pierce) to correct initial rates for protein. To assay acidification, 30 μl of the vesicle suspension was added to 2.0 ml of 140 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 3.3 μmacridine orange, 2.5 mm ATP, and other reagents as indicated. The reaction was started by adding 10 mmMgCl2 to the reaction mixture at 37 °C, and fluorescence was followed in an SPF500 spectrofluorometer at an excitation of 460 nm and an emission of 520 nm (20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay provides a linear increase in initial rate over a 40-fold change in added membrane protein and can be used to compare specific activities. When desired, 0.1 μm valinomycin was added 20 s prior to the addition of MgCl2. A chicken genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by hybridization with a probe containing the entire coding region of bovine p64 (31Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated genomic clones were sequenced using the Sequenase system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). An exon was identified encoding a region homologous to the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of bovine p64. The chicken exon sequence corresponds to nucleotides 1314–1469 in the bovine p64 sequence with 84% identity. The amino acid sequence predicted by the exon corresponds to positions 387–437 (C terminus) in the p64 amino acid sequence and is followed by a stop codon. The chicken and bovine sequences show 88% identity and 94% similarity. An 18-amino acid peptide from this region,NCAADKEIEQAYADVAKRL (sites of nonidentity between the chicken and bovine sequences are underlined), was synthesized and covalently linked to rabbit serum albumin by the Peptide Synthesis Facility in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Meechum (Department of Cell Biology, Washington University). This peptide was used to immunize a rabbit (Cocalico Biological, Reamstown, PA). A high titer antiserum was obtained. The antiserum recognized both bovine p64 and the chicken osteoclast ruffled border chloride channel, p62. For Western blotting, the antiserum was affinity-purified on LacZ-p64 fusion protein (31Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) immobilized on an Amino-link column (Pierce). The antiserum against the 70-kDa H+-ATPase subunit was prepared in the same way against a peptide previously shown to be a consensus sequence of this subunit in vertebrates (18Mattsson J.P.

Freshly isolated avian medullary bone was fixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde, and 100 mm cacodylate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DNDS, 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; kb, kilobase(s).

Tissue samples (0.5 cm) were fixed at 4 °C for 18 h, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy (London Resin White, EBTEC, Agawam, MA). Silver-gray ultrathin sections were cut, collected on uncoated 83-μm pitch nickel grids, and dried for 18 h at 25 °C. Sections were hydrated for 30 min in PBS-TB (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and reacted with antibody or preimmune rabbit serum diluted 1:20 in PBS-TB for 18 h in humidified air at 25 °C. After three rinses, antibody was visualized by reaction for 8 h at 25 °C with protein A-conjugated 9-nm gold beads (Sigma) at A 520 nm= 0.2 in PBS-TB, followed by washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, rinsing in distilled water, and counterstaining with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared, separated, and blotted as described previously (31Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol.

Proton pump probes were generated from bovine kidney total RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (33Diffenbach L.W. Dueksler G.S. Respir. Physiol. 1995; 33: 41-50Google Scholar), amplifying nucleotides 707–1224 in the 70-kDa sequence (34Marushack M. Lee B.S. Masood K. Gluck S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F171-F174PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleotides 114–598 in the 58-kDa (brain) isoform sequence (35Puopolo K.M. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products of the expected size were generated and cloned by ligation with the PCR II vector (Invitrogen). The identity of clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Probes were labeled with 32P by random priming, and hybridization was carried out by standard methods (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 58-96Google Scholar) in 40% formamide at 37 °C. The final wash was at moderate stringency in 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 55 °C for 15 min. To prepare samples for Western analysis with antibody 656 (raised against the 16-mer polypeptide derived from the osteoclast ruffled border chloride channel gene), osteoclast membranes prepared as described above were suspended in 140 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES and brought to 1m NaSCN by the addition of 0.25 volume of 5 mNaSCN. The suspension was mixed and incubated on ice for 30 min, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE; electroblotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membrane by standard methods (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar); stained with Ponceau S to reveal the positions of molecular mass standards; and then blocked with TNT (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h. The primary antibodies were diluted into TNT with 1% milk and incubated with the blot for 1 h. Blots were washed four times in TNT with 1% milk for 10 min each and then incubated with alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:5000 in TNT with 1% milk for 1 h. The blot was washed as described above and developed with bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Planar lipid bilayers were prepared by spreading 30 mg/ml asolectin in n-decane across the 0.25-mm orifice of a polystyrene cuvette (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). This orifice communicated between the cis-solution (1.0 ml) and the interior of the cuvette (trans-solution; 0.5 ml). The chambers were connected to silver chloride wires by 3 m KCl and 3% agar bridges, and currents were monitored by a BCA-525 bilayer clamp and headstage (Warner Instrument Corp.). The data were digitized using Axotape software and a Digidata 1200 board (Axon Instruments, Inc.). This system was calibrated for response and accuracy using a bilayer model provided by Warner Instrument Corp. Records were archived on video tape using a Neurocorder DR-484 (Neuro Data Instrument Corp., Water Town Gap, PA). Data were commonly filtered at 1000 Hz, and digitization was at 3.3 × 103 points/s. Analysis of the data was done in part with Pclamp (Version 6.02; Axon Instruments, Inc.). Digitized data were histogramed and fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Data were plotted using Origin (Microcal, Inc). Membranes were allowed to thin to a capacitance of 400 nanofarads, at which point the bilayer typically had a leak current of <2 pA at 100 mV of applied potential. Vesicles were added to thecis-chamber with stirring, and the bilayer current was monitored for fusion and channel activity. Each current-voltage plot (see Figs. 6 and 7) was repeated (n = 3) in multiple experiments, yielding the limiting slope conductance and reversal potential indicated below.Figure 7Electrical properties of the purified ruffled border chloride channel. The DIDS affinity-purified chloride channel protein was reconstituted into asolectin vesicles by detergent dialysis at a ratio of 0.1–0.2 μg/100 mg of lipid. The reconstituted vesicles were allowed to fuse into preformed bilayers, resulting in both single and multiple channel records. A, recording from a multiple channel fusion in symmetric 140 mm KCl solutions with +40 mV applied at the arrow. The current suggests that there are ∼10–15 channels in this bilayer. The bottom trace shows the effect of an ∼60-s exposure to 200 μm DNDS in the trans-chamber on the response to a +40-mV step.

Teitelbaum S.L. Blair H.C. Greenfield E.M. Athanasou N.A. Ross P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,24Prallet B. Male P. Neff L. Baron R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and are “5-day no-bone” cells in our experiments. 4) Mononuclear cells that are cultured for 5 days with 12 μg of devitalized bone particles/ml develop into multinucleated cells that rapidly excavate bone surfaces and are referred to as “5-day plus-bone” cells. We examined acid transport and the expression of the proton pump and chloride channel in these four cell types. Ruffled border membranes prepared from mature chicken osteoclasts contain a bafilomycin A1-sensitive proton ATPase in parallel with a DNDS-inhibitable chloride conductance (19Blair H.C. Schlesinger P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acidification of these vesicles requires Mg2+-ATP and a permeable anion (i.e. chloride) and can be limited by inhibition of either the H+-ATPase or the anion channel. The chloride dependence of acidification is eliminated by collapsing the potential gradient generated by the proton pump with the potassium ionophore valinomycin, making acidification directly dependent upon H+-ATPase activity and independent of chloride channel activity. We assayed vesicle acidification in the presence and absence of valinomycin to determine whether it was limited by chloride channel activity. Activity in total cell membranes rather than subcellular fractions was studied to avoid potential complications from differences in polarization between cells grown with or without bone. Membrane vesicles from each of the cell types described above were assayed for acidification by acridine orange quenching (Fig.2) as described previously (2Schlesinger P.H. Mattsson J.P. Blair H.C. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1994; 20: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, acidification of the vesicle interior leads to accumulation of the weak base, acridine orange. The fluorescence of acridine orange is quenched as the intravesicular concentration rises, and vesicle acidification is reflected as a fall in fluorescence. During the first 3–10 s of vesicle acidification, the rate of acridine orange quenching is linear, strictly dependent upon the amount of vesicles added, and demonstrates classic hyperbolic behavior as the substrate concentration is varied (20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows the acid transport properties of vesicles prepared from 5-day plus-bone cells. These vesicles acidify rapidly on addition of MgSO4. Very little increase in the rate of acidification is seen in the presence of valinomycin, indicating that the membrane potential is not limiting. Replacement of chloride with the impermeant anion sulfate drastically inhibits acidification. Bafilomycin A1 completely blocks acidification. Thus, these vesicles contain both an active proton pump and an active chloride channel, and the chloride channel activity present is adequate to support full proton pump activity. This pattern of activity is essentially identical to the acid transport properties of ruffled border vesicles from mature osteoclasts as previously reported (20Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.L. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1315-C1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is plotted in Fig. 2 A for comparison. Fig. 2 B shows the acidification of membrane vesicles prepared from 5-day no-bone cells. In sharp contrast, these vesicles acidify poorly in a standard reaction mixture, but there is a marked increase in acidification in the presence of valinomycin. As before, bafilomycin A1 completely inhibits acidification. Therefore, membranes from 5-day no-bone cells contain an active proton pump whose activity is limited by the membrane potential. The acidification of these vesicles is limited by the low level of anion permeability, not the intrinsic activity of the proton pump. The acidification of membrane vesicles from day 1 cells is shown in Fig. 2 C. These membranes demonstrate minimal acidification, with slight enhancement by valinomycin and inhibition by bafilomycin A1. Thus, they express minimal levels of both the proton pump and chloride channel. The initial rates of acidification by each membrane preparation in the presence and absence of valinomycin are shown in Fig. 2 D. Rates were normalized to that of the ruffled border vesicles prepared from fresh osteoclasts and corrected for protein concentration. In cells cultured without bone, ∼90% of acidification is valinomycin-dependent. It is only in the presence of bone that the cells express both pump and channel activities at levels adequate to support acidification fully. A 62-kDa protein (p62) was reported to be the ruffled border chloride channel based on DIDS affinity purification and reconstitution of chloride permeability into proteoliposomes (19Blair H.C. Schlesinger P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). p64 is a chloride channel protein identified in bovine kidney microsomes by biochemical purification (31Landry D. Sullivan S.

The similarity of the two proteins led us to investigate whether bovine p64 and avian p62 are related. Antibodies raised against bovine p64 (31Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C.

Lanes 3 and 4 show identical lanes that were blotted and probed with anti-bovine p64 antiserum (31Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol.

To generate a more useful antiserum, sequences were obtained from chicken genomic clones"
https://openalex.org/W2038003361,"We previously reported that hepatocytes exhibit a reversible suppression of respiration during prolonged hypoxia (PO2 = 20 torr for 3–5 h). Also, isolated bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase undergoes a reversible decrease in apparent V max when incubated under similar conditions. This study sought to link the hypoxia-induced changes in cytochrome oxidase to the inhibition of respiration seen in intact cells. Hepatocytes incubated at PO2 = 20 torr exhibited decreases in respiration and increases in [NAD(P)H] after 2–3 h that were reversed upon reoxygenation (PO2 = 100 torr). Respiration during hypoxia was also inhibited whenN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (0.5 mm) and ascorbate (5 mm) were used to reduce cytochrome c, suggesting that cytochrome oxidase was partially inhibited. Similarly, liver submitochondrial particles revealed a 44% decrease in the apparent V maxof cytochrome oxidase after hypoxic incubation. In hepatocytes loaded with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (10 nm) to quantify mitochondrial membrane potential, acute hypoxia (<30 min) produced no change in fluorescence, consistent with the absence of an acute change in respiration. However, fluorescence increased during acute reoxygenation after prolonged hypoxia, suggesting an increase in potential. The control exhibited by NADH over mitochondrial respiration was not altered during hypoxia. Thus, changes in theV max of cytochrome oxidase during prolonged hypoxia correlate with the changes in respiration and mitochondrial potential. This suggests that the oxidase functions as an oxygen sensor in the intact hepatocyte. We previously reported that hepatocytes exhibit a reversible suppression of respiration during prolonged hypoxia (PO2 = 20 torr for 3–5 h). Also, isolated bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase undergoes a reversible decrease in apparent V max when incubated under similar conditions. This study sought to link the hypoxia-induced changes in cytochrome oxidase to the inhibition of respiration seen in intact cells. Hepatocytes incubated at PO2 = 20 torr exhibited decreases in respiration and increases in [NAD(P)H] after 2–3 h that were reversed upon reoxygenation (PO2 = 100 torr). Respiration during hypoxia was also inhibited whenN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (0.5 mm) and ascorbate (5 mm) were used to reduce cytochrome c, suggesting that cytochrome oxidase was partially inhibited. Similarly, liver submitochondrial particles revealed a 44% decrease in the apparent V maxof cytochrome oxidase after hypoxic incubation. In hepatocytes loaded with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (10 nm) to quantify mitochondrial membrane potential, acute hypoxia (<30 min) produced no change in fluorescence, consistent with the absence of an acute change in respiration. However, fluorescence increased during acute reoxygenation after prolonged hypoxia, suggesting an increase in potential. The control exhibited by NADH over mitochondrial respiration was not altered during hypoxia. Thus, changes in theV max of cytochrome oxidase during prolonged hypoxia correlate with the changes in respiration and mitochondrial potential. This suggests that the oxidase functions as an oxygen sensor in the intact hepatocyte. Cellular respiration is normally determined by metabolic activity and the corresponding rate of ATP utilization. Classical studies have shown that cellular oxygen uptake (VO2) remains essentially independent of oxygen tension (PO2) as long as the extracellular O2 tension exceeds a critical value ranging from 3–6 torr (1Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jones D.P. Am. J.

Z. 1929; 214: 5-18Google Scholar). Below this point, diffusion of O2 to the mitochondria begins to limit oxidative phosphorylation (5Jones D.P. Mason H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4874-4880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in those studies the duration of hypoxia ranged from seconds to a few minutes at most, and this brief exposure may have precluded the development of an adaptive response. More recent studies have demonstrated that isolated cells undergo a significant suppression in their rate of O2 uptake when exposed to moderate hypoxia for longer periods (6Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar, 7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). This non-lethal suppression occurs at O2 tensions (PO2) between 10 and 40 torr and is rapidly reversed when thePO2 is restored to normoxic conditions. Because the decrease in respiration was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in lactate production (6Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar, 7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar), the response would appear to reflect a decrease in ATP utilization rather than a mere shift in energy production from aerobic to anaerobic sources. The mechanism responsible for the reversible decrease in respiration during moderate hypoxia has been the focus of a number of studies in our laboratory. In this regard, evidence points to a role for mitochondria as the site of cellular O2 sensing. For example, rat liver mitochondria incubated in buffer solutions at lowPO2 (<2 torr) exhibited an inhibition in State 3 respiration after reoxygenation to PO2 = 20 torr, which was reversible when they were subsequently reoxygenated toPO2 = 100 torr (8Chandel N. Budinger G.R.S. Kemp R.A. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L918-L925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of respiration during hypoxia also was observed when the mitochondria were given TMPD 1The abbreviation used is: TMPD,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. and ascorbate as substrates, which suggested that cytochrome oxidase function was reversibly inhibited. More recently, kinetic studies of isolated bovine heart cytochrome oxidase revealed that the apparent V max of the enzyme during hypoxia was reversibly inhibited by approximately 50% after incubation at PO2 = 20 torr (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Those results suggested that O2 may interact with cytochrome oxidase, eliciting a reversible change in its catalytic function possibly through an allosteric interaction at a second binding site. Such an effect would produce a change in the reduction state of the enzyme in cells exposed to O2 tensions of approximately 20 torr for prolonged periods (i.e. >2–3 h), which in turn could allow cytochrome oxidase to function as a cellular O2sensor in the physiological range of hypoxia. The present study sought to determine whether the kinetic changes in cytochrome oxidase observed with the purified enzyme also contribute to the hypoxic responses in the intact cell. First, we assessed the function of cytochrome oxidase in intact cells and in submitochondrial particles to determine whether the changes in the oxidase were consistent with the changes in cellular respiration. Second, we studied the effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial transmembrane potential to assess the balance between electron flux and ATP consumption. Finally, we measured the respiratory control coefficients for NADH to determine whether processes controlling the supply and utilization of NADH were also affected by prolonged hypoxia. The results support the hypothesis that changes in the kinetic properties of cytochrome oxidase allow the enzyme to function as an O2 sensor in the intact cell, participating in the reversible inhibition of respiration during hypoxia. Male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats weighing 225 ± 25 g were provided with food and water ad libitum. Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of livers using methodology similar to that previously described (10Seglen P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1972; 74: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), followed by Percoll centrifugation. This procedure yielded hepatocytes with >90% viability, as determined by trypan blue (0.4%) exclusion. Cells then were studied either in suspension or adhered to glass coverslips coated with 0.1% collagen (see below). For cells studied in suspension, approximately 1.0 × 107 cells were seeded into spinner flasks containing 250 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Hepes (10 mm) and antibiotics. The media in the spinner flasks had been previously equilibrated with 21% O2, 5% CO2 or 5% O2, 5% CO2 passed through the head space in the flask. A polarographic electrode mounted in the flask was used to monitor the PO2 in the media. The spinner flasks were stirred at 60–70 rpm in an incubator regulated at 37 °C. Cellular O2 consumption rates were measured in aliquots of cells removed from the flask and studied in a magnetically stirred, water-jacketed (37 °C), anaerobic respirometer (2 ml volume) fitted with a polarographic O2 electrode. Prior to each measurement the respirometer was flushed with gas at the same PO2 used to gas the head space of the flask. Because the cell aliquots were transferred anaerobically from the spinner flask to the respirometer, contact with ambient air was prevented and the measurements of O2 uptake were obtained at approximately the same PO2 used for the incubation in the spinner flask. Mitochondrial respiration was determined as the difference between total O2 consumption and that obtained after addition of the electron transport inhibitor myxothiazol (150 ng/ml). Changes in cellular NAD(P)H concentrations were assessed from changes in the autofluorescence of stirred cell suspensions studied in a spectrofluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer) at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm, an emission wavelength of 460 nm, and a slit width of 5 nm. Cells were transferred anaerobically from the spinner flask to a quartz cuvette (4 ml) containing a magnetic stir bar. The cuvette was filled or emptied via a 4-cm capillary chimney and was maintained at 37 °C in a water-jacketed holder within the spectrofluorimeter. The cuvette had been previously flushed with 3% O2 or 15% O2 prior to addition of cells. Different respiratory inhibitors were added to the cell suspensions after allowing 2–5 min for the cells to stabilize; the change in fluorescence was measured 2 min after addition. For each replicate experiment, the extent of maximum reduction of the mitochondrial NAD(P)H pool was determined by adding β-hydroxybutyrate (20 mm) and rotenone (10 μm). Fluorescence changes are reported as percentage of fluorescence measured during maximum mitochondrial reduction. Cytochrome c oxidase catalytic activity was measured in whole cells in some studies and in submitochondrial particles in others. Cells or submitochondrial particles were incubated in spinner flasks at different designated PO2. Oxygen consumption rates were measured in the presence of rotenone (10 μm), myxothiazol (100 ng/ml), TMPD (0.5 mm), and ascorbate (5 mm). The former two compounds were used to inhibit autologous mitochondrial electron transport. TMPD is a electron donor which reduces cytochrome c nonenzymatically (11Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, when TMPD is used as a substrate, changes in O2uptake rates reflect changes in cytochrome oxidase activity. Ascorbate was used to reduce TMPD, which would otherwise become progressively oxidized. Submitochondrial particles were prepared from rat liver mitochondria as described previously (12Ardail D. Gasnier F. Lermé F. Simonot C. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the biuret procedure with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured in adherent hepatocytes on glass coverslips. Approximately 105 cells in 2 ml of media were pipetted onto coverslips (25 mm) and maintained in a humidified incubator for 12 h. Coverslips were then transferred to an anaerobic flow-through chamber (Sykes-Moore, Belco Glass Co.). A thermocouple within the chamber was used to maintain the perfusate temperature at 37 °C. The chamber was clamped to a temperature-controlled block on the stage of an inverted microscope and continuously perfused with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, 10 nm). TMRE is a cationic membrane-permeant fluorescent probe that has been shown to be distributed between cytosol and mitochondria according to Nernstian equilibrium (13Farkas D.L. Wei M.-D. Febbroiello P. Carson J.H. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1053-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As such, it has been shown to provide a qualitative measure of mitochondrial membrane potential. Because the dye is not significantly quenched in the cell, increases in fluorescence can be used to indicate relative hyperpolarization while decreases in fluorescence can be used to indicate depolarization. Cells were superfused with the dye for 1–2 h to effect loading prior to study. Quantitative fluorescence images of cells were acquired using a digital imaging system. An inverted microscope was equipped with a 75-watt xenon lamp for epifluorescent illumination. Changes in fluorescence were determined using an excitation wavelength of 535 nm and an emission of 610 nm. The excitation wavelength was obtained using interference and neutral density filters mounted in the light path between the source and the cells. Images were acquired with a 12-bit chilled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Princeton Instruments) under computer control (Metamorph, Universal Imaging). Differences among groups were analyzed using analysis of variance, followed by Student's t statistical comparisons. Statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level. Values are reported as means ± S.D. Replicate experiments were carried out using cells from separate isolations. This study sought to quantify the effects of hypoxic incubation on O2 consumption and NAD(P)H concentrations in rat hepatocytes. Cells were maintained in suspension in spinner flasks at PO2 = 100 or 20 torr for 5 h. Oxygen consumptions were measured in aliquots studied at approximately the same PO2 used for incubation, at time = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h. As shown in Fig.1, the O2 uptake at 20 torr decreased from 2.43 ± 0.82 initially to 1.39 ± 0.23 μmol/h/106 cells (p < 0.05) after 5 h at PO2 = 20 torr. By contrast, cells incubated at PO2 = 100 torr maintained their O2 uptake rates over the same interval. Cell viability was unchanged from the beginning to the end of the experiment. In separate experiments, cells were incubated at PO2 = 100 torr for 1 h, after which the oxygen tension was decreased toPO2 = 20 torr for 3 h. An aliquot of cells at 20 torr was then aspirated into a syringe containing 5% CO2 and 15% O2 and rotated axially for 5 min to restore the media PO2 to 100 torr (acute reoxygenation). Oxygen uptake rates and NAD(P)H concentrations during that study are summarized in Fig.2. The NAD(P)H fluorescence increased by 25.8 ± 7.0% while O2 uptake decreased from 2.57 ± 0.05 to 1.16 ± 0.31 μmol/h/106 cells during hypoxia. During acute reoxygenation, O2 uptake and NAD(P)H fluorescence recovered to initial values. Thus, the changes in respiratory rate and NAD(P)H seen during prolonged hypoxia were reversible within 5 min after reoxygenation.Figure 2O2 consumption rate (top) and NAD(P)H fluorescence (bottom) during hepatocyte exposure to PO2 = 100 torr (1 h),PO2 = 20 torr (3 h), andPO2 = 100 torr (min, Acute Reoxygenation).

Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) also occur within intact hepatocytes during prolonged hypoxia. Hepatocytes were maintained in suspension in spinner flasks atPO2 = 100 or 20 torr for 5 h. Cellular O2 uptake rates were measured at time = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h at the same PO2 used for incubation, immediately after addition of TMPD (500 μm), ascorbate (5 mm), and rotenone (10 μm) (Fig.3). Because TMPD supplies electrons directly to cytochrome c (1Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respiration with TMPD can provide an index of maximal cytochrome oxidase activity if cytochrome c is maximally reduced. After exposure to 20 torr for 5 h, TMPD respiration decreased from 7.76 ± 0.57 to 4.65 ± 0.2 μmol/h/106 cells (p < 0.05). By contrast, TMPD respiration remained unchanged in cells maintained at 100 torr for the same duration. After incubation under hypoxia for 5 h, cells were acutely reoxygenated to PO2= 100 torr, and TMPD respiration increased to 7.39 ± 0.27, which was not different from the initial value at PO2= 100 torr (p = not significant). The O2 dependence of cytochrome oxidase activity was also examined in submitochondrial particles from rat liver mitochondria. Submitochondrial particles were incubated without substrates in stirred suspensions at different PO2 for 4 h. Oxygen consumption rates were then assessed in aliquots studied at the same PO2 used for incubation, after addition of TMPD (500 μm) and ascorbate (5 mm) as substrates. As shown in Fig. 4 (top), submitochondrial particles incubated at PO2 < 50 torr exhibited a 43.8% decrease in cytochrome oxidase activity, compared with those studied at higher O2 tensions. The TMPD concentration dependence of the O2 consumption rate was also measured in submitochondrial particles incubated atPO2 = 100 or 20 torr for 4 h (Fig. 4,bottom). As the concentration of TMPD was increased from 0 to approximately 100 μm there was a proportional increase in the rate of O2 uptake, consistent with a progressive increase in cytochrome c reduction at these low concentrations of TMPD. At higher concentrations of TMPD the increase in O2 uptake appeared to plateau, suggesting that cytochrome c reduction was complete. Submitochondrial particles incubated under hypoxia also showed a TMPD concentration dependence of O2 uptake, but the rate was decreased by approximately 50% at each TMPD concentration compared with the normoxic particles (Fig. 4, bottom). Thus, cytochrome oxidase activity in submitochondrial particles was significantly and reversibly inhibited over a wide range of TMPD concentrations, after exposure to prolonged hypoxia. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential reflects a balance between processes contributing to the electrochemical gradient and those tending to dissipate it. Measurement of the potential can therefore provide information regarding the relative rates of these opposing processes and insight into the processes inhibited during hypoxia. For example, if the decrease in cellular respiration during hypoxia were due solely to an inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity without any change in ATP utilization, then a marked decrease in mitochondrial potential should occur. By contrast, if the decreases in cellular respiration were caused solely by a decrease in ATP utilization without any change in mitochondrial function then membrane potential should increase during hypoxia. To distinguish between these, we measured mitochondrial potential in intact hepatocytes superfused with normoxic or hypoxic media. Initial studies were carried out to confirm that the fluorescent probe TMRE behaved in the manner consistent with that expected for a mitochondrial potentiometric dye. Hepatocytes on coverslips maintained at 37 °C were imaged every 30 s for 12 min while the chamber was perfused with media at PO2 = 100 torr. Ouabain (100 μm), an inhibitor of the membrane Na+-K+-ATPase, was added to the perfusate att = 5 min. Fig. 5 (top) illustrates the increase in fluorescence observed after the addition of ouabain, consistent with the expected hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Fig. 5 (bottom) illustrates the response to gramicidin D, which should decrease the membrane potential by increasing Na+-K+-ATPase activity and thereby increasing the supply of ADP to mitochondria. Cells given gramicidin D (1 μg/ml) at PO2 = 100 torr exhibited significant decreases in fluorescence, consistent with mitochondrial depolarization. A decrease in the activity of the mitochondrial ATP synthase should result in hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Fig.6 (top) shows the effect of oligomycin (1 μg/ml) on TMRE fluorescence in hepatocytes during normoxia. The increase in fluorescence that was observed is consistent with membrane hyperpolarization. Similarly, the increase in fluorescence elicited using carboxyatractyloside (50 μm) to block the mitochondrial adenine transporter (Fig. 6, bottom) was consistent with membrane hyperpolarization. Because the mitochondrial potential is generated by electron flux, an inhibition of electron transport would limit proton pumping and cause a depolarization. Fig. 7 (top) shows the effect of myxothiazol (25 ng/ml) administered to cells atPO2 = 100 torr on TMRE fluorescence. The decrease in fluorescence is consistent with the expected decrease in mitochondrial potential. Likewise, administration of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 μm) (Fig. 7, bottom) caused a large decrease in fluorescence, consistent with the loss of membrane potential. Collectively, the above studies indicated that TMRE is capable of providing a sensitive measure of mitochondrial potential in hepatocytes. Accordingly, this probe was used to assess mitochondrial potential during hypoxia in two different studies. First, hepatocytes loaded with TMRE were equilibrated at PO2 = 100 torr for 1 h. The cells were then imaged every 30 s for 10 min, after which the PO2 of the perfusate was abruptly decreased to 20 torr and the cells were imaged for an additional 10 min (acute hypoxia). This produced no detectable change in fluorescence (Fig. 8), suggesting that mitochondrial potential remained constant. This was consistent with the absence of change in O2 uptake or TMPD respiration by intact hepatocytes during acute hypoxia (see Fig. 1). By contrast, exposure to prolonged hypoxia was associated with a decrease in O2 uptake by 3–4 h (see Fig. 1). Unfortunately, measurement of TMRE fluorescence over the same time frame is imprecise, due to drifts in the signal caused by additional uptake of dye, photobleaching, or other artifacts. As an alternative, we examined the response to acute reoxygenation toPO2 = 100 torr in hepatocytes that had been incubated for 3 h at PO2 = 20 torr. As shown in Fig. 2, acute reoxygenation had been associated with a rapid restoration of O2 consumption, indicating a reversal of the effects of prolonged hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 9, cells that had been perfused with media at PO2 = 20 torr for 3 h were imaged for 10 min to establish a fluorescence baseline. Subsequently, the media PO2 was abruptly increased to 100 torr as the cells continued to be imaged. The TMRE fluorescence increased significantly during reoxygenation, which suggested that the mitochondrial potential had increased. Such a change suggests that the rate of electron transport was acutely increased, consistent with an increase in the activity of cytochrome oxidase. Cell processes that alter mitochondrial [NADH] produce a corresponding change in cellular O2 consumption (14Hafner R.P. Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In steady state, mitochondrial [NADH] reflects a balance between “upstream” processes controlling the supply of reducing equivalents from the matrix dehydrogenases to NADH and the “downstream” steps responsible for electron transport to cytochrome oxidase and O2. The control exerted by [NADH] on cellular respiration has been described by Brown et al. (15Brown G.C. Lakin-Thomas P.L. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) in terms of the relative sensitivities of the upstream and downstream arms of this metabolic pathway to changes in the [NADH]. The resultingrespiratory control coefficient for NADH contains information related to the extent that [NADH] controls cellular respiration. In hepatocytes, Brown et al. (15Brown G.C. Lakin-Thomas P.L. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported control coefficients for NADH of 0.15 to 0.30. We carried out a similar analysis to determine whether the control coefficients for NADH were altered in hepatocytes incubated at PO2 = 20 torr. Such an effect would indicate that hypoxia must influence metabolic control at multiple sites within the cell. An absence of change in the control coefficient for NADH during hypoxia would support the notion that cytochrome oxidase acts alone in this response. To determine the sensitivity of downstream processes to [NADH], mitochondrial [NADH] was experimentally altered by adding β-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate, which influence mitochondrial redox states via their interconversion by the NAD+-linked β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase located in the mitochondrial matrix. Ketone bodies were added to suspended hepatocytes after incubation at either PO2 = 100 torr or 20 torr for 4 h, and the change in mitochondrial respiratory rate was measured. Addition of β-hydroxybutyrate to normoxic cells produced an increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence and an increase in mitochondrial respiration, whereas addition of acetoacetate produced a decrease in fluorescence and a decrease in respiration (Table I). Although cells incubated under prolonged hypoxia exhibited increased levels of NAD(P)H fluorescence compared with normoxic cells (see Fig. 2), the responses to β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were not different between the two groups (Table II). Thus, the suppression of cellular respiration elicited by exposure to prolonged hypoxia did not alter the extent to which mitochondrial [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios control respiration at sites downstream from NADH (Fig.10).Table IRespiratory control ratios in hepatocytes incubated at PO2= 20 torr for 4 hInterventionsMitochondrial respirationNAD(P)H %changeβ-Hydroxybutyrate (20 mm)14.1 ± 2.440.9 ± 10.1Acetoacetate (20 mm)−12.8 ± 4.7−37.4 ± 14.3Gramidicin D (10 μg/ml)25.5 ± 7.1−17.1 ± 5.9Myxothiazol (50 ng/ml)−66.2 ± 19.957.5 ± 18.0Oligomycin (5 μg/ml)−70.3 ± 12.363.4 ± 7.8Atractyloside (100 μm)−74.0 ± 3.971.5 ± 4.3Cells were exposed to hypoxia (PO2 = 20 torr) for 3 h.

An experimental intervention that alters the rate of electron transfer from NADH to O2 will elicit a change in [NADH] reflective of how the supply of reducing equivalents from the Krebs cycle to NADH is regulated. We studied this regulation in hepatocytes by measuring the changes in NADH when electron transport was partially inhibited by administering myxothiazol (50 ng/ml), or when electron transport was accelerated by adding gramicidin D (10 μg/ml) to stimulate Na+-K+-ATPase activity. The myxothiazol caused a 66% decrease in mitochondrial respiration, which elicited a 58% increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence. The gramicidin D caused a 26% increase in respiration and a 17% decrease in NAD(P)H fluorescence (Table I). The slope of the line relating change in [NAD(P)H] and the change in respiration was similar between hypoxic (0.83) and normoxic cells (0.82), suggesting that the control of electron supply to NADH was not influenced by hypoxic incubation (Fig. 10). The above relationships were used to calculate the respiratory control coefficient for NADH, which is the ratio of the slope relating Δ[NAD(P)H]/ΔVO2 (obtained from gramicidin D and myxothiazol studies) to the ΔVO2/Δ[NAD(P)H] (generated by the titration of ketone bodies). The overall control coefficient was 0.24 ± 0.03 during normoxia compared with 0.23 ± 0.03 in hypoxia. When comparing the slope generated by myxothiazol, oligomycin, and carboxyatractyloside to that obtained with addition of ketone bodies, a value of 0.35 ± 0.04 was obtained during normoxia, and a value of 0.32 ± 0.04 was found during hypoxia. Thus the overall control coefficient of NADH over mitochondrial respiration ranged from 0.2–0.38 in both normoxic and hypoxic groups. The similar control coefficients seen in the normoxic and hypoxic cells suggest that the control exerted by NADH over mitochondrial respiration was not influenced by hypoxia. Mitochondrial respiration involves the transfer of reducing equivalents from metabolic substrates to O2. As reducing equivalents are shuttled through the electron transport chain, some protons are pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix while others are chemically consumed, thereby generating an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane consisting of a membrane potential (Ψ) and pH gradient. The ATP synthase obtains the free energy needed for ATP synthesis from the return of protons down this gradient. Many factors are known to influence the control of mitochondrial respiration under different conditions. For example, models have been proposed to characterize the regulation of respiration by [ADP] + [Pi] (16Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol.

Nutr. 1992; 12: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the regulation of respiration in intact cells during prolonged hypoxia is still incomplete. In the present study and in a previous report (6Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar) we found that hepatocytes decrease their rate of O2 uptake when kept under physiological levels of hypoxia for several hours. These changes were reversed when the PO2 was restored to 100 torr and were not associated with a loss of cell viability. Moreover, lactate production by the cells did not increase significantly during prolonged hypoxia, indicating that anaerobic ATP production was not increased. Collectively, these observations suggest that hepatocytes may be capable of suppressing cellular ATP utilization at O2 tensions well above the critically low levels necessary to limit respiration. The present study sought to clarify the narrower question of whether the changes in cytochrome oxidase observed in vitro mediate the detection of O2 within the intact cell during prolonged hypoxia. To determine whether processes upstream or downstream of NADH contributed to the suppression of respiration during hypoxia, we examined the effects of hypoxia on the control exerted by NADH on mitochondrial respiration. An inhibition of the matrix dehydrogenases could decrease the supply of reducing equivalents to NADH, which could reduce O2 consumption and decrease mitochondrial membrane potential. Such a response could conceivably decrease the phosphorylation potential and thereby affect ATP synthesis. However, the data showed that NADH levels were increased in hepatocytes incubated under hypoxia, which indicated that prolonged hypoxia was associated with a change in the regulation of electron transport downstream from the NADH pool. Yet the control exerted by NADH supply over mitochondrial respiration was similar in the two groups. In both groups, the changes in [NAD(P)H] were large compared with the changes in O2 consumption, indicating that the control of respiration by [NADH] is small compared with that exerted by ATP. We therefore conclude that inhibition of matrix dehydrogenases is unlikely to contribute importantly to the hypoxic suppression of respiration. Rather, the responsible mechanism appears to reside exclusively within the mitochondrial electron transport chain downstream of NADH supply. The mitochondrial potential provides the driving force for ATP synthesis, and its measurement can provide insight into the factors contributing to the suppression of respiration in hypoxia. Factors that increase the flux of reducing equivalents in the electron transport chain tend to increase membrane potential by augmenting proton pumping. Conversely, factors that increase the entry of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane such as the ATP synthase or proton leaks tend to decrease mitochondrial potential. During steady state the mitochondrial potential therefore reflects a balance between the rate of electron transport and the rate of ATP utilization by the cell. If the suppression of respiration during prolonged hypoxia occurred via an inhibition of the matrix dehydrogenases or the electron transport chain without a change in the rate of ATP utilization, then mitochondrial potential would decrease. Such a depolarization could conceivably limit the rate of ATP synthesis and consequently the rate of ATP utilization. On the other hand, if hypoxia suppressed respiration by inhibiting ATP utilization at the ATPases directly, then hyperpolarization of the membrane would be predicted in response to the decrease in ADP availability. We found that reoxygenation of cells that had been incubated under hypoxia caused an abrupt restoration in O2 uptake and a significant increase in mitochondrial potential. This suggests that the membrane potential was depolarized during hypoxia, as a consequence of a decrease in mitochondrial electron transport. The results also suggest that electron transport must have increased acutely at reoxygenation without any change in the rate of ATP utilization. Interestingly, acute hypoxia elicited no decrease in potential. However, neither basal nor TMPD respiration decreased until cells had been kept hypoxic for 2–3 h, suggesting that the changes in respiratory control required several hours of hypoxia to become apparent. These results were consistent with the changes in cytochrome oxidase function observed in submitochondrial particles, where a decrease in the apparent V max required 3–4 h of hypoxic incubation. These observations implicate cytochrome oxidase as a possible oxygen sensor in intact hepatocytes, through an effect of hypoxia on the kinetic activity of the enzyme. However, the significance of the changes in membrane potential as a component in the signal transduction of hypoxia is not yet known. Experiments using submitochondrial particles supplied with TMPD and ascorbate as substrates confirmed that changes in the kinetic function of the electron transport system paralleled the changes in cellular respiration and membrane potential that were observed during hypoxia and reoxygenation. In this regard, incubation of submitochondrial particles under prolonged hypoxia induced a reversible decrease in the rate of enzymatic turnover at each concentration of TMPD. Because TMPD reduces cytochrome c, measurements of respiration with TMPD reflect the activity of the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex directly. Assuming that cytochrome c reduction increases as the concentration of TMPD was increased (see Fig. 4,bottom), these results suggest that prolonged hypoxia acts on cytochrome oxidase to cause a decrease in its turnover rate at any given level of cytochrome c reduction. This observation is consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that the purified oxidase undergoes a reversible decrease in its apparentV max when incubated in buffer solutions at similar levels of hypoxia (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations implicate a physiological role for cytochrome oxidase in the cellular response to hypoxia and suggest a mechanism by which this oxidase can function as a cellular O2 sensor. These results generate two important questions. First, how could cytochrome oxidase function as an oxygen sensor at O2concentrations much higher than its apparent K m for oxygen? Second, why should a 50% decrease in the apparentV max of the enzyme cause a decrease in respiration if the enzyme normally functions at only a fraction of its maximal velocity? A conceptual model that addresses these questions is shown in Fig. 11, which is based on the experimental data shown in Fig. 4, bottom. Note that cytochromec and the oxidase are normally present in roughly equal concentrations in mitochondria (11Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions (point A), cytochrome c exists in an incompletely reduced state, and cytochrome oxidase operates well below its maximal capacity (V max). Prolonged hypoxia appears to decrease the apparent V max of the oxidase, as evidenced by (a) the decrease in TMPD respiration observed in intact cells (Fig. 3), (b) the decrease in enzymatic turnover seen in submitochondrial particles incubated under hypoxia (Fig. 4), or (c) the decrease in V maxmeasured for isolated cytochrome oxidase (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). If a shift to this “hypoxic” state could occur instantaneously, O2consumption would fall acutely (Fig. 11, top, point B). However, continued electron flux would cause an increase in cytochrome c reduction and tend to restore O2uptake. Indeed, the normoxic level of O2 uptake could be maintained if cytochrome c were sufficiently reduced. However, a simultaneous decrease in the rate of ATP utilization by the cell would produce the inhibited state (Fig. 11, top,point C) seen after 3–4 h of hypoxia (see Fig. 1,t = 3–5 h). We did not measure cytochrome creduction directly, but we did observe an increase in [NAD(P)H] in cells incubated under prolonged hypoxia, which suggests that cytochromec reduction increased. Reoxygenation of cytochrome oxidase appears to cause an immediate restoration of its normal V max, as evidenced by (a) the rapid increase in electron transport and O2 uptake observed in cells and submitochondrial particles during reoxygenation, (b) the rapid increase in cellular TMPD respiration seen at reoxygenation, and (c) the decrease in [NAD(P)H] and the increase in mitochondrial potential seen upon reoxygenation. These changes can be interpreted according to the model shown in Fig. 11, bottom. Cells adapted to hypoxia (point C) undergo a rapid increase in respiration when reoxygenated, consistent with a rapid return of the oxidase to its native state (Fig. 11, bottom, point D). The increase in O2 uptake would cause an acute decrease in cytochrome c reduction. In steady state, ATP utilization would be restored and the cell would return to its normoxic state (point A). An assumption of the above analysis is that the decrease in respiration during prolonged hypoxia reflects a decrease in the rate of ATP utilization. In cultured cardimyocytes, prolonged moderate hypoxia caused a reversible decrease in respiration and contractile motion without a decrease in [ATP] or phosphocreatine levels (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar), which was indicative of a decrease in ATP utilization. We speculate that a similar inhibition of ATP-dependent reactions occurs in hepatocytes during hypoxia. The results of the present study are supportive of that hypothesis, but additional studies will be required to test that question directly. Under steady state conditions, ATP synthesis must match ATP utilization in the intact cell. It is unlikely that the decrease in respiration observed during prolonged hypoxia is solely a consequence of an inhibition of the oxidase, because such a limitation would limit ATP synthesis and deplete cellular ATP stores, unless ATP utilization were also inhibited. Data from the present study are consistent with the hypothesis that cytochrome oxidase acts as the O2 sensor during prolonged hypoxia. Through a signaling sequence that is not yet known, we speculate that mitochondrial responses to hypoxia initiate a reversible suppression of ATP utilization elsewhere in the cell. Reoxygenation rapidly reverses the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase, which increases mitochondrial potential by restoring electron transport while ATP utilization remains inhibited. It is conceivable that the changes in mitochondrial potential or cytochrome c reduction shown in Fig. 11 participate in this signaling sequence. However, further understanding of the details of this signaling cascade and its significance for O2 sensing in other cell types will require additional study."

Stably transfected 293 cells were obtained by selection in 800 μg/ml G418 (70% active) for 2 weeks and cloned at that stage. Supernatants of stably transfected clones were harvested after 10–12 days in culture and screened by Western blotting or receptor binding ELISA (see below) for expression levels. 293 cells (2 × 105) transiently transfected with sFasL and their corresponding supernatants (20 × concentrated, 15 μl) were heated in 20 μl of 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 3 min at 95 °C. Samples were cooled and supplemented with 10% Nonidet P-40 (2 μl) and 0.5 msodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (2 μl). Peptide N-glycanase F (125 units/μl, 1 μl) was added (or omitted in controls), and samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C prior to analysis by Western blotting. Supernatants of stably transfected cells were filtered using a 0.22-μm membrane and loaded as 40-ml aliquots onto 1-ml columns of anti-flag M2 agarose (for sFasL) or Protein A-Sepharose (for hFas-Fc) equilibrated in PBS. The columns were washed with 10 ml of PBS and eluted with 2.5 ml of 50 mm citric acid. The eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris base, concentrated, and exchanged into PBS using Centriprep-30 concentrators. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and the purity of the samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed on 12% mini gels according to previously published methods (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, 45Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with anti-flag M2 monoclonal antibodies (5 μg/ml, 0.02% NaN3, in blocking buffer: PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, 4% skim milk), followed by rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins coupled to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer). Peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Tunicamycin was stored at −70 °C at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9. Stably transfected cells secreting sFasL were grown for 10 days in the presence of 1, 100, or 1000 ng/ml tunicamycin. Cells and supernatants were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. A20 or Jurkat cells (100 μl, 50,000 cells, in 96-well plates) were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of sFasL at the indicated concentrations and 1 μg/ml M2 monoclonal antibody. In some experiments, hFas-Fc or muFas-Fc was added at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 1 μg/ml Protein A. Four to 8 h after the addition of FasL, 20 μl of a solution containing 2 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) reagent (Promega) and 50 μg/ml phenazine methosulfate was added to the cells. Following color development (2–4 h), absorbance at 490 nm was taken with an ELISA reader. 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp) were coated with either hFas-Fc or muFas-Fc (1 μg/ml in PBS, 100 μl, 2 h, 37 °C). The following incubation and washing steps were performed: (a) saturation in block buffer (PBS, 5% FCS, 300 μl, 1 h, 37 °C), (b) three washes (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20), (c) incubation with sFasL (10–1000 ng/ml in PBS containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μl, 1 h, 37 °C), (d) three washes, (e) incubation with M2 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml in block buffer, 100 μl, 37 °C, 30 min), (f) three washes, (g) incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase (1/1000 dilution in block buffer, 100 μl, 30 min, 37 °C), (h) three washes, (i) detection (0.3 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine hydrochloride, 0.01% H2O2 in 50 mmcitric acid, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 200 μl, as necessary (1–5 min), 25 °C), and (j) termination (2 n HCl, 50 μl). Absorbance was taken at 490 nm with an ELISA reader. sFasL samples (5 μg in 100 μl) were mixed with the internal standards catalase and ovalbumin, then loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR10/30 column, and the proteins were eluted in PBS at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.25 ml) were analyzed using the receptor binding ELISA (using 5 μl of fractions for active ligands), and Western blotting was carried out after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the entire fraction. The column was calibrated with standard proteins: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Molecular models for both Fas and FasL were generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods as implemented in the Swiss-Model server (46Peitsch M.C. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 47Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). A molecular model for FasL was built using the known tridimensional structures of both TNFα (48Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lymphotoxin α (TNFβ) (49Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W.

Immunol. 1995; 32: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The known structure of the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (51Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was used to produce a molecular model for Fas. In both cases, the modeling procedure was started by submitting the respective protein sequences to Swiss-Model via the First Approach Mode. The resulting models were then used to correct the automated multiple sequence alignments generated by the server in several loop regions. These corrected alignments were resubmitted to Swiss-Model through the Optimize Mode. The resulting models were structurally sound, and did not show obvious sequence or structure inconsistencies (51Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) according to three-dimensional/one-dimensional profiles (52Luethy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar) and ProsaII (53Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of the Fas-FasL complex was generated using the x-ray structure of the human lymphotoxin α-TNF receptor I complex (54Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). Three copies of the ligand model and three copies of the receptor model were superimposed onto the corresponding subunits of the experimental structure. The hexameric protein complex was further refined by 200 cycles of energy minimization with CHARMM (53Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The three N-glycosylation sites are located at Asn-184, Asn-250, and Asn-260 in the FasL model. A short branched N-linked glycan structure (GlcnAcβ1–4Manα1–6[Manα1–3]Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1 –4GlcNAc) was extracted from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entry 9API, and was linked to the respective asparagines using interactive graphics. A plasmid encoding the signal peptide of hemaglutinin, in frame with a flag epitope and the COOH-terminal portion of the extracellular domain of human Fas ligand (amino acids 139–281), was transfected into the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. Secreted sFasL was affinity-purified using immobilized anti-flag antibodies. The theoretical molecular mass of the encoded recombinant protein is 18.2 kDa. Purified sFasL migrated as a doublet on SDS-PAGE with deduced molecular masses of 29 and 25.5 kDa (Fig.1 A). Taken together with previous data (55Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), this heterogeneity and the discrepancy between predicted and observed molecular masses suggest that carbohydrates are present on the sFasL. Indeed, sFasL present in both cell extracts and cell supernatants could be digested with peptide N-glycanase F to a single band with the predicted molecular mass of 18 kDa (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the various species of sFasL differed by their degree ofN-glycosylation. This result was confirmed when cells were treated with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin; a dose-dependent accumulation of cellular, unglycosylated 18-kDa sFasL was observed with concomitant loss of sFasL secretion (Fig. 1 C). A total of four evenly spaced bands of sFasL could be detected, which probably correspond to the unglycosylated, mono-, di-, and tri-N-glycosylated sFasL monomers. Thus, all three potential N-glycosylation sites of human FasL (Asn-184, Asn-250, and Asn-260) appear to be used. Interestingly, secreted sFasL is consistently found in its highly glycosylated form, even at intermediate tunicamycin concentrations where unglycosylated sFasL is by far the predominant cellular species (Fig. 1 C). This strongly suggests that N-linked oligosaccharides are required for efficient secretion of sFasL.Figure 1Glycosylation of sFasL. Panel A, Coomassie Blue staining of sFasL. The flag-tagged sFasL in conditioned supernatants of stably transfected 293 cells was affinity-purified on anti-flag M2 agarose, and 1.5 μg was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The molecular mass markers (in kDa) are indicated. Panel B, peptide N-glycanase F digestion of sFasL. 293 cells transiently transfected with flag-tagged sFasL were grown for 72 h in serum-free medium. Cell extracts (Cells, 2.5 × 105 cells/lane) and 20 × concentrated supernatant (S/N, 15 μl/lane) were treated with or without peptide N-glycanase F (PNGase F) and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-flag M2 antibodies.Panel C, the effect of tunicamycin on the glycosylation and secretion of sFasL. Stably transfected 293 cells were grown for 10 days in serum-free medium and in the presence of the indicated concentrations of tunicamycin. Cells (2.5 × 105/lane) and supernatants (20 μl) were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-flag M2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next generated a molecular model of the FasL-Fas complex (Fig.2) using knowledge-based protein modeling methods and the known tridimensional structures of lymphotoxin α (TNFβ) and the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (49Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). It can be seen that theN-linked oligosaccharides are concentrated on the lateral edge of each FasL monomer, leaving vertical clefts, which would allow the receptor to reach the interaction site of the ligand. Two of the three glycosylation sites of the FasL have counterparts in other family members. Residue Asn-260 of FasL is also found at the corresponding position in lymphotoxin β, CD27L, and CD40L, whereas residue Asn-250 of FasL corresponds to a site in CD30L. In some TNF family members, N-glycosylation appears to be important for the biological activity of the protein. For example, FasL, which can be expressed in a variety of eukaryotic systems (20Tanaka M. Suda T. Haze K. Nakamura N. Sato K. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. Mizuki M. Tagawa S. Ohga S. Hatake K.

The extensively glycosylated CD30L (four putative N-glycosylation sites) is also best produced in a recombinant form in eukaryotic systems (57Jumper M.D. Nishioka Y. Davis L.S. Lipsky P.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2369-2378PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylated recombinant CD40L is readily expressed at the surface of eukaryotic cells, but transport to the cell surface is blocked in the presence of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (57Jumper M.D. Nishioka Y. Davis L.S. Lipsky P.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2369-2378PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TNFα (58Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and lymphotoxin α (59Goh C.R. Loh C.-S. Porter A.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) can be produced in a soluble, non-glycosylated and active form in prokaryotic expression systems. When these two latter ligands are expressed in eukaryotic systems,N-glycosylation can result in minor effects such as a 10-fold decrease in specific activity of TNFα (60Koyama Y. Hayashi T. Fujii N.

We observed inhibition of glucocorticoid-specific gene induction in several responsive cell systems. Hormone binding abilities of receptors for glucocorticoid, progestin, androgen, and estrogen were inhibited upon exposing intact cells to geldanamycin. Inhibition was only seen when geldanamycin was applied to cell cultures under growth conditions or was present during in vitro synthesis; presynthesized receptors in cell extracts were not affected. Upon withdrawal of geldanamycin, glucocorticoid binding ability was regained; this was partially independent of de novo protein synthesis. Geldanamycin caused decreased levels of immunoreactive glucocorticoid receptors in wild-type cells with enhanced degradation occurring through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Analysis of receptors from treated cells revealed a heteromeric structure of normal size in which the receptor polypeptide is complexed with normal amounts of hsp90 and the immunophilin p59. These data support the view that hsp90 actively participates in steroid-induced signal transduction, and they suggest that geldanamycin affects receptor action without disrupting hsp90-containing heterocomplexes per se. Nevertheless, complexes synthesized and assembled in vitro in the presence of geldanamycin differ from receptors of cellular origin.

Steroid hormone receptors are members of the ever growing family of nuclear receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B.

Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar). They are characterized by sequence homologies that are most prominent within the DNA binding domains. In contrast to most other members of the family, steroid hormone receptors are known to be complexed with heat shock proteins, most notably hsp90, 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: hsp90 and hsp70, heat shock proteins of M r90,000 and 70,000, respectively; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), ORG 2058, 16α-ethyl-21-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; triamcinolone acetonide, 9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-ketal with acetone. 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: hsp90 and hsp70, heat shock proteins of M r90,000 and 70,000, respectively; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), ORG 2058, 16α-ethyl-21-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; triamcinolone acetonide, 9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-ketal with acetone. and heat shock proteins are involved in steroidal signal transduction (for reviews, see Refs. 3Bohen S.P.

The association with heat shock proteins thus prevents these receptors from interacting with specific DNA recognition sequences while they are not yet complexed with the respective steroidal ligands. On the other hand, hsp90 in association with receptor polypeptides appears to significantly contribute to the receptors' hormone binding ability, as has been established for several steroid hormone receptors (5Bresnick E.H.

Interestingly, geldanamycin and herbimycin A, major representatives of ansamycin antibiotics, were found to directly interact with hsp90 (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). This observation prompted a series of investigations into the effects of these drugs on steroid hormone receptors. In the present study we show that geldanamycin at non-toxic concentrations inhibits hormonal inducibility in several responsive cell systems. Moreover, this drug affects the binding of glucocorticoid, progestin, androgen, and estrogen to their specific receptors but does not per se interfere with the interaction of hsp90 with the receptor polypeptide, thus leaving the overall heteromeric receptor structure intact.

Bovine insulin (50 μg/ml) was added as carrier, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were dissolved in 0.4 m Tris base. EGS cross-linked receptors after immunopurification and acid precipitation were reprecipitated with cold acetone (8-fold volume) and submitted to continuous SDS-PAGE as before with incompletely cross-linked phosphorylase a as markers (22Rexin M.

Elution from gels was by maceration in 50 mmTris buffer, pH 7.2 (containing 0.1% SDS), followed by cleavage of cross-links with 1 m hydroxylamine at 37 °C for 3 h (22Rexin M. Busch W. Gehring U. J.

Standard discontinuous SDS-PAGE was in 10% gels with rabbit muscle phosphorylase (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.4 kDa), and bovine liver catalase (59 kDa) as molecular size markers. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) in 25 mm Tris, 48 mm glycine, containing 10% methanol, overnight at 50 V in the cold.

Incubation with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (Sigma) and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) were used for detection; evaluation was by scanning densitometry. Chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia) was in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. Columns (bed volume, 200–210 ml) were calibrated in separate runs with blue dextran 2000,Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (Stokes' radiusR S = 6.85 nm), bovine liver catalase (R S = 5.23 nm), and human hemoglobin (R S = 3.21 nm), however, blue dextran and hemoglobin were included in each experiment. The rat glucocorticoid receptor (20Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikström A.-C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) was synthesized by combined transcription/translation (TNT; Promega) in 50-μl samples for 90 min at 30 °C using 1 μg of the cDNA construct that contains the SP6 promoter. Preincubation with geldanamycin was for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were incubated with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide (60 nm) for 2 h at 0 °C and subsequently passed through Sephadex G-50 (bed volume, 1.3 ml). Effluent fractions (150 μl) were treated with alkaline H2O2 (20%) for 15 min at room temperature, and excess H2O2 was removed at 90 °C before scintillation counting. Some synthesis reactions were in the presence of [35S]methionine. In preliminary experiments with several cell lines in culture we established the concentrations of geldanamycin that are tolerated by these cells. We observed that incubation with 0.1 μg/ml for up to 2 days had only a slight effect on the doubling time of the cells used in this study, except for the WEHI-7 line, which appeared to be particularly sensitive and was affected even by such low concentrations of geldanamycin. However, treatment at 0.3–1.0 μg/ml for several hours and subsequent washout was found to have no deleterious effect on further growth of WEHI-7 cells. We therefore routinely used this concentration range in our experiments with intact cells. To check whether geldanamycin affects hormonally controlled gene expression, we first turned to one of the classical systems: induction of hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase in response to glucocorticoid. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the induction of enzymatic activity in rat hepatoma cells of line HTC was significantly reduced upon administration of geldanamycin together with the steroid. In another experiment we employed 3T3 fibroblasts that have been stably transfected with steroid-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (32Härtig E. Nierlich B. Mink S. Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 813-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exposed them to geldanamycin. Glucocorticoid induction of enzyme activity was greatly repressed (Fig. 1 B). Quantitative evaluation by scanning showed an 8.7-fold increase in activity by triamcinolone acetonide (Fig. 1 B, lane 2 versus lane 1), which was reduced to 1.2-fold by the drug (lane 4 versus lane 1). We also used COS-7 cells and transiently transfected them with a corresponding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct as well as the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (Fig. 1 C). In this experiment, treatment with geldanamycin and triamcinolone acetonide was overnight. We observed a 28-fold induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase by hormone, which was inhibited by geldanamycin to roughly half. These data clearly show that geldanamycin interferes with steroid hormone inducibility in different cell types. However, the extent of inhibition appears to vary between cell systems. We also observed that the magnitude of the drug effect depended on the time of incubation. In any event, geldanamycin greatly dampens the action of steroid hormones in target cells. For hormone binding studies we initially used intact WEHI-7 mouse lymphoma cells and the glucocorticoid [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. The Scatchard analyses of Fig. 2 were carried out at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of geldanamycin. Within 3 h of treatment with 0.3 μg/ml, hormone binding capacity decreased to about a third of that of untreated cells; some effect was also seen on the affinity for the ligand. Inhibition of hormone binding is readily reproduced in cell-free experiments using extracts of cells pretreated with the drug (Table I). Several such binding studies yielded a 80–90% reduction in the number of glucocorticoid binding sites after preincubation of cells with 0.3 μg/ml geldanamycin.Table IEffect of geldanamycin on specific hormone bindingGeldanamycin treatmentSpecific hormone binding in cell extracts (percentage of control)%Glucocorticoid receptor (WEHI-7 cells) Pretreatment of intact cells, 37 °C, 2 h1-aIn five independent experiments specific binding varied between 1110 and 3350 fmol/mg of protein in the control (average 1860 fmol/mg) and between 90 and 610 fmol/mg of protein in treated samples (average 290 fmol/mg); residual binding activity was 8–25%.15.0 ± 6.2 (S.D.)

Open table in a new tab WEHI-7 cells and extracts thereof were treated with 0.3 μg/ml geldanamycin, while T-47D, MCF-7, and Rat1A cells received 0.6 μg/ml. Specific binding was determined by Scatchard analysis in cell extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, the addition of geldanamycin to receptor containing extracts of untreated WEHI-7 cells did not produce any effect. No inhibition was seen whether the cell extract was preincubated with geldanamycin for 2 h in the cold or for 30 min at 37 °C (TableI). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of geldanamycin was not seen when cells were kept in the cold during exposure to the drug (data not shown). These observations may suggest that active cellular processes are required for inhibition to occur. To substantiate this view, we used glucocorticoid receptors in vitro synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate system. While the control sample showed ample binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide, there was almost no hormone binding when receptor synthesis was carried out in the presence of geldanamycin (Fig.3 A). To check whether the drug might affect the in vitro synthesis system itself, we carried out parallel incubations in the presence of [35S]methionine. We detected equal amounts of receptor polypeptide in the treated sample and the control (Fig. 3 A, inset). To find out about the specificity of inhibition by geldanamycin, we also investigated the progestin receptor of T-47D mammary carcinoma cells, the estrogen receptor of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells, and the androgen receptor overexpressed in fibroblasts. In these studies we used binding assays with cell extracts rather than intact cells, since they are less error-prone according to our experience. As summarized in Table I, inhibition of hormone binding was observed in each case upon pretreatment of intact cells with geldanamycin, although the drug affected the respective receptors to different extents. Interestingly, the androgen receptor was significantly less sensitive than the other receptors. This corresponds to the previous observation that there is no absolute requirement of hsp90 association for hormone binding to the androgen receptor (33Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, with progestin and estrogen receptors, pretreatment of intact cells with geldanamycin was required for the inhibitory effect to show up, and there was no inhibition of hormone binding if extracts were incubated with the drug (Table I). The above binding studies made it necessary to directly investigate the receptors of geldanamycin-treated cells. For example, hormone binding might be affected if the drug disrupted the association of hsp90 with receptor polypeptides. In fact, the glucocorticoid receptor stripped of heat shock proteins has been reported to possess significantly decreased ligand binding activity (5Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Segnitz B. Gehring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2789-2796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Denis M. Gustafsson J.-Å. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1880-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, receptor devoid of hsp90 might have a much faster intracellular turnover than the complexed form; consequently, cells would accumulate much lower receptor levels. We therefore checked by immunoblotting for the glucocorticoid receptor polypeptide in extracts of geldanamycin-treated WEHI-7 cells. In all cell samples we detected significant levels of immunoreactive receptor; however, the intensity of the receptor signal was lower in samples from geldanamycin-treated cells than in samples from untreated cells. The degree of receptor loss varied among experiments, with 46 ± 12% (S.D.) of control levels in seven independent experiments, as evaluated by scanning. Fig. 4 A shows a representative experiment in which 63% of control receptor levels were obtained as judged by scanning. In one experiment, we treated cells with higher concentrations of geldanamycin and for up to 4 h but did not detect any further decrease of immunoreactive receptors (data not shown). In all of these experiments with WEHI-7 cells, there was no obvious correlation between such losses of immunodetectable receptor polypeptide and the decrease in hormone binding ability. We next investigated the size of glucocorticoid receptors by gel permeation chromatography. We had previously established that the receptor complexed with heat shock proteins elutes from Sephacryl S-300 columns with a Stokes' radius of roughly 8 nm, while the receptor stripped of hsp90 has a radius of 6 nm (21Gehring U. Mugele K. Arndt H. Busch W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 53: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Rexin M. Busch W. Gehring U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5593-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 4 B, we therefore pooled the effluents corresponding to the void volume and the 8- and 6-nm regions, respectively, and analyzed them by immunoblotting for receptor polypeptide. The receptor was exclusively recovered in the 8-nm region independent of pretreatment of the cells with geldanamycin. Interestingly, there was no receptor material recovered in the 6-nm region, demonstrating that geldanamycin-treated cells do not contain the naked receptor polypeptide. In another experiment we pooled 2-ml effluent fractions and individually analyzed them by immunoblotting. We did not obtain any evidence for a change in receptor size by pretreating cells with the drug (data not shown). To independently assess the size of glucocorticoid receptors contained in geldanamycin-treated WEHI-7 cells, we used chemical cross-linking with EGS (22Rexin M. Busch W. Gehring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24601-24605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Segnitz B. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This stabilization of heteromeric structures allows their analysis by continuous SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. High molecular weight receptor material of 340 ± 15 kDa was detected as judged from cross-linked phosphorylase marker bands (Fig.4 C). A comparison of lanes 1 and 2again shows less receptor material in the sample from cells exposed to geldanamycin. However, by far the major portion of immunodetectable receptors is of the same size whether extracted from untreated or treated cells. To investigate the components of hormone binding-incompetent receptors produced in geldanamycin-treated cells, we again made use of chemical cross-linking. Extracts of WEHI-7 cells exposed or unexposed to geldanamycin were cross-linked with EGS followed by extensive receptor-specific immunopurification and continuous SDS-PAGE. Receptor material was excised and eluted from gels, and cross-links were cleaved. Samples were then analyzed by discontinuous SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the receptor polypeptide, hsp90, and the p59 receptor component (Fig.5). Both preparations yielded specific immunosignals of about the same intensity for all three proteins. This suggests that the majority of glucocorticoid receptor molecules within cells maintain their heteromeric structure in the presence of geldanamycin although hormone binding ability is impaired. Interestingly, in the experiment of Fig. 5, similar intensities of receptor signals were obtained in both samples, thus underlining the above mentioned variability in receptor yields with geldanamycin present. The lower portion of the blotting membrane was also stained with monoclonal antibody JJ3 directed against the component p23 (31Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, no immunosignal was observed with either of the highly purified receptor preparations (data not shown). The above experiments suggest that geldanamycin does not interfere with the intracellular formation of receptor complexes of normal size and composition. Nevertheless, we also che"

Roughly half of all neurons produced by neurogenesis die during development of the mammalian nervous system (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). Neuronal survival is determined largely by neurotrophic factors such as NGF produced by target cells, and neurons that do not obtain an adequate supply of survival factors undergo apoptosis (2Korsching S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2739-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated sympathetic neurons from rat superior cervical ganglia (SCG) are mainly used as an in vitro model of neuronal PCD and have been characterized extensively (3Martin D. Schmidt R. DiStefano P. Lowry O. Carter J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 4Edwards S.N. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this culture system, the majority of neurons die after removal of NGF from the culture medium. The characteristics of this neuronal death such as shrinkage of the neuronal soma with intact organelles, nuclear condensation, fragmentation of the DNA into oligonucleosomes, and blebbing of the plasma membrane are hallmarks of apoptosis (5Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 6Edwards S.N. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2140-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Neuronal death in this system can be prevented by inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis, suggesting that this phenomenon is controlled by a genetic program (7Johnson Jr., E.M. Deckwerth T.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the search for constituents of the genetic program, several genes have been identified using this in vitro model. Immediate early genes such as c-fos and c-jun and cell cycle-related genes such as c-myb and cyclin D1(8Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson Jr., E.M. J.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) are these candidates. Especially cell cycle-related genes stimulate the postmitotic neurons to attempt re-entry into the cell cycle, and these comflicting growth-regulatory signals are thought to cause neurons to undergo apoptosis. On the other hand, several anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 (10Garcia I. Martinou I. Tsujimoto Y. Martinou J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 11Greenlund L.J.S. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M.

Yuan J. Science. 1994; 263: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) have been reported. Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene products in sympathetic neurons has been shown to protect neurons from apoptosis (10Garcia I. Martinou I. Tsujimoto Y. Martinou J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2 have been reported to prevent the loss of mitochondrial function (14Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). CrmA gene products also prevent neuronal death induced by NGF deprivation. This activity is attributed to interleukin 1β-converting enzyme protease inhibition (13Gagliardini V. Fernandez P.A. Lee R.K.K. Drexler H.C.A. Rotello R.J. Fishman M.C. Yuan J. Science. 1994; 263: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar,15Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Re-entry into the cell cycle and activation of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like proteases are closely associated with neuronal PCD, but the molecular events or cascades underlying neuronal death regulated by the genetic program still remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms, it is crucial to list the molecules involved in this process and to examine the relationships between them. For this purpose, using the differential display technique (16Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar), we screened for genes, the expression of which is induced during neuronal PCD, and identified one candidate, named DP5. Here we report its structure, expression patterns, and putative biological functions. Sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglia of 1-day-old Sprague Dawley rats were isolated and cultured as described by Ham et al. (17Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Digested cells were preplated to minimize the number of non-neuronal cells in uncoated 10-cm dishes for 3 h. The resultant supernatant enriched in neurons was then plated on 10-cm dishes coated with collagen (Koken, Tokyo, Japan) in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mmglutamine, 20 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, 20 μmuridine, and 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (Promega). The neurons were maintained for 5–7 days in the presence of NGF before being subjected to screening, Northern blotting, and RT-PCR analyses. NGF withdrawal was carried out by changing the medium to DMEM/10% FCS lacking NGF and containing anti-NGF antibodies (CIDtech Research Inc., Ontario, Canada) diluted 1:1000. PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Neuronal PC12 cell cultures were prepared by treatment with 50 ng/ml NGF in DMEM containing 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 0.02 μm progesterone for 7–10 days. Deprivation of NGF was performed as for SCG neurons. Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar) from SCG neurons cultured for 15 h in medium containing NGF and those cultured in medium from which NGF had been removed. Differential display was carried out essentially as described previously (16Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar). cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA with reverse transcriptase after DNaseI treatment, and PCR was performed using a ramdom primer with the synthesized cDNA as a template. We used about one hundred different random primers (12-mers, Common primer, Bex Inc.) for screening. After separation by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cDNA bands of interest were cut from the gel, reamplified using the same primers from the eluted cDNA solution, and then cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). A 630-bp DP5 cDNA fragment (DP-PCR) obtained by differential display was used to screen 1 × 106 plaques from each of a newborn rat brain Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library, an adult rat brain λZAPII cDNA library, and a newborn mouse brain λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene). Standard phage screening techniques were employed. Several rounds of screening were performed using 3′- and 5′-regions of cDNA fragments obtained by the first screening as probes to obtain overlapping clones almost covering the full-length DP5 cDNA. Total RNA was fractioned by electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Immobilon N membranes (Millipore). Filters were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probe generated from the DP5 cDNA DP-PCR, with a specific activity between 5 × 108 and 3 × 109 cpm/μg DNA by the random hexamer procedure (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B.V. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). After washing in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, filters were dried and autoradiographed. Aliquots of 3 μg of total RNA purified from preplated SCG cultures were reverse-transcribed using 300 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 60-μl reaction mixture in the presence of 2.5 μm oligo(dT) primer and 20 μm dNTP mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. For PCR amplification, specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (0.5 μm each) were incubated with 1 μl of cDNA, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 1 × Taq buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), 10 μm dNTP mixture, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in a 20-μl reaction mixture. Oligonucleotides used for amplification of DP5 cDNA were DP5–5′, 5′-AGACCCAGCCCGGACCGAGCAA-3′, 347–368; DP5–3′, 5′-ATAGCACTGAGGTGGCTATC-3′, 516–535. Typical cycle parameters were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 22–24 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min. 10-μl aliquots of each reaction mixture were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels, and the dried gels were subjected to autoradiography and quantitative analysis (Scanning Imager, Molecular Dynamics). Control experiments were performed to determine the range of PCR cycles over which amplification efficiency remained constant. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by subcloning the amplified cDNAs into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequencing. Sf21 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DP5. Recombinant fusion proteins extracted with Triton X-100 were purified by chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Typical yield of fusion protein was 1 mg per 2 × 108 infected Sf21 cells. Antibodies were raised against the recombinant GST-DP5 fusion protein. Immunization of rabbits and screening of antisera were performed as described previously (20O'Rourke K.M. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24921-24924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of DP5 polypeptide, 1 × 106 SCG neurons were plated per 10-cm dish and incubated for 7 days in the presence of NGF. One dish was used per immunoprecipitation. Neurons were harvested and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min to remove large cellular debris. For each immunoprecipitation, 3 μg of the anti-GST-DP5 fusion antibody was used. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker with the antibody. Anti-rabbit IgG agarose (Sigma, 20 μl) was added to each sample followed by another 1-h incubation at 4 °C on a rocker. The beads were then washed five times in the lysis buffer to reduce nonspecific binding. On the last wash, all buffer was removed, and reducing sample buffer was added to each reaction. Samples were boiled and loaded onto a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore). Blots were preblocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat milk, and washes were performed using PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Primary antibodies were used at 0.2–0.5% (v/v), and detection was performed with 0.1% alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) in PBS-T with 5% nonfat milk by the alkaline phosphatase method. The DP5 cDNA DP-7W was subcloned in both sense and antisense orientation into the XbaI site of pEF-BOS (21, pEFDP5 and pEFantiDP, respectively). For the control vectors, the lacZ gene (3.5-kbp cDNA containing the open reading frame of β-galactosidase derived from pCH110,CLONTECH) were cloned into pEF-BOS (pEFlacZ). The rat bcl-2 cDNA was cloned by PCR using RNA from rat brain and was also cloned into the XbaI site of pEF-BOS. Microinjection was carried out using a Narishige micromanipulator. Microinjection needles were pulled from glass capillaries using a vertical electrode puller and loaded using Eppendorf microloaders. DNA was injected directly into the nucleus. Each expression vector, pEFDP5, pEFantiDP, and pEFlacZ, was injected in 0.5 × PBS at a concentration of 0.05–0.2 mg/ml. Approximately 80–90% of SCG neurons survived after microinjection. For analysis of the effects of expression vectors on neuronal cell death, neurons were plated at a density of 100 per measure (3 × 3 mm) and used 5–7 days after plating. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (The Jackson Laboratory) was used to mark the injected cells in these experiments and was added to the injection mixture at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The neurons were maintained in the presence of NGF, and the numbers of living cells were counted based on morphological criteria and trypan blue staining at various time points after microinjection. For X-gal staining of neurons expressing β-galactosidase, cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 3 min and stained with X-gal solution (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 3 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% X-gal) at 37 °C. TUNEL was carried out essentially as described previously (22Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9100) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temparature. They were then rinsed three times in PBS and incubated in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. After washing twice, in situ labeling of apoptosis-induced DNA strand breaks was performed using an In situ Cell Death Detection Kit, fluorescein (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were analyzed directly under a fluorescence microscope. Previously, the commitment point for cell death in the culture model, as defined by the ability of half of the neurons to be rescued from death by readdition of NGF or addition of cycloheximide (CHX), has been shown to occur after approximately 15–17 h (23Tanaka S. Koike T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and this was confirmed by our results (data not shown). Sufficient quantities of “death gene” or “death-related gene” products and their mRNA would have accumulated by this time. Therefore, we collected mRNAs from SCG cultures 15 h after NGF withdrawal. The control mRNAs were isolated from SCG neurons which were cultured in medium containing NGF. These mRNAs were reverse-transcribed and screened for genes induced during neuronal PCD by the differential display technique (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although most of the bands observed in this screening showed the same patterns in both control neurons and those in which PCD was induced, we isolated one clone (DP5), the expression of which was strongly induced during cell death, and the length of the cDNA fragment amplified by PCR was 630 bp (designated as clone DP-PCR, Fig.1). The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment showed no homology with those of known genes registered in the EMBL, GenBankTM, and DDBJ data bases. By Northern blot analysis, a cDNA probe synthesized from 630 bp of the DP5 cDNA DP-PCR was shown to hybridize with a single mRNA species of about 5.5 kb, and expression of DP5 mRNA was specific to the neurons in which PCD was induced (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Northern blot analysis of DP5 mRNA expression. A, DP5 mRNA expression in SCG neurons 15 h after NGF deprivation. The 32P-labeled DP5 cDNA probe hybridized to an RNA species of approximately 5.5 kb. Total RNA isolated from control neurons or from neurons in which PCD was induced was loaded in each lane. Ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal RNAs (18 S) indicate that the amounts of total RNAs were nearly equivalent in each lane. B, changes of DP5 mRNA expression in neuronal PC12 cells induced to undergo apoptosis by removal of NGF. Total RNAs were purified from the PC12 cells at the specified times (0, 15, 24 h) after NGF deprivation. C, the expression of DP5 in various tissues of an 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rat. B, brain; Sp, spleen; Ty, thymus; Te, testis; H, heart; I, intestine; Sk, skeletal muscle. The signal of DP5 mRNA seems greatly intense in brain, but this filter was autoradiographed for 7 days to confirm that DP5 mRNA is not expressed in other tissues. Originally, the signal of DP5 is very faint. 15-μg aliquots of total RNA were loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence of events that occur following removal of NGF from differentiated PC12 cells is very similar to that in sympathetic neurons following removal of NGF (3Martin D. Schmidt R. DiStefano P. Lowry O. Carter J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and the commitment point in the neuronal PC12 cell model system is considered to be 12–15 h after NGF deprivation (25Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To show that induction of DP5 is not specific to SCG neurons, we examined expression of the DP5 gene during PCD of neuronal PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, PC12 cells cultured in medium containing NGF expressed DP5 mRNA only faintly, whereas those deprived of NGF showed elevation of DP5 mRNA expression. The level of expression of DP5 mRNA was higher 15 h after removal of NGF, and this time was consistent with the commitment point for PCD in this model. We next examined tissue distribution of DP5 mRNA. Among the various adult rat tissues examined, only the brain showed a hybridizing band for the DP5 mRNA (Fig. 2 C). No signals were detected in other tissues examined even if the membrane was exposed to film for 7 days. Therefore, it appears that expression of the DP5 gene could be highly specific to the nervous system. We then isolated and determined the full nucleotide sequence of DP5 cDNA. The cDNA consists of 5253 nucleotides, and many stop codons were found in this nucleotide sequence. There were three possible open reading frames (ORF) in all three frames. In all cases, these ORFs encoded small polypeptides which consisted of about 100 amino acids. To determine the ORF of DP5, we isolated a cDNA of mouse DP5 homolog from newborn mouse brain and characterized it. Comparison of a 279-bp segment of an ORF at its 5′ end, which has the 5′-most ATG among the cDNA clones isolated, from rat and mouse revealed only one nucleotide change, and this change did not alter the predicted amino acid sequence of the ORF (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the other regions of mouse DP5 cDNA including another two possible ORFs showed 84% homology with those of rat cDNA. These observations suggest that there is selective pressure to conserve this 279-bp segment as a protein coding region, and DP5 encodes a polypeptide of 92 amino acids. Data base analysis showed that DP5 had no homology with any other known protein and contained no motif that would indicate its putative biochemical functions. Hydrophobicity analysis indicated that DP5 does not contain a signal sequence or any transmembrane regions. To demonstrate that the DP5 polypeptide is indeed expressed during neuronal death, a rabbit polyclonal anti-GST-DP5 fusion protein antibody was raised against proteins produced in a baculovirus expression system, and immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting was carried out. An immunoreactive band of approximately 10 kDa was detected in Sf21 insect cell homogenates expressing a 1.5-kbp cDNA fragment containing the ORF (clone DP-7W, Fig. 4). This immunoreactive band was also observed in SCG neurons 24 h after NGF deprivation, but not in those of control neurons. To examine the temporal changes in levels of DP5 mRNA during PCD, we reverse-transcribed mRNAs isolated from SCG cultures before and at varying times after NGF withdrawal and analyzed proportions of DP5 cDNAs using RT-PCR (Fig. 5 A). We also analyzed the expression patterns of control cellular marker genes including the neuronal gene neurofilament-M (NF) and the glial and Schwann cell marker S-100β. Expression of S-100β did not significantly change over the 25-h period of NGF withdrawal. PCR products of NF diminished over the course of PCD. Thus, mRNA levels for neuronal and non-neuronal genes decreased or did not change during PCD. The DP5 expression pattern during PCD was in contrast with the patterns of expression of the control markers described above. A relatively low level of DP5 expression was detected before NGF withdrawal. This signal increased at 5 h and was maximal at 15 h after removal of NGF with a subsequent reduction after this time point. The temporal changes in DP5 mRNA expression during PCD matched the expression pattern predicted for putative cell death genes or death-related genes, i.e. the peak of DP5 expression occurred concurrently with the commitment point for PCD as determined by CHX rescue after NGF withdrawal. We next examined the changes in DP5 mRNA expression on treatment of SCG neurons with various agents which prevent neuronal PCD,i.e. CHX, KCl (26Koike T. Martin D.P. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6421-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 27Koike T. Tanaka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3892-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the cyclic AMP analogue CPTcAMP (24Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 28Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To test the abilities of various agents to promote survival, SCG neurons deprived of NGF were cultured for 24 h with or without various agents, and the number of survived neurons were counted. Without additives, approximately 90% of the cells died, while good survival was promoted in the presence of CHX, KCl, or CPTcAMP (Fig.5 B). After neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF for 15 h in the presence or absence of various agents, total RNA was extracted and analyzed for changes in DP5 gene expression by RT-PCR. Levels of products amplified by DP5-specific primers were markedly decreased in all cases treated with cell death blockers (Fig.5 C). Quantification of the DP5 signals showed that the expression levels of DP5 in SCG neurons treated with various agents were approximately 5–30% of those in control neurons (Fig.5 D). The degrees of cell death prevention corresponded well with the reduction of DP5 gene expression by treatment with these agents. Having demonstrated that expression of DP5 increases after NGF withdrawal and that DP5 is closely associated with neuronal PCD, it was of interest to determine whether overexpression of DP5 alone is sufficient to cause the death of SCG neurons. We microinjected neurons with a full-length DP5 polypeptide expression vector (pEFDP5) and with antisense DP5 vector (pEFantiDP) or a β-galactosidase expression vector (pEFlacZ) as a negative control. The neurons were maintained in the presence of NGF, and the numbers of living cells were counted at various time points after injection. Most cells injected with pEFlacZ and pEFantiDP at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml survived at 24 h after injection. In contrast, about 70% of neurons injected with pEFDP5 at an equivalent concentration died by this time point (Fig. 6). The cell death caused by introduction of DP5 gene begun at 3 h after injection and surviving cell number was rapidly decreased at 6 h. The dying cells overexpressing DP5 showed morphological characteristics of apoptosis such as shrinkage of the cell body, pyknotic nuclei, and blebbing of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7,A–D). TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) staining revealed positive reactivity in the nuclei of shrinking cells injected with pEFDP5 (Fig. 7 F), but those of cells injected with pEFlacZ and pEFantiDP were negative for TUNEL staining (data not shown). These results suggested that cell death induced by DP5 involved DNA fragmentaion.Figure 7Morphological changes in neurons injected with DP5 expression vector. The injected neurons were cultured for 6 h in the presence of NGF. Phase-contrast photomicrographs of neurons injected with pEFantiDP (A) and pEFDP5 (B).

Bar = 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that this type of cell death is caused by apoptosis but not by nonspecific stress or toxicity of overproduction of DP5 polypeptide, we coinjected expression plasmids of bcl-2 gene together with the DP5 gene into the SCG neurons. Most of the injected neurons did not die 24 h after microinjection of bcl-2 and DP5 expression vectors (Fig. 8). This suggested that Bcl-2 can prevent cell death induced by DP5 and that this type of cell death is not simply caused by toxicity of overproduction of DP5 polypeptide. This notion was also supported by the facts that neither β-actin nor GST expression vectors killed SCG neurons (data not shown). PCD in a variety of systems requires de novo gene and protein expression, evidenced by the ability of transcriptional or translational inhibitors to block PCD (3Martin D. Schmidt R. DiStefano P. Lowry O. Carter J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 29Tata J.R. Dev. Biol. 1966; 13: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 30Pratt R.M. Greene R.M. Dev. Biol. 1976; 54: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Stanisic T. Sadlowsky R. Lee C.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This indicates that cell death genes and proteins which control the cell death program are induced during PCD. We isolated one clone, DP5, strongly induced during PCD of cultured SCG neurons. The putative ORF of DP5 gene was very small and was located at the 5′ end of the 5.3-kbp DP5 cDNA. Although this was not a usual position of ORF, we consider it valid for the following two reasons. 1) The mouse DP5 homolog shows a very high degree of conservation of the nucleotide sequence within this ORF. 2) In Western blotting analysis, the polyclonal DP5 antibody reacted with a 10-kDa band in SCG neurons undergoing PCD, which is consistent with the size of the protein predicted from ORF. This gene and gene product showed no homology with any other known genes or proteins and contained no motif that may indicate a biochemical function. DP5, therefore, may represent the prototype of a novel type of cell death gene. Another unique feature of DP5 gene is that it is expressed only in the brain in adult rats, and no expression was detected in other tissues. If the DP5 gene is also closely associated with the death program in vivo as shown in the in vitro study, cell death cascades in the nervous system, which accompany induction of DP5, may differ from those of other tissues. In support for this hypothesis, the expression of DP5 was not detected during cell death of thymocytes induced by glucocorticoid (data not shown). Whether DP5 overexpression can induce cell death in other types of cells is an interesting point and is now under investigation in our laboratories. The induction of DP5 mRNA during neuronal PCD was demonstrated using RT-PCR and Northern blotting. During PCD, DP5 mRNA began to accumulate 5 h after NGF withdrawal and reached maximal levels at 15 h, with a subsequent gradual decrease by 25 h. The peak of DP5 expression correlated well with the commitment point for cell death (15–17 h) as determined by CHX rescue after NGF deprivation (23Tanaka S. Koike T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). DP5 was not induced immediately early, but many hours after the initial stimulus of NGF removal, suggesting that DP5 was induced in response to intracellular events. Indeed, the induction of DP5 expression was blocked by CHX. This finding suggests that DP5 could be a part of a cellular genetic program that required ongoing protein synthesis. Cell death was prevented by treatment with high K+, which depolarized neurons and raised intracellular Ca2+ levels (26Koike T. Martin D.P. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6421-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 27Koike T. Tanaka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3892-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or by treatment with cAMP analogue CPTcAMP (23Tanaka S. Koike T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In these cases, the expression of DP5 was markedly suppressed. The degrees of suppression of DP5 expression corresponded with those of cell death blockade by these agents. The mechanisms by which these agents prevent the death program remain unclear. However, the results suggest that DP5 expression is closely associated with proceedings of neuronal death, and DP5 is likely to be a constituent of the death program in SCG neurons. Neurons microinjected with pEFDP5 to overexpress DP5 gene products underwent apoptosis even in the presence of NGF. Cells into which DP5 was introduced showed typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis such as shrinkage of the cell body, blebbing of the plasma membrane, and DNA fragmentation as evidenced by TUNEL staining. Deckwerth and Johnson (24Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) reported morphological changes of sympathetic neurons after removal of NGF. In this paper, 19 h after NGF withdrawal, atrophy was first detectable in half of the neuronal somas, and the plasma membrane lost its smooth appearance and its cellular outline became increasingly irregular. These observations corresponded with morphological changes of neurons injected with DP5 expression vectors, suggesting that the cells into which the DP5 constructs were introduced could be activated death pathway and die in an apoptotic fashion. In contrast, cells injected with antisense DP5,lacZ, β-actin, or GST expression vectors showed no morphological changes and did not die. In addition, most of the neurons co-injected with bcl-2 and DP5 did not die. Taking these results into account, it is unlikely that the cell death was caused by nonspecific toxicity of DP5 overproduction. Injecting DP5 kills neurons rapidly even in the presence of NGF. This suggests that DP5 may be having an effect late in the death processes unlike most other “killer genes” such as c-jun and myc. As described above, the induction of DP5 expression was inhibited by CHX or some other cell death blocker, i.e. it is required for ongoing protein synthesis and may be needed for execution of cell death. However, we cannot unveil the molecular cascades of neuronal apoptosis induced by DP5 in the present sudy. There are several precedents which can induce apoptosis of neuronal cells, such as Bak (34Farrow S.N. White J.H.M. Martinou I. Raven T. Pun K. Grinham C.J. Martinou J. Brown R. Nature. 1995; 374: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and c-Jun (17Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Whether DP5 interacts or associates with these proteins must be analyzed further to understand the mechanisms of DP5-induced cell death. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests that DP5 is likely to be one of the constituents of the genetic program of neuronal PCD. Whether DP5 is required for this phenomenon or not is open for further analysis. Experiments to test this question are currently in progress, using gene knockout technologies. Furthermore, identification of the protein(s) which interact(s) with the DP5 polypeptide and transcription factors which regulate DP5 gene expression are necessary to elucidate the putative DP5-related cell death cascade. When this manuscript was accepted for publication, we noticed a paper that described cloning of a gene,harakiri (Hrk), which was significantly homologous with DP5 (35Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Judging from the differences of sizes of the transcripts and expression patterns, DP5 seems not to be a rat homologue of Hrk, but to constitute a gene family withHrk. Both proteins can induce apoptosis when overexpressed in the cultured cells. We do not know whether DP5 can specifically interact with BCL-2 and BCL-Xl as Hrk does. This aspect is now under investigation. We thank Prof. Y. Tsujimoto (Division of Molecular Genetics, Osaka University Medical School) for helpful discussions. We are grateful to Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W1968784427,"Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) induces the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide (Cer) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, and Cer has been proposed to play a role in the down-regulation of cytochrome P450 2C11 (CYP2C11) and induction of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) by this cytokine (Chen, J., Nikolova-Karakashian, M., Merrill, A. H. & Morgan, E. T. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25233–25238). Nonetheless, some of the features of the down-regulation of CYP2C11 do not fit a simple model of Cer as a second messenger as follows:N-acetylsphinganine (C2-DHCer) is as potent asN-acetylsphingosine (C2-Cer) in suppression of CYP2C11; the IL-1β concentration dependence for SM turnover is different from that for the increase in Cer; and the increase in Cer mass is not equivalent to the amount of SM hydrolyzed nor the time course of SM hydrolysis. In this article, we report that these discrepancies are due to activation of ceramidase by the low concentrations of IL-1β (∼2.5 ng/ml) that maximally down-regulate CYP2C11 expression, whereas higher IL-1β concentrations (that induce AGP) do not activate ceramidase and allow Cer accumulation. This bimodal concentration dependence is demonstrated both by in vitro ceramidase assays and in intact hepatocytes using a fluorescence Cer analog, 6-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-Cer (NBD-Cer), and following release of the NBD-fatty acid. IL-1β increases both acid and neutral ceramidase activities, which appear to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation because pretreatment of hepatocytes with sodium vanadate increases (and 25 μmgenistein reduces) the basal and IL-1β-stimulated ceramidase activities. Since these findings suggested that sphingosine (and, possibly, subsequent metabolites) is the primary mediator of the down-regulation of CYP2C11 by IL-1β, the effects of exogenous sphingosine and C2-Cer on expression of this gene were compared. Sphingosine was more potent than C2-Cer in down-regulation of CYP2C11 when added alone or with fumonisin B1 to block acylation of the exogenous sphingosine. Furthermore, the suppression of CYP2C11 by C2-Cer (and C2-DHCer) is probably mediated by free sphingoid bases, rather than the short chain Cer directly, because both are hydrolyzed by hepatocytes and increase cellular levels of sphingosine and sphinganine. From these observations we conclude that sphingosine, possibly via sphingosine 1-phosphate, is a mediator of the regulation of CYP2C11 by IL-1β in rat hepatocytes and that ceramidase activation provides a “switch” that determines which sphingolipids are elevated by this cytokine to produce multiple intracellular responses. Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) induces the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide (Cer) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, and Cer has been proposed to play a role in the down-regulation of cytochrome P450 2C11 (CYP2C11) and induction of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) by this cytokine (Chen, J., Nikolova-Karakashian, M., Merrill, A. H. & Morgan, E. T. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25233–25238). Nonetheless, some of the features of the down-regulation of CYP2C11 do not fit a simple model of Cer as a second messenger as follows:N-acetylsphinganine (C2-DHCer) is as potent asN-acetylsphingosine (C2-Cer) in suppression of CYP2C11; the IL-1β concentration dependence for SM turnover is different from that for the increase in Cer; and the increase in Cer mass is not equivalent to the amount of SM hydrolyzed nor the time course of SM hydrolysis. In this article, we report that these discrepancies are due to activation of ceramidase by the low concentrations of IL-1β (∼2.5 ng/ml) that maximally down-regulate CYP2C11 expression, whereas higher IL-1β concentrations (that induce AGP) do not activate ceramidase and allow Cer accumulation. This bimodal concentration dependence is demonstrated both by in vitro ceramidase assays and in intact hepatocytes using a fluorescence Cer analog, 6-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-Cer (NBD-Cer), and following release of the NBD-fatty acid. IL-1β increases both acid and neutral ceramidase activities, which appear to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation because pretreatment of hepatocytes with sodium vanadate increases (and 25 μmgenistein reduces) the basal and IL-1β-stimulated ceramidase activities. Since these findings suggested that sphingosine (and, possibly, subsequent metabolites) is the primary mediator of the down-regulation of CYP2C11 by IL-1β, the effects of exogenous sphingosine and C2-Cer on expression of this gene were compared. Sphingosine was more potent than C2-Cer in down-regulation of CYP2C11 when added alone or with fumonisin B1 to block acylation of the exogenous sphingosine. Furthermore, the suppression of CYP2C11 by C2-Cer (and C2-DHCer) is probably mediated by free sphingoid bases, rather than the short chain Cer directly, because both are hydrolyzed by hepatocytes and increase cellular levels of sphingosine and sphinganine. From these observations we conclude that sphingosine, possibly via sphingosine 1-phosphate, is a mediator of the regulation of CYP2C11 by IL-1β in rat hepatocytes and that ceramidase activation provides a “switch” that determines which sphingolipids are elevated by this cytokine to produce multiple intracellular responses. The lipid backbones (e.g. ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate) of sphingolipids are highly bioactive compounds that have the potential to serve as second messengers in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, diverse cell behaviors, and cell death (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Spiegel S.

Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that cells activate sphingomyelinase in response to cytokines, whereas growth factors also activate ceramidase and sphingosine kinase and thereby choose between the formation of Cer versussphingosine 1-phosphate (and other bioactive metabolites) (11Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, current knowledge is still quite fragmentary about the full spectrum of sphingolipid metabolites that are produced in response to various stimuli and how the activities of the key regulatory enzymes are controlled. We have investigated the involvement of sphingolipid metabolites in the inflammatory response of hepatocytes to IL-1β (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and found that this cytokine stimulated sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis and increased cellular levels of Cer. Furthermore, addition of a short chain Cer (N-acetylsphingosine, C2-Cer) induced the expression of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and down-regulated cytochrome P450 2C11 (CYP2C11), which mimicked the effects of IL-1β on these genes. By these criteria, SM metabolites (possibly Cer) appear to mediate the response of hepatocytes to IL-1β, as has been seen in other systems (5Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mathias S. Younes A. Kan C.C. Orlow I. Joseph C. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1993; 259: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, not all of the observations with rat hepatocytes were consistent with Cer acting as the mediator of CYP2C11 down-regulation (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The concentrations of IL-1β that suppressed CYP2C11 (∼2.5 ng/ml, ED50 = 1 ng/ml) did not cause an increase in Cer mass (whereas Cer was elevated by the higher levels of IL-1β that induced AGP). Furthermore, both C2-Cer andN-acetylsphinganine (C2-DHCer) down-regulated CYP2C11 (which is not typically seen in systems where Cer is a mediator) (14Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and only C2-Cer induced AGP. These discrepancies, plus the detection of some increase in free sphingosine in IL-1β-treated hepatocytes (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggested that this cytokine may be activating ceramidase as well as sphingomyelinase. This article describes the dose-dependent activation of ceramidase in rat hepatocytes, apparently via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and demonstrates that sphingosine is more potent than Cer in down-regulation of CYP2C11. These findings establish that downstream metabolites of Cer,e.g. sphingosine or sphingosine 1-phosphate, are responsible for the down-regulation of CYP2C11 by IL-1β in hepatocytes. Male Harlan Sprague Dawley and Fisher 344 rats (150–200 g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. Waymouth's medium, MB 752/1, and murine recombinant IL-1β were from Life Technologies, Inc. The 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-Cer (NBD-Cer), NBD-SM, and NBD-hexanoic acid were from Molecular Probes.d-erythro-Sphinganine anddl-threo-sphinganine were synthesized as described previously (16Nimkar S. Menaldino D. Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3037-3040Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and used to prepare the C2-DHCer by acetylation with acetic anhydride.d-erythro-Sphingosine and C2-ceramide were from Matreya, Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA. Matrigel was prepared as described in Ref. 17Schuetz E.G. Li D. Omiecinski C.J. Muller-Eberhard U. Kleinman H.K. Elswick B. Guzelian P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar. All the other reagents were from Sigma. The tissue culture dishes were treated with Matrigel (6.3 mg/ml) as described previously (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from ether-anesthetized rats by in situ collagenase perfusion (18Liddle C. Mode A. Legraverend C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the cells (3.5 × 106 per plate; viability >80%) were plated in 3 ml of Waymouth's medium containing insulin (0.15 μm) as the only hormone. Cultures were maintained for 5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere with replacement of the medium every 48 h, commencing 3 h after plating. This protocol is used because expression of CYP2C11 mRNA is almost completely lost when hepatocytes are initially placed in culture but is restored after 5 days in culture on Matrigel (18Liddle C. Mode A. Legraverend C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were treated on day 5 with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β, which was first prepared as a concentrated stock solution in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and diluted with culture medium immediately before use. The control cells were treated with the same concentrations of BSA and other vehicles (i.e. solvents used for delivery of the sphingolipids). Unless otherwise stated, the cells were incubated with IL-1β for 45 min prior to analysis of the enzymatic activities or metabolites. To test the effects of exogenously added ceramides on cellular free long chain bases, the hepatocytes were treated with 30 μm C2-Cer or C2 DHCer for 1 and 4 h. They were delivered to the cells from stock solutions in ethanol (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of different sphingolipids on CYP2C11, the cells were treated with up to 30 μm sphingosine, C2-Cer, and/or 25 μm fumonisin B1 for 24 h. In these experiments C2-ceramide was added from 60 mm stock in Me2SO. Sphingosine was delivered to the cells as BSA complex in a molar ratio of 1:1. This complex was formed by injecting 10 μl of 100 mm sphingosine (stock solution in ethanol) into 1 ml of 1 mm BSA in PBS, vigorously vortexing, and further incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. For the experiments using various inhibitors, the cells were preincubated with 1 mmsodium vanadate or 25 μm genistein for 1 h, or with 50 μmdl-threo- sphinganine (as a BSA complex) for 10 min, prior to addition of IL-1β. In all experiments the control groups were treated with the respective vehicles, and in the cases of dose response, the concentration of the vehicles was kept one and the same between the groups. Hepatocytes were harvested at appropriate times with 1 ml of PBS, and aliquots were taken for protein measurement. In the case of sodium vanadate or genistein pretreatment, the harvest buffer was supplemented with the respective inhibitor, and these inhibitors were kept throughout the procedure. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar), modified as described previously (20Williams R. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Silica gel 60 plates (20 × 20 cm) using chloroform:methanol:triethylamine:2-propyl alcohol:0.25% potassium chloride (30:9:25:18:6, by volume) as the developing solvent. The regions migrating with standard Cer were scraped from the plate, and the SM was visualized with I2 or 50% H2SO4 and quantitated by phosphate assay (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To quantitate the mass of Cer, 5 nmol ofN-acetyl-C20-sphinganine was added to the unknown Cer sample on the chromatoplate, and then the lipids were eluted from the silica with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, by volume) followed by 1 ml of methanol. The combined eluates were driedin vacuo, and the Cer mass was quantitated by HPLC of the long chain bases released after an acid hydrolysis in 0.5 mHCl in methanol at 65 °C for 15 h. Free long chain bases were analyzed as described in Ref. 21Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R. Jamison W. Nimkar S. Liotta D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 337-381Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar. The cells were scraped from two dishes (each of which contained approximately 1.0 mg of cellular protein), pooled, and recovered by centrifugation at 300 ×g for 5 min. They were lysed in 1.0 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (supplemented where appropriate with 1 mm sodium vanadate or 25 μm genistein), for 10 min on ice. The lysates were homogenized with three passes through a 25-gauge needle, and 10-μl aliquots were taken for protein assay. NBD-Cer or NBD-SM was added to the lysates to give a concentration of 20 μm (from 10 mm stock solutions in ethanol), and they were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min to allow the substrate to equilibrate among the micelles. Aliquots of this mixture (containing approximately 0.1 mg of protein and a final concentration of NBD-substrate of approximately 3 μm) were added to 5 mm MgCl2 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (for the neutral sphingomyelinase), 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (for neutral ceramidase), 0.5 m acetate buffer, pH 4.5 (for acidic sphingomyelinase and ceramidase), or 10 mm Hepes, pH 9.5 (for alkaline ceramidase), for a final volume of 300 μl. All incubation buffers contained 0.2% Triton X-100 and were supplemented with sodium vanadate or genistein for the respective treatments. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of the mobile phase used in the subsequent HPLC analysis, and the products were analyzed by HPLC (as described below). Product formation was linear over this time of incubation and proportional to the amount of added protein for up to 0.3 mg/assay. On the 4th day in culture, the hepatocytes were changed to new medium containing 6 μm NBD-Cer (added to the medium by ethanol injection as described previously (22Babia T. Kok J.-W. Hulstaert C. deWeerd H. Hoekstra D. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). After 12 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were placed in new medium with or without IL-1β at the concentrations indicated in the text and figures. After 45 min, the cells were harvested in cold 0.5 ml of PBS, and 1.5 ml of methanol:water:phosphoric acid, 850:150:1.5 (by volume), was added to the cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation in a table top clinical centrifuge (at 3,000 rpm for 10 min), an aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC (as described below). For analysis of NBD-ceramide hydrolysis, the samples were injected onto a normal phase Silica column (Nova Pak, Bio-Rad) and eluted with hexane:chloroform:methanol:water:triethylamine (240:560:180:11:7, by volume) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Under these conditions, the NBD-fatty acid elutes at 1.7 min and NBD-ceramide at 3.2 min. For analysis of SM hydrolysis, a second mobile phase (hexane:chloroform:methanol:water:85% phosphoric acid (281:650:300:30:4, by volume) (23Martin O. Pagano R. Anal. Biochemistry. 1986; 159: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min was used. In this system, NBD-SM elutes at 7.8 min and NBD-Cer and NBD-Fatty acid appear as a single peak at 1.6 min. When analysis of all three NBD-lipids was needed they were analyzed using a reverse-phase column (Nova Pak, C18, Bio-Rad), eluted with methanol:water:phosphoric acid (850:150:1.5, by volume) as the mobile phase (at 2 ml/min). In this system, the elution times of the NBD-fatty acid, NBD-Cer, and NBD-SM are 1.5, 10.3, and 12.3 min, respectively. The resolution of NBD-Cer and NBD-SM diminished as the column aged using this system. The NBD fluorescence was analyzed with excitation at 455 nm and emission at 530 nm. The mass of the NBD compounds was calculated by comparison with the fluorescence of the NBD-lipids standards. Total hepatocyte RNA was prepared by the acid phenol extraction method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). The relative abundances of CYP2C11 mRNA in total RNA was measured by slot-blot hybridization assay as described previously (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), using a full-length cDNA for CYP2C11. Bound probe was assayed by autoradiography and densitometric scanning. All results were normalized to the content of poly(A+) RNA and measured by probing slot-blots with an oligo(dT)30 probe. The amount of total RNA were previously determined to be in the range giving a linear response. Our previous study (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IL-1β induced SM turnover in rat hepatocytes which (in combination with other data in that study) indicated that SM metabolite(s) are involved in the down-regulation of expression of CYP2C11 and induction of AGP by this cytokine. It was puzzling, however, that <1 ng/ml of IL-1β induced SM turnover, but Cer mass did not increase until addition of >1 ng/ml (cf. Figs. 2 and 3 in Ref. 12). This discrepancy in dose-response alerted us to examine other differences in dose response, and these observations (from Refs. 12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 25Chen J.Q. Strom A. Gustafsson J.A. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 940-947PubMed Google Scholar) are summarized in Fig. 1. CYP2C11 is suppressed by lower concentrations of IL-1β (∼2.5 ng/ml; ED50 = 1 ng/ml) than are required to induce AGP (which occurs in two phases, one at 0.5–2 ng/ml IL-1β and a second, larger increase at >5 ng/ml) (Fig. 1, left panels) (25Chen J.Q. Strom A. Gustafsson J.A. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 940-947PubMed Google Scholar); furthermore, maximal suppression of CYP2C11 is apparent with 10–30 μm C2-Cer, whereas induction of AGP does not exhibit saturation behavior at 30 μm (Fig. 1, right panels) (12Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol.

Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the experiment depicted in Fig. 2, there were no significant changes in sphingolipids in cells that were changed to new medium without IL-1β. Nonetheless, such was observed occasionally in other experiments; therefore, this should be routinely checked in experiments in which the culture medium is changed during the addition of an agonist. There was a significant reduction in SM mass (∼0.75 nmol) within 15 min, whereas Cer mass did not increase until 45 min, and there was a small (0.1 nmol), but statistically significant, decline in Cer at the 15-min time point. Even at the maximum increase in Cer mass (0.5 nmol), this accounted for less than half of the total turnover of SM (>1.25 nmol). Some of this difference could be accounted for by an elevation in the mass of sphingosine (by ∼0.25 nmol at 45 min). The goals of our next studies were to explain why Cer mass does not increase upon addition of the low concentrations of IL-1β that induce SM turnover and suppress CYP2C11 and to determine if this is relevant to the regulation of CYP2C11 by sphingolipids. One possibility is that SM is hydrolyzed to another metabolite, such as ceramide 1-phosphate or sphingosine phosphorylcholine; however, neither of these were detected on the thin layer chromatoplates (data not shown). Because there was an elevation in sphingosine (albeit only at a later time point), it appeared that Cer was undergoing hydrolysis; therefore, the effect of IL-1β on ceramidase activity was determined. Ceramidase activity was assayed at acidic, neutral, and basic pH (Fig. 3) because it has been suggested that there are multiple forms of this enzyme (27Spence M.W. Beed S. Cook H.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Slife C.W. Wang E. Hunter R. Wang S. Burgess C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10371-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, the specific activity was greatest at pH 5.0, followed by pH 9.0, and a low, but measurable activity was obtained at pH 7.2. Addition of 2.5 ng/ml IL-1β to the hepatocytes 45 min prior to assay of ceramidase in vitro resulted in a 10-fold increase in the neutral activity and 2-fold increases in the activities at acidic and alkaline pH. However, when 5 ng/ml IL-1β was added to the cells, the acidic and neutral activities were not elevated above the controls, and the activity at alkaline pH was increased only 1.4-fold. The magnitude of these changes varied from experiment to experiment; however, the trends shown in Fig. 3 were seen consistently. Because these results were somewhat surprising, andin vitro assays of lipid metabolizing enzymes can be complicated by many factors (delivery of substrates, etc.), ceramidase activation was examined using a method that can evaluate Cer turnoverin situ. In this assay, hepatocytes are incubated overnight with NBD-Cer, which results in formation of some NBD-SM and NBD-hexanoic acid, but a substantial amount of NBD-Cer remains in the cells, and its subsequent hydrolysis in response to IL-1β can be analyzed by HPLC with quantitation of the products by fluorescence (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). 3This finding that NBD-Cer is hydrolyzed to NBD-fatty acid is consistent with the broad substrate specificity reported for the purified acidic ceramidase (29Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This assay has an advantage over measurement of sphingosine that NBD-hexanoic acid is not reutilized, whereas sphingosine can be removed by further metabolism (30Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31McCormack M. Brecher P. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When varying concentrations of IL-1β were added to the hepatocytes after the overnight preincubation with NBD-Cer, there was a significant decline in the amount of NBD-Cer and an essentially stoichiometric increase in the amount of NBD-hexanoic acid (Fig. 4). The concentration dependence of the IL-1β-induced changes in NBD-Cer and NBD-fatty acid was similar to the results of the assays of ceramidase in vitro (i.e. displayed a maximum at 2.5 ng/ml IL-1β and thereafter declined until no turnover was apparent at 7.5 ng/ml). This is remarkably good quantitative agreement, considering the many factors that differ between the in vitro and in situ assays (e.g. physical state of the enzymes and substrates, etc.). To characterize the activation of ceramidase more thoroughly, the effects of incubating hepatocytes with sodium vanadate and genistein were determined because Coroneos et al. (11Coroneos E.

Herein, the interaction between Rac and p67 phox is explored using functional and physical methods. Mutually facilitated binding (EC50) of Rac1 and p67 phox within the NADPH oxidase complex was demonstrated using steady state kinetic methods measuring NADPH-dependent superoxide generation. Direct binding of Rac1 and Rac2 to p67 phox was shown using a fluorescent analog of GTP (methylanthraniloyl guanosine-5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate) bound to Rac as a reporter group. An increase in the methylanthraniloyl fluorescence was seen with added p67 phox but not p47 phox, and the emission maximum shifted from 445 to 440 nm. Rac1 and Rac2 bound to p67 phox with a 1:1 stoichiometry and with K d values of 120 and 60 nm, respectively. Mutational studies (Freeman, J., Kreck, M., Uhlinger, D. J., and Lambeth, J. D.

Proteins mutated in the effector region (Rac1(N26H), Rac1(I33N), and Rac1(D38N)) showed a marked increase in both the K d and the EC50, indicating that mutations in this region affect activity by inhibiting Rac binding to p67 phox. Insert region mutations (Rac1(K132E) and L134R), while showing markedly elevated EC50 values, bound with normal affinity to p67 phox. The structure of Rac1 determined by x-ray crystallography reveals that the effector region and the insert region are located in defined sectors on the surface of Rac1.

Three cytosolic components (p47 phox, p67 phox, and a small molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Rac), activate superoxide generation and can be considered to be regulatory subunits of the flavocytochrome. p47 phox, while not essential for activity, functions as a regulated adaptor protein that increases the binding of p67 phox to the oxidase 100-fold (12Freeman J.L.

Translocation of Rac requires neither p47 phox nor p67 phox and occurs with different kinetics than these other cytosolic components (34Heyworth P. Bohl B. Bokoch G. Curnutte J. J. Biol.

In their isoprenylated forms, both Rac1 and Rac2 can activate superoxide generation in a cell-free system (38Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol.

Kinetic characterization and binding studies are complicated by the presence of the isoprenyl group, which limits the solubility and requires the presence of a detergent. The proteins in their nonisoprenylated forms can be expressed in and purified from bacteria. However, in their nonisoprenylated forms, only Rac1 activates efficiently. This is because membrane association is essential for optimal function of Rac, and nonisoprenylated Rac1 can interacts with the membrane via its polybasic C terminus (41Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed versions of Rac1 have therefore been used for most of the studies described herein. We have previously characterized two regions on Rac1 that are important for its ability to activate the NADPH oxidase. These are the effector region (within the range of residues 26–45) and the insert region (residues 124–135). The effector region shows homology to a region on Ras that has been characterized as mediating the GTP-dependent binding to the Ras effector Raf-1, a member of the MAP kinase cascade (42Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 43Warne P.H. viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The effector region of Ras includes residues the conformation of which changes significantly depending on whether GTP or GDP is bound. The insert region on Rac has no counterpart in Ras. Mutation of residues in both the effector region and the insert region of Rac1 results in a marked decrease in the ability to support cell-free superoxide generation (44Freeman J.L.R. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45Xu X. Barry D. Settleman J. Schwartz M. Bokoch G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the interaction has been demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid analysis, but it is not clear whether Rac also interacts with other targets. In addition, no quantitative information on Rac binding to p67 phox is available (e.g. affinity, stoichiometry). Herein, steady state kinetic analysis was used to demonstrate the functional linkage between Rac and p67 phox. In addition, Rac binding to p67 phox was measured directly, making use of a fluorescent GTP analog that binds tightly to Rac as a reporter group. The Rac-associated analog undergoes an increase in fluorescence upon interaction of Rac with p67 phox, and this fluorescence change was used to quantify the Rac binding to p67 phox. This method, used in conjunction with mutational analysis, reveals that the effector region participates in binding to p67 phox, while the insert region does not. Mapping of residues the mutation of which lowers activity onto the structure of Rac1 (recently determined by x-ray crystallography; Ref. 50Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reveals that the effector region and the insert region are located in distinct sectors of the protein, consistent with a model in which these two regions bind to distinct targets within the NADPH oxidase complex.

Samples (mant-GppNHp, Rac 1, cytochromeb 558, and cytosolic factors) were incubated at 20 °C in 0.3 ml of 20 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.45, containing 3 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 μm MgCl2. Preloading of Racs with mant-GppNHp was carried out for 15–20 min, at which point the fluorescence change due to the guanine nucleotide binding was stable. Low MgCl2concentration was essential to facilitate complete guanine nucleotide exchange. Titrations were carried out by adding p67 phox and recording fluorescence readings until three successive stable readings, at least 45 s apart, were obtained. Fluorescence changes induced by p67 phox occurred rapidly (within 1–2 min) and did not change further with prolonged incubation. Spectral resolution was 5 nm for both the excitation and emission paths, respectively. Superoxide generation was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as described previously (54Burnham D.N. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Rac, preloaded with a 5-fold molar excess of GTPγS for 15 min at 25 °C in the absence of MgCl2 (52Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Yeung C.L. Katkin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14256-14260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min followed by the addition of 200 μm NADPH and 200 μm cytochromec. An extinction coefficient at 550 nm of 21 mm−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the quantity of cytochrome c reduced (57Lambeth J.D. Burnham D.N. Tyagi S.R. J. Biol.

The theoretical lines through the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2were calculated using a nonlinear least squares fit of the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation and were plotted using Sigma Plot. Kinetic constants are reported as V max and EC50 (effective concentration at 50% of V max). Fluorescence titrations were fit to a single site binding equation as described previously (58Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Sigma plot was used to generate a nonlinear least squares fit of the data, solving for K d and ΔF max, constraining the fit to the actual concentration of Rac(mant-GppNHp) used in the experiment. For the Rac(D38N) mutation, it was necessary to assume the ΔF max to be the same as that of the wild type, since binding was weak and it was not feasible to approach saturation.Figure 5Comparison of binding of Rac1, Rac2, and Rac1 point mutants to p67phox. Titrations were carried out as in Fig. 4. The concentration of Rac or Rac mutants in various experiments shown ranged from 0.25 to 0.6 μm, and the corresponding concentration of mant-GppNHp was 70% of the Rac concentration. The Rac form used is indicated in each panel. The lines shown are derived from theoretical fits of the data, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thearrowheads on the y axes indicate the maximal fluorescence change, which was obtained either by extrapolation according to Equation 1 (top panels and lower right panel) or in a parallel titration using Rac1 (remaining panels) in cases where an accurate ΔF maxcould not be obtained by extrapolation.

Although ODC is sharply but transiently increased by growth stimuli, it is constitutively activated during cell transformation induced by carcinogens, viruses, or oncogenes. Overexpression of ODC has been correlated with increased proliferative potential (4Sistonen L. Keski-Oja J. Ulmanen I. Hölttä E. Wikgren B.-J. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 518-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), tissue invasiveness (5Polvinen K. Sinervirta R. Alhonen L. Jänne J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, ODC appears to be the only growth-related gene activated by the transcription factors c-myc (9Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for the enzyme in growth control. However, as indicated below, findings obtained in cell culture may not be directly applicable to conditions prevailing in vivo. To define the role of polyamines in proliferative processes associated with the whole animal, we have generated a number of transgenic mouse and rat lines that overexpress ODC and/or other polyamine biosynthetic enzymes. Given the importance of polyamine biosynthetic activity to cell growth, the phenotypic changes were unexpectedly mild. In transgenic mice overexpressing ODC, the most marked effect was inhibition of meiotic DNA synthesis during spermatogenesis (13Hakovirta H. Keiski A. Toppari J. Halmekytö M. Alhonen L. Jänne J. Parvinen M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1430-1436PubMed Google Scholar) ultimately leading to male infertility (14Halmekytö M. Hyttinen J.-M. Sinervirta R. Utriainen M. Myöhänen S. Voipio H.-M. Wahlfors J. Syrjänen S. Syrjänen K. Alhonen L. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that life-long overexpression of ODC in mouse tissues did not seem to increase the incidence of spontaneous tumors (15Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kosma V.-M. Wahlfors J. Kauppinen R. Jänne J. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The absence of more profound phenotypic changes in these mice may be attributable to the relatively minor changes observed in higher polyamine pools. Despite severalfold increases in ODC activity, polyamine pool disturbances were mainly confined to putrescine accumulation, and the pools of those polyamines considered to be more significantly involved in cell growth, spermidine and spermine, were only minimally affected. We presume this is due to compensatory responses since in vitro systems indicate that polyamine pools are sensitively maintained by complex regulatory responses involving polyamine biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport (1Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar). The existence and effectiveness of these responses in minimizing polyamine pool effects in the ODC transgenics further indicate the cellular importance of polyamines. In this present study, we have undertaken an alternative approach to studying the whole animal consequences of polyamine pool perturbations, that of polyamine pool depletion. Because genetic inactivation of ODC is known from in vitro systems to be incompatible with cell growth (16Pilz R.B. Steglich C. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gene knock-out was considered untenable. Instead, we attempted lowering intracellular polyamine pools by overexpressing an enzyme regarded as rate-limiting in polyamine catabolism, spermidine/spermine N 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). By acetylating these higher polyamines, the enzyme facilitates their back-conversion to putrescine and promotes their excretion out of cells (17Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The net effect of these two processes is a reduction in the higher polyamine pools, an event presumably intended to prevent cellular toxicity due to polyamine excess (1Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar). Very little is known about the metabolic consequences resulting from constitutive overexpression of SSAT. Recombinant human SSAT has been efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli using an inducible expression vector (18Parry L. Lopez-Ballester J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In induced cells, all of the cellular spermidine was rapidly converted to the SSAT product,N 1-acetylspermidine, resulting in a reduction in cellular growth rate (18Parry L. Lopez-Ballester J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Attempts to constitutively overexpress SSAT in mammalian cells have been unsuccessful due to poor translation of message in the absence of elevated intracellular polyamines (19Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gene has been transiently expressed in COS cells where it led to an accumulation ofN 1-acetylspermidine and putrescine, a decrease in spermidine and spermine pools, and a compensatory increase in biosynthetic enzyme activities (20Vargiu C. Persson L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Possible effects on cell growth were not reported perhaps because of the transient nature of the expressed enzyme activity (20Vargiu C. Persson L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Some insight into the cellular consequences of SSAT overexpression has been provided by studies with polyamine analogs such asN 1,N 12-diethylspermine which potently induce SSAT and deplete intracellular pools (1Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar). In cell line comparisons, analog induction of SSAT has been correlated with inhibition of cell growth (21Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1089PubMed Google Scholar). These correlations are complicated, however, by additional analog effects which, at a minimum, include down-regulation of polyamine biosynthesis and transport (1Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar). It is these same effects which limit the usefulness of such analogs for studying the consequences of SSAT overexpression in vivo. We report here on the generation of a transgenic founder animal and an independent mouse line in which the catabolism and/or excretion of the polyamines have been activated through the overexpression of SSAT. Relative to transgenic mice that overexpress ODC systemically (14Halmekytö M. Hyttinen J.-M. Sinervirta R. Utriainen M. Myöhänen S. Voipio H.-M. Wahlfors J. Syrjänen S. Syrjänen K. Alhonen L. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these mice show much more profound changes in their tissue polyamine pools. In addition to a massive putrescine accumulation, spermidine and/or spermine pools were also decreased. Of the various organs and tissues examined, skin was most strikingly affected where significant changes in polyamine pools were associated with a permanent hair loss at the age of 3 to 4 weeks. In addition to providing insights into metabolic and physiologic consequences of SSAT overexpression, these findings indicate the usefulness of this genetic approach as a means to achieve whole animal disturbances in polyamine pools. The transgenic mice were generated using the standard pronuclear microinjection technique (23Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 1-322Google Scholar). Fertilized oocytes were obtained from superovulated BALBc × DBA/2 (CD2F1) females mated with CD2F1 males. The gene construct used was a 18-kbp genomic sequence isolated from 129 SVJ mouse genomic library in the lambda Fix® vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was screened with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probe amplified from reverse-transcribed mouse brain RNA. The probe covered nucleotides 137–744 of mouse (Mus domesticus) SSAT cDNA (24Fogel-Petrovic M. Kramer D.L. Ganis B. Casero Jr., R.A. Porter C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The transgene construct contained all the exons and introns of the SSAT gene together with 3 kbp of the 5′-flanking region and 11.5 kbp of the 3′-flanking region. As the transgene construct was an endogenous mouse gene, the method for its detection was based on the integration of multiple transgene copies in the form of concatamers (head-to-tail) so that a minimum of two integrated transgene copies were required for the detection. The design of the oligonucleotides was based on the head-to-tail recombination of the transgenes so that one primer recognized the tail region and one the head region of the SSAT gene. The following oligonucleotide primers were used in the PCR: 5′-GTTCTTCTCAGCAATAGGGC-3′ (from 3′ tail) and 5′-CAGGAATAG-GCAAACCCAAC-3′ (from 5′ head). DNA was isolated by the method of Blin and Stafford (25Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar) and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation (27Ross J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In Northern and Southern blot analyses, human SSAT cDNA probe (28Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Brown P.J. Haddox M.K. Porter C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14436-14444Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession number L10244) or that generated for the library screening (see above) were used. Dot blot analysis with serially diluted kidney DNA samples was used to determine the gene copy number. To study the expression of mouse hairless gene (29Cachon-Gonzales M.B. Fenner S. Coffin J.M. Moran C. Best S. Stoye J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a 599-nucleotide PCR product covering nucleotides 1142–1740 in the third exon of the gene (29Cachon-Gonzales M.B. Fenner S. Coffin J.M. Moran C. Best S. Stoye J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was amplified and used as a probe in Northern blot analyses. SSAT, ODC, and AdoMet decarboxylase activities were assayed as described earlier (30Bernacki R.J. Oberman E.J. Seweryniak K.E. Atwood A. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar). In initial studies (Table I), SSAT activity was expressed as pmol of N 1-acetylspermidine generated per min/mg of tissue and in later studies (Table II) as pmol of N 1-acetylspermidine/min/mg protein. Polyamines and the acetylated derivative of spermine were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography as described by Kramer et al. (31Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For statistical analyses, two-tailed t test was used. The tissue specimens for histology were fixed in 10% formalin in phosphate buffer, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin.

We generated a female founder animal (169F0) harboring a large number of copies of the SSAT gene. Phenotypically this animal was hairless from early age, extremely small, and infertile. The second founder animal (165F0) was a male that gives rise to two different kinds of offspring, animals with normal hair (line 165a) and animals that permanently lost their hair at the age of 3 to 4 weeks (line 165b). Southern blot analysis (HindIII digestion) of DNA extracted from kidneys of the transgenic animals and their syngenic littermates is depicted in Fig. 1. The endogenous mouse SSAT gene gave rise to at least three signals of different sizes. The main fragments common to all strains were about 7 and 4 kbp in size. The third HindIII fragment was larger and displayed a strain difference between BALB/c and DBA/2 (Fig. 1). The transgene-derived fragment was about 9 kbp in size (the size difference in comparison with the endogenous gene is based on the head-to-tail recombination of the transgene copies) and gave a signal in tissues of line 165a equivalent to a copy number of 2 to 5. By contrast, the members of line 165b harbored at least 20 copies of the transgene and the founder animal 169F0 even more (Fig. 1). A comparison of the digestion pattern of lines 165a and 165b indicated that the founder animal 165F0 apparently had two different sites of transgene integration as follows: one locus with only a few copies (inherited by the offspring of the line 165a), and the other with a large number of gene copies (inherited by the offspring of line 165b). The mRNA levels in the liver and brain of the above transgenic animals is shown in Fig.2. As indicated, the expression of SSAT in line 165a was only modestly increased relative to syngenic animals, whereas expression in line 165b and especially the founder animal 169F0 showed strikingly elevated SSAT mRNA levels. Brain and liver of the founder animal 169F0 and two members of the line 165a and of 165b were also analyzed for SSAT activity and polyamine pools. As shown in Table I, the SSAT activity was enhanced ∼8- and ∼30-fold in liver and brain, respectively, of the founder animal 169F0, whereas no changes were seen in the members of line 165a, the offspring that carried the fewest transgenes. In the liver, but not in brain, of line 165b SSAT activity was distinctly enhanced. Consistent with these SSAT activities, the polyamine pools in members of line 165a were practically unchanged, and those of the founder animal 169F0 were drastically altered. Interestingly, the latter changes were clearly tissue-specific. The brain of the 169F0 animal displayed a moderate accumulation of putrescine, a massive increase in acetylspermidine, and decrease in spermidine but not spermine. By contrast, the liver showed a massive accumulation of putrescine, a slight increase in spermidine, and a large decrease in spermine (Table I). The changes in the liver of the line 165b resembled those in the founder animal. We next undertook a detailed analysis of the members of the line 165b, the offspring that carried >20 copies of the transgene. Fig. 3 shows the SSAT mRNA levels in selected tissues of the transgenic line 165b and their nontransgenic littermates. In each of the tissues of transgenic animals, the mRNA levels of SSAT were distinctly elevated. It is obvious that the SSAT gene gives rise to two different messages. On the basis of findings in human cell lines (32Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the larger one probably represents preprocessed primary (heteronuclear) transcript. Table II shows the activities of SSAT, ODC, and AdoMet decarboxylase as well as the intracellular polyamine pools. Even though the SSAT activity was elevated in all tissues studied, the enhancement of the enzyme activity over that of the nontransgenic tissues was less than expected on the basis of mRNA levels (Fig.3). This may be attributable to feedback control of SSAT activity by the polyamine pools via posttranscriptional mechanisms (28Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Brown P.J. Haddox M.K. Porter C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14436-14444Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This view is also supported by the profound distortion of the polyamine pools indicative of a marked activation of the back-conversion pathway in the transgenic animals. In all of the tissues studied, there was a significant putrescine accumulation that varied according to tissue, from ∼2-fold in the testes to >25-fold in the spleen. The metabolic intermediate of the polyamine back-conversion pathway,N 1-acetylspermidine, was not found in the tissues of syngenic littermates but accumulated to significant levels in all transgenic tissues (Table II). NeitherN 1-acetylspermine norN 1-acetylputrescine was observed. With the exception of uterus, ovary, and testes, most of the transgenic tissues showed reduced spermidine and/or spermine pools. Markedly elevated ODC and AdoMet decarboxylase activities in most of the transgenic tissues probably reflect enzyme up-regulation by lowered spermidine and/or spermine pools. This interpretation was complicated, however, by the fact that the enzymes were also increased in ovary, uterus, and testes where polyamine pools were not decreased. Although the activity of ODC was substantially elevated in many tissues of the transgenic animals, it is unlikely that this rise contributed to the putrescine overaccumulation to any appreciable degree, a view that is supported by a close and highly significant correlation between putrescine accumulation and SSAT activity but not between putrescine and ODC activity (analysis not shown). Of the 18 tissues subjected to a macroscopic and microscopic pathology evaluation, only the skin and organs of the female reproductive tract were found to be affected in the transgenic animals. As mentioned earlier, the founder animal 169F0 was hairless from an early age, whereas members of the 165b line (having the larger number of SSAT gene copies of the two offspring lines) acquired normal first hair but lost it at the age of 3 to 4 weeks and remained hairless thereafter. Upon aging, the hairless skin of the transgenic animals appeared excessive and became extremely wrinkled as shown in Fig. 4. As indicated in Fig.5, normal hair follicles (Fig. 5 A) were replaced in the transgenic animals (Fig. 5 B) by large cysts filled with keratin-like material. No hair shafts were visible. An occasional thickening of the epidermis was also seen in the skin of the transgenic animals, and subcutaneous fat cells were consistently much less apparent (Fig. 5 A, lower right corner). As mentioned earlier, the female members of the transgenic line 165b were infertile. On macroscopic examination, their uteri appeared hypoplastic. Histologically, the muscular layer of the uterus was thinner, and the stromal and glandular development of the mucosa was much reduced relative to nontransgenic littermates (results not shown). Microscopic examination of the ovaries revealed that in transgenic animals, the primary and small secondary follicles were present but, unlike in the nontransgenics, larger developing follicles and corpus luteum formation were absent (results not shown).Figure 5Histology of normal (A) and transgenic (B) skin (magnification 100 ×). Note the replacement of hair follicles with large keratin containing cysts in the dermis of the transgenic mice (B). In addition, there is an absence of subcutaneous fat in the transgenic skin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One goal of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of genetically modulating tissue polyamine pools by overexpressing a polyamine catabolic enzyme. Our previous experiments with transgenic animals overexpressing genes of the biosynthetic enzymes of the polyamines (9Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 10Wagner A.J. Meyers C. Laimins L.A. Hay N. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 879-883PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that spermidine and spermine pools are remarkably resistant to change. Despite the availability of large quantities of the precursor putrescine in the ODC transgenic mice, the diamine was not converted to these higher polyamines (34Halmekytö M. Alakuijala L. Alhonen L. Jänne J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown here, overexpression of SSAT produces much more profound changes in the polyamine pools. Although massive accumulation of putrescine was also a very prominent feature, significant lowering of spermidine and spermine pools also took place. While in ODC transgenics, putrescine accumulation was obviously due to increased decarboxylation of ornithine, the accumulation of putrescine in the SSAT transgenics derives largely from a metabolic disassembly of the higher polyamines. The unusual appearance in transgenic tissues of significant quantities of N 1-acetylspermidine, a metabolic intermediate in the back-conversion pathway, is entirely consistent with this interpretation. The present findings illustrate for the first time the metabolic consequences of sustained overexpression of SSAT activity in a mammalian system. In the context of the intact mouse, the present results indicate that the effects of SSAT expression were clearly tissue-dependent. Despite identical gene copy numbers and similar transcript levels (Figs. 1 and 3), the levels of expressed SSAT activity frequently differed among tissues and tended to follow those of the basal levels for a tissue. This is consistent with our previous findings indicating that a large proportion of SSAT expression is regulated via polyamine-mediated mechanisms affecting translation of the enzyme protein (33Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the SSAT enzyme activity profiles observed in the transgenic animals represent an established equilibrium of life-long homeostatic adjustments between that enzyme, polyamine pools, biosynthetic enzymes, and polyamine uptake. Despite compensatory responses, tissue levels of polyamine pools were significantly but differentially affected by SSAT overexpression. While all tissues showed increased levels of putrescine, not all displayed decreased levels of spermidine and spermine. Interestingly, those tissues that most effectively resisted changes in these higher polyamines tended to be those associated with reproduction (i.e. testes, ovary, and uterus). The biological significance of these interesting trends is not immediately apparent. The possibility exists that at an earlier time in development the polyamine pools were much more affected. The brain emerged as the only tissue in which spermidine was lowered but spermine was not, whereas liver was the only tissue in which spermine was lowered but spermine was not, perhaps because this organ is especially active in AdoMet metabolism. In almost all tissues ODC and or AdoMet decarboxylase were up-regulated to a level which, in most cases, again seemed to be determined by the basal enzyme activity of a particular tissue. It is presumed that this increase in enzyme is a compensatory response to SSAT lowering of spermidine and spermine pools (1Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar). In tissues where polyamine pools are not lowered but enzymes were up-regulated, such as in the ovary and uterus, it is difficult to assign such cause and effect relationships since pools may have been low at an earlier time but now appear normal due to the regulatory increases in the biosynthetic enzymes. Obviously, the metabolic basis for the observed tissue polyamine profiles is too complex to allow a full interpretation based on the current data. The various regulatory responses to SSAT overexpression could probably be better understood following short term induced expression of the enzyme as opposed to examining the final results of long term homeostatic adjustments. Regarding the phenotypic changes seen in the skin, the present animals resemble the hairless mutation of the mouse, an alteration caused by a proviral insertion (35Stoye J.P. Fenner S. Greenoak G.E. Moran C. Coffin J.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and disruption of the so-called hairless gene (29Cachon-Gonzales M.B. Fenner S. Coffin J.M. Moran C. Best S. Stoye J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The latter encodes a putative transcription factor expressed only in the skin and brain (29Cachon-Gonzales M.B. Fenner S. Coffin J.M. Moran C. Best S. Stoye J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This hairless mutation is recessive (35Stoye J.P. Fenner S. Greenoak G.E. Moran C. Coffin J.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and can be induced, in addition to proviral insertion, by an insertional inactivation by a transgene (36Jones J.M. Elder J.T. Simin K. Keller S.A. Meisler M.H. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We believe that that the hairless phenotype of our transgenic mice was not caused by insertional inactivation of the gene since the present phenotype is dominant instead of recessive and since we generated a founder animal and an independent transgenic line with exactly the same phenotype. In addition, we examined the expression of the hairless gene in our transgenic animals using a PCR-generated probe covering most of the third exon of the gene. By this analysis, hairless gene mRNA was present at a level only slightly below that of the nontransgenic mice (data not shown). There is striking phenotypic similarity between our present transgenic mice and those overexpressing a stabilized ODC enzyme under skin-specific (keratin) promoter (37Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Peralta Soler A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar, 38Peralta-Soler A. Gilliard G. Megosh L.C. O'Brien T.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1108-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The timing of the hair loss, the wrinkling of the skin, and the histopathological changes were almost identical for the two transgenics. In this regard, it is somewhat surprising that overexpression of ODC, a gene expected to increase tissue polyamine levels, would give rise to a phenotype that is apparently identical to that seen with overexpression of SSAT, a gene expected to lower tissue polyamine pools. However, one prominent feature shared by both transgenics is the massive overaccumulation of putrescine in the skin. It seems likely, therefore, that this imbalance in skin putrescine pools may be responsible for shifting the differentiation process of the epidermal hair follicle cells to one of proliferation as has been proposed by O'Brien's group (38Peralta-Soler A. Gilliard G. Megosh L.C. O'Brien T.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1108-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is particularly interesting since putrescine is not typically implicated in proliferative processes in in vitro systems (1Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar, 2Jänne J. Alhonen L. Leinonen P. Ann.

The contribution of possible oxidative stress caused by polyamine catabolism should also be considered in the case of hair loss in the SSAT transgenics. In contrast to skin-specific ODC transgenics, there was no indication of skin papilloma formation (37Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Peralta Soler A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar) in the SSAT mice. Whether the absence of spontaneous tumor formation in the SSAT transgenic animals is related to the unaltered or slightly decreased skin pools of spermidine and spermine (Table II), in contrast to those elevated in ODC transgenic mice (37Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Peralta Soler A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar), is not known. Even though the exact mechanism(s) leading to ovarian hypofunction and infertility of the female members of the present transgenic animals overexpressing SSAT is not known, it is of interest to note that a testicular overexpression of ODC in transgenic mice caused disturbances of spermatogenesis (13Hakovirta H. Keiski A. Toppari J. Halmekytö M. Alhonen L. Jänne J. Parvinen M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1430-1436PubMed Google Scholar) ultimately leading to male infertility (14Halmekytö M. Hyttinen J.-M. Sinervirta R. Utriainen M. Myöhänen S. Voipio H.-M. Wahlfors J. Syrjänen S. Syrjänen K. Alhonen L. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as in the skin, increases in putrescine could play a role in mediating the effects on ovarian function. In addition to revealing novel metabolic and phenotypic changes due to overexpression of SSAT, the present findings validate the approach for using the polyamine catabolic enzyme SSAT as a means to deplete intracellular spermidine and spermine pools in whole animals. This strategy can now be extended to conditional (39Furth P.A. St Onge L. Boger H. Gruss P. Gossen M. Kistner A. Bujard H. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9302-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and/or tissue-specific expression systems (37Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Peralta Soler A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G.

In most nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins, the targeting signal is contained in an N-terminal extension, the mitochondrial targeting sequence (presequence). The presequences are recognized by the mitochondrial outer membrane translocation system (TOM complex) 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane of mitochondria; OMV, outer membrane vesicle; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; HSW, high salt washing buffer; LSW, low salt washing buffer; DSG, disuccinimidyl glutarate; EDC, ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. and the translocation apparatus of the inner membrane (TIM complex). Both complexes can act in a coordinated fashion to facilitate the insertion of preproteins into these two membranes as well as the translocation into the internal compartments, the intermembrane space and the matrix (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pfanner N.

Investigations during the last decade have identified many components participating in mitochondrial protein import and have provided us with a coarse picture of the molecular mechanism of the transport process. At the mitochondrial outer membrane, import is initiated through a series of reactions, including preprotein recognition, unfolding, insertion, and translocation (reviewed in Ref. 5Lill R. Neupert W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 56-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These processes are facilitated by the multisubunit TOM complex. Members of the TOM complex can be grouped into components that are protease-sensitive and act as preprotein receptors and components that are more embedded into the membrane and that may form a translocation pore. The central receptor components are Tom20 and Tom22. They form a receptor unit that is essential for the formation of a presequence binding site defined as the “cis site” (7Mayer A. Neupert W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ionic interactions with the presequence appear to be the dominant force of preprotein recognition at this site, as bound preproteins readily dissociate at higher ionic strength (8Mayer A.

The other receptors, Tom37, Tom70, and possibly Tom71, form a subcomplex and cooperate in the import of a subset of preproteins (12Gratzer S. Lithgow T. Bauer R.E. Lamping E. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). From the receptors, preproteins move into and across a putative translocation pore, which may be formed by the membrane-embedded components of the TOM complex (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These components include the essential protein Tom40 (15Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner T. Griffiths G. Horstmann H.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The transfer of the presequence into the translocation pore is accompanied by the concomitant unfolding of the mature part of the preprotein and results in the formation of a stably bound translocation intermediate in which the presequence is bound to a specific binding site termed “trans site.” In this binding state, the presequence is exposed to the intermembrane space (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The questions of how this passage across the outer membrane occurs and which components are involved in forming the trans site are still unresolved. The aim of the present study is to further unravel the mechanistic events of the membrane translocation process across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, we attempted to identify those components that are in close contact to the translocating preprotein and that serve as specific binding partners for the presequence. For this purpose, we identified the nearest neighbors of the translocating polypeptide chain by chemical cross-linking. The preprotein was arrested in distinct translocation intermediate states that were established in either purified outer membrane vesicles (OMV) (20Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or in intact mitochondria. Particular emphasis was on the identification of the cross-linking partners of the presequence part of the preprotein to gain insight into the molecular nature of the presequence-specifictrans site. The results presented here demonstrate that, in addition to the well known presequence binding partners Tom20 and Tom22, Tom40 is in close contact with the presequence part of a translocating polypeptide chain. This intimate contact is established early on in the translocation event, when the preprotein is still bound to the surface-exposedcis site. Upon entering the translocation pore, the presequence looses its contact to the cis site-forming proteins Tom20/Tom22, but remains bound in the close vicinity of Tom40. Our data suggest that Tom40 plays an important role in presequence interaction during the passage of preproteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane. The following published procedures were used: growth of Neurospora crassa wild type strain 74A and purification of mitochondria and mitochondrial OMV (20Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); treatment of OMV with trypsin, raising antisera, and purification of IgG (21Söllner T. Griffiths G. Pfaller R. Pfanner N.

Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); analysis of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and fluorography of the resulting gels (23Nicholson D.W. Köhler H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); blotting of proteins onto nitrocellulose and immunostaining of blotted proteins using the ECL chemiluminesence detection system (Amersham Corp.) (20Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The amount of radioactive protein was quantitated on a PhosphorImager FUJI X BAS 1500. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie dye-binding assay using IgG as a standard (Bio-Rad). The following fusion proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate: PreSu9-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) containing the first 69 amino acids of subunit 9 of the mitochondrial F0-ATPase (pSu9) in front of mouse DHFR; this protein was termed pSu9-DHFR and contains cleavage sites for matrix processing peptidase after residues 35 and 66 (24Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A truncated version of pSu9-DHFR termed pSu9-DHFR13was generated by cleaving the plasmid pGEM4 harboring the coding region of pSu9-DHFR at unique site with AccB7I restriction enzyme before transcription. This results in a linearized DNA containing the coding region for amino acid residues 1–69 of pSu9 plus the first 13 residues of DHFR. A protein termed pSu9(+7) containing amino acid residues 1–69 of pSu9 plus 7 additional residues was generated by linearizing plasmid pGEM3 harboring the coding region for this sequence with EcoRI (plasmid kindly provided by Dr. B. Westermann). All these truncated proteins were synthesized by run-off translation for 1 h at 25 °C in reticulocyte lysate. Puromycin (250 μm) was added at the end of the synthesis reaction, and incubation was continued for 3 min at 25 °C to release nascent protein from the ribosomes. For import or binding experiments, all vials were coated with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml, 15 min) before use to reduce unspecific interactions of precursor proteins with tube walls. OMV were suspended in import buffer (0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) in the absence or presence of 1 mm NADPH and 1 μmmethotrexate (MTX). In experiments using mitochondria, the import buffer was supplemented with 220 mm sucrose, and with 30–45 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to dissipate the membrane potential across the inner membrane. Reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled precursor proteins was then added and incubated with OMV or mitochondria for the desired times at various temperatures. Samples were diluted with high (HSW) or low salt (LSW) washing buffer (10 mm MOPS/KOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and 120 or 20 mm KCl, respectively) containing 220 mm sucrose for experiments with mitochondria. Finally, OMV or mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation for 20 min at 125,000 × gor 10 min at 12,000 × g, respectively. For cross-linking experiments, OMV or mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in SEM buffer (220 mm sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 containing CCCP in the case of mitochondria), and either 117 μm disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) or 1 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (both from Pierce) was added. After 40 min at 0 °C, excess cross-linker was quenched by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 100 mm glycine, pH 8.0. Aliquots were removed before and after the addition of the cross-linking reagents, proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, samples were dissolved in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). After incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, the lysed material was diluted 40-fold with lysis buffer lacking SDS. After a clarifying spin (15 min at 20,000 × g), the supernatant was incubated with antibodies that were coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Co-immunoprecipitation of the TOM complex with bound translocation intermediates was performed as described earlier using antibodies directed against Tom40 (15Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Söllner T. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To identify the components involved in forming the previously defined cis and trans sites of the TOM complex (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a fusion protein comprised of the presequence part of subunit 9 of the F0-ATPase and mouse DHFR termed pSu9-DHFR was used.Cis site binding was established by incubating isolated OMV with the fusion protein at 0 °C in the presence of 1 μm MTX followed by a wash of the OMV with LSW (20 mm KCl). Under this condition, the preprotein was loosely bound to the OMV and dissociated at higher ionic strength (8Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1 A, lanes Total).Trans site interaction was established by performing the binding reaction at 25 °C in the absence of MTX. In this case, the majority of the preprotein was bound in a stable, salt-resistant fashion. Residual cis site-bound material could be removed by a wash with HSW (120 mm KCl), thus resulting in an almost exclusive accumulation of trans site-bound preprotein. This latter material was firmly associated with the TOM complex and could be isolated by co-immunoprecipitation using antibodies against, e.g. Tom40 (Fig. 1 A), in contrast to what was found for cis site-bound material. Using these two binding conditions, we analyzed the molecular environment of the bound preprotein by a cross-linking approach. In an initial cross-linking experiment, the homobifunctional reagent DSG was added to OMV carrying pSu9-DHFR bound to either thecis or the trans site. Several specific cross-linking products were formed under both conditions (Fig.1 B). Some of the bands were obtained also by using the “zero length” cross-linking reagent EDC (not shown; see below), indicating that the preprotein is in intimate contact to these cross-linking partners. The pattern of the cross-linking products in the two binding conditions was similar, despite the fundamentally different character of binding. Addition of chemical amounts of the presequence peptide F1β (corresponding to amino acids 1–32 of the precursor of the β-subunit of yeast F1-ATPase) after the incubation of preprotein with OMV, but before the cross-linking reaction largely reduced the formation of the specific cross-linking products in both the cis andtrans binding conditions (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the cross-links were occurring with a preprotein that is specifically bound via its presequence. The sizes of the cross-linking products suggested Tom20, Tom22, and Tom40 as possible partners. This expectation was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against these TOM complex proteins (Fig. 1 C). Two Tom40-specific cross-linking products were observed which differed in their electrophoretic mobility. These two cross-linking species correspond to different conformations of the preprotein-Tom40 complex. 2D. Rapaport, unpublished results. None of the cross-linking products was immunoprecipitated with antibodies derived from preimmune serum or with antibodies against porin, the most abundant protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. We conclude from these results that a preprotein bound to the surface-exposed cis site is also in the vicinity of Tom40, a membrane-embedded component. Most likely, this early contact with Tom40 occurs through the presequence part of the preprotein (see also below). After transfer of the presequence into and across the outer membrane, the translocating polypeptide chain remains in the vicinity of both Tom40 and the receptors Tom20/Tom22. To more precisely analyze the role of the presequence for preprotein binding to the TOM machinery, we constructed two additional polypeptides. The first is a truncated version of pSu9-DHFR termed pSu9-DHFR13, consisting of the presequence of subunit 9 and the N-terminal 13-amino acid residues of DHFR. The second, pSu9(+7), consists of the presequence of subunit 9 plus 7 additional amino acid residues resulting from the cloning procedure. Cross-linking of these polypeptides to the TOM components by DSG or EDC can occur only via the presequence part, as the short segments following the presequence lack any lysyl residues. Addition of the cross-linkers to OMV that were incubated with pSu9(+7) under cis binding conditions resulted in the formation of several specific cross-linking products (Fig. 2 A), while under conditions favoringtrans site binding, reduced amounts of pSu9(+7) were bound to OMV, and only a few specific cross-linking bands were detected. Similar results were obtained with pSu9-DHFR13 (data not shown). As seen by immunoprecipitation, pSu9(+7) bound at thecis site became cross-linked to Tom20, Tom22, Tom40, and Tom70 (Fig. 2 B). Cross-linking to the latter two components is consistent with results from a previous cross-linking study that utilized a presequence peptide to identify new components of the mitochondrial protein translocation machinery (25Gaikwad A.S. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6437-6443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The additional band at an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (Fig. 2 A) corresponds most likely to the cross-linking product of the preprotein with one of the small Tom proteins. Thus, a surface-bound presequence is in intimate contact with various TOM complex proteins including the receptors. After the high salt wash only 13% of the preprotein remained bound to OMV as estimated by PhosphorImager analysis. The cross-link to Tom40 relative to bound protein occurred to a similar extent as under the cis binding condition (Fig.2 A). This result shows that a presequence polypeptide bound in a salt-resistant fashion stays in the vicinity of Tom40. Further, the data suggest that stable binding to the trans site requires a contribution of the mature part of the preprotein.Figure 2A presequence polypeptide bound to OMV undercis and trans conditions can be cross-linked to various TOM components. A, OMV were incubated with radioactively labeled pSu9(+7) for 15 min at 0 °C or 25 °C and diluted with LSW or HSW buffers, respectively. After reisolation (20 min, 125,000 × g), the OMV were resuspended in SEM buffer, and the cross-linking reagents DSG (117 μm) and EDC (1 mm) were added as indicated. After incubation for 40 min at 0 °C, the cross-linkers were quenched. Further analysis was as in Fig. 1 B. B, identification of the cross-linking products by immunoprecipitation. OMV were incubated with pSu9(+7) for 15 min at 0 °C, diluted with LSW buffer, and reisolated (20 min, 125,000 × g). The pellets were resuspended in SEM buffer, and DSG (117 μm) was added. Aliquots were removed before (−DSG) and after the cross-linking reaction (40 min at 0 °C; +DSG). Further analysis and immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against Tom20, Tom22, Tom40, and Tom70 or antibodies derived from preimmune serum were as in Fig. 1 C. Apparent molecular masses are given on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether establishing a direct contact between the presequence of a preprotein and Tom40 requires the participation of the cytoplasmic domains of Tom20/Tom22 receptors. For that purpose, we performed the cross-linking of pSu9-DHFR and pSu9(+7) with OMV that were pretreated with trypsin. This pretreatment quantitatively removes the surface receptors and completely abolishes cis site binding (8Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but leaves Tom40 intact. 3K.-P. Künkele, personal communication. Binding to trypsin-treated OMV under the trans site conditions was reduced to about 20–30% of the binding to untreated OMV (Fig. 3, A and B). Using the zero-length cross-linking reagent EDC, adducts between both preproteins and Tom40 were observed with trypsin-pretreated OMV. As quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis, the efficiency of cross-linking to Tom40 relative to bound precursor protein was about 2-fold higher than in the presence of surface receptors. This suggests that a preprotein, via its presequence, can bind to Tom40, even in the absence of surface receptors. Thus, the surface receptors appear to be essential for efficient accumulation of preproteins at the trans site (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), but they are not necessary for establishing and maintaining the interaction with Tom40. We asked whether the interaction of the presequence with the different TOM components is dependent on soluble factors that are contained in the lysate mixture. Factors such as MSF and Hsp70 have been reported to be important for establishing the association (reviewed in Ref. 26Mihara K. Omura T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Chemical amounts of the purified presequence peptide F1β (see above) were bound to OMV. The OMV were washed with high or low salt buffers and cross-linking with EDC was performed. Immunostaining analysis revealed specific cross-linking of this presequence peptide to Tom22 and to Tom40 (Fig. 4, A andB, marked b). In addition, cross-linking of Tom22 and Tom40 to one of the small TOM complex proteins was seen (Fig. 4,A and B, marked a). Weak cross-linking of the presequence peptide was also observed to Tom20, but no products were recognized for porin (not shown). Strikingly, the cross-link to Tom22 was absent, when OMV were washed with high salt buffer, in contrast to the cross-link to Tom40. It appears that F1β is bound to Tom22 and Tom40 in a distinct fashion, a situation presumably reflecting the different binding properties of preproteins such as pSu9-DHFR to the cis and trans sites (see above). Cross-linking was specific for mitochondrial presequences, as no reaction was observed for a control peptide (CH4), corresponding to amino acids 1–25 of N. crassa cytochromec heme lyase, which does not resemble a presequence (Fig.4 A) (cf. Ref. 27Lill, R., Mayer, A., Steiner, H., Kispal, G. & Neupert, W. (1996)Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 51–70.Google Scholar). The cross-linking product of F1β with Tom40 was observed at a similar efficiency also after trypsin pretreatment of the OMV (Fig. 4 B), corroborating our results from above that the presequence- Tom40 contact can occur independently of receptors. Taken together, our data show that a presequence peptide bound to OMV is in intimate contact with the surface receptors Tom20 and Tom22 only in the presence of low salt, whereas the interaction with Tom40 may persist even after a high salt wash. Since the results were obtained with a purified presequence peptide, no soluble factors are necessary for establishing these interactions. It was now of particular interest whether the presequence-TOM protein interactions observed with isolated OMV can be identified during the import of preproteins into intact mitochondria. For that purpose, import intermediates were accumulated with isolated mitochondria. To avoid translocation across the inner membrane, both matrix ATP and the membrane potential ΔΨ across the inner membrane were depleted (28Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,29Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. Van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). pSu9-DHFR and pSu9(+7) were bound under conditions that result in almost exclusive binding to the cis site and in binding to a state corresponding to the trans site (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 30Hwang S.T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).2 As seen with isolated OMV, the DHFR moiety became unfolded in the latter binding condition, a characteristic feature oftrans site binding. 4R. Lill and D. Rapaport, unpublished results. The cross-linking pattern observed for binding of both preproteins undercis site conditions was similar to that obtained with OMV,i.e. specific cross-links to Tom20, Tom22, and Tom40 were formed (Fig. 5). After incubation of the preproteins with mitochondria at 25 °C and a high salt wash (transcondition), the cross-linking efficiency to the TOM components was reduced, even though the amount of bound preproteins was comparable to that under the cis site condition. This observation may be due to the further movement of the presequence into the intermembrane space or to the outer face of the inner membrane, a reaction that is not possible in OMV. Nevertheless, preproteins bound under this condition could be specifically cross-linked to Tom40 and to a lesser extent to Tom20 and Tom22 (Fig. 5). Thus, the nearest neighbors of a presequence during its transport across the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria are the same as those identified with OMV. In summary, our data suggest that the presequence of a translocating preprotein is in the proximity of Tom40 under both the cis andtrans binding conditions. Since in our experiments, the zero length cross-linker EDC was used, Tom40 appears to be in direct contact with the presequence, especially when bound at the transsite. Our present cross-linking study analyzes the neighborhood of presequence-containing preproteins bound to the protein import complex of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The data allow us to extend and refine our view of the molecular mechanism of preprotein translocation across this membrane (see, e.g. Ref. 5Lill R. Neupert W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 56-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Earlier investigations have shown that the preprotein first interacts with the surface receptors Tom20 and Tom22 (see Fig. 6,stage A). This has been demonstrated by various techniques including binding studies (8Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Haucke V. Lithgow T. Rospert S. Hahne K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5565-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and cross-linking techniques (32Hönlinger A. Kübrich M. Moczko M. Gärtner F. Mallet L. Bussereau F. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Jacquet M. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3382-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our study now shows that it is the presequence part of the preprotein which is in close contact to the receptors. In this surface-bound stage previously defined as the cis site, the presequence is also in contact with Tom40, a component, which according to its high protease resistance, is embedded in the outer membrane and most likely forms the translocation channel or a major part thereof. This contact could occur either via a surface-exposed region of Tom40 (Fig. 6,stage A), or the presequence could be inserted at least partially into the translocation pore thereby initiating the translocation process (Fig. 6, stage B). Only N-terminal parts of the presequence may have entered the translocation channel in this surface-bound state, since the mature part of the preprotein remains fully folded, and added matrix processing peptidase can readily cleave off the presequence of cis site-bound preproteins (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 6, stages A and B). Deeper insertion of the presequence across the outer membrane requires the unfolding of the mature part of the preprotein, a reaction which does not depend on external energy sources such as ATP hydrolysis (Fig.6, stage C) (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Translocation is thought to be driven by the interaction of the presequence with a second presequence-specific binding site. This site was previously termed trans site, since the presequence is accessible from the intermembrane space side of the outer membrane. The matrix processing peptidase introduced into the lumen of OMV could cleave off the presequence of transsite-bound preproteins, but was unable to do so from the cytosolic side (Fig. 6, stages C and D) (7Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our cross-linking study now provides important information about the molecular environment forming this presequence-specific binding site. Tom40 appears to be the major partner of interaction for the presequence at this stage. The presequence-Tom40 interaction can be seen even after removal of the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor proteins, suggesting that these domains are not essential for the formation of this binding site. Moreover, cross-linking of a presequence peptide to Tom40 was observed also after removing loosely bound molecules by a high salt wash (Figs. 2 and 4). In contrast, cross-linking to Tom22 was almost completely abolished under such conditions. Thus, Tom40 appears to be directly involved in forming the second presequence binding site. Preproteins bound to this stage remain in close contact to Tom20 and Tom22. This contact is formed mainly through the mature part of the preprotein, as cross-linking of trans site-bound preproteins to Tom20 and Tom22 is only seen with preproteins containing a larger portion of the mature part. In addition to Tom40, other components of the TOM complex may be important for the formation of thetrans presequence binding site. One such component is likely one of the small TOM complex proteins that was observed to become cross-linked to a presequence polypeptide. The precise position of the trans presequence binding site on Tom40 remains unknown. Based on the accessibility of the matrix processing peptidase cleavage site of trans site-bound preproteins from the inner face of the outer membrane, it may be argued that the trans site is located toward the intermembrane space. However, a situation in which the presequence is in dynamic equilibrium between the translocation pore and the intermembrane space side seems also possible (Fig. 6, stages C andD). A prerequisite for defining the binding site in detail is the unraveling of the structure of Tom40. Earlier investigations have addressed the role of the intermembrane space domain of Tom22 in presequence binding on the transside of the outer membrane. Two studies found no significant alterations in preprotein translocation across the outer membrane upon deletion of this segment of Tom22 (33Nakai M. Kinoshita K. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30571-30575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4034-4042Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In another report, deletion of this piece had a dramatic influence on the growth of mutated yeast cells and largely affected protein import into mitochondria (10Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6318-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, an interaction between presequences and the C-terminal portion of yeast Tom22 was found. In contrast, no significant association between presequences or preproteins and the corresponding piece of N. crassa Tom22 was observed (34Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4034-4042Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our present cross-linking study was unable to detect any cross-linking of Tom22 to presequence peptides, when they were bound at the salt-resistanttrans site of the outer membrane. Thus, our previous (34Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4034-4042Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and present results suggest that the C terminus of Tom22 does not play an essential role in binding and translocation of mitochondrial presequences across the mitochrondrial outer membrane. Preprotein translocation across the outer membrane of mitochondria is similar in a number of aspects to protein transport across the chloroplast outer envelope membrane (35Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J.

In chloroplasts, the outer envelope protein IAP86/OEP86 serves as the initial binding partner (36Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J.

As in the case of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the surface-bound preprotein is in close proximity to a membrane-embedded component that possibly forms a translocation pore, namely IAP75/OEP75 (37Ma Y.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1436-2446Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Insertion of the targeting sequence leads to a stable import intermediate in which the presequence is recognized a second time. In both organelles, the membrane-embedded pore-forming components (Tom40 in mitochondria or IAP75/OEP75 in chloroplasts) are involved in the formation of these two binding sites. What may be the relevance of a second presequence binding site for the protein import reaction? Repeated deciphering of the targeting information might be important to increase the accuracy of targeting. At the organellar surface, preproteins are bound in a rather labile fashion and readily equilibrate with the bulk solution. The labile character of interaction in this first binding site would be well suited for selecting the cognate preproteins from the large pool of cytosolic proteins. Erroneously bound proteins could readily dissociate from the organellar surface at this stage. Efficient insertion into the translocation pore and binding to the second presequence binding site is only feasible if the correct targeting information is attached to the N terminus of the preprotein. It is possible that different features of the targeting sequences are recognized at these two binding sites. Such a “double-check system” would thus guarantee the accurate selection of the correct preproteins. We thank Dr. B. Westermann for providing the plasmid encoding the pSu9(+7) protein and P.

https://openalex.org/W2051985278,"Recent studies of the phenylalkylamine binding site in the α1C subunit of l-type Ca2+ channels have revealed three amino acid residues in transmembrane segment IVS6 that are critical for high affinity block and are unique to l-type channels. We have extended this analysis of the phenylalkylamine binding site to amino acid residues in transmembrane segment IIIS6 and the pore region. Twenty-two consecutive amino acid residues in segment IIIS6 were mutated to alanine and the conserved Glu residues in the pore region of each homologous domain were mutated to Gln. Mutant channels were expressed in tsA-201 cells along with the β1b and α2δ auxiliary subunits. Assay for block of Ba2+ current by (−)-D888 at −60 mV revealed that mutation of five amino acid residues in segment IIIS6 and the pore region that are conserved between l-type and non-l-type channels (Tyr1152, Phe1164, Val1165, Glu1118, and Glu1419) and one l-type-specific amino acid (Ile1153) decreased affinity for (−)-D888 from 10–20-fold. Combination of the four mutations in segment IIIS6 increased the IC50 for block by (−)-D888 to approximately 9 μm, similar to the affinity of non-l-type Ca2+ channels for this drug. These results indicate that there are important determinants of phenylalkylamine binding in both the S6 segments and the pore regions of domains III and IV, some of which are conserved across the different classes of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

The pore forming α1 subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+channels consist of four homologous domains (I-IV), each containing six putative transmembrane segments (S1-S6) (3Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A.

The role ofl-type channels in initiating muscle contraction within the cardiovascular system has made them important therapeutic targets for the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, and cardiac arrhythmia (4Fleckenstein A.

Three major classes of l-type Ca2+ channel blockers are currently in clinical use, dihydropyridines, benz(othi)azepines, and phenylalkylamines. Drugs from all three classes bind to the pore-forming α1 subunit ofl-type Ca2+ channels in a manner that suggests that their binding sites are closely linked (5Gould R.J. Murphy K.M. Snyder S.H.

Recently, much progress has been made toward the characterization of Ca2+antagonist receptor sites at the molecular level (for review see Ref.7Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A.

Photoaffinity labeling studies and studies utilizing chimeric and mutant channels have indicated that both transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 are involved in forming the dihydropyridine (8Striessnig J.

In contrast, such studies of the phenylalkylamine binding site, to date, have indicated the involvement of only transmembrane segment IVS6. The high affinity photolabel LU49888 was found to derivatize transmembrane segment IVS6 of the skeletal muscle l-type channel exclusively (13Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9108-9112Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies with mutant channels, three amino acid residues in IVS6, which are unique tol-type channels, have been found to be critical for high affinity phenylalkylamine block (14Hockerman G.H.

Birnbaumer L. Hoffmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Simultaneous mutation of these three residues, Tyr1463, Ala1467, and Ile1470, resulted in channels that were blocked by the high affinity phenylalkylamine (−)-D888 with an affinity similar to that of non-l-type channels. Transfer of the l-type IVS6 sequence in chimeric Ca2+ channels was sufficient to confer l-type sensitivity to (−)-D888 in a non-l-type channel (16Doring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the studies implicating only segment IVS6 in phenylalkylamine binding, several lines of evidence suggest that IIIS6 might also be involved in the phenylalkylamine receptor site. The allosteric interactions among all three major classes of l-type Ca2+ channel blockers suggests that the binding sites for these drugs are near each other but not identical. Because evidence from both photolabeling studies and analysis of mutant channels has implicated domain IIIS6 in the binding of both dihydropyridines and benzothiazepines, it is important to examine the role of individual amino acids in domain IIIS6 in block of l-type channels by phenylalkylamines. We have individually mutated 21 amino acids in IIIS6 to Ala and another (Ala1157) to Pro and analyzed the mutant channels for sensitivity to the high affinity phenylalkylamine (−)-D888. We report here that four amino acid residues in transmembrane domain IIIS6 are required for high affinity block ofl-type Ca2+ channels by (−)-D888. The phenylalkylamines are thought to block ion channels by occluding the ion-conducting pore and thereby preventing cation permeation (17Wit A.L. Cranefield P.F. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Hescheler J. Pelzer D. Trube G. Trautwein W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

Moreover, at physiological pH, phenylalkylamines are predominantly positively charged due to protonation of the tertiary amino group. In view of these observations, we mutated four conserved Glu residues known to contribute to the ion-selective pore ofl-type Ca2+ channels, Glu363, Glu709, Glu1118, and Glu1419 (20Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 109-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), to Gln and screened the resulting mutant channels for sensitivity to (−)-D888. We report here that Glu1118 and Glu1419 in the putative pore-lining segments of homologous domains III and IV, respectively, are also involved in high affinity block of l-type Ca2+ channels by phenylalkylamines. All mutations were constructed using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described previously (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4905) Google Scholar). The IIIS6, E1118Q, and E1419Q mutations were inserted into full-length α1 subunit constructs in the expression vector Zem229 (Dr. Eileen Mulvihill, Zymogenetics Corp., Seattle) using the 1.5-kilobase SpeI/DraIII fragment and the 272-base pair DraIII/DraIII fragment in a three-way ligation. The E363Q mutation was inserted into the full-length α1 subunit construct using the 1.4-kilobaseNgoMI/BglII fragment. The E709Q mutation was inserted into the full-length α1 subunit construct using the 1.3-kilobase SgrAI/SpeI fragment. All mutations were confirmed by cDNA sequencing. tsA201 cells, a subclone of the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 that expresses SV40 T antigen (a gift of Dr. Robert Dubridge, Cell Genesis, Foster City, CA), were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2.

(−)-D888 was applied to cells recorded in the whole cell patch-clamp configuration by the addition of 0.2 ml of a 6× stock to a 1-ml bath. The extracellular (bath) saline contained 150 mm Tris, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm BaCl2, and pH adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. Patch electrode saline (intracellular) contained 130 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm EGTA, 60 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and pH adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). No nonlinear outward currents were detected under these conditions. Patch electrodes were pulled from VWR micropipettes and fire-polished to produce an inner tip diameter of 4–6 μm. Currents were recorded using a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier and filtered at 2 kHz (8-pole Bessel filter, −3 db). Data were acquired using Basic-Fastlab software (Indec Systems). Voltage-dependent currents have been corrected for leak using an on-line P/4 subtraction paradigm. Thel-type Ca2+ channel α1C subunit (22Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M.

Ba2+ currents through the resultingl-type Ca2+ channels were blocked by (−)-D888; a concentration of 50 nm (−)-D888 reduced the Ba2+ current by approximately 50% (Fig.1 A). The block by (−)-D888 was rapid and reached equilibrium within 200 s (14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Analysis of equilibrium block of Ba2+ currents by a range of concentrations of (−)-D888 yielded an IC50 of 48 ± 5 nm(Fig. 1 F). The putative transmembrane segment IIIS6 of the α1C subunit of l-type Ca2+channels contains primarily hydrophobic amino acid residues.α1C ISIFFIIYI¯IIIAFFMMNIFV¯GFVI 1169α1B L­­­YVV­FVVFP­­FV­­­­ALI­1373SCHEME1Of the 25 amino acid residues predicted to comprise this transmembrane segment, 14 are different in the phenylalkylamine-insensitive (14Hockerman G.H.

To assess the role of the individual amino acid residues in the IIIS6 segment of α1C in high affinity block by (−)-D888, we mutated Ala1157 to Pro as in N-type Ca2+ channels (Scheme 1), mutated the other amino acids in IIIS6 to Ala, and screened the mutant channels for sensitivity to (−)-D888. Ala was chosen for substitution because it has minimal effects on protein secondary structure when substituted in α helices in the core of proteins (26Blaber M. Zhang K.J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and therefore is expected to reduce the hydrophobicity and size of the amino acid residue in each position in this putative α helix without causing global conformational change. All of the mutant α1 subunits studied formed functional Ca2+ channels in tsA-201 cells except A1157P. Seventeen of these mutations had no effect on the concentration dependence of block by (−)-D888, as illustrated for M1160A in Fig. 1 (B andF). In contrast, three of these single amino acid mutations caused marked increases in the IC50 values for block of Ba2+ currents by (−)-D888. For example, the mutation F1164A caused a large increase in the concentration of (−)-D888 required for block of the Ba2+ current (Fig. 1 C) and approximately a 10-fold shift to higher concentration of the inhibition curve for (−)-D888 (Fig. 1 F). The IC50 values for block of Ba2+ currents through the wild type and all of the mutant α1C subunits are illustrated as a bar graph in Fig. 2. Of the 21 amino acid mutations to Ala studied, only I1153A (IC50 = 601 ± 106 nm), F1164A (IC50 = 449 ± 83 nm), and V1165A (IC50 = 449 ± 93 nm) caused significant increases in the IC50for (−)-D888 block (Fig. 2). In contrast to the other mutations studied, Y1152A reduced the IC50 for (−)-D888 approximately 7-fold to 7.5 ± 2.4 nm, suggesting a potentially important role of the amino acid in this position in determining affinity for phenylalkylamines. To assess the effect of a more conservative substitution at this postion, we mutated Tyr1152 to Phe instead of Ala. The Y1152F mutation, which removes only a hydroxyl group, caused an increase in the concentration of (−)-D888 required for block of Ba2+currents (Fig. 1 D) and approximately an 18-fold shift to higher concentration in the inhibition curve for (−)-D888 (Fig.1 F; IC50 = 873 ± 219 nm). Thus, our results suggest that a total of four amino acid residues in segment IIIS6 may contribute to formation of the high affinity receptor site for (−)-D888 (Fig. 2). If these four amino acid residues are determinants of high affinity binding of (−)-D888, mutation of combinations of them should increase the IC50 for block of the l-type Ca2+ channels to a value near 5 μm, like the N-type Ca2+ channels (14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The quadruple mutation Y1152F,I1153A, F1164A,V1165A (YIFV) caused an even further increase in the IC50 for block by (−)-D888 than the single mutations. Concentrations of (−)-D888 in the range of 5 μm were required to observe significant block of Ba2+ currents (Fig. 1 E). Analysis of the block of Ba2+ currents by a range of concentrations of (−)-D888 at equilibrium yielded an IC50 of 8.7 ± 4.8 μm (Fig. 1 F). Each concentration of drug tested in these experiments reached an equilibrium level of block with mutant YIFV and with the other mutants studied, indicating that the changes in IC50 reflect changes in the equilibrium K d for drug binding. The changes in free energy of binding of (−)-D888 caused by each mutation (Δ[ΔG]) can be estimated from the measured K dvalues according to the equation: Δ[ΔG] = −RTln[K d(wt)/K d(mut)]. For the single mutants with significant effects on (−)-D888 binding, the Δ[ΔG] values were: Y1152F, 1.7 kcal/mol; I1153A, 1.5 kcal/mol; F1164A, 1.3 kcal/mol; and V1165A, 1.3 kcal/mol. For the YIFV mutation, the Δ[ΔG] value was 3.1 kcal/mol. Therefore, the decrease in binding energy in the YIFV was only 53% of the sum of the changes caused by the individual mutations, suggesting that the contributions to the binding energy by these four amino acid residues are not independent. To examine the specificity of the effects of the IIIS6 mutations on Ca2+channel function, we compared their kinetic and voltage-dependent properties with those of Ca2+channels containing wild type α1C. Current-voltage relationships were generally similar for wild type and for the mutant α1C subunits having altered affinity for (−)-D888 (Fig.3, A and B) with peak Ba2+ currents observed at +10 to +20 mV in each case. However, closer analysis of conductance-voltage relationships revealed small but significant differences (wild type, V½ = +11.5 mV; Y1152F, V½ = +6 mV; I1153A,V½ = +3.7 mV; F1164A, V½ = +6.8 mV; and V1165A, V½ = +4.0 mV). These voltage shifts were not due to differences in the time from forming the whole cell patch clamp configuration because current-voltage relations were first measured at 5 min after break-in, and no additional shifts were observed after that time. Although the voltage dependence of activation was significantly different for the single mutations, the voltage dependence of channel activation was not significantly different in the combination mutant YIFV compared with wild type (YIFV,V½ = +14.3 mV), suggesting that the effects of the single mutations were compensated in the combined mutant. The IIIS6 mutations also affected the apparent reversal potential (E rev) of the mutant channels, which is a measure of their ion selectivity. Although theE rev of the mutant YIFV was shifted only slightly from wild type (YIFV, E rev = +56.3 ± 2.9 mV, n = 6; wild type,E rev = +61.3 mV ± 4.4, n = 10), both single Tyr1152 mutations were shifted approximately 15 mV (Y1152A, E rev = +46.9 ± 6.1 mV, n = 4; Y1152F, E rev = +46.9 ± 3.1 mV, n = 4). TheE rev values of mutants I1153A and V1165A were also substantially shifted from wild type (I1153A,E rev = 47.4 ± 1.8 mV, n = 5; V1156A, E rev = 42.2 ± 2.3 mV,n = 5), whereas the E rev of mutant F1164A was more moderately affected (F1164A,E rev = 53.1 ± 3.6 mV, n = 5). These results are consistent with the idea that the IIIS6 segment contributes to the lining of the pore of Ca2+ channels, and mutations of amino acid residues in this segment therefore alter the selectivity of ion conductance. In contrast to their lack of effect on channel activation, phenylalkylamines cause Ca2+ channel inactivation curves to shift in the hyperpolarizing direction, indicating that block by these compounds is more potent at depolarized potentials where inactivation is favored (27Ehara T. Kaufmann R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1978; 207: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 28McDonald T.F. Pelzer D. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1984; 352: 217-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, mutations that alter voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ channels may affect binding and block by phenylalkylamines indirectly. To avoid such effects, all of our experiments were carried out at a holding potential of −60 mV, considerably more negative than steady-state inactivation of l-type Ca2+ channels, so further reduction in voltage-dependent inactivation by mutations should not significantly reduce affinity for (−)-D888. Nevertheless, we have characterized the voltage dependence of inactivation of the mutant Ca2+ channels in detail (Fig.3 C). Mutation of residues Ile1153, Phe1164, and Val1165 caused positive shifts inV½ for inactivation (V1165A,V½ = −14.5 mV; I1153A, V½ = −11.6 mV; and F1164A, V½ = −9.1 mV) compared with wild type (V½ = −17.7 mV). Removal of the hydroxyl group from Tyr1152 did not affect the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation significantly (Y1152F,V½ = −18.8 mV), but removal of the aromatic ring from that position in IIIS6 resulted in a negative shift of approximately 11 mV in V½ (Y1152A,V½ = −29.0 mV). Inactivation curves for the combination mutant YIFV are approximately 12 mV more positive than wild type (V½ = −5.7 mV). To examine the correlation between shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation and the affinity for block by (−)-D888 quantitatively, we plotted the IC50 values for the IIIS6 mutants against their half-inactivation voltage (Fig. 3 D). Half-inactivation values range from −29 mV to −4 mV, and no overall correlation with IC50 is evident. For example, mutant Y1152F has nearly the same V½ value as wild type but substantially increased IC50. Many other mutants have substantially increased or decreased values of V½, but no change in IC50. Mutants I1153A, V1165A, and F1164A have different half-inactivation potentials but comparable increases in IC50 values (Fig. 3 D). Thus, because inactivation is minimal at the holding potential used in these experiments (−60 mV) and no correlation of IC50 withV½ is observed, the decrease in (−)-D888 affinity cannot be ascribed to changes in the intrinsic voltage dependence of channel inactivation in the mutants. On the other hand, the correlation plot of Fig. 3 D may reveal the reason for the increase in affinity caused by mutation Y1152A. This mutant has by far the most negative V½ value (−29 mV) and also has the highest affinity for (−)-D888. Enhanced steady-state inactivation at −60 mV for this mutant may contribute substantially to its increased affinity for (−)-D888. The α1 subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels contain four highly conserved P-loops between the S5 and S6 transmembrane segments of each homologous domain that together form the selectivity filter through which the channel conducts cations. The high selectivity of voltage-gated Ca2+channels for divalent cations over monovalent ions and for Ca2+ ions over other divalent ions is mediated by four Glu residues, one in each homologous domain, that are conserved across all Ca2+ channels (20Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 109-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 30Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because phenylalkylamines are thought to block ion channels by binding in the pore and the protonated amino group of (−)-D888 is positively charged at physiological pH and could potentially interact with the pore Glu residues through an electrostatic mechanism, we mutated each of these Glu residues individually to Gln to neutralize the negative charge that the acidic side chains have at physiological pH and tested the affinity for block by (−)-D888 in the four E → Q mutants. The mutant channels E363Q and E709Q having mutations in domains I and II, respectively, were both blocked by (−)-D888 with IC50 values that were not significantly different from that of the wild type channel (Fig.4, A and D). However, the mutant channels E1118Q and E1419Q in domains III and IV, respectively, both had significant increases in the IC50 for (−)-D888 block (Fig. 4, B and D). The E1118Q mutant caused approximately a 20-fold rightward shift in the concentration dependence of block by (−)-D888 (Fig. 4 D; IC50 = 949 ± 275 nm). The E1419Q mutant caused approximately a 15-fold rightward shift in the concentration dependence of block by (−)-D888 (Fig. 4, B and D; IC50 = 717 ± 241 nm). These results indicate that the P-loop Glu residues in domains III and IV interact with bound (−)-D888, but those in domains I and II do not. Besides the effects on (−)-D888 block, mutation of the pore Glu residues affected other parameters of channel function. The current-voltage curves for these four mutants (Fig. 4 C) show that the voltage dependence of channel activation was not significantly different from wild type. However, the E rev of the mutant E363Q was shifted approximately 16 mV to more negative potential (E rev = 44.7 ± 6.9 mV, n = 5), whereas the E rev of mutant E1118Q was shifted approximately 8 mV negatively (E rev = 52.9 ± 3.9 mV, n = 5) compared with wild type (E rev = 61.3 ± 4.4 mV, n = 10). Surprisingly, E rev of the corresponding mutations in domains II and IV, E709Q and E1419Q, were not different from wild type (E709Q, E rev = 63.5 ± 4.5,n = 5; E1419Q, E rev = 57.5 ± 4.0, n = 6). The effects of the pore mutations on the voltage dependence of inactivation also varied widely. In mutant E363Q, the V½ for inactivation was not substantially different from wild type (E363Q V½ = −16.3 mV), whereas V½ values for inactivation of E709Q and E1419Q were shifted to more positive potentials by approximately 10 and 6 mV, respectively (E709Q, V½ = −7.1 mV; E1419Q, V½ = −11.6 mV). As with the mutations in segment IIIS6, there was no correlation between the effects of the mutations on IC50 for (−)-D888 andV½ for inactivation, consistent with the conclusion that these mutations affect the binding of (−)-D888 directly. As summarized in Fig. 2, we have analyzed the contribution of 21 single amino acid side chains in the transmembrane segment IIIS6 to block by (−)-D888. Of the single amino acid residues mutated in this region, only four had significant effects on the IC50 for (−)-D888. One of these four amino acids is unique to l-type channels (Ile1153), whereas the others are conserved across all types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Scheme 1, underlined residues). The involvement of primarily conserved amino acid residues in segment IIIS6 in high affinity (−)-D888 binding stands in sharp contrast to the results of previous experiments in segment IVS6 where the only three amino acids required for (−)-D888 binding were unique tol-type channels (14Hockerman G.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results show that conserved amino acid residues play crucial roles in the action ofl-type selective drugs and demonstrate the importance of systematic analysis of all amino acid residues in putative drug binding sites in addition to chimeric approaches that target only isoform-specific residues. The single amino acid mutation in this region with the largest effect was the conservative substitution of Phe for Tyr (Y1152F), in which only a single hydroxyl group was removed from the native channel structure. This result is similar to our previous observation (29Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar) that mutation of a Tyr in IVS6 (Tyr1463) to Phe caused a large reduction in sensitivity to (−)-D888. Simultaneous mutation of both Tyr1152 and Tyr1463 to Phe resulted in a channel with an approximately 100-fold increase in IC50 for (−)-D888 and normal inactivation properties. 1G. H. Hockerman, B. D. Johnson, M. R. Abbott, T. Scheuer, and W. A. Catterall, unpublished results. The importance of these two hydroxyl groups, which are potential hydrogen bond donors, suggests a privileged hydrogen bond between them and the singlemeta-methoxy group, a potential hydrogen bond acceptor, on the phenethylamine group of D888. This interaction is apparently not accessible for the lower affinity phenylalkylamines verapamil and D600 (methoxyverapamil), which possess an additional para-methoxy group (29Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support the conclusion that the effects of the mutations of amino acid residues Tyr1152, Ile1153, Phe1164, and Val1165 on binding of (−)-D888 results from alteration of the interactions of the side chains of these residues with the bound drug. The effects of mutations of these residues are highly specific; mutations of adjacent residues to Ala have no effect on block by (−)-D888. There is no correlation between the effects of these mutations on activation or inactivation of Ca2+ channels and their effects on affinity for (−)-D888, indicating that the mutations do not cause their effects by indirect allosteric changes. Thus, our working hypothesis is that these four amino acid residues interact with (−)-D888 when it is bound to its receptor site on l-type Ca2+ channels with high affinity. As suggested previously for amino acid residues in IVS6 that are required for high affinity phenylalkylamine block of l-type Ca2+ channels (14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is likely that the IIIS6 amino acid residues that affect (−)-D888 block also project into the ion-conducting pore. Like the IVS6 residue Tyr1463, mutation of Tyr1152, Ile1153, Phe1164, and Val1165 to Ala resulted in significant shifts in apparent reversal potential. As we showed for Y1463A (14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), these shifts are likely to be due to increases in channel permeability to the normally impermeant organic cationN-methyl-d-glucamine, which is the principal cation in the intracellular solution. Thus, mutations of Tyr1152, Ile1153, Phe1164, and Val1165 change the shape or size of the ion-conducting pore. Phenylalkylamines are thought to bind in the pore of Ca2+ channels (17Wit A.L. Cranefield P.F. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Hescheler J. Pelzer D. Trube G. Trautwein W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 393: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Pelzer D. Trautwein W. McDonald T.F. Pflügers Archi.v. 1982; 394: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and our results show that amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 that are involved in high affinity binding of (−)-D888 are also involved in maintaining the ion selectivity of the pore (Ref. 14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and this work). We therefore investigated the effects of mutating four highly conserved Glu residues, Glu363, Glu709, Glu1118, and Glu1419, in the pore region for two reasons. First, these acidic amino acid side chains apparently project into the pore to form the Ca2+ binding site(s) that confers Ca2+ selectivity to voltage-gated Ca2+channels (20Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 109-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 30Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, these amino acid side chains are negatively charged at physiological pH and potentially participate in electrostatic interactions with protonated (i.e. positively charged) phenylalkylamine molecules. The spatial selectivity of the effects of mutations of these four pore Glu residues is consistent with the large body of data showing domains III and IV to be the site of binding of phenylalkylamines. Mutations of Glu1118 in domain III and Glu1419in domain IV caused major reductions in the affinity for (−)-D888, whereas mutations of Glu363 in domain I and Glu709 in domain II had no appreciable effects. The decreased affinity of E1118Q and E1419Q for (−)-D888 was likely not caused by shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation because E709Q, the pore mutant with the largest shift in steady-state inactivation, had no change in affinity for the drug. Although it is possible that the decreased affinity for (−)-D888 conferred by E1118Q and E1419Q is due to indirect effects, the specificity for these two mutations among the four pore Glu residues and their lack of correlated effects on channel gating argue that they interact directly with the bound drug molecule, most likely through electrostatic interactions with the positively charged amino group. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies showing that phenylalkylamines block ion channels in their positively charged, protonated state (18Hescheler J. Pelzer D. Trube G. Trautwein W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 393: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 745-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and with the evidence that phenylalkylamines bind within the pore of the Ca2+ channel. The results of this and previous studies (14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hoffmann F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that the receptor site for (−)-D888 is composed of at least four distinct subsites: IIIS6, the P-loop in the IIIS5-IIIS6 linker, IVS6, and the P-loop in the IVS5-S6 linker. The critical role of amino acid residues from both IIIS6 and IVS6 in (−)-D888 binding and block strongly suggest that these two transmembrane domains are juxtaposed to form a portion of the intracellular mouth of the ion-conducting pore (Fig.5). Thus, our results support a “domain interface model” of phenylalkylamine binding and block, as proposed previously for dihydropyridines (32Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 256-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The YIFV residues are arranged in two clusters of two amino acids each in IIIS6, but these four residues do not align in precisely the same position in consecutive turns of the α helix as the YAI motif in IVS6 does (14Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the deviation from strict cylindrical shape of many bundled α helices in proteins of known structure would allow all four of these residues to contribute to a binding site for phenylalkylamines in the pore of the channel. We propose that the YIFV motif in IIIS6 and the YAI motif in IVS6 act together to form a hydrophobic pocket that stabilizes (−)-D888 bound in the pore and enhances the electrostatic interactions between the pore Glu residues Glu1118 and Glu1419 and the tertiary amino group of (−)-D888 (Fig.5 A). It will be of interest to determine how other structurally related phenylalkylamines of differing affinity interact with these components of the high affinity phenylalkylamine receptor site. As we have shown in the preceding paper (33Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18752-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), mutation of specific amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 greatly reduce the affinity of the l-type Ca2+ channel for the dihydropyridine PN200-110 as measured by equilibrium binding. The results of mutations in IIIS6 and IVS6 on block by (−)-D888 and binding of PN200-110 are summarized in Fig.5 B. It is clear that the binding sites for these structurally distinct molecules are intricately interwoven, because single mutations at three residues in adjacent positions in IIIS6 and IVS6 (Tyr1152, Ile1153, and Tyr1463) disrupted both DHP 2The abbreviation used is: DHP, dihydropyridine. binding and (−)-D888 block. However, mutations at other positions had drug-specific effects. For example, mutation of Phe1164, Val1165, Ala1467, and Ile1470affected block by (−)-D888 but did not significantly affect PN200-110 binding. Conversely, mutations of five amino acids in the central region of IIIS6 (Ile1156, Phe1158, Phe1159, Met1160, and Met1161) as well as four amino acids in IVS6 (Phe1462, Met1464, Ile1471, and Asn1472) each had significant effects on DHP binding but not on (−)-D888 block. We therefore suggest that the phenylalkylamines and DHPs bind to different faces of the IIIS6 and IVS6 transmembrane segments and in some cases bind to opposite sides of the same amino acid residues. In this model, the allosteric interactions between bound phenylalkylamines and DHPs would take place over very short distances, possibly separated by no more than the plane of a phenyl ring or the width of an aliphatic side chain."

We investigated in this study the guanine nucleotide-releasing activities of Ras-GRF, mSos, and C3G toward R-Ras, which shows high sequence similarity to Ras. Ras-GRF markedly stimulated the dissociation of GDP from R-Ras, and C3G also promoted the release of R-Ras-bound GDP. Under the same conditions, mSos little affected the reaction. When Ras-GRF and R-Ras were coexpressed in COS7 cells, the remarkable accumulation of the active GTP-bound form of R-Ras was observed. C3G also increased active R-Ras in COS7 cells, while mSos did not give any effect. These results indicated that Ras-GRF and C3G could activate R-Ras. Furthermore, the activation of R-Ras by Ras-GRF was enhanced when cells were treated with ionomycin, which is known to increase the intracellular calcium concentration. The examination of tissue distribution of R-Ras, Ras-GRF, and mSos by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that Ras-GRF was expressed only in brain and testis, whereas R-Ras, C3G, and mSos were expressed rather ubiquitously. These findings raise the possibility that R-Ras is activated by Ras-GRF in brain and testis, and by C3G in other tissues, respectively.

R-Ras was isolated by low stringency hybridization with the v-Ha-ras gene as a probe (1Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of R-Ras shows a 55% sequence identity with that of Ras and has an amino-terminal extension of 26 residues. The GTP-binding domains and the effector domain are well conserved between R-Ras and Ras. The function of Ras has been intensively investigated, which revealed that Ras transduces signals from receptor-type tyrosine kinases to downstream effectors and thereby controls the proliferation and the differentiation of various types of cells (2Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the close resemblance in structure to Ras, the biological function of R-Ras has not been characterized extensively. Ras recycles between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound forms (2Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GDP-bound form is converted to the active form by guanine nucleotide-releasing factors (GRFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GRF, guanine nucleotide-releasing factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: GRF, guanine nucleotide-releasing factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form is converted to the inactive form by the intrinsic GTPase activity, which is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), p120GAP, neurofibromin, and Gap1m (5Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 6Maekawa M. Li S. Iwamatsu A. Morishita T. Yokota K. Imai Y. Kohsaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6879-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast to activated Ras, the activated form of R-Ras does not transform Rat1 fibroblastic cells (1Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rey et al. (7Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar) stated that R-Ras did not induce DNA synthesis in Swiss3T3 cells or the differentiation of PC12 cells. However, two further reports demonstrated that activated R-Ras transforms NIH3T3 cells and the transformant forms tumors in athymic nude mice (8Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J.

Since the putative effector domain of R-Ras is highly homologous to that of Ras, R-Ras binds to c-Raf-1 kinase and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leading to the induction of c-fos (7Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar,8Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 10Spaargaren M.

Besides the roles in the stimulation of the proliferation of cells, R-Ras may play roles in some cell biological processes other than those of Ras. It was described that the carboxyl-terminal domain of R-Ras interacts with Bcl-2, which is a key molecule in the control of apoptosis, in a GTP-independent manner (11Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The activated form of R-Ras promotes apoptotic cell death induced by growth factor deprivation through a Bcl-2 suppressible mechanism (12Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (13Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) stated that the active form of R-Ras stimulates cell adhesion through the activation of integrins. Following the identification of Ras-GRF and mSos as mammalian GRFs for Ras, we isolated C3G as a Crk SH3-binding GRF (14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). C3G has a sequence similarity to the catalytic domains of Ras-GRF and mSos. The fact that C3G complemented a temperature-sensitive mutation ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae CDC25 gene indicates that C3G can activate RAS in budding yeast cells (14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, additional biochemical and cell biological analyses revealed that C3G activates Rap1 much more efficiently than does Ras (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y.

Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); however, a GRF specific to R-Ras has not yet been identified. Considering the high sequence similarity between Ras and R-Ras, we examined the effects of the known GRFs for the Ras family proteins, Ras-GRF, mSos, and C3G on the guanine nucleotide release from R-Ras. The results described in this study indicate that Ras-GRF and C3G can stimulate the nucleotide exchange of R-Ras and raise the possibility that these factors may be activators for R-Ras.

The cDNA of the carboxyl-terminal region of Ras-GRF was amplified by PCR with primers Ras-GRF-5′ (5′-GGCAAGCTTGTGTCATCAGAT-3′) and Ras-GRF-3′ (5′-GGCTCTAGATGTGGGGAGTTTTGG-3′). In the product, Ras-GRF-C term, the authentic termination codon of Ras-GRF was replaced with anXbaI site, to which the CAAX box sequence amplified as described above was fused. A HindIII-EcoRI fragment of the fused sequence covering the carboxyl-terminal region of Ras-GRF with the CAAX box was used to replace the corresponding part of pCAGGS-Ras-GRF to generate pCAGGS-Ras-GRF-F (F stands for farnesylation signal). pCAGGS-mSos, pCAGGS-mSos-F, pCAGGS-C3G, and pCAGGS-C3G-F, which express mSos and C3G with or without the farnesylation signal, were described previously (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF and C3G proteins for in vitro experiments were described previously (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of mSos (22Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using a primer mSos-N (5′-GGCATCGATCAGCTGAAGAGAAAAAC-3′), corresponding to amino acid residues 559–565 with an artificial ClaI site, and a primer mSos-C (5′-TCCTCGGTCTTGGATTTGATT-3′), corresponding to amino acids 1070–1077 with an artificial NotI site. An amplified mSos fragment was ligated toClaI/NotI-digested pEBG, to yield pEBG-mSos. To obtain a mSos protein, 1 μg of pEBG-mSos was introduced into COS7 cells (1.0 × 106 cells per 100-mm diameter dish) that had been cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 48 h, the cells from six dishes were harvested and suspended in 500 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain and disrupted by freezing and thawing. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved and used as the mSos protein. The pEBG vector was similarly transfected into COS7 cells, and the lysate was used as a control. The sequences of all the amplified fragments described above were confirmed after subcloning the fragments into pUC18. The nucleotide exchange reaction was carried out as described previously (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of a reaction buffer containing 2.0 pmol of each low molecular weight GTP-binding protein-[3H]GDP complex, an appropriate amount of GRF, and an excess amount of nonradioactive GTP were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The activities of exchange factors were measured as a decrease in the amount of GTP-binding protein-[3H]GDP complex, which was quantitated by the nitrocellulose filter method. [3H]GDP bindings to Ras family proteins were 0.5–0.6 pmol/pmol of protein. COS7 cells (1.5 × 105 per 35-mm diameter dish) were transfected with the various combinations of expression vectors for Ha-Ras, R-Ras, and GRFs (0.3 μg) (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). After 48 h, guanine nucleotides bound to Ha-Ras or R-Ras were analyzed as described previously (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with 0.05 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Corp.) in a serum-free medium for 4 h, then the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer. Ras was immunoprecipitated by Y13-259 anti-Ras monoclonal antibody, and GST-R-Ras was recovered by using glutathione-Sepharose. Guanine nucleotides bound to Ras and R-Ras were separated by polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography and quantitated by the BAS 2000 system (FUJI Film, Tokyo). The treatment of cells with ionomycin was carried out as described by Farnsworth et al. (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Thirty-two hours after transfection of the plasmids, cells were incubated in a serum-free medium for 12 h and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. Cells were treated with 10 μm ionomycin for 5 min, then R-Ras-bound nucleotides were analyzed. mRNA from various mouse organs (0.5 μg) was reverse transcribed by using SuperScriptII (TAKARA Co. Ltd.). The cDNA concentration was normalized by β-actin mRNA content measured by quantitative PCR. PCR was carried out with 25 μl of a solution containing 20 pmol each of sense and antisense primers, 2.5 nmol of dNTP, 0.5 μl of cDNA solution, and 1.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Boheringer Mannheim). The thermal cycling profile for R-Ras, Ras-GRF, and mSos was 95 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. For β-actin, the annealing temperature was 58 °C. The number of cycles for β-actin, R-Ras, Ras-GRF, and mSos were 25, 27, 30, and 30 respectively. Oligonucleotide primers used were β-actin, sense 5′-TGCCCATCTACGAGGCT-3′, antisense 5′-TAGAAGCACTTGCGGTGC-3′; R-Ras, sense 5′-GCCATCCAGTTCATCCAGTCCTA-3′, antisense 5′-GCCTTCTTCCTGGGAGCACTAGGT-3′; mSos, sense 5′-CCCTGAGTGCAGAGCTGAAGA-3′, antisense 5′-GCCGGACACCATTGAAGTTC-3′; Ras-GRF, sense 5′-GGCCAACACAGGCTTTTCCTCTGAC-3′, antisense 5′-GGCGCTGCGGTTGATGGAGGAGGT-3′. The products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, and the gels were stained with SYBER Green I (Molecular Probes). The intensity of each band was quantitated by Fluoroimager (Molecular Dynamics Co. Ltd.). We measured the substrate specificity of Ras-GRF by using various Ras family proteins. As expected Ras-GRF stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ha-Ras and N-Ras in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1,left). Ras-GRF also stimulated the dissociation of GDP from R-Ras. We previously reported that Ras-GRF did not stimulate the release of GDP from RalA, Rab3A, or RhoA (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We next examined the substrate specificity of mSos, another GRF for Ras. Under the same conditions, mSos stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ha-Ras and N-Ras, but not from R-Ras in vitro (Fig. 1,middle), which confirmed the previous result by Buday and Downward (25Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Ras-GRF promotes the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of R-Ras. Recently, we showed that C3G, a Crk SH3 domain-binding GRF, having a sequence similarity to mSos and Ras-GRF, is a GRF for Rap1 (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Then we examined the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G for R-Ras. As previously reported, C3G effectively activated Rap1B while it slightly activated Ha-Ras and N-Ras. When R-Ras was used as a substrate, the activity was intermediate between Ras and Rap1 (Fig. 1, right). This result shows that C3G also has a guanine nucleotide exchange activity for R-Ras. The time courses of GDP release from R-Ras and Ha-Ras were measured in the presence or absence of Ras-GRF (Fig. 2). The spontaneous dissociation of GDP from R-Ras proceeded rather faster than that from Ha-Ras. Ras-GRF accelerated the GDP release from both small GTPases.Figure 1The effects of GRFs on the nucleotide exchange reactions of Ras family proteins. The effects of Ras-GRF (left), mSos (middle), and C3G (right) proteins on the nucleotide exchange reactions of Ras family proteins were examined, using 100 nm of R-Ras·[3H]GDP (○), Ha-Ras·[3H]GDP (•), N-Ras·[3H]GDP (□), and Rap1B·[3H]GDP (♦) as the substrates. [3H]GDP bindings to Ras family proteins were 0.5–0.6 pmol/pmol of protein. Samples with indicated amounts of each GRF were incubate at 30 °C for 20 min. The values obtained with samples without GRFs were taken as 100%, and the results are shown in relative percentages. The typical result of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2The effect of Ras-GRF on the kinetics of GDP release from R-Ras and Ha-Ras. R-Ras·[3H]GDP (100 nm (left) or Ha-Ras·[3H]GDP (100 nm (right) was incubated for the times indicated in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 100 nm Ras-GRF, and the amount of the remaining R-Ras·[3H]GDP or Ha-Ras·[3H]GDP was measured as in the legend to Fig. 1. The value obtained with the sample without Ras-GRF kept on ice was taken as 100%, and the values are expressed as relative percentages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether Ras-GRF and C3G activate R-Ras in intact COS7 cells. A mammalian GST-fusion R-Ras expression vector was introduced into COS7 cells and guanine nucleotides bound to R-Ras were examined (Fig.3, A and B). When R-Ras and a control vector pCAGGS were introduced, the relative amount of GTP-bound form was 10% of the total R-Ras. We then examined the effects of mSos, Ras-GRF, and C3G with or without the farnesylation signal of c-Ki-ras2 (CAAX box) on the activation of R-Ras. When R-Ras was expressed with Ras-GRF or Ras-GRF-F (with a farnesylation signal), the ratio of the GTP-bound form of R-Ras greatly increased. Ras-GRF and Ras-GRF-F showed similar effects in the accumulation of the GTP-bound form of R-Ras. C3G and C3G-F also increased the GTP-bound form of R-Ras. Under the same conditions, mSos and mSos-F marginally increased the proportion of the GTP-bound form of R-Ras. The effects of Ras-GRF, mSos, and C3G on the activation of Ha-Ras in COS7 cells were also examined. The basal level of the GTP-bound form was less than 5% of the total Ras. In this analysis, the Ras-GRF and mSos activation of Ras was stronger than that of C3G (Fig.4). These results demonstrate that Ras-GRF and C3G activate R-Ras as well as Ras in intact COS7 cells, while mSos activates Ha-Ras but not R-Ras. Recently Farnsworth et al. (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) showed that the ability of Ras-GRF to activate Ras in vivo is markedly enhanced by a raised Ca2+ concentration. Hence we next investigated whether the activation of R-Ras by Ras-GRF was also enhanced by the increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium (Fig. 5). When ionomycin was added to COS7 cells expressing GST-R-Ras and Ras-GRF, the GTP-bound form of R-Ras further increased. This result indicated that the activity of Ras-GRF toward R-Ras is also up-regulated by intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Previous study showed that Ras-GRF is highly expressed in the brain (26Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Our results implicate that Ras-GRF and C3G can regulate R-Ras. Then we analyzed the expression level of R-Ras, Ras-GRF, and mSos in each organ by using the reverse transcribed PCR method. As shown in Fig. 6, Ras-GRF was expressed abundantly in brain and moderately in testis. In contrast to the restricted expression of Ras-GRF, R-Ras and mSos were ubiquitously expressed in all the organs examined. We previously showed that C3G is also ubiquitously expressed in all organs (14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Ras-GRF and C3G may act as GRFs for R-Ras in brain and testis, and in many tissues, respectively. Genetic and biochemical studies established that CDC25 and Sos, and their counterparts in mammalian cells, are GRFs for Ras proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For Ral and Rap1, RalGDS (16Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and C3G (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) have been identified as GRFs, respectively. However, a GRF for R-Ras has not yet been described. In the present study, we demonstrated that both Ras-GRF and C3G can activate R-Ras. While Ras-GRF is expressed only in brain and testis, R-Ras and C3G are widely expressed in all the tissues examined (Fig. 6) (9Saez R. Chan A.M. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2977-2982PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 26Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recently, GRF2, the amino acid sequence of which is 80% identical to that of Ras-GRF, was identified (27Fam N.P. Fan W.-T. Wang Z. Zhang L.-J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GRF2 is widely expressed in various tissues and has GRF activity for Ras (27Fam N.P. Fan W.-T. Wang Z. Zhang L.-J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Considering the high sequence similarity between Ras-GRF and GRF2, it is highly likely that GRF2 also acts on R-Ras as a GRF. Thus it is conceivable that R-Ras may be activated by Ras-GRF in brain and testis, and by C3G and GRF2 in various tissues. However, this does not exclude the presence of R-Ras-specific GRFs yet to be discovered. Huff et al. (28Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) described that the coexpression of known Ras activators with R-Ras did not stimulate the transforming and the transactivating activities of R-Ras. Based on these results they argued that mSos and Ras-GRF are not the activators of R-Ras. However, these activities of R-Ras, even activated by a point mutation analogous to Rasval12, are much weaker than those of activated Ras (8Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar). When the wild type R-Ras and Ras-GRF are coexpressed, the relative amount of GTP-bound form of R-Ras was about 30% (Fig. 3), the value of which may be lower than that expected for the activated R-Ras. Therefore it may be difficult to determine by these rather indirect methods whether the activators of Ras also activate R-Ras. In contrast we demonstrated the activation of R-Ras by directly measuring the ratio of GTP-bound form. The amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of mSos, Ras-GRF, and C3G show about 30% identity with one another (14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, there is a marked difference in their substrate specificities. Both mSos and Ras-GRF activated Ras efficiently. However, while Ras-GRF activated R-Ras as thoroughly as Ras, mSos did not activate R-Ras at all. C3G activated most efficiently Rap1, moderately R-Ras, and rather weakly Ras (this study) (14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sander C. Wittinghofer A. Valencia A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) whose conformation dramatically changes depending on the bound guanine nucleotides, another portion of Ras is obviously necessary for the interaction. Among 17 residues in the switch II region, 12 residues are identical between Ras and R-Ras, whereas 8 residues are conserved between R-Ras and Rap1. This may be the reason why Ras-GRF activates both Ras and R-Ras but not Rap1. Quilliam et al. (35Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Zhong S. Lowry A. Mosteller R.D. Han J. Drugan J.K. Broek D. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. J. Biol.

However, Ras-GRF but not mSos activates R-Ras, demonstrating that there may be still some difference in the structures recognized by the two factors. Nine residues are identical between switch II regions of Ras and Rap1. Although critical residues of Rap1, R-Ras, and Ras for the interaction with C3G are yet to be identified, C3G showed the broadest substrate specificity. Ras-GRF with or without a membrane-targeting signal exhibited similar activities in the stimulation of both Ha-Ras and R-Ras, whereas mSos with the targeting signal showed higher activity than that without the signal in the activation of Ha-Ras (Fig. 4). The difference in the effects of the membrane targeting signal may reflect the difference in the cellular localizations of Ras-GRF and mSos. It has been shown that mSos translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by the adapter proteins, Grb2 and Shc, which causes the activation of Ras (3Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Buchsbaum et al. (37Buchsbaum R. Teliez J.-P. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) stated that Ras-GRF expressed in 293T cells distributes mainly in the particulate fraction, although a close relative of Ras-GRF, GRF2, expressed in the same cells translocates from the cytosol to the membrane periphery when the cells are treated with ionomycin (27Fam N.P. Fan W.-T. Wang Z. Zhang L.-J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activity of Ras-GRF is up-regulated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, and calcium (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 38Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell.

Thus the activities of these Ras activators may be regulated by different mechanisms. The fact that both Ras-GRF and C3G activate two distinct GTP-binding proteins is not surprising considering the high sequence resemblance among Ras family proteins. All the known Ras GAPs, p120GAP, neurofibromin, Gap1m, and R-Ras GAP activate the GTPase activities of both Ras and R-Ras (7Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Despite the close resemblance to Ras, activated Rap1 inhibits GAP activity of p120GAP (40Frech M. John J. Pizon V. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Clark R. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

Although not shown, if activated Rap1 also inhibits other Ras GAP molecules and R-Ras GAP, the activation of Rap1 by C3G would favor the formation of a GTP-bound form of R-Ras. Since the in vitro activation of R-Ras by C3G is rather modest compared with the activation of R-Ras in COS7 cells, this indirect mechanism might work in the cells. It is very intriguing that Ras-GRF and C3G activate R-Ras and Ras, and Rap1 and R-Ras, respectively, since a single stimulus may activate two different signaling pathways. R-Ras promotes apoptotic cell death when interleukin-3 is withdrawn (12Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas the expression of activated form of Ras prevents apoptotic cell death caused by interleukin-3 deprivation (41Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this case Ras and R-Ras cause opposite cell biological effects. In contrast, the activated forms of both R-Ras and Ras induce transformation of a particular fibroblast cell line (8Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 9Saez R. Chan A.M. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2977-2982PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the biological meaning of co-activation of R-Ras and Ras should await further experiments. Similarly, C3G activates Rap1 and R-Ras. Although Rap1 acts antagonistically against Ras function (42Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar), it is not well investigated whether Rap1 and R-Ras interfere with each other in some biological processes. Recently, it has become a consensus that the activation of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins is achieved through the functional activation of GRFs rather than the inhibition of GTPase-activating proteins. For Ras, it has been demonstrated that the signals from receptor-type tyrosine kinases and cytosolic tyrosine kinases are transduced to Ras through the translocation of Sos (3Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The activity of Ras-GRF is up-regulated by serum or lysophosphatidic acid (38Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar) and by the increase in the intracellular calcium concentration (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that a signal from the βγ subunit of trimeric G proteins activates Ras-GRF in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (43Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 may be under the control of tyrosine kinases, since its GRF, C3G, is a Crk-binding protein. Although not yet proven, these signals may also activate R-Ras. We thank Drs. L. A. Feig, A. Wittinghofer, D. Bowtell, Y. Takai, K. Kaibuchi, B. J. Mayer, and J. Miyazaki for materials."

Under physiological conditions Hsp90 has been shown to play a major role in several specific signaling pathways, including maturation of various kinases and maintenance of steroid receptors in an activable state. It is well established that the level of Hsp90 increases severalfold under stress conditions, and it has been shown that the chaperone function of Hsp90 is ATP-independent. Although yeast Hsp90 does not bind ATP, as determined by a number of methods monitoring tight binding, ATP-dependent functions of Hsp90 in the presence of co-factors and elevated temperatures are still under discussion.Here, we have reinvestigated ATP-binding properties and ATPase activity of human Hsp90 under various conditions. We show that human Hsp90 does not bind ATP tightly and does not exhibit detectable ATPase activity. However, using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, weak binding of spin-labeled ATP analogues with half-maximal binding at 400 μm ATP was detected. The functional significance of this weak interaction remains enigmatic. Hsp90 is one of the most abundant proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells.

Under stress conditions, e.g. high temperatures, cells overexpress a distinct set of proteins, the so-called heat shock or stress proteins. The major classes of heat shock proteins, Hsp90, 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; ANP, adenosine nucleotides with an undefined number of phosphoryl groups; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ε-ATP, etheno-ATP; ESR, electron spin resonance; Hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein; IgG, immunoglobulin G; MABA-ADP,N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranyl-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine diphosphate; MABA-ATP,N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranyl-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine triphosphate; MANT-ATP, 3′-O-N-methylanthraniloyl triphosphate; 2′,3′-SL-ATP, 2,3-(2, 2, 5, 5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-1-oxyl-3-carboxylic acid ester)-adenosine triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; ANP, adenosine nucleotides with an undefined number of phosphoryl groups; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ε-ATP, etheno-ATP; ESR, electron spin resonance; Hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein; IgG, immunoglobulin G; MABA-ADP,N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranyl-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine diphosphate; MABA-ATP,N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranyl-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine triphosphate; MANT-ATP, 3′-O-N-methylanthraniloyl triphosphate; 2′,3′-SL-ATP, 2,3-(2, 2, 5, 5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-1-oxyl-3-carboxylic acid ester)-adenosine triphosphate. Hsp70, Hsp60, and small Hsps, are thought to function as molecular chaperones during protein folding (1Morimoto, R. I., Tissie-res, A., and Georgopolous, C. (eds) (1994) Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine, pp. 1-31, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar, 2Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem.

The mechanisms of these chaperone functions are still under intensive investigation. In the case of Hsp70 and Hsp60, ATP binding and hydrolysis is a major requirement in chaperone-mediated folding (1Morimoto, R. I., Tissie-res, A., and Georgopolous, C. (eds) (1994) Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine, pp. 1-31, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). In vivo experiments suggest that Hsp90, one of the most abundant and conserved heat shock proteins, is a specific chaperone involved in regulating signal transduction pathways by assisting structural changes of certain kinases and steroid receptors (4Pratt W.B.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 3Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Like other chaperones, Hsp90 performs at least part of its activity in association with specific partner proteins (9Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J.

In this context, the involvement of ATP in Hsp90 function is still a controversial subject (11Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

In contrast to these findings, we have shown that yeast Hsp90 does not bind ATP (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by means of assays that are reflecting structural changes of the observed protein in the presence of ligand, detecting binding of the protein to immobilized ATP or binding of fluorescence-labeled ATP analogues to Hsp90. These observation enabled only the investigation of tight interactions between ATP and Hsp90. New results concerning p23, a partner protein of Hsp90 that is thought to play an important role in Hsp90/steroid receptor complexes, readdressed the possibility that human Hsp90 is an ATP-binding protein (18Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This brought up the question of whether human Hsp90 differs in its ATP-binding properties from yeast Hsp90, assuming that p23 does not bind ATP (Ref. 15Bose S. Weikl T. Bügl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar and see below). In agreement with our previous findings regarding yeast Hsp90 (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we could show that human Hsp90 behaves similarly and does not bind ATP strongly. However, the possibility of weak ATP binding could not be ruled out by the methods used. Therefore, ESR spectroscopy using spin-labeled nucleotides was applied to examine potential low binding affinities of Hsp90 and ATP. This method had successfully been used before to investigate nucleotide binding to enzymes like F1-type ATPases, the chaperone DnaK, as well as the proto-oncogene product p21 ras (24Burgard S. Nett J.H. Sauer H.E. Kagawa Y. Schäfer H.-J. Wise J.G. Vogel P.D. Trommer W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17815-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lösel R.M. Erbse A.H. Nett J.H.

In ESR spectroscopy the signals of the freely tumbling spin-labeled nucleotides are well separated from the signals of the protein-immobilized components and therefore allow direct determination of the free substrate. In addition, ESR spectroscopy enables the evaluation of rather weak interactions of proteins and nucleotides with dissociation constants in the upper micromolar range that are usually not detectable by the more common techniques like fluorescence spectroscopy. We also investigated the effect of molybdate on Hsp90 structure and its interaction with nucleotides, since efficient complex formation between Hsp90 and p23 seems to require apart from ATP the polyanion molybdate (11Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 56: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). About 40 years ago, molybdate was found to inactivate phosphoprotein phosphatases (30Paigen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 388-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, molybdate was used to stabilize glucocorticoid receptors, which were thought to be destabilized by dephosphorylation (31Nielsen C.J. Sando J.J. Vogel W.M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol Chem. 1977; 252: 7568-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After detecting some low molecular weight factors associated with Hsp90, which seem to be important to keep steroid receptors activatable in the absence of hormone, it was suggested that molybdate mimics the effects of these factors (32Meshinchi S. Stancato L.F. Gordon B.M. Jones K.W. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8617-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Bodine P.V.N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Receptor. 1995; 5: 117-122PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that human Hsp90 binds ATP with a K D in almost millimolar range as detected by ESR spectroscopy. While p23 seems to slightly affect this process, no further effect of molybdate on Hsp90 structure and its interaction with p23 and ATP could be determined. Human Hsc70 and human p23 were purified as recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli as described previously (15Bose S. Weikl T. Bügl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 34Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In the case of Hsc70, an additional gel filtration step with Superdex 200 preparatory grade column was introduced. Murine BiP was purified as described previously (35Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Hsp90 was purified from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells, kindly provided by the Colorado Cancer Center. 48 h after infection, a crude cell extract was prepared by gentle pottering. The soluble fraction was loaded onto Q-Sepharose and eluted with a 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient. The appropriate fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column. Elution of bound Hsp90 was achieved using a 200–400 mm potassium phosphate gradient at pH 6.8. Finally, gel filtration chromatography with Superdex 200 preparatory grade was performed. The protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients calculated from the known contents of aromatic amino acids (36Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients used are 0.74 for human Hsp90, 0.40 for murine BiP, 0.51 for human Hsc70, and 1.96 for human p23 for a 0.1% solution at 280 nm and 1 cm path length. C8-ATP-agarose and sodium molybdate were from Sigma, [α-32P]ATP from Hartmann Analytics, and ATP from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose was obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. Nucleotides were analyzed by reverse phase chromatography with a 2-ml C18 column (Bishop) as described previously (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Binding to immobilized ATP was performed essentially as described previously (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 1 ml of ATP-agarose was equilibrated in buffer A (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2) in a batch procedure. 200 μg of each protein were added to the equilibrated ATP-agarose together with 5 mg of IgG, to prevent unspecific binding, and rotated for 1 h at 37 °C or 43 °C. The agarose was washed five times with buffer A (wash 1) and another five times with buffer B (buffer A + 0.5 m KCl, wash 2). Elution of specifically bound proteins was initiated by addition of buffer B supplemented with 5 mm ATP. This procedure was repeated five times. Finally the ATP-agarose was washed with two bed volumes of 7 m urea in buffer A. The samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All gels were silver-stained. ATPase assays were performed as described previously (35Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Kornberg A. Scott J.F. Bertsch L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3298-3304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Hsp90 and BiP were incubated at 37 °C or 43 °C and BSA at 37 °C with 500 μm (final concentration) unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a total volume of 20 μl, containing 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and 2 mm MgCl2. Protein concentrations varied from 0.05 to 0.75 μg/μl. A possible influence of molybdate on ATPase activities was examined in the presence of 10 mmNa2MoO4. The respective proteins were diluted into various concentrations of ATP in buffer C (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) at the concentrations given in the figure legends. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C or 43 °C to achieve equilibrium. Subsequently, fluorescence measurements were performed in 3-mm quartz cuvettes in a Perkin-Elmer MPF 44A luminescence spectrometer at 37 °C or 43 °C. The tryptophan fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 325 nm. The spectral bandwidths were set to 5 nm and 10 nm for excitation and emission respectively. Fluorescence intensities are expressed as the percentage of total protein fluorescence obtained after subtracting the background intensity of the buffer. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence were corrected for the absorption of ATP (inner filter effect) at 295 nm excitation using the formula shown in Equation 1.Fcorr=Fobs×a/1−e−a(witha=2.303×LT×ɛL)Equation 1 F corr is the corrected fluorescence, andF obs is the observed fluorescence after subtracting the background light intensity. L T is the total ATP concentration, and εL is the absorption coefficient of ATP (38Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap B. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To monitor thermal unfolding of human Hsp90, fluorescence measurements were performed in the temperature range from 20 °C to 70 °C in stirred 1-cm quartz cuvettes in a Perkin-Elmer MPF 44A luminescence spectrometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder connected to a thermoprogrammer. Human Hsp90 was diluted into 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8, to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml. The fluorescence of Hsp90 was measured at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 320 nm. The spectral bandwidths were set to 10 and 4 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. The heating rate was 0.5 °C/min. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an SLM Smart 8000 Photon-Counting spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments) at 37 °C or 43 °C. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (25 °C), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithioerythritol. The fluorescent nucleotides were added and mixed manually. All data are volume-corrected averages of 10 readings of 1-s intervals of photon counting. The nucleotide analogues 3′-O-N-methylanthraniloyl triphosphate (MANT-ATP),N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranyl-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine triphosphate (MABA-ATP),N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranyl-aminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine diphosphate (MABA-ADP), and etheno-ATP (ε-ATP) were employed to analyze binding of adenosine nucleotides to Hsp90 and BiP. The concentrations used were 0.4 μm each of the triphosphate nucleotides, 0.2 μm each of the diphosphate nucleotides, and up to 2.5 μm each of the selected proteins. In the case of co-incubation of Hsp90 and p23, 0.56 μm MABA-ATP were used. The emission wavelengths of ε-ATP, MABA-ATP/MABA-ADP, and MANT-ATP were 410, 427, and 440 nm, and the according excitation wavelengths were 300, 340, and 360 nm, respectively. For competition experiments 1 mm unlabeled ATP/ADP, in the case of Hsp90/p23 co-incubation 1.7 mm unlabeled ATP, was added to the respective protein ATP/ADP analogue incubation reaction and the fluorescence was monitored. ESR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300E spectrophotometer operating in the X-band mode. The resonance cavity used was a TE102 (ER 4102 ST). The experiments were performed at 19 °C in micro-flat cells with a total volume of 40 or 50 μl. The solutions were mixed using a platinum wire. The spectra were recorded at 6.3-milliwatt microwave power and a peak to peak modulation amplitude of 1 G. Protein and spin-label concentrations for ESR spectra are given in the figure legends. The nucleotide analogue 2′,3′-SL-ATP was prepared as described previously (39Streckenbach B. Schwarz D. Repke K.H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The amount of protein-bound 2′,3′-SL-ATP was determined as the difference between the known amounts of total spin-labeled nucleotides added and the directly measured free spin-labeled nucleotides (the signal amplitude of the freely tumbling, not enzyme-bound radicals is directly proportional to their concentration). To avoid chemical reduction of the spin labels, thiol components such as dithioerythritol were removed prior to the experiments. Recombinant human Hsp90 was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography from baculovirus infected SF9 cells. The purified protein was free of bound nucleotides according to HPLC analysis (data not shown). Previous reports suggested that isolated Hsp90 may be an ATP-hydrolyzing protein (22Nadeau K. Sullivan M.A. Bradley M. Engman D.M. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our attempts failed to detect ATPase activity in highly purified bovine Hsp90 preparations (41Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7414-7421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the observed low ATPase activities of purified yeast Hsp90 may be due to impurities such as kinases (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or they may be caused by ATP/GTPases associated with Hsp90 (42Nardai G. Schnaider T. Soti C. Ryan M.T. Hoj P.B. Somogyi J. Csermely P. J. Biosci. 1996; 21: 179-190Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous results, human Hsp90 did not exhibit detectable ATPase activity at 37 °C (Table I). Furthermore, no ATPase activity of its partner protein p23 could be detected (Table I). Next, we checked the influence of heat shock temperatures on ATPase activity. For BiP, a temperature shift from 37 °C to 43 °C yielded a 3.5-fold increase in ATPase activity (Table I). However, no significant change in the ATPase activity of Hsp90 could be detected upon an increase of the temperature (Table I). Molybdate alone showed a slight increase in ATPase activity (data not shown), which might be due to hydrolysis of ATP by molybdate (43Walter U. Experientia ( Basel ). 1981; 37: 1263-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, in our assays no significant influence of molybdate on the ATPase activities of BiP, and Hsp90, could be observed (Table I). Since Hsp90/p23 interaction is supposed to be ATP-dependent (12Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13Johnson J.L. Corbisier R.

ATPase activities were measured in the absence or the presence of 10 mm sodium molybdate. ND, not determined. Previously, we had reported that addition of ATP to yeast Hsp90 does not significantly alter the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We readdressed this question by comparing the influence of ATP on the intrinsic fluorescence of human and yeast Hsp90 with well known ATP-binding proteins like human Hsc70 and murine BiP; BSA, which binds ATP with a K D between 50 and 100 μm(44Bauer M. Baumann J. Trommer W.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); and the non-ATP-binding protein IgG at physiological and heat shock temperatures. We detected a slight decrease in tryptophan fluorescence of human and yeast Hsp90 with increasing ATP concentrations, but similar effects of ATP were also observed for IgG and a tryptophan solution (Fig. 1). BSA, as a weak ATP-binding control, showed a higher decrease in fluorescence with increasing amounts of ATP compared with Hsp90 or IgG. For the tight ATP-binding proteins Hsc70 and BiP, a significant effect of ATP on the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon binding was observed (Fig. 1). Switching the temperature to 43 °C did not change the general fluorescence patterns of all proteins tested (data not shown). These findings led to the conclusion that ATP does not influence the intrinsic fluorescence of Hsp90. Because binding of ATP does not necessarily lead to changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins, we performed experiments with fluorescence-labeled ATP analogues to monitor binding directly. Here, specific binding results in fluorescence changes of the label, which can be reversed by competing with unlabeled ATP. Increasing amounts of Hsp90 were incubated with a fixed quantity of the ligand and the fluorescence emission was recorded. The experiments performed at 37 °C and 43 °C demonstrated a slight increase in fluorescence of the nucleotide analogues MABA-ATP, MANT-ATP, and ε-ATP, when up to 2.5 μm Hsp90 were added (Fig.2 A and data not shown). However, this increase was due to an unspecific effect of the labeled ATP analogues, because the reaction could not be competed with unlabeled ATP (Fig.2 A and data not shown). In contrast, control experiments with murine BiP showed that the fluorescence of MABA-ADP increased significantly compared with the experiment with Hsp90 (Fig. 2,A and B, inset). In this case, bound MABA-ADP could be removed from BiP by competing with increasing amounts of unlabeled ADP (Fig. 2 B) with a calculated dissociation constant of 0.38 ± 0.12 μm. This value is similar to measurements performed with DnaK, a Hsc70 analogue from E. coli (45Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We also tested p23 for ATP binding, but we failed to detect binding to p23 or Hsp90 and p23 together using MABA-ATP (Fig.2 C) or the other analogues (data not shown). The presence of 20 mm sodium molybdate did not change the ATP-binding properties of all proteins tested (data not shown). Another method to detect the association of proteins with nucleotides is binding to immobilized ATP. In this experiment the addition of IgG was necessary to prevent unspecific interaction of Hsp90 with the agarose matrix. Previously it was shown that IgG has no influence on the specific binding of the control protein Hsc70 (17Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Elution of the bound proteins was induced by addition of ATP after extensive salt washes. Specific binding of Hsc70 to immobilized ATP could be observed at 37 °C (data not shown) and at 43 °C (Fig.3 A), while binding of Hsp90 could not be detected at both temperatures (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Again, addition of sodium molybdate did not alter"

Membrane vesicles made from the outer membrane of Escherichia colistrains expressing only OmpC or OmpF were reconstituted into liposomes probed by patch clamp. The channel activity was recorded in control solutions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of a specific polyamine. In all cases, concentration- and voltage-dependent inhibitory effects were observed. They include both the suppression of channel openings and the enhancement of channel closures as well as the promotion of blocked or inactivated states. OmpF and OmpC, although highly homologous, have distinct sensitivities to modulation, especially by spermine. This compound inhibits OmpF in the nanomolar range, which is in agreement with its potency on eukaryotic channels. Putrescine was the least effective (upper millimolar range) and also had inhibitory effects qualitatively distinct from those exerted by the other polyamines. The compounds appear to bind to at least two distinct binding sites, one of which resides within the pore. The potencies to this site are lower when the polyamines are applied from the extracellular side than from the periplasmic side, suggesting an asymmetric binding site.

Polyamines are a class of naturally occurring polycationic molecules produced through complex pathways involving decarboxylations of ornithine, arginine, or lysine (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most ubiquitous are spermine, spermidine, cadaverine and putrescine. With the exception of spermine, which is associated exclusively with eukaryotes, the other three are endogenous to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell types. Polyamines have been implicated in a wide range of biological phenomena (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing forms of polyamine action is the recently discovered modulation of ion channels of heart, muscles, and neurons (3Lopatin A. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G.

Mayer M.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).The cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli cells is surrounded by an additional external membrane, the outer membrane, whose outer leaflet is made of highly negatively charged lipopolysaccharides. Polyamines are associated with the outer membrane of E. coli, possibly through their interactions with the lipopolysaccharides (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although polyamines have not been measured directly in the periplasmic space between the outer and cytoplasmic membranes, they are likely to accumulate in this compartment during their synthesis and transport (12Buch J.K. Boyle S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 522-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kashiwagi K. Pistocchi R. Shibuya S. Sugiyama S. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An arginine decarboxylase involved in the production of putrescine is located in the inner periplasmic space (12Buch J.K. Boyle S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 522-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a lysine-cadaverine exchanger of the cytoplasmic membrane participates in the extrusion of cadaverine (13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, polyamines appear to reside in the vicinity of the major pore-forming proteins of the outer membrane, the porins. Porins are trimeric channels characterized extensively at the biochemical, structural, and genetic levels (15Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella-Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 29-47Google Scholar). They are the only ion channels whose structure is known at atomic resolution (16Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Each monomer is a 16 β-stranded barrel with a pore that allows the passage of water-soluble compounds of molecular mass up to 600 Da. Two major porins, OmpC and OmpF, are slightly cation-selective and share a high degree of homology with each other (∼60%).Porins are traditionally believed to be permanently open pores. Playing the main role of molecular filter, they are largely responsible for the overall permeability of the outer membrane. However, the regulation of porin function by potentially physiologically relevant factors is still poorly understood. We showed recently that polyamines inhibit chemotaxis and flux of β-lactam antibiotics through porins and thus decrease the permeability of the outer membrane (17delaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In electrophysiological experiments, we also demonstrated that cadaverine induces closures of porins (18delaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This study was limited to the investigation of a single polyamine on heterotrimers of OmpF and OmpC. In this report, we have extended our investigations to the modulation of homotrimers of OmpF or OmpC by all four polyamines (spermine, spermidine, cadaverine, and putrescine) and showed that the effects are complex. In conjunction with our previous work on polyamine inhibition of site-directed OmpC mutants (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), the present study allows us to present a model for the possible molecular interactions between porins and polyamines.DISCUSSIONPolyamines have recently been discovered to regulate the activity of eukaryotic channels (3Lopatin A. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 4Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M.

Mayer M.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that this role can be extended to prokaryotic channels, since polyamines effectively inhibit homotrimers of the E. colimajor porins, OmpC and OmpF. The potencies of the compounds on porins are similar to those found with eukaryotic channels, but the molecular mechanisms of inhibition appear very different. In the case of porins, the potency follows the series: spermine > spermidine > cadaverine > putrescine. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, spermine is an effective compound eliciting inhibition of channels even at submicromolar concentrations. The estimated concentration of free spermine in eukaryotic cells is on the order of a few tens of micromolar, high enough for this compound to play a role as natural regulator of some channels (27Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, spermine is not synthesized by bacteria (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) and thus is not an endogenous modulator of channels in this system. This is not the case for the other three polyamines investigated. The calculated whole cell concentrations range from ∼0.05 to 10 mm for spermidine (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and are on the order of 10–50 mm for cadaverine and putrescine (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These values are within the effective range for porin modulation (Fig.3). Although not known, the periplasmic concentrations of polyamines may be higher because of the presence in the cell envelope of enzymes and transporters involved in their synthesis and export (12Buch J.K. Boyle S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 522-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyamines also seemingly associate with the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could reach high amounts in the vicinity of the porins. In addition, the excretion of cellular putrescine is promoted by a sudden increase in medium osmolarity (29Munro G.F. Hercules K. Morgan J. Sauerbier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1272-1280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that of cadaverine is induced by a drop in external pH or oxygen tension (13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the changes in polyamine concentrations in the cell envelope in response to environmental conditions may influence the activity state of porins and provide an avenue for modulation of outer membrane permeability. The modulation of porins by polyamines would then constitute a physiologically relevant phenomenon, in particular in stressful situations. Preliminary experiments suggest that β-lactam fluxes through porins are indeed inhibited when cells are grown at low pH, a condition of increased cadaverine synthesis. 2H. Samartzidou and A. H. Delcour, unpublished data. The inhibition of porin channels by compounds in the submillimolar range has not been shown previously. At this point, it is not clear whether the higher potency of spermine with respect to other polyamines is the result of its longer chain or its increased positive charge. Molecular length may be a determinant factor, since cadaverine shows a slightly higher potency that the shorter, but still divalent, putrescine. But ionic interactions between porins and polyamines also play an important role, as evidenced by the voltage and pH dependence of inhibition (18delaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The replacement of aspartate residues on the L3 loop of OmpC by glutamines yields channels with severely compromised modulation by polyamine (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). The involvement of acidic residues has also been demonstrated in polyamine binding to eukaryotic channels (3Lopatin A. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar,4Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and in the association of biogenic amines with their receptors (33Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that polyamines plug the long K+-selective pore of heart inward rectifier channels by binding to multiple sequential sites (34Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 923-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The overall effect is that of a voltage-dependent block. We propose that the molecular mechanism for inhibition of porins is different. In patches containing a few channels, open channel block typically leads to one of the following three patterns, depending on the relative residence time of the drug inside the channel with respect to the channel's intrinsic gating kinetics (25Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). In mechanism 1, slowly dissociating blockers lead to a quasi-irreversible loss in the number of channels. In mechanism 2, fast dissociating blockers leave the total number of active channels in the patch intact but decrease the single channel conductance. In mechanism 3, blockers with intermediate dissociation kinetics lead to bursts of fast flickering activity. The most consistently observed behavior of porins in the presence of polyamines does not include a reduced single channel conductance or fast flickering activity, ruling out mechanisms 2 and 3. Bursts of flickering activity have been seen rarely, and slight decreases (<20%) in single channel conductance are only observed occasionally at high polyamine concentrations (mostly in the case of spermidine). But the observed increased closing frequency and prolonged closed times of the modulated channels are indicative of an effect of the polyamines on the intrinsic rate constants controlling channel opening and closure. In addition, the channels remain highly cooperative: simultaneous closing (followed by simultaneous reopening) of a large number of channels is observed frequently and is unlikely to represent the block and unblock of many channels at exactly the same time. The suppression of openings from a population of mostly closed channels would also not be expected in an open channel block mechanism. Therefore, we propose that the main mechanism for modulation of porin channels involves an alteration in the intrinsic rate constants for gating, leading to stabilized closed states.We cannot rule out that block by a slowly dissociating molecule (mechanism 1) is responsible for the instantaneous loss of channels after polyamine perfusion. Such a mechanism would require that the polyamine binds with very high affinity to the open channel. Loss of channels is seen even in the presence of cadaverine and putrescine, which both have low binding affinities. This effect still occurs in the L3 mutants that have lost the modulation of closing kinetics, 3N. Liu and A. H. Delcour, unpublished data. indicating that it does not necessitate negative residues present inside the pore. This result would be surprising if open channel block did take place. For these reasons, we believe that the polyamine-induced instantaneous channel loss is more likely to be caused by the rapid inactivation of some channels.At this point, the simplest mechanism that is supported by all of our data is that polyamines exert allosteric effects on kinetic rate constants such that closed states are stabilized. Allosteric mechanisms are also proposed for the N-methyl-d-aspartate and acetylcholine receptors (6Johnson T.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Jayaraman V. Ponasik J. Ganem B. Usherwood P.N.R. Hess G.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 334Google Scholar). A related phenomenon was described for the modulation of mitochondrial VDAC channels by polyanions (35Mangan A.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this case, the accumulation of impermeant and highly charged compounds in the channel mouth was held responsible for the increased voltage dependence of closure. We do not believe that such an unspecific effect is responsible for polyamine modulation of porins because the extent of inhibition is clearly dependent on the site of application of the chemicals. This asymmetry, the difference in sensitivity between the two homologous porins, and the high potency of spermine are suggestive of specific binding. The lack of effect of cadaverine from the pipette side is not surprising, considering that this compound is already much less potent than spermine when bath-applied.What is the potential location of the binding site(s)? From our previous work with mutants (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar) and the experiments presented here, we propose the following. The increased closing kinetics observed from a population of predominantly open channels is controlled by binding of the polyamines to an asymmetric site within the pore that in OmpC involves Asp-105 and Asp-118 (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), but not Glu-109. 4N. Liu and A. H.Delcour, manuscript in preparation. Access to this site is possible from both periplasmic and extracellular sides, but potency is higher from the periplasmic side. The suppression of openings from predominantly closed channels is due to polyamine binding to a different site because (i) it is not affected by mutations on the L3 loop (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), and (ii) it is not induced by spermine binding to OmpF even while a strong modulation of closing kinetics is taking place. Polyamines can access this site from both membrane sides, and thus, although not affected by the mutations at Asp-105 and Asp-118, the site may also reside within the pore. Finally, the instantaneous loss of channels might involve binding to yet a third site, since it is not affected by mutations on the L3 loop. Several binding sites would not be surprising on channels that can occupy multiple conformational states (23Delcour A.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 115-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This working hypothesis awaits further confirmation through conventional binding measurements and the isolation and characterization of additional mutants. Polyamines are a class of naturally occurring polycationic molecules produced through complex pathways involving decarboxylations of ornithine, arginine, or lysine (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most ubiquitous are spermine, spermidine, cadaverine and putrescine. With the exception of spermine, which is associated exclusively with eukaryotes, the other three are endogenous to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell types. Polyamines have been implicated in a wide range of biological phenomena (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing forms of polyamine action is the recently discovered modulation of ion channels of heart, muscles, and neurons (3Lopatin A. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G.

Mayer M.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli cells is surrounded by an additional external membrane, the outer membrane, whose outer leaflet is made of highly negatively charged lipopolysaccharides. Polyamines are associated with the outer membrane of E. coli, possibly through their interactions with the lipopolysaccharides (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although polyamines have not been measured directly in the periplasmic space between the outer and cytoplasmic membranes, they are likely to accumulate in this compartment during their synthesis and transport (12Buch J.K. Boyle S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 522-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kashiwagi K. Pistocchi R. Shibuya S. Sugiyama S. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An arginine decarboxylase involved in the production of putrescine is located in the inner periplasmic space (12Buch J.K. Boyle S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 522-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a lysine-cadaverine exchanger of the cytoplasmic membrane participates in the extrusion of cadaverine (13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, polyamines appear to reside in the vicinity of the major pore-forming proteins of the outer membrane, the porins. Porins are trimeric channels characterized extensively at the biochemical, structural, and genetic levels (15Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella-Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 29-47Google Scholar). They are the only ion channels whose structure is known at atomic resolution (16Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Each monomer is a 16 β-stranded barrel with a pore that allows the passage of water-soluble compounds of molecular mass up to 600 Da. Two major porins, OmpC and OmpF, are slightly cation-selective and share a high degree of homology with each other (∼60%). Porins are traditionally believed to be permanently open pores. Playing the main role of molecular filter, they are largely responsible for the overall permeability of the outer membrane. However, the regulation of porin function by potentially physiologically relevant factors is still poorly understood. We showed recently that polyamines inhibit chemotaxis and flux of β-lactam antibiotics through porins and thus decrease the permeability of the outer membrane (17delaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In electrophysiological experiments, we also demonstrated that cadaverine induces closures of porins (18delaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This study was limited to the investigation of a single polyamine on heterotrimers of OmpF and OmpC. In this report, we have extended our investigations to the modulation of homotrimers of OmpF or OmpC by all four polyamines (spermine, spermidine, cadaverine, and putrescine) and showed that the effects are complex. In conjunction with our previous work on polyamine inhibition of site-directed OmpC mutants (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), the present study allows us to present a model for the possible molecular interactions between porins and polyamines. DISCUSSIONPolyamines have recently been discovered to regulate the activity of eukaryotic channels (3Lopatin A. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 4Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M.

Mayer M.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that this role can be extended to prokaryotic channels, since polyamines effectively inhibit homotrimers of the E. colimajor porins, OmpC and OmpF. The potencies of the compounds on porins are similar to those found with eukaryotic channels, but the molecular mechanisms of inhibition appear very different. In the case of porins, the potency follows the series: spermine > spermidine > cadaverine > putrescine. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, spermine is an effective compound eliciting inhibition of channels even at submicromolar concentrations. The estimated concentration of free spermine in eukaryotic cells is on the order of a few tens of micromolar, high enough for this compound to play a role as natural regulator of some channels (27Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, spermine is not synthesized by bacteria (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) and thus is not an endogenous modulator of channels in this system. This is not the case for the other three polyamines investigated. The calculated whole cell concentrations range from ∼0.05 to 10 mm for spermidine (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and are on the order of 10–50 mm for cadaverine and putrescine (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These values are within the effective range for porin modulation (Fig.3). Although not known, the periplasmic concentrations of polyamines may be higher because of the presence in the cell envelope of enzymes and transporters involved in their synthesis and export (12Buch J.K. Boyle S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 522-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyamines also seemingly associate with the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane (11Koski P. Vaara M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3695-3699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could reach high amounts in the vicinity of the porins. In addition, the excretion of cellular putrescine is promoted by a sudden increase in medium osmolarity (29Munro G.F. Hercules K. Morgan J. Sauerbier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1272-1280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that of cadaverine is induced by a drop in external pH or oxygen tension (13Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the changes in polyamine concentrations in the cell envelope in response to environmental conditions may influence the activity state of porins and provide an avenue for modulation of outer membrane permeability. The modulation of porins by polyamines would then constitute a physiologically relevant phenomenon, in particular in stressful situations. Preliminary experiments suggest that β-lactam fluxes through porins are indeed inhibited when cells are grown at low pH, a condition of increased cadaverine synthesis. 2H. Samartzidou and A. H. Delcour, unpublished data. The inhibition of porin channels by compounds in the submillimolar range has not been shown previously. At this point, it is not clear whether the higher potency of spermine with respect to other polyamines is the result of its longer chain or its increased positive charge. Molecular length may be a determinant factor, since cadaverine shows a slightly higher potency that the shorter, but still divalent, putrescine. But ionic interactions between porins and polyamines also play an important role, as evidenced by the voltage and pH dependence of inhibition (18delaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The replacement of aspartate residues on the L3 loop of OmpC by glutamines yields channels with severely compromised modulation by polyamine (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). The involvement of acidic residues has also been demonstrated in polyamine binding to eukaryotic channels (3Lopatin A. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar,4Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5532-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and in the association of biogenic amines with their receptors (33Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that polyamines plug the long K+-selective pore of heart inward rectifier channels by binding to multiple sequential sites (34Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 923-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The overall effect is that of a voltage-dependent block. We propose that the molecular mechanism for inhibition of porins is different. In patches containing a few channels, open channel block typically leads to one of the following three patterns, depending on the relative residence time of the drug inside the channel with respect to the channel's intrinsic gating kinetics (25Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). In mechanism 1, slowly dissociating blockers lead to a quasi-irreversible loss in the number of channels. In mechanism 2, fast dissociating blockers leave the total number of active channels in the patch intact but decrease the single channel conductance. In mechanism 3, blockers with intermediate dissociation kinetics lead to bursts of fast flickering activity. The most consistently observed behavior of porins in the presence of polyamines does not include a reduced single channel conductance or fast flickering activity, ruling out mechanisms 2 and 3. Bursts of flickering activity have been seen rarely, and slight decreases (<20%) in single channel conductance are only observed occasionally at high polyamine concentrations (mostly in the case of spermidine). But the observed increased closing frequency and prolonged closed times of the modulated channels are indicative of an effect of the polyamines on the intrinsic rate constants controlling channel opening and closure. In addition, the channels remain highly cooperative: simultaneous closing (followed by simultaneous reopening) of a large number of channels is observed frequently and is unlikely to represent the block and unblock of many channels at exactly the same time. The suppression of openings from a population of mostly closed channels would also not be expected in an open channel block mechanism. Therefore, we propose that the main mechanism for modulation of porin channels involves an alteration in the intrinsic rate constants for gating, leading to stabilized closed states.We cannot rule out that block by a slowly dissociating molecule (mechanism 1) is responsible for the instantaneous loss of channels after polyamine perfusion. Such a mechanism would require that the polyamine binds with very high affinity to the open channel. Loss of channels is seen even in the presence of cadaverine and putrescine, which both have low binding affinities. This effect still occurs in the L3 mutants that have lost the modulation of closing kinetics, 3N. Liu and A. H. Delcour, unpublished data. indicating that it does not necessitate negative residues present inside the pore. This result would be surprising if open channel block did take place. For these reasons, we believe that the polyamine-induced instantaneous channel loss is more likely to be caused by the rapid inactivation of some channels.At this point, the simplest mechanism that is supported by all of our data is that polyamines exert allosteric effects on kinetic rate constants such that closed states are stabilized. Allosteric mechanisms are also proposed for the N-methyl-d-aspartate and acetylcholine receptors (6Johnson T.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Jayaraman V. Ponasik J. Ganem B. Usherwood P.N.R. Hess G.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 334Google Scholar). A related phenomenon was described for the modulation of mitochondrial VDAC channels by polyanions (35Mangan A.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this case, the accumulation of impermeant and highly charged compounds in the channel mouth was held responsible for the increased voltage dependence of closure. We do not believe that such an unspecific effect is responsible for polyamine modulation of porins because the extent of inhibition is clearly dependent on the site of application of the chemicals. This asymmetry, the difference in sensitivity between the two homologous porins, and the high potency of spermine are suggestive of specific binding. The lack of effect of cadaverine from the pipette side is not surprising, considering that this compound is already much less potent than spermine when bath-applied.What is the potential location of the binding site(s)? From our previous work with mutants (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar) and the experiments presented here, we propose the following. The increased closing kinetics observed from a population of predominantly open channels is controlled by binding of the polyamines to an asymmetric site within the pore that in OmpC involves Asp-105 and Asp-118 (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), but not Glu-109. 4N. Liu and A. H.Delcour, manuscript in preparation. Access to this site is possible from both periplasmic and extracellular sides, but potency is higher from the periplasmic side. The suppression of openings from predominantly closed channels is due to polyamine binding to a different site because (i) it is not affected by mutations on the L3 loop (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), and (ii) it is not induced by spermine binding to OmpF even while a strong modulation of closing kinetics is taking place. Polyamines can access this site from both membrane sides, and thus, although not affected by the mutations at Asp-105 and Asp-118, the site may also reside within the pore. Finally, the instantaneous loss of channels might involve binding to yet a third site, since it is not affected by mutations on the L3 loop. Several binding sites would not be surprising on channels that can occupy multiple conformational states (23Delcour A.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 115-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This working hypothesis awaits further confirmation through conventional binding measurements and the isolation and characterization of additional mutants.

This effect still occurs in the L3 mutants that have lost the modulation of closing kinetics, 3N. Liu and A. H. Delcour, unpublished data. indicating that it does not necessitate negative residues present inside the pore. This result would be surprising if open channel block did take place. For these reasons, we believe that the polyamine-induced instantaneous channel loss is more likely to be caused by the rapid inactivation of some channels. At this point, the simplest mechanism that is supported by all of our data is that polyamines exert allosteric effects on kinetic rate constants such that closed states are stabilized. Allosteric mechanisms are also proposed for the N-methyl-d-aspartate and acetylcholine receptors (6Johnson T.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Jayaraman V. Ponasik J. Ganem B. Usherwood P.N.R. Hess G.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 334Google Scholar). A related phenomenon was described for the modulation of mitochondrial VDAC channels by polyanions (35Mangan A.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this case, the accumulation of impermeant and highly charged compounds in the channel mouth was held responsible for the increased voltage dependence of closure. We do not believe that such an unspecific effect is responsible for polyamine modulation of porins because the extent of inhibition is clearly dependent on the site of application of the chemicals. This asymmetry, the difference in sensitivity between the two homologous porins, and the high potency of spermine are suggestive of specific binding. The lack of effect of cadaverine from the pipette side is not surprising, considering that this compound is already much less potent than spermine when bath-applied. What is the potential location of the binding site(s)? From our previous work with mutants (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar) and the experiments presented here, we propose the following. The increased closing kinetics observed from a population of predominantly open channels is controlled by binding of the polyamines to an asymmetric site within the pore that in OmpC involves Asp-105 and Asp-118 (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), but not Glu-109. 4N. Liu and A. H.Delcour, manuscript in preparation. Access to this site is possible from both periplasmic and extracellular sides, but potency is higher from the periplasmic side. The suppression of openings from predominantly closed channels is due to polyamine binding to a different site because (i) it is not affected by mutations on the L3 loop (19Liu, N., Benedik, M. J., and Delcour, A. H. (1997) Biophys. Biochim. Acta, in press.Google Scholar), and (ii) it is not induced by spermine binding to OmpF even while a strong modulation of closing kinetics is taking place. Polyamines can access this site from both membrane sides, and thus, although not affected by the mutations at Asp-105 and Asp-118, the site may also reside within the pore. Finally, the instantaneous loss of channels might involve binding to yet a third site, since it is not affected by mutations on the L3 loop. Several binding sites would not be surprising on channels that can occupy multiple conformational states (23Delcour A.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 115-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This working hypothesis awaits further confirmation through conventional binding measurements and the isolation and characterization of additional mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2014993721,"Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) is a transcriptional activator that acts on a diverse set of nuclear genes required for mitochondrial respiratory function in mammalian cells. These genes encode respiratory proteins as well as components of the mitochondrial transcription, replication, and heme biosynthetic machinery. Here, we establish that NRF-1 is a phosphoprotein in vivo. Phosphorylation occurs on serine residues within a concise NH2-terminal domain with the major sites of phosphate incorporation at serines 39, 44, 46, 47, and 52. The in vivo phosphorylation pattern can be approximated in vitro by phosphorylating recombinant NRF-1 with purified casein kinase II. Phosphate incorporation at the sites utilized in vivo results in a marked stimulation of DNA binding activity which is not observed in mutated proteins lacking these sites. Pairwise expression of the wild-type protein with each of a series of truncated derivatives in transfected cells results in the formation of a dimer between wild-type and mutant forms demonstrating that a homodimer is the active binding species. Although NRF-1 can dimerize in the absence of DNA, phosphorylation does not enhance the formation of these dimers. These findings suggest that phosphorylation results in an intrinsic change in the NRF-1 dimer enhancing its ability to bind DNA.

Mitochondrial respiratory function requires the expression of essential gene products from both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic systems. Because of its compact structure and limited coding capacity, the mitochondrial genome encodes only 13 proteins along with the tRNAs and rRNAs required for their translation (for review, see Ref. 2Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). All of these proteins are subunits of the inner membrane respiratory complexes. Thus, nuclear genes must specify the majority of respiratory subunits and all of the proteins required for the expression, maintenance, and replication of mitochondrial DNA (for review, see Ref.8Clayton D.A.

One approach to understanding nucleo-mitochondrial interactions in mammalian cells is to identify the nuclear transcription factors that govern the expression of these genes.NRF-1 1The abbreviations used are: NRF-1, nuclear respiratory factor 1; HA, hemagglutinin; CKII, casein kinase II; SRF, serum response factor; MEF2C, myocyte enhancer factor 2C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: NRF-1, nuclear respiratory factor 1; HA, hemagglutinin; CKII, casein kinase II; SRF, serum response factor; MEF2C, myocyte enhancer factor 2C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. was originally identified as a nuclear transcription factor that acts on mammalian genes encoding cytochromec and a number of other respiratory proteins (4Evans M.J.

A possible role for the factor in intergenomic communication is supported by the discovery of functional NRF-1 recognition sites in nuclear genes specifying the rate-limiting heme biosynthetic enzyme, 5-aminolevulinate synthase (14Braidotti G.

The latter include the RNA subunit of mitochondrial RNA processing endonuclease, an enzyme implicated in the formation of mtDNA replication primers and mtTFA, an activator of mitochondrial transcription (for review, see Refs. 8Clayton D.A.

These findings led to a model whereby NRF-1, along with other transcription factors, helps coordinate the synthesis and function of respiratory proteins from both genomes (6Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 18Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, it has been postulated that NRF-1 may play a role in other developmental and growth regulatory processes (10Chau C.A. Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6999-7006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Most notably, the chicken homolog of NRF-1 has recently been associated with the expression of the histone H5 gene during erythrocyte development (21Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NRF-1 has been purified and a cDNA clone isolated and characterized (10Chau C.A. Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6999-7006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The protein is related through a novel DNA binding domain to developmental regulatory proteins from sea urchins (12Calzone F.J. Hoog C. Teplow D.B. Cutting A.E. Zeller R.W. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Development. 1991; 112: 335-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andDrosophila (13Desimone S.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3641-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This highly conserved DNA binding domain is in the NH2-terminal half of the molecule, and the conservation extends beyond its NH2-terminal boundary through a region containing a complex nuclear localization signal (17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A large COOH-terminal domain in NRF-1 is required for transcriptional activation and is not conserved in the lower eukaryotic proteins (23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we establish that a concise NH2-terminal domain in NRF-1 serves as a target for phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. The phosphorylation occurs on multiple serine residues and enhances DNA binding activity. Although the phosphodomain overlaps a region required for NRF-1 homodimerization, phosphorylation does not alter the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the absence of DNA. Rather, phosphorylation appears to cause an intrinsic change in the NRF-1 dimer thereby enhancing its DNA binding.DISCUSSIONThe preponderance of evidence points to a role for NRF-1 in nucleo-mitochondrial interactions in mammalian cells (6Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Functional NRF-1 sites are present in the majority of nuclear genes encoding respiratory subunits and also in several genes required for mitochondrial transcription, replication, and heme biosynthesis (22Scarpulla R.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, NRF-1 may serve a more integrative role in coordinate gene expression by acting on target genes encoding key components in the pathways of cellular metabolism, signal transduction, and chromosome maintenance (10Chau C.A. Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6999-7006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Several structural domains in NRF-1 which are required for its biological function have been resolved. A DNA binding domain within the NH2-terminal two-thirds of the molecule is highly conserved in a small family of eukaryotic regulatory proteins which includes the sea urchin P3A2 factor and the Drosophilaerect wing gene product (17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These proteins are required for proper neuromuscular development in their respective organisms. The COOH-terminal domain is not conserved among family members. In NRF-1, this domain contains clusters of hydrophobic residues that are required for transcriptional activation (23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to the DNA binding domain, significant sequence conservation with P3A2 is present between residues 37 and 116. Part of the sequence conservation in this region (residues 88–116) has been ascribed to a complex nuclear localization signal located just upstream from the DNA binding domain (21Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). No other functions had been assigned to the remainder of this conserved region.Here, we establish that NRF-1 is a phosphoprotein and that in vivo phosphorylation occurs within a concise NH2-terminal domain on serine residues 39, 44, 46, 47, and 52. Four of the five serines (39, 44, 46, and 47) are conserved in P3A2, but it is unknown whether they are phosphorylated in sea urchins. All five serines conform to the consensus for phosphorylation by CKII (35Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) (S/T-X-X-acidic, where the acidic residue can be glutamate, aspartate, phosphoserine, or phosphotyrosine), and the purified enzyme phosphorylates these sites in vitro. All five are surrounded by acidic amino acids that are prevalent in known CKII sites, and all but serine 44 have the requisite acidic residue at the +3 position. In the serine 44 site it is likely that the negative charge at this position is contributed by phosphoserine 47.Although CKII is the most likely candidate for the in vivoNRF-1 kinase, the in vivo and in vitrophosphorylation patterns are not identical. The major difference is that the region between residues 48 and 77 is more intensely phosphorylated in vitro than it is in vivo. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation suggests that this region accepts two phosphates on a molar basis. In addition to serine 52, which is weakly phosphorylated in vivo, threonines 51 and 62 conform to the consensus. These residues can account for the in vitrothreonine phosphorylation detected in wild-type and mutated proteins. Thus, it is likely that these residues are more accessible to phosphorylation in the in vitro CKII reaction. It is important to note, however, that threonine phosphorylation by itself does not contribute to enhanced DNA binding. Only that majority of sites which are phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro can account for the stimulatory effect of phosphorylation on NRF-1 DNA binding activity.The formation of NRF-1 heterodimers in transfected cells expressing both wild-type and deleted proteins constitutes compelling evidence that the protein binds DNA as a dimer. This is consistent with the dyad symmetry in the pallidromic NRF-1 recognition site (6Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although glutaraldehyde cross-linking results in two species migrating as monomer and dimer on denaturing gels (not shown), attempts to form heterodimers in vitro by mixing native proteins were unsuccessful. This has also been observed with the chicken homolog of NRF-1 and has been attributed to a low equilibrium dissociation constant for the homodimer (21Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of wild-type and deleted proteins in the same cellular compartment in transfected cells allows free association among subunits and results in the detection of heterodimers.Here, we demonstrate that the stability of the NRF-1 dimer in the absence of DNA is disrupted upon progressive NH2-terminal deletion to residue 78. Upon deletion to this residue, the predominant species detected on native gels is clearly monomer. This indicates that a strong determinant of dimerization is located in the NH2-terminal region of the protein apart from the DNA binding domain. However, a protein with the 1–78 deletion binds DNA as a homodimer, can heterodimerize with wild-type on DNA (Fig. 6), and can be cross-linked to a dimer with glutaraldehyde (not shown). We note that the Mut 3 protein does appear to bind DNA less strongly than the wild-type, which is consistent with removal of a dimerization domain. This is in agreement with the results obtained with chicken NRF-1 which suggest an overlap between DNA binding and dimerization functions between residues 79 and 172 (21Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that the NH2-terminal domain identified here is essential for stable subunit interactions in the absence of DNA. In addition, determinants within the DNA binding domain contribute a level of stability sufficient for DNA binding and for detection with cross-linking agents. However, we find no evidence that phosphorylation stimulates DNA binding by promoting dimer stability. Complete elimination of all NH2-terminal phosphorylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis does not result in any detectable dissociation to monomer on native gels. This suggests that phosphorylation affects DNA binding at the level of DNA-protein interaction.One might expect that the phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of DNA binding would result in an increased ability of wild-type NRF-1 to activate transcription compared with Mut 3. We have previously compared wild-type NRF-1 and Mut 3 for their ability totrans-activate a luciferase reporter whose expression was driven by four copies of the NRF-1 binding site from the rat cytochromec gene cloned upstream of a minimal promoter in transient cotransfection experiments in COS-1 cells (23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In those experiments, both proteins activated transcription by about 7–8-fold over that of an empty vector. The absence of a difference between these constructs under conditions of transient transfection most likely results from the fact that the transgene expresses NRF-1 or Mut 3 at very high levels. Since Mut 3 can still bind DNA and has an intact activation domain, overexpression may compensate for its reduced DNA binding activity relative to that of the wild-type phosphorylated protein.Several transcription factors are now known to be phosphorylated at CKII consensus sites both in vivo and in vitro. In particular, NRF-1 shares a number of interesting similarities with two such factors, SRF and MEF2C. Both SRF (30Manak J.R. Prywes R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 703-711PubMed Google Scholar, 31Janknecht R.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 955-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and MEF2C (27Molkentin J.D. Li L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17199-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) resemble NRF-1 in that phosphorylation of a restricted number of serine residues adjacent to the region of the molecule which contacts DNA accounts for enhanced factor binding to their cognate recognition sites. In SRF, dephosphorylation of specific serine residues resulted in decreases in both its association and dissociation rates leading to the conclusion that phosphorylation does not alter the equilibrium binding affinity for DNA (31Janknecht R. Hipskind R.A. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Marais R.M. Hsuan J.J. McGuigan C. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We also note that phosphorylation results in a marked increase in the rate of dissociation of NRF-1 from DNA, 2S. Gugneja and R. C. Scarpulla, unpublished observations. suggesting that its exchange rate on DNA may be similarly affected. Conversion of the essential serines to acidic amino acids in both SRF and MEF2C had the same stimulatory effect on DNA binding as phosphorylation. In addition, phosphorylation does not alter the ability of SRF to dimerize (33Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or of MEF2C to interact with other myogenic transcription factors (27Molkentin J.D. Li L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17199-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In both cases it has been postulated that introduction of a negative charge may induce a conformational change that affects the DNA binding domain (27Molkentin J.D. Li L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17199-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,33Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism is consistent with the finding that NRF-1 phosphorylation also stimulates DNA binding without altering the association between homologous subunits. These similarities suggest that SRF, MEF2C, and NRF-1 may be targets for the same or very similar kinase-mediated signaling pathway.Control of NRF-1 function by phosphorylation is an attractive mechanism given the proposed role for the factor in nucleomitochondrial interactions and the integration of other growth regulatory pathways. Although CKII activity is stimulated by serum growth factors (for review, see Ref. 34Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) there is conflicting evidence that this stimulation leads to the activation of gene expression through the modification of specific transcription factors. No change in the phosphorylated state of SRF or the relative amounts of SRF isoforms has been found in response to growth factor treatment. Stable expression of a mutant SRF that binds its recognition site at constitutively high levels had no effect on c-fos expression (30Manak J.R. Prywes R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 703-711PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, phosphorylation of the CKII sites in the upstream binding factor markedly elevates the trans-activation of their ribosomal RNA target genes. In addition, the phosphorylated state of upstream binding factor but not its level of expression, is stimulated in proliferating relative to serum arrested cells, and this correlates with enhanced ribosomal RNA transcription (28Voit R. Schnapp A. Kuhn A. Rosenbauer H. Hirschmann P. Stunnenberg H.G. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29O'Mahony D.J. Xie W. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unexplored possibility is that phosphorylation of transcription factors such as NRF-1 by CKII or related kinases occurs in response to intracellular signals that communicate the respiratory state of the mitochondria to the nuclear transcriptional apparatus. Such a mechanism may link the expression of nuclear genes to the availability of respiratory energy. The results presented here represent an essential first step in understanding the potential role of phosphorylation in NRF-1-dependent gene expression. Mitochondrial respiratory function requires the expression of essential gene products from both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic systems. Because of its compact structure and limited coding capacity, the mitochondrial genome encodes only 13 proteins along with the tRNAs and rRNAs required for their translation (for review, see Ref. 2Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). All of these proteins are subunits of the inner membrane respiratory complexes. Thus, nuclear genes must specify the majority of respiratory subunits and all of the proteins required for the expression, maintenance, and replication of mitochondrial DNA (for review, see Ref.8Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 453-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). One approach to understanding nucleo-mitochondrial interactions in mammalian cells is to identify the nuclear transcription factors that govern the expression of these genes.

The latter include the RNA subunit of mitochondrial RNA processing endonuclease, an enzyme implicated in the formation of mtDNA replication primers and mtTFA, an activator of mitochondrial transcription (for review, see Refs. 8Clayton D.A.

These findings led to a model whereby NRF-1, along with other transcription factors, helps coordinate the synthesis and function of respiratory proteins from both genomes (6Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C.

In addition, it has been postulated that NRF-1 may play a role in other developmental and growth regulatory processes (10Chau C.A. Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6999-7006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Most notably, the chicken homolog of NRF-1 has recently been associated with the expression of the histone H5 gene during erythrocyte development (21Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRF-1 has been purified and a cDNA clone isolated and characterized (10Chau C.A. Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6999-7006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The protein is related through a novel DNA binding domain to developmental regulatory proteins from sea urchins (12Calzone F.J. Hoog C. Teplow D.B. Cutting A.E. Zeller R.W. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Development. 1991; 112: 335-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andDrosophila (13Desimone S.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3641-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This highly conserved DNA binding domain is in the NH2-terminal half of the molecule, and the conservation extends beyond its NH2-terminal boundary through a region containing a complex nuclear localization signal (17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A large COOH-terminal domain in NRF-1 is required for transcriptional activation and is not conserved in the lower eukaryotic proteins (23Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we establish that a concise NH2-terminal domain in NRF-1 serves as a target for phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. The phosphorylation occurs on multiple serine residues and enhances DNA binding activity. Although the phosphodomain overlaps a region required for NRF-1 homodimerization, phosphorylation does not alter the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the absence of DNA. Rather, phosphorylation appears to cause an intrinsic change in the NRF-1 dimer thereby enhancing its DNA binding. DISCUSSIONThe preponderance of evidence points to a role for NRF-1 in nucleo-mitochondrial interactions in mammalian cells (6Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C.

Functional NRF-1 sites are present in the majority of nuclear genes encoding respiratory subunits and also in several genes required for mitochondrial transcription, replication, and heme biosynthesis (22Scarpulla R.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, NRF-1 may serve a more integrative role in coordinate gene expression by acting on target genes encoding key components in the pathways of cellular metabolism, signal transduction, and chromosome maintenance (10Chau C.A.

Photoaffinity labeling and analysis of mutant Ca2+ channels implicate the IIIS6 and IVS6 segments in high affinity binding. The amino acid residues that are required for high affinity binding of dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists were probed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the α1C subunit, transient expression in mammalian cells, and analysis by measurements of ligand binding and block of Ba2+ currents through expressed Ca2+ channels. Eleven amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 were identified whose mutation reduced the affinity for the Ca2+ antagonist PN200-110 by 2–25-fold. Both amino acid residues conserved among Ca2+ channels and those specific to l-type Ca2+ channels were found to be required for high affinity dihydropyridine binding. In addition, mutation F1462A increased the affinity for the dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist PN200-110 by 416-fold with no effect on the affinity for the Ca2+ agonist Bay K8644. The residues in transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 that are required for high affinity binding are primarily aligned on single faces of these two α helices, supporting a “domain interface model” of dihydropyridine binding and action in which the IIIS6 and IVS6 interact to form a high affinity dihydropyridine receptor site on l-type Ca2+ channels.

Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels mediate Ca2+influx in response to membrane depolarization and thereby initiate cellular activities such as secretion, contraction, and gene expression. Several types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been distinguished by their physiological and pharmacological properties and have been designated L, N, P/Q, R, and T (for review see Refs. 1Hofmann F.

The l-type Ca2+ channels consist of the pore-forming α1 subunits of 190–250 kDa in association with disulfide-linked α2δ subunits of approximately 140 kDa, intracellular β subunits of 55–72 kDa, and, for the skeletal muscle l-type channel, an additional transmembrane γ subunit of 33 kDa (for review see Ref. 6Isom L.L.

The α1subunits confer the characteristic pharmacology and functional properties of each channel type, but their function is modulated by association with the auxiliary subunits. The pore-forming α1 subunits can be divided into two distinct families,l-type and non-l-type, which share less than 40% amino acid identity. The l-type Ca2+channel α1 subunit family includes skeletal muscle (α1S) (7Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S.

The predominant site of labeling corresponds to transmembrane segment IIIS6 and a portion of the extracellular segment connecting IIIS5 and IIIS6, and approximately 15–30% of the total photolabeling is incorporated into a peptide fragment composed primarily of transmembrane segment IVS6 (30Striessnig J.

Site-directed mutagenesis of single amino acid residues that differ between l-type and non-l-type Ca2+channels revealed multiple amino acid residues on one side of the IIIS6 and IVS6 putative transmembrane α helices that are important determinants of high affinity binding of DHP agonists and antagonists to l-type Ca2+ channels (37Schuster A.

In addition, mutation of a Tyr residue (Tyr1048 in α1S) in segment IIIS6 that is conserved in all Ca2+ subtypes was found to have the largest effect on DHP affinity (38Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N.

Mutation of this residue to Phe caused a 12-fold reduction in binding affinity, and mutation to Ala prevented measurable high affinity DHP binding. In the experiments reported here, we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to map both conserved and l-type-specific amino acid residues that contribute to the high affinity of the DHP receptor site. tsA-201 cells were provided by Dr. Robert DuBridge (Cell Genesis, Foster City, CA). cDNA encoding the α2δ subunit cloned from rabbit skeletal muscle calcium channel was provided by Drs.

The resulting construct was used as a template for the generation of single-stranded DNA for introduction of mutations into transmembrane segment IVS6 of α1CII. These mutations were transferred to the full-length α1CII subunit cDNA by subcloning the 272-base pair DraIII/DraIII fragment. Mutations in transmembrane segment IIIS6 were made with a single-stranded DNA template containing the 1.7-kilobaseAvrII/EcoRI fragment of the α1CIIcDNA. The IIIS6 mutations were transferred to the full-length α1CII construct using the 1.5-kilobaseSpcI/DraIII and the 272-base pairDraIII/DraIII fragments in a three-way ligation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using established procedures (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar), mutations were verified by sequence analysis of approximately 200 base pairs surrounding the site of mutagenesis, and the integrity of the full-length mutant Ca2+ channel cDNA was confirmed by extensive restriction digest analysis. Human tsA-201 cells, a simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen expressing derivative of the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human tsA-201 cells were cotransfected with wild type or mutant α1CII and cDNA encoding the β1b (40Pragnell M. Leveille C.F. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and α2δ Ca2+ channel subunits such that the molar ratio of the plasmids was 1:1:1. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation according to the procedures outlined by Margolskeeet al. (41Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horne R. Biotechniques. 1994; 15: 906-911Google Scholar), and cells were harvested 30–40 h following transfection. Cells were washed two times, scraped, and homogenized using a glass-teflon homogenizer in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm benzamidine, 1.0 μmpepstatin A, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 8.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged 30 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the membrane pellet was washed and homogenized in Buffer A. The resulting membrane homogenate was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C for up to 3 months with no detectable loss of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding activity. Equilibrium binding assays were performed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 100 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm benzamidine, 1.0 μm pepstatin A, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 8.0) with 20–200 μg of membrane protein, 0.01–10 nm (+)-[3H]PN200-110 and 1 mmCa2+ at 32 °C for 180–210 min. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm (±)-PN200-110, and bound and free ligand were separated by vacuum filtration over GF/C glass fiber filters. Filters were washed using ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris, 1% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 8.0), and bound radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Dissociation constants (K d) were determined using the radioligand data analysis program LIGAND. All data are means ± S.E. Cultures of tsA-201 cells at 75% confluence in 35-mm cell culture dishes were transfected with a total of 4 μg of DNA consisting of an equimolar ratio of the three channel subunit cDNAs and 0.8 μg of CD8 cDNA. After the addition of CaPO4-DNA, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Twenty h after transfection, the cells were removed from culture dishes using 2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and replated at low density for electrophysiological analysis. Transfectants were recognized by labeling with anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads (M450 CD8 Dynabeads, Dynal, Inc.). Barium currents through l-type Ca2+ channels were recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Patch electrodes were pulled from VWR micropipettes and fire-polished to produce an inner tip diameter of 4–6 μm. Currents were recorded using a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier and filtered at 2 kHz (8-pole Bessel filter, −3 db). Voltage pulses were applied, and data were acquired using Fastlab software (Indec Systems). Linear leak and capacitance currents have been subtracted using an on-line P/4 subtraction paradigm. (+)-PN200-110 was applied to cells by the addition of 0.2 ml of a 6× stock to a 1-ml bath. Inhibition of Ca2+ channel current (carried by Ba2+) during application of (+)-PN200-110 was monitored by 100-ms depolarizations to +10 mV from a holding potential of −60 mV applied every 10 s until block had reached steady-state (1–3 min). The bath saline contained 150 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmBaCl2. The intracellular saline contained 130 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm EGTA, 60 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgATP, and 1 mm MgCl2. The pH of both solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). Transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 contain important molecular determinants for high affinity binding of DHPs as determined by photoaffinity labeling (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 30Striessnig J. Murphy B.J.

Previous molecular biological studies that support this conclusion have focused almost exclusively on amino acid residues that are present in DHP-sensitivel-type Ca2+ channels but not in DHP-insensitive non-l-type channels. In the present experiments, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of single amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 of α1CII was employed to identify all of the amino acids, both conserved andl-type-specific, that are important determinants for DHP binding. Most of the amino acids in IIIS6 and IVS6 of α1CII were systematically changed to Ala and coexpressed with α2δ and β1b in tsA-201 cells (Fig.1, C and D, shaded boxes). To assess the relative importance of Ala1157 and Ala1467, these amino acids were changed to Pro and Ser, respectively, as found in DHP-insensitive Ca2+ channels. Ala was chosen for these experiments because its substitution in α helices in the core of proteins has minimal effects on secondary structure (42Blaber M. Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ala is therefore expected to reduce the hydrophobicity and size of the amino acid residue in each position in these putative α helices without causing global conformational changes.Figure 1Location of the DHP receptor site.

A high ratio of specific to nonspecific binding was observed in binding experiments with both wild type Ca2+ channels (not shown) and mutant channels having substantially reduced affinity (for example, mutant N1472A; Fig. 2 A). The linearity of the Scatchard plots (Fig. 2 B) indicates a single class of high affinity binding sites with a K d of 55 pm for wild type and 470 pm for the mutant N1472A. Mutation of several amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 to Ala had large effects on DHP binding affinity (Fig.3). Of the mutations in IIIS6, the largest effects on PN200-110 binding were observed when the l-type-specific residues Ile1153, Ile1156, Met1160, and Met1161 were changed to Ala, resulting inK d values that are larger than wild type by 6.2-, 17-, 3.5-, and 9.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In addition, mutation of three residues in IIIS6 that are conserved between l-type and non-l-type Ca2+channels to Ala had large effects on DHP binding. The mutants F1158A and F1159A have K d values that are 4.5- and 4.3-fold larger than wild type, respectively. The mutant Y1152A, which corresponds to the conserved residue Tyr1048 in α1S, which we previously showed was essential for DHP binding (38Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), exhibits no detectable DHP binding at concentrations of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 up to 25 nm. Of the amino acid residues screened by alanine-scanning mutagenesis in transmembrane segment IVS6, mutations Y1463A, M1464A, and I1471A, which affect l-type-specific residues, and N1472A, which affects a conserved residue, exhibited the largest effects, withK d values that were larger than wild type by 2.9-, 1.6-, 2.7-, and 9-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The comparatively small effects of mutation of residues in IVS6 compared with IIIS6 suggest that this transmembrane segment is on the periphery of the DHP receptor site and has relatively weak interactions with bound DHPs compared with IIIS6. We were unable to detect specific DHP binding to the α1Cmutants Y1152A, Y1458A, and F1462A using concentrations of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 up to 25 nm. To determine if these mutants can form functional Ca2+ channels and to measure their affinity for DHPs, these mutants were expressed and analyzed electrophysiologically (Fig. 4). The mutant F1458A did not express Ba2+ currents, so it is likely that the lack of DHP binding observed with this mutant is caused by failure to express functional Ca2+ channels. The mutants Y1152A and F1462A both expressed Ba2+ currents but less effectively than wild type (Fig. 4, B and C). The voltage dependence of activation of these mutants was comparable with that of wild type as assessed from current-voltage relationships. In contrast, the voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted for these mutant Ca2+ channels (Fig. 4 D). For mutant Y1152A, the voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted to more negative membrane potentials and became significantly less steep than wild type. For mutant F1462A, the voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted 10 mV to more positive membrane potentials. As DHP antagonists bind with higher affinity to inactivated Ca2+ channels, changes in the extent of inactivation at the membrane potential of our experiments could influence DHP binding and block. However, as shown below, the changes in DHP affinity caused by these two mutations are in the opposite directions from those expected on the basis of the changes in the voltage dependence of inactivation so the changes in affinity are likely to result from molecular changes in the DHP binding site rather than from indirect allosteric effects due to the change in inactivation gating. The DHP antagonist PN200-110 inhibits wild type and mutant Ca2+ channels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A–C). Analysis of concentration-effect relationships indicates that the IC50 for inhibition of Y1152A by PN200-110 at −60 mV is approximately 25-fold higher than wild type (Fig. 4 E). Thus, Tyr1152 is indeed an important determinant for DHP binding. This large decrease in binding affinity coupled with low levels of expression are likely to prevent detection of specific (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding to this mutant. In contrast, the IC50 for block of mutant F1462A by PN200-110 was decreased from 6.8 ± 1.2 nm to 16 ± 5.8 pm, indicating that this mutation results in an α1 subunit with an affini"
https://openalex.org/W1995528135,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are peptides that share nearly 50% sequence homology. However, although their cognate receptors also exhibit significant overall sequence homology, the affinity of each peptide for the non-cognate receptor is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than for the cognate receptor. The molecular basis for this discrimination is unclear, as are the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand binding. We have recently identified a major ligand binding site of the insulin receptor by alanine scannning mutagenesis. These studies revealed that a number of amino acids critical for insulin binding are conserved in the IGF-1 receptor, suggesting that they may play a role in ligand binding. We therefore performed alanine mutagenesis of these amino acids to determine whether this is the case. cDNAs encoding alanine-substituted secreted recombinant IGF-1 receptors were expressed in 293 EBNA cells, and the ligand binding properties of the expressed proteins were evaluated. Mutation of Phe701 resulted in a receptor with undetectable IGF-1 binding; alanine substitution of the corresponding amino acid of the insulin receptor, Phe714, produces a 140-fold reduction in affinity for insulin. Mutation of Asp8, Asn11, Phe58, Phe692, Glu693, His697, and Asn698 produces a 3.5–6-fold reduction in affinity for IGF-1. In contrast, alanine mutation of the corresponding amino acids of the insulin receptor with the exception of Asp12 produces reductions in affinity that are 50-fold or greater. The affinity of insulin for these mutants relative to wild type receptor was similar to that of their relative affinity for IGF-1 with two exceptions; the IC50 values for insulin binding to the mutants of Arg10, which has normal affinity for IGF-1, and His697, which has a 6-fold reduction in affinity for IGF-1, were both at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than for wild type receptor. The K d values for insulin of the corresponding alanine mutants of the insulin receptor, Arg14 and His710, are 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than for wild type receptor. However, in contrast, the relative affinity of des(25–30)[PheB25α-carboxamide]insulin for these IGF-1 receptor mutants is reduced only 4- and 50-fold, respectively. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are peptides that share nearly 50% sequence homology.

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 are circulating serum peptides that share nearly 50% sequence homology (for a review, see Ref. 1LeRoith D. McGuinness M. Shemer J. Stannard B. Lanau F.

Conservation of the predicted major secondary structural elements of both peptides suggests that their tertiary structures are similar (2Blundell T.L. Bedarkar S. Rinderknecht E. Humbel R.E. Proc.

The molecular basis for this discrimination is at present unclear, as are the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand binding. As a consequence of the availability of a large number of naturally occurring and chemically and biosynthetically modified analogs of insulin, an extensive body of information regarding its receptor binding determinants has accumulated. A current consensus is that A2 isoleucine, A3 valine, B12 valine, B24 and B25 phenylalanine, A19 tyrosine, A21 asparagine, and the partially buried residues A16 and B15 leucine are the major determinants of the receptor binding site, with A8 threonine, B9 serine, B10 histidine, B13 glutamate, and B16 tyrosine making minor contributions. 2G. Dodson, personal communication. 2G. Dodson, personal communication. This forms a patch on the surface of the molecule overlapping its dimerization surface. More recent studies also suggest that a small patch formed from the residues A13 and B17 on the hexamerization surface of insulin may represent a topologically distinct receptor binding site located on the opposite side of the molecule (6Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Much less information is available with regard to the receptor binding determinants of IGF-1.

In addition, tyrosines 24 and 60, corresponding to B25 phenylalanine and A19 tyrosine of insulin, respectively, both essential for high affinity binding of insulin, play important roles in the receptor binding of IGF-1 (8Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Chicchi G.G. Miller R.E. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15648-15652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand binding determinants of both receptors have also been the subject of study. Studies with chimeric receptors have provided insights into the regions of the molecules that appear to confer specificity. A consensus of such studies is that determinants of insulin specificity appear to reside between amino acids 1 and 68 and between amino acids 450 and 524 of the insulin receptor (5Kjeldsen T.

Brandenburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8950-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 704 and 718 of the α subunit (15Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P.

Recent studies from this laboratory, utilizing alanine scanning mutagenesis, have identified and characterized a major ligand binding site of the insulin receptor α subunit (16Williams P. Mynarcik D. Yu G.-Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This appears to be composed of an N-terminal subdomain between amino acids 1 and 120 (16Williams P. Mynarcik D. Yu G.-Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal subdomain between amino acids 704 and 716 (17Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The N-terminal subdomain is composed of four discontinuous polypeptide segments widely separated in the primary sequence, composed of 14 amino acids. In contrast, the C-terminal subdomain is composed of three discontinuous segments composed of 12 amino acids. Insulin analog binding studies of these mutants reveal that the free energy contributions of these amino acids can fully account for the free energy of binding of insulin to the secreted recombinant receptor (18Mynarcik D.C. Williams P. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2077-2081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the major determinants of insulin binding have been identified. In contrast, it is far from clear that all of the determinants of ligand binding by the IGF-1 receptor have been identified. As noted above, IGF-1 binds to the insulin receptor with very low but measurable affinity (5Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S. Wiberg F.C. Rasmussen J.S. Schaffer L. Balschmidt P. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This suggests that both receptors may have some common ligand binding determinants in addition to their specificity determinants. This notion receives further support from our scanning mutagenesis studies of the insulin receptor (16Williams P. Mynarcik D. Yu G.-Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); many of the amino acids critical for insulin binding are conserved in the IGF-1 receptor, suggesting that there may be evolutionary conservation of function. In the present study we have, therefore, investigated this possibility by examining the ligand binding properties of alanine mutants of conserved amino acids in the IGF-1 receptor that correspond to those in the insulin receptor that are critical for insulin binding. All molecular biological procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing, were performed by standard methods (19Sambrook J.

These constructs were transiently expressed in 293 EBNA cells (an adenovirus-transformed human kidney cell line expressing Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen) by transfection with 2 μg of miniprep DNA using the commercially available lipofection reagent Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. For analysis of transient expression, media and cells were harvested 1 week after transfection. Conditioned medium was concentrated prior to assay using Centriprep 100 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Detergent lysates of cells were prepared as described previously. We chose to utilize the extracellular domain for these experiments, since it is expressed in large amounts by this expression system and eliminates interference due to the substantial background of endogenous IGF-1 receptors in the 293 EBNA cells. 3D.

For ligand binding studies, the insulin analog, X92, was iodinated with 125-iodine by the lactoperoxidase method. The monoiodo-A14 tyrosine isomer was separated from the iodination reactions by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (28Dreyer K. Kruse V. Larsen U.D. Hougaard P. Bjorn S. Gammeltoft S. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Soluble IGF-1 receptor binding assays were performed using a microtiter plate antibody capture assay. Microtiter plates (Immulon 4, Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) were incubated with affinity-purified goat antimouse IgG (50 μl/well of 20 μg/ml solution in 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.4) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline and blocking for 15 min with 250 μl of SuperblockTM (Pierce), wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution in SuperblockTM of crude ascites of anti-IGF-1 receptor monoclonal antibody 24–31 (22Soos M.A. Field C.E.

This antibody has been demonstrated to have minimal effects on the affinity of the receptor for IGF-1. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, wells were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with soluble receptor, diluted to give 10–20% 125I-IGF-1 binding in the absence of added unlabeled IGF-1 or 10–20% 125I-X92 in the absence of unlabeled insulin under assay conditions. After washing with wash buffer (0.15 m sodium chloride, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.025% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide), wells were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with 125I-IGF-1 (12 pm) or 125I-X92 (12 pm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled IGF-1 or insulin, in 100 μl of binding buffer (137.5 mm sodium chloride, 10 mmmagnesium sulfate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.025% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide). To terminate the assay, wells were aspirated and washed three times with 300 μl of ice-cold wash buffer and then counted. Insulin binding was determined as described previously (16Williams P.

Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) to obtain theK d of the expressed protein. Transfection and binding assays were repeated at least once to confirm theK d of each mutant. Each result is the mean of two experiments. Immunoblotting of the IGF-1 receptor α subunit in conditioned medium and detergent lysates of transfected cells was performed according to standard methods (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody directed toward the IGF-1 receptor α subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Mutant IGF-1 receptor cDNAs were transiently expressed in 293 EBNA cells. To evaluate expression and post-translational processing of the receptor, conditioned medium from transfected cells and detergent lysates of the cells were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody directed toward the N terminus of the α subunit of the IGF-1 receptor. In conditioned medium, a M r 135,000 protein representing IGF-1 receptor α subunit was detectable for all transfections (see Fig. 1 for a representative immunoblot) with the exception of those with cDNAs encoding alanine mutations of Leu32 and Glu38 (data not shown); the epitope for the antibody used for these blots is directed toward amino acids 31–50 of the receptor α subunit, and hence it would not be expected to recognize these mutants. In detergent lysates of cells, a protein of M r 160,000, corresponding to the predicted mobility of the secreted receptor precursor (23Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar), was detected in all transfections with the exception of the Leu32 and Glu38 mutants. TheM r 135,000 protein observed in the lysates was present in all transfections and probably represents a protein cross-reacting with the secondary antibody, since we have seen a protein of the same mobility in lysates of transfected cells blotted with anti-insulin receptor antibodies (17Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For each transfection, the amount of detectable α subunit relative to precursor was similar (see Fig. 1 for a representative example), suggesting that the mutations did not cause any major perturbation of post-translational processing of the receptor. While the relationship between post-translational processing and protein folding has not been systematically examined for the IGF-1 receptor, studies with the closely related insulin receptor (31Kadowaki T.

Curiously, glycerol fails to stimulate insulin secretion, even though it has been reported that islets contain abundant glycerol kinase activity and oxidize glycerol efficiently. We have reinvestigated this point and find that rat islets and the well differentiated insulinoma cell line INS-1 contain negligible glycerol kinase activity. A recombinant adenovirus containing the bacterial glycerol kinase gene (AdCMV-GlpK) was constructed and used to express the enzyme in islets and INS-1 cells, resulting in insulin secretion in response to glycerol. In AdCMV-GlpK-treated INS-1 cells a greater proportion of glycerol is converted to lactate and a lesser proportion is oxidized compared with glucose. The two fuels are equally potent as insulin secretagogues, despite the fact that oxidation of glycerol at its maximally effective dose (2–5 mm) occurs at a rate that is similar to the rate of glucose oxidation at its basal, nonstimulatory concentration (3 mm). We also investigated the possibility that glycerol may signal via expansion of the glycerol phosphate pool to allow enhanced fatty acid esterification and formation of complex lipids. Addition of Triacsin-C, an inhibitor of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, to AdCMV-GlpK-treated INS-1 cells did not inhibit glycerol-stimulated insulin secretion despite the fact that it blocked glycerol incorporation into cellular lipids. We conclude from these studies that glycerol kinase expression is sufficient to activate glycerol signaling in beta cells, showing that the failure of normal islets to respond to this substrate is due to a lack of this enzyme activity. Further, our studies show that glycerol signaling is not linked to esterification or oxidation of the substrate, but is likely mediated by its metabolism in the glycerol phosphate shuttle and/or the distal portion of the glycolytic pathway, either of which can lead to production of ATP and an increased ATP:ADP ratio.

According to the fuel hypothesis of insulin secretion, release of the hormone is stimulated only by metabolic fuels that are actively metabolized in islet beta cells. In support of this notion, glucose and glyceraldehyde stimulate insulin secretion in proportion to their rates of metabolism (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A working model of stimulus-secretion coupling in the beta cell is that fuel metabolism leads to an increase in the ATP:ADP ratio, which causes closure of ATP-sensitive K+channels (KATP channels) and activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, influx of extracellular Ca2+, and activation of the exocytotic machinery (reviewed in Refs. 1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar and 2Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Early studies in which mitochondrial uncouplers were found to block glucose-stimulated insulin secretion led to the assumption that fuel oxidation and mitochondrial ATP production were key events in insulin release (reviewed in Refs. 1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 2Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev.

In the context of this model, the poor insulinotropic effect of pyruvate, despite its efficient oxidation in islets, has never been adequately explained. Subsequently, several lines of investigation have suggested that ATP produced from glycolysis constitutes the critical signal for KATP channel closure and initiation of insulin secretion, while ATP produced via mitochondrial metabolism plays a secondary role of maintaining sufficient energy to drive secretory granule exocytosis (4MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Mertz R.J. Worley III, J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). That “glycolytic” ATP more effectively regulates KATPchannels than “mitochondrial” ATP is a concept originally introduced from studies in isolated myocytes (6Weis J.N. Lamp S.T. Science. 1987; 238: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, since other recent studies have provided data that seem to affirm the importance of mitochondrially derived ATP in beta cell stimulus-secretion coupling (7Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the matter remains unresolved. In addition to fuel signaling via ATP produced by glycolysis or fuel oxidation, two other pathways for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion have been considered. First, a link between glucose and fatty acid metabolism has been implicated as a critical component of the glucose sensing response (2Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Glucose has been shown to increase the level of malonyl-CoA, which causes inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and diversion of long-chain acyl-CoAs away from oxidation and into esterification (8Corkey B.E.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Phospholipids derived in this way could participate in stimulation of insulin secretion by allowing membrane lipid turnover during granule exocytosis, or by generation of bioactive byproducts such as diacylglycerol or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Second, because of the very high activities of mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in islets cells, it has been suggested that transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria may occur with high efficiency in such cells, and that FADH produced as a by-product of the mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase reaction can serve a signaling function by entering site II of the electron transport chain, resulting in generation of ATP (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Dukes I.D. McIntyre M.S.

In the current study, we have sought to create a new model of insulin secretion that can be used to determine which of the four signaling pathways named above are actually operative in fuel-stimulated beta cells. Despite the potent effects of glyceraldehyde on insulin secretion, islets are unable to respond to another simple triose, glycerol. This is puzzling in light of studies by Malaisse and co-workers suggesting that islets and insulinoma cell lines contain substantial levels of glycerol kinase and oxidize glycerol efficiently (14Yilmaz M.T. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 52: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Sener A. Rasschaert J. Zahner D. Malaisse W.J. Int. J.

Our laboratory has been developing the recombinant adenovirus system as a tool for metabolic engineering of mammalian cells, including islet beta cells (16Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S.

To determine the effect of glycerol kinase expression on beta cell responses to glycerol, we have used the adenovirus system to introduce the gene encoding the bacterial form of the enzyme into isolated rat islets or well differentiated insulinoma cells. While control rat islets or INS-1 cells metabolize glycerol at a very low rate and exhibit no response to it as a secretagogue, adenovirus-mediated expression of glycerol kinase in such cells markedly enhances glycerol flux and confers glycerol-stimulated insulin secretion. Clear differences between the metabolic fates of glucose and glycerol in such engineered cells provide new insight into the important metabolic signaling events for fuel-mediated insulin secretion. A plasmid pWT165 containing the gene encoding Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (glpK) was obtained from Dr. Donald Pettigrew, Texas A & M University (19Pettigrew D.W. Ma D.-P. Conrad C.A.

The new recombinant virus (AdCMV-GlpK) was produced by homologous recombination of the pACCMV.pLpA plasmid containing the glycerol kinase insert with pJM17 (21McCrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) in cotransfected 293 cells and purified by CsCl density equilibrium ultracentrifugation as described previously (16Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 162-189Google Scholar). INS-1 rat insulinoma cells were obtained from Drs. Claes Wollheim and Philippe Halban, University of Geneva (22Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 130: 167-178Crossref Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol (22Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 130: 167-178Crossref Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted by plating the cells into 12-well dishes and treating them at approximately 75% confluence with AdCMV-GlpK virus or, as a control, the AdCMV-βGAL virus containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (23Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to one or the other of the recombinant viruses for 1 h in the supplemented RPMI medium described above. The virus-containing medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed once with fresh medium and then cultured in fresh medium for 48 h to allow the transgenes to be expressed. Total RNA was extracted from AdCMV-GlpK or AdCMV-βGAL-treated INS-1 cells with the TRIzol kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Samples of 20 μg of RNA were resolved on agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon supporting membranes by capillary action, and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Randomly primed32P-labeled probes for rat GLUT-2 (a 1063-base pairHindIII fragment within the protein coding region of the cDNA) (24Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. Milburn J.L. Lodish H.F. Thorens B. J.

Hughes S.D. Milburn J.L. Unger R.H. Newgard C.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography. Cells were suspended in extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 40 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell suspensions were thawed on ice, and cellular debris pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C). Protein levels in the resultant supernatant were quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Glycerol kinase activity was measured by modification of a radioisotopic assay that is routinely used for measurement of glucose phosphorylation (27Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8849-8853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of the extract supernatant containing 10 μg of total protein in 7–10 μl of extraction buffer were added to 50-μl assay buffer (100 mm Tris, 5 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm glycerol, pH 7.2) for 2 h at room temperature, after which the enzymatic reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 97% ethanol, 3% methanol. 30 μl of the alcohol-treated reaction mix were spotted onto circular DEAE filters (Schlieicher & Schuell) and allowed to air dry. Filters were washed overnight in distilled water and allowed to air dry the next morning. Dried filters were placed in scintillation vials and counted in 10 ml of BioSafe II scintillation mixture (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL). Cells were preincubated in 1 ml of Hepes/bicarbonate balanced salt solution (HBBSS) 1The abbreviations used are: HBBSS, Hepes/bicarbonate balanced salt solution; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. consisting of 20 mmHEPES, 114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mmMgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25.5 mm NaHCO3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, with 2 mm glucose for 1 h prior to a 3-h incubation with 500 μl of HBBSS containing various secretagogues. In some experiments, 10 μm Triacsin-C (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was included in both the preincubation and secretagogue buffers. Following the 3-h incubation, the HBBSS medium was transferred to Eppendorf-type tubes and centrifuged for 3 min at 3,000 ×g. An aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 50 μl were diluted 1:4 for radioimmunoassay utilizing tubes precoated with anti-human insulin IgG (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). A standard curve was generated with rat insulin and was linear over the range of 5–400 microunits/ml insulin. Insulin secretion was normalized to total cellular protein (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Lactate accumulation was measured by sampling of 50–75 μl of HBBSS at the conclusion of the 3-h static incubation studies described above. Oxidation assays were performed as described previously (28Milburn Jr., J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, approximately 5 × 105 INS-1 cells (≈100 μg of protein) were transferred to a center well plastic cup connected to a rubber sleeve stopper. Approximately 105 cpm of 14C-labeled substrate ([U-14C]glucose or [U-14C]glycerol) was added to the suspension, and the cup was sealed within a 20-ml borosilicate glass scintillation vial by means of the sleeve stopper. Vials were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, after which 100 μl of HClO4 were added to the cells in the cup, followed by addition of 300 μl of methanolic hyamine hydroxide (1 m) to the bottom of the vials (both compounds were injected into the sealed vials through the sleeve stopper). Following a further 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, vials were unsealed, cups were removed and discarded, and 10 of ml BioSafe II scintillation mixture were added. Vials were allowed to equilibrate overnight, prior to liquid scintillation counting. Glycerol usage was assayed by inclusion of tracer [2-3H]glycerol (∼2500 cpm/nmol) in the aforementioned insulin secretion assay and measurement of3H2O production by previously described methods (17Becker T.C.

Following a 1 h preincubation in culture medium containing 2 mmglucose with or without 10 μm Triacsin-C, cells were incubated in culture medium with added [2-3H]- or [U-14C]glycerol for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by aspiration of the culture medium and addition of 20% methanol in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 250 μl of 0.2 mNaCl and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 750 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1) were added to the thawed cell suspension, and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 6,000 ×g. The top (aqueous) fraction was transferred to new tubes, and the bottom (lipid) layer was washed once with methanol:chloroform:water (48:3:47). [2-3H]Glycerol incorporated into these fractions was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in 10 ml of BioSafe II scintillation mixture. Pancreatic islets were isolated from 150–200-g Wistar rats, placed in culture, and treated with the AdCMV-GlpK and AdCMV-βGAL recombinant adenoviruses as described previously (17Becker T.C.

After exposure to virus, islets were cultured for an additional 48 h, after which 300–600 islets were transferred into Swinnex chambers and submerged in a 37 °C water bath. Islets were perifused at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, beginning with a 15-min equilibration with HBBSS supplemented with 2 mm glucose, and followed by perifusion with HBBSS supplemented with various secretagogues as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and 200 μl of each sample were used for insulin radioimmunoassay as described above. Two-tailed, two-sample Student'st test with pooled estimator of common variance was used for statistical comparison of experimental groups. The capacity of AdCMV-GlpK to direct expression of glycerol kinase mRNA in INS-1 cells was evaluated by RNA blot hybridization analysis and measurement of enzyme activity. A radiolabeled probe prepared from the GLUT-2 glucose transporter cDNA hybridized to a single 2.6-kilobase pair transcript in both AdCMV-βGAL- and AdCMV-GlpK-treated INS-1 cells. In contrast, a probe prepared from the bacterial glycerol kinase gene hybridized to a 2.2-kilobase pair transcript only in the AdCMV-GlpK-treated cells (data not shown). The level of glycerol kinase enzymatic activity was proportional to the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of AdCMV-GlpK (Fig.1 A). Thus the lowest m.o.i. tested (2.5 plaque forming units/cell) caused an approximate doubling of glycerol kinase activity above the background level measured in AdCMV-βGAL-treated cells. Treatment of cells with higher viral titers caused a progressive increase in glycerol kinase activity, such that at an m.o.i. of 100, the activity was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that measured in cells treated with AdCMV-βGAL. Use of the AdCMV-βGAL virus at an m.o.i. of 25 and staining of the cells with the β-galactosidase chromogenic substrate revealed essentially 100% efficiency of gene transfer in INS-1 cells (data not shown), as we have previously shown for other cell lines (29Ferber S. BeltrandelRio H. Johnson J.H. Noel R.J. Cassidy L.E. Clark S. Becker T.C. Hughes S.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11523-11529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin secretion in response to the combination of 3 mm glucose and 5 mm glycerol was assayed in cells treated with AdCMV-GlpK or AdCMV-βGAL over the same range of m.o.i. values as studied for glycerol kinase activity. We chose to include 3 mm glucose because this concentration is itself not stimulatory for insulin secretion, but does provide a basal level of the hexose (22Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 130: 167-178Crossref Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) (see also data of Fig. 3). All INS-1 cells treated with the control virus AdCMV-βGAL secreted the same amount of insulin (approximately 35 microunits/mg of protein/h) regardless of the m.o.i. used (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of cells with AdCMV-GlpK increased insulin secretion by approximately 4-fold relative to AdCMV-βGAL-treated cells, to around 150 microunits/mg of protein/h. Interestingly, for the range of m.o.i. chosen, the lowest viral titer used was equally effective as the highest in conferring enhanced responsiveness to the combination of fuels. We conclude that expression of glycerol kinase in INS-1 cells, even at relatively low levels, confers a glycerol-stimulated insulin secretion response that is absent in control cells. An m.o.i. of 25, falling in the middle of the range studied, was chosen for all subsequent experiments. To determine whether glycerol kinase expression confers glycerol-stimulated insulin secretion in normal islets as it does in INS-1 cells, pancreatic islets were isolated from normal Wistar rats and treated with AdCMV-GlpK or AdCMV-βGAL. Four days later, insulin secretion was studied by perifusion (Fig. 2). Basal insulin secretion during perifusion with 1 mm glucose was the same in AdCMV-GlpK- and AdCMV-βGAL-treated islets. Addition of 5 mm glycerol to this basal perifusate resulted in an approximate 2-fold increase in insulin secretion over the base line from AdCMV-GlpK-treated cells (from 6.9 ± 1.2 to 13.7 ± 1.7 microunits/ml, measured as the average insulin secreted over the respective 15-min perifusion periods), but had no effect on insulin secretion from AdCMV-βGAL-treated cells. Return to the basal perifusate (1 mm glucose without glycerol) restored insulin secretion to the original base line in AdCMV-GlpK-treated cells. Finally, addition of 20 mm glucose and 5 mmglycerol to the perifusion buffer stimulated insulin secretion to a similar degree in AdCMV-GlpK- and AdCMV-βGAL-treated islets (2.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively). At the end of the study, islets were recovered from the perifusion chambers and assayed for glycerol kinase activity. Homogenates from islets transduced with AdCMV-GlpK contained glycerol phosphorylating activity of 371 ± 36 nmol glycerol/mg of protein/h, while no glycerol kinase activity was detectable in homogenates from AdCMV-βGAL-transduced islets. These data demonstrate that INS-1 cells and isolated islets are similar in that they do not normally express glycerol kinase at detectable levels or respond to glycerol by secreting insulin, but both cell preparations gain a glycerol-stimulated insulin secretion response upon expression of the glycerol kinase gene. Based on these findings, all further studies were conducted with INS-1 cells. We next determined the glycerol concentration dependence of insulin secretion from AdCMV-GlpK-treated INS-1 cells. These studies were conducted in the presence and absence of 3 mm glucose and are summarized in Fig. 3. In the absence of glucose, 0.5 mmglycerol had no effect on insulin secretion, but 1 mmglycerol caused a 1.7-fold increase in insulin secretion relative to the base line level of 53 microunits/mg of protein/h, while 5 mm glycerol caused the maximal 3.6-fold enhancement (Fig.3 A). In other experiments that included glycerol concentrations between 1 and 5 mm, 2 mmglycerol was found to be sufficient to stimulate maximal insulin release (see Fig. 5). Addition of 3 mm glucose in the absence of glycerol had no effect on insulin secretion relative to cells incubated in the complete absence of substrates. However, inclusion of this nonstimulatory concentration of glucose caused a shift in the glycerol dose response, such that 0.5 mmglycerol now caused a 1.8-fold increase in secretion over the baseline of 67 microunits/mg of protein/h achieved by 3 mm glucose alone (p < 0.001). Furthermore, maximal insulin secretion, equivalent to that achieved with 5 or 10 mmglycerol alone, was achieved at 1 mm glycerol when 3 mm glucose was present (Fig. 3 A). In parallel experiments, a maximal stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin secretion of approximately 4-fold above base line, similar to the maximal glycerol-stimulated response, was observed at concentrations of ≥ 10 mm glucose (data not shown). A clear illustration of the left shift in the glycerol response curve that is elicited by the inclusion of a glucose concentration (3 mm) that is itself not stimulatory is provided by plotting the data as relative insulin secretion versus glycerol concentration (Fig.3 B). Thus, glucose potentiates insulin secretion at low glycerol levels, but mixing of the two substrates does not increase maximal insulin output beyond that achieved with high levels of glucose or glycerol alone. Expression of glycerol kinase in islet beta cells allows glycerol to function as a secretagogue with a potency similar to that of glucose (see Figs. 1, 2, 3). To learn more about the signal transduction pathways involved, we carried out a series of experiments in which we compared the metabolic fate of glucose and glycerol in these cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, at the doses that are maximally effective for stimulation of insulin secretion, more [U-14C]glucose is oxidized than [U-14C]glycerol in AdCMV-GlpK-treated INS-1 cells, expressing the data as total nanomoles of CO2 produced/mg of cellular protein/h. Thus, glucose was oxidized to produce 75 nmol of CO2/mg of protein/h at basal glucose levels (3 mm) and 162 nmol of CO2/mg of protein/h when glucose was raised to 10 mm (a further increase in glucose to 20 mm did not result in any further enhancement in glucose oxidation). In comparison, glycerol was oxidized at a rate of 44 nmol of CO2/mg of protein/h at basal glycerol concentrations (0.5 mm), and at a r"

The ADH system is the major pathway for the metabolism of beverage ethanol as well as biological important alcohols or aldehydes like retinol, 3β-hydroxysteroids, ω-hydroxy fatty acids, and 4-hydroxynonenal (1Edenberg H.J.

Each isoenzyme in the ADH family is a dimer comprised of two 40-kDa subunits. The individual subunits are comprised of two domains, a catalytic domain and a coenzyme-binding domain (4Eklund H.

Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as well as the structure of a cod liver ADH isoenzyme (14Ramaswamy S. Mustapha E.A. Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Eklund H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, an increasingly diverse structural data base exists from which information concerning the determinants of substrate recognition can be obtained by comparing the structures and kinetic properties of ADH isoenzymes. Important amino acids within the substrate-binding site directly affect the substrate specificity of the human ADH isoenzymes (TableI). For instance, γ1γ1 ADH, which has a Ser at residue 48, is the only human isoenzyme able to bind and oxidize 3β-hydroxysteroids (15Höög J.-O. Eklund H. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions within the loops comprised of residues 55–61 and of residues 113–121 in χχ ADH cause these loops to adopt new conformations and contribute to the enzyme's inability to be saturated with ethanol (13Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on the β1β1 isoenzyme indicate that residues 93 and 94 account for the increased catalytic efficiency toward secondary alcohols exhibited by αα, relative to β1β1 (16Hurley T.D.

The K m for ethanol exhibited by ςς ADH is 215-fold higher than that for hexanol (9Stone C.L. Thomasson H.R. Bosron W.F. Li T.-K. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, ςς ADH exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency for the oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal among the known human ADH isoenzymes (19Yang Z.-N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The production of all-trans-retinal from retinol is thought to be the rate-controlling step for the production of all-trans-retinoic acid (20Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13592-13597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an important regulator of gene expression during embryonic development (21Allenby G. Bocquel M.-T. Saunders M. Kazmer S.

The pathway of retinoic acid biosynthesis involves retinoid-binding proteins, which may provide a mechanism to discriminate specific dehydrogenases from nonspecific dehydrogenases (22Napoli J.L. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Retinol, in vivo, is bound to the cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). Evidence has been presented showing that holo-CRBP serves as substrate for microsomal dehydrogenases (22Napoli J.L. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and that CRBP may then transfer retinal to the cytosolic retinal dehydrogenase for oxidation to retinoic acid. Complete dependence on the CRBP pathway for retinoic acid production may deny accessibility of retinol to ςς ADH in vivo. However, retinoic acid synthesis during embryogenesis was reported to correlate spatiotemporally with the expression of class IV ADH gene (23Ang H.L. Deltour L. Hayamizu T.F. Zgombic-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It was proposed that competitive inhibition by ethanol consumed during pregnancy can reduce retinoic acid synthesis and may contribute to the development of fetal alcohol syndrome (24Pullarkat R.K. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1991; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Stone C.L. Bosron W.F. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 892-899Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the structural basis for substrate recognition in ςς ADH through x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. By comparing the structures of the known human ADH substrate-binding sites, it may be possible to gain a more complete understanding of their roles in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous alcohols. The cDNA for the ς subunit (5Kedishvili N.Y. Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Hurley T.D. Peggs C.F. Thomasson H.R. Popov K.M. Carr L.G. Edenberg H.J. Li T.-K. J. Biol.

The lysate was first mixed with DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, at 4 °C, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The unbound proteins were eluted in a batch procedure and then were buffer exchanged into 7 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 1 mm DTT using the Minitan apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and loaded onto a 5- × 15-cm S-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with a linear sodium phosphate gradient from 7 to 65 mm. The enzyme was dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 1 mm DTT and applied to a 2.5- × 10-cm Affi-Gel Blue column (Bio-Rad). The enzyme was then eluted with a linear gradient from 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.4, to 100 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 1 mm DTT. The purified ςς ADH was dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT and concentrated with a Microcon 30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) before crystallization. The sitting drop method was employed to crystallize the protein. Typically 2 μl of an 8 mg/ml ςς ADH solution was mixed with 2 μl of the precipitant solution in the drop. The optimized crystallization conditions for ςς ADH complexed with NAD+ were 100 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, 50–100 mm zinc acetate, 7.5 mm NAD+, and 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. The crystals formed as flat parallelepipeds overnight and grew to maximal size in 1 or 2 more days. Single-stranded ςς cDNA in the M13HinEco1 vector (26Edenberg H.J. Dailey T.L. Zhang K. Weiner H. Flynn T.G. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. 2. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 181-192Google Scholar) was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. A single oligonucleotide, 45 bases in length, was used to mutate residues Phe-309 and Cys-317 to Leu and Ala, respectively. Following identification of the correct mutant clone by DNA sequencing, the mutant cDNA was subcloned into pKK223-3 and completely sequenced, prior to expression, to ensure that no unwanted mutations were present in the cDNA sequence. The mutant enzyme, ς309L317A, was expressed and purified using the same procedure as described for the wild-type enzyme. The kinetic measurements were evaluated at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, on a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. Enzyme activity was monitored by following the production of NADH at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1.V max values were converted to turnover numbers assuming a molecular mass of 40 kDa per subunit. TheK m values for substrates were determined at a fixed NAD+ concentration of 2.5 mm, except those for 1-butanol which were determined both at 2.5 mmNAD+ and by co-variation of NAD+ and 1-butanol. All kinetic experiments were evaluated using the kinetic programs of Cleland (27Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). All reported values are expressed as the means of at least three separate experiments with their associated standard deviations. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 3 Å. Higher resolution data were observed initially (2.6 Å), but severe radiation decay and the inability to flash-cool these crystals prevented collection of the higher resolution data. Four crystals (approximate dimensions, 0.3 × 0.15 × 0.07 mm3) were used to collect the native data set at room temperature on a Rigaku 200HB rotating anode generator equipped with an RAXIS IIC image plate area detector with a crystal-to-detector distance of 145 mm. The data collection statistics are listed in Table II. All crystals exhibited radiation decay and were replaced every 12 h. The diffraction data were indexed, merged, and scaled using the RAXIS IIC data processing software (38Hagashi T. RAXIS IIC data processing software.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program package AMoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and the data between 15.0 and 4.0 Å. The β1β1 ADH ternary complex dimer with NAD+ and the inhibitor 4-iodopyrazole (Protein Data Bank code 1DEH (13Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) served as the search model for these calculations. The correlation coefficients for the top two rotation solutions were 25.7 and 19.7, respectively. After the positions for the two dimers in the asymmetric unit were found, the starting model possessed a correlation coefficient of 54.7 and an R value of 39.9%. All subsequent model refinement was performed using the program package X-PLOR (version 3.1) (29Brünger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). Rigid-body refinement of the initial model structure with the data between 8.0 and 3.5 Å broughtR work from 40.2 to 37.7% andR free from 40.5 to 37.3%. The atomic positions were refined to 3 Å using the positional refinement protocol in X-PLOR (30Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and an overall temperature factor of 25 Å2. The resulting structure was inspected using 2F o −F c and F o −F c maps in CHAIN (31Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 224-226Crossref Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were introduced as their positions were identified during refinement. Additional solvent zinc cations and solvent acetate molecules were added when strong positive F o −F c electron density indicated their presence. In the last refinement procedure, an overall temperature factor for each subunit was refined, and the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were removed. The final model possesses an average r.m.s.d. of 0.2 Å for the main chain atoms in the four subunits of the asymmetric unit. Cα alignments between ςς and β1β1isoenzymes were performed using LSQKAB (32Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1978; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar) in CCP4 (1994) suite and displayed using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA). NAD+, grade I and DTT were purchased from Boehringer Mannhein, and PEG 6000 was purchased from Hampton Research; ethanol was purchased from Midwest Grain (Pekin, IL). All other reagents were from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. The structure of the human class IV, or ςς, ADH isoenzyme was solved to 3.0 Å by molecular replacement using the 2.2-Å structure of the class I human β1β1 isoenzyme (12Davis G.J. Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Owusu-Dekyi K. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17057-17061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as the starting model. The final refined structure possesses an R workof 22.5% with an R free of 30.5% (Table II). The stereochemistry of this model was inspected using the program package PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The Ramachadram plot showed that 98.6%, or 1471, of the 1492 residues were in the preferred and allowed regions, and 1.4%, or 21, of the residues were in the generously allowed region. No non-glycine residues were found in the disallowed region. Due to the presence of zinc acetate in the mother liquor, 8 solvent zinc cations and 10 acetate ions were identified as bound to the enzyme. There was an acetate ion present in the substrate pocket in all four subunits. A ςς ADH mutant, ς309L317A, was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. Two residues in the ςς isoenzyme, Phe-309 and Cys-317, were mutated to Leu and Ala, respectively. The choice of these two positions for mutagenesis was based on their unique characteristics compared with class I enzymes (Table I). Residue 309 is in the substrate-binding pocket, and residue 317 is behind the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. The substrate specificity of this mutant was studied and compared with wild-type ςς ADH (Table III). Mutations at these two residues dramatically increase the K m values toward small alcohol substrates. For instance, the mutant enzyme exhibits aK m for ethanol that is 100-fold higher than the wild-type ςς ADH. Interestingly, the K m values for substrates with five or more carbons are less affected. TheK m values for hexanol and retinol are essentially unaffected by these mutations. As the chain length for straight alcohols increases, theV max/K m of the mutant enzyme increases to a greater extent than does the wild-type enzyme. TheK m value for NAD+ was approximately 2 times higher than the wild-type enzyme, whereas theK i(NAD+) value obtained from experiments varying both 1-butanol and NAD+ concentrations was identical with the wild-type enzyme (0.75 ± 0.03 mm).Table IIIKinetic constants of human ςς, ς309L317A mutant, and β1β1 ADHs at 25 °CK mV max/K mβ1β1Mutantςςβ1β1Mutantςςmmmin−1mm −1Ethanol0.052920 ± 37028 801.1 ± 0.2 651-Propyl alcohol0.019330 ± 551.391603.2 ± 0.6 5701-Butanol0.01251 ± 80.7924033 ± 626401-Pentanol0.0291.9 ± 0.40.28190510 ± 7534001-Hexanol0.0220.18 ± 0.020.132006300 ± 7809000All-trans-retinol0.0450.049 ± 0.0110.031 20250 ± 351900NAD+0.0150.529 ± 0.0150.262703-aCalculated for ethanol oxidation.55903-aCalculated for ethanol oxidation.70803-aCalculated for ethanol oxidation.The kinetic constants were determined at pH 7.4 or 7.5 for recombinant ADHs, except for the K m for NAD+ of ςς ADH, which was determined from the stomach isolated enzyme.

An alignment of the Cα atoms, excluding residues 113–120 and 244–262, in the dimeric ςς and β1β1 isoenzymes gives a r.m.s.d. of 0.60 Å. Alignment of the individual domains within each subunit yields similar results, with r.m.s.d. values of 0.49 Å for the catalytic domain and 0.61 Å for the coenzyme-binding domain. Cα alignment of ςς ADH with horse and other human ADHs shows that its structure is most similar to the human and horse liver class I ADH isoenzymes. Unlike the recently reported structures of the human class III χχ isoenzyme (13Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the ADH isoenzyme from cod liver (14Ramaswamy S. Mustapha E.A. Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Eklund H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), both of which exhibited semi-open domain structures, the human ςς isoenzyme exhibits a fully closed conformation of the catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains when NAD(H) is bound. The alignments reveal that, relative to β1, there are two major structural differences in each domain of the ς subunit (Fig. 1). In the coenzyme binding domain, the largest difference occurs at the C terminus of an α-helix comprised of residues 251–258 and the following turn. This structural change results from the substitutions of the two Gly residues at positions 260 and 261 in β1β1 by two Asn residues in ςς ADH. The main chain conformations of Gly-260 and -261 in the β1β1 isoenzyme are incompatible with the presence of side chains, thus the main chain path must shift dramatically to accommodate Asn residues at positions 260 and 261. Relative to β1β1 ADH, the Cα atoms of residues 244–262 in ςς ADH shift, on average, by 1.8 Å, with a maximum of 4.8 Å at residue 261. The other structural difference in the coenzyme-binding domain involves residues 297–309, which are located at the dimer interface and within the substrate-binding pocket of the neighboring subunit. One structural difference in the catalytic domain involves residues 17–25 and is not likely to affect enzymatic activity or subunit interactions. The other structural difference within the catalytic domain is due to the deletion of residue 117, which shortens the loop at the entrance to the substrate-binding pocket in ςς ADH. Cα alignment between ςς and χχ, with each domain aligned separately and then the results combined, reveals that in addition to those differences between ςς and β1β1, ςς and χχ differ substantially at both N and C termini (Fig. 1). Moreover, great differences exist at residues 55–61 and 112–120. Both regions adopt new conformations in χχ ADH and contribute to a larger active site in χχ ADH (13Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our structural comparisons also reveal that there is no evidence that the interaction between coenzyme and residue 223 is weakened in ςς ADH, as was suggested by a modeling study (34Moreno A. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In fact, the hydrogen-bonding distances between adenosine ribose oxygens and γ oxygens of Asp-223 are within the range of 2.6–2.7 Å in both ςς and β1β1 ADHs. The alcohol binding pocket is an extension of the coenzyme binding site (4Eklund H. Nordström B. Zeppezauer E. Söderlund G. Ohlsson I. Boiwe T. Söderberg B.-O. Tapia O. Brändén C.-I. Åkeson Å. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 27-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and is fully formed only after coenzyme binding has occurred. In ςς ADH, the substrate pocket is a cylinder having dimensions of approximately 16 by 7 by 6 Å. The substrate specificity for this enzyme is determined by surface complementarity between the enzyme and the substrates throughout this cylinder. Changes in theK m values are related to the effective concentration of the ES complex. Mutations can affectK m by changing the ratio of productiveversus non-productive encounters with the enzyme. In ADH, these changes are brought about either through steric exclusion (preventing productive binding), as seen for the binding of secondary alcohols to β1β1 ADH (16Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), or by changing the number of non-productive conformations permitted by altering the accessible volume of the active site (13Yang Z.-N. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inner part of the alcohol site (near the catalytic zinc) includes residues 48 and 93 and the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. ςς ADH has aK m value for ethanol that is 560-fold higher than β1β1 ADH (Table III). One possible cause for this difference may be the substitution of Cys for Ala-317 near the nicotinamide ring. To accommodate its longer side chain in ςς ADH, the main chain atoms of residue 317 move ∼1 Å away from Thr-186, toward the carboxamide group relative to β1β1 ADH (Fig. 2). To avoid unfavorable contacts with the Cys-317 carbonyl oxygen, the plane of nicotinamide ring appears to twist in ςς ADH, relative to its position in the β1β1 isoenzyme (Figs. 2 and3), This twist creates more space between the nicotinamide ring and the catalytic zinc in ςς ADH (Fig. 3). In addition to these changes, Thr-48 and Phe-93 also shift away from the catalytic zinc. The distance between the Cα atoms of these two residues is 0.9 Å longer in ςς ADH. Consequently, smaller substrates, such as ethanol, are not as conformationally constrained in this active site as in the β1β1 ADH. Thus, a higher concentration of ethanol is required to produce an equivalent number of productively bound conformations.Figure 3Comparison of the active site in ςς and β1β1 ADH isoenzymes. a, superposition of the active site between two isoenzymes.

Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Hurley T.D. Peggs C.F. Thomasson H.R. Popov K.M. Carr L.G. Edenberg H.J. Li T.-K. J. Biol.

Pyrazole and its 4-substituted derivatives competitively inhibit the binding of alcohol substrates through the formation of a tight enzyme·NAD+·inhibitor complex (35Theorell H. Yonetani T. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 255-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which pyrazole nitrogens interact with both zinc and NAD+. We speculate the bond between the pyrazole nitrogen atom and the C-4 atom on the nicotinamide ring may be distorted due to the twist of the nicotinamide ring in ςς ADH. In fact, if the active sites of the ςς and β1β1 structures are aligned and the position of 4-iodopyrazole in the β1β1active site structure is used to examine the geometric constraints on pyrazole binding to the ςς structure, the corresponding angle between the C-4–N-1 and the N-1–N-2 bond is 133°, while it is close to 120° in the β1β1 structure, corresponding to a low energy, stable complex. This angular difference would undoubtedly represent a higher energy conformation and could account for up to 2.7 kcal/mol of the observed difference (3.8 kcal/mol) using a harmonic potential with a force constant of 0.27 kcal/(mol·degree) (36Page M.I. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1973; 2: 295-323Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the increased distances between the N-1 of pyrazole and the C-4 of the nicotinamide ring (by 0.3 Å) and between residues 48 and 93, where pyrazole is held, could contribute to lowering the affinity for 4-methylpyrazole. The middle region of the substrate pocket, which plays an important role in the interactions with the aliphatic tail of longer substrates, such as butanol and pentanol, includes residues 57, 141, 294, and 309. Like many other ADH isoenzymes, ςς ADH exhibitsK m values for primary straight chain alcohols, which decrease with increasing chain length, whereas theV max values remain relatively constant. Thus, the catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) increases with increasing chain length. For example, theV max/K m for hexanol is 138-fold higher than that for ethanol in ςς ADH (Table III). In contrast, the V max/K m values for β1β1 ADH vary only 2- to 3-fold for substrates from ethanol to hexanol. These different characteristics can be explained by differences in the amino acids within the middle region of the substrate pocket. The key amino acids within this region are residues 57, 141, and 309. β1β1 ADH possesses Leu residues at all these positions, and their side chains do not appear to create new productive interactions as substrates get longer (Table III). The presence of Phe at position 309, Met at position 141, and Met at position 57, in ςς ADH, narrows the middle region of the substrate pocket compared with β1β1 (Fig. 3). The twist on the nicotinamide ring also contributes to a shift in Phe-309, to avoid unfavorable contact with NAD(H), which further narrows the channel leading to the catalytic zinc. Although this narrowing does not appear to directly aid the binding of ethanol, it can explain the decreasedK m values for propanol, butanol, and pentanol in the ςς isoenzyme relative to β1β1 ADH. Our modeling indicated that the side chain of residues 57 and 309 would interact with the substrates at the carbon 4, 5, and 6 positions, whereas the side chain of residue 141 interacts with carbon 3 and 4. In the ς309L317A mutant, the K m values for propanol, butanol, and pentanol are increased by 240-, 60-, and 7-fold, confirming the role of residues 309 and 317 in stabilizing the binding of these substrates. Moreover, the increase inV max/K m versus the chain length of the substrates is greater for the mutant than for the wild-type enzyme. This behavior in the mutant enzyme is due to a much lower V max/K m for small substrates, since the V max/K mvalues for hexanol approach those of the wild-type enzyme. The substitutions in the mutant enzyme thus appear to further widen the substrate-binding site, relative to ςς ADH, resulting in a greater number of permissible non-productive ES complexes. These changes in the mutant only affect substrates where binding is dependent on the local topology, such as ethanol, but do not significantly affect the catalytic efficiency toward hexanol or retinol. The outer part of the substrate-binding pocket is exposed to solvent and includes the loop comprised of residues 114–120 and residue 306 from the other subunit within the dimer. The deletion of residue 117 in ςς ADH shortens the loop comprised of residues 114–120 (Fig. 3) and widens the entrance to the substrate-binding site. In β1β1 ADH, Leu-116 appears to function as a door, opening to allow substrates in or out, but then closing to help keep in bound substrate (17Hurley T.D. Vessell D.L. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Holmes R. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. 5. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 321-325Google Scholar). Consistent with this function, its side chain was found to occupy different conformations in binary and ternary complexes (10Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Hamilton J.A. Amezel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In ςς ADH, the shift in the position of residue 116 due to the deletion of residue 117 does not permit its side chain to function in this manner, leaving an open substrate-binding site (Fig. 3). Widening of the bottleneck at position 116 in β1β1 ADH by mutagenesis dramatically increased the apparent K m values for primary and secondary alcohols (17Hurley T.D. Vessell D.L. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Holmes R. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. 5. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 321-325Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, ςς ADH has higher K m values than the β1β1 isoenzyme for straight chain alcohols and very poor efficiency toward all secondary alcohols (5Kedishvili N.Y. Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Hurley T.D. Peggs C.F. Thomasson H.R. Popov K.M. Carr L.G. Edenberg H.J. Li T.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3625-3630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TheK m for hexanol and retinol are virtually identical in the wild-type and mutant enzymes. With the enlarged entrance to the substrate pocket in the ςς isoenzyme, the structure of the middle and inner regions of the substrate pocket would seem to be best suited for the oxidation of long chain aliphatic alcohols, such as ω-hydroxy fatty acids, farnesyl alcohols, and retinol. To examine long chain alcohol binding, all-trans-retinol was docked into the active site using program AUTODOCK (37Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The results of this simulation confirm our previous results based on modeling studies (5Kedishvili N.Y. Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Hurley T.D. Peggs C.F. Thomasson H.R. Popov K.M. Carr L.G. Edenberg H.J. Li T.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3625-3630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the β-ionone ring of retinol binds at the widened entrance of the substrate-binding pocket, such that an extended conformation of retinol can be adopted. Thus, the ability to bind retinol in a more extended and, presumably, lower energy conformation in ςς ADH could account for its higher catalytic efficiency."

We have constructed a series of single mutant proteins at Ala52, and double mutant proteins, in which Ala52 was replaced by Gly, Val, Ile, Leu, or Phe, and Val74 was replaced by Ala or Leu. All of these mutant proteins, except for A52W, A52R, and A52G/V74A, were overproduced and purified. Measurement of the thermal denaturations of the proteins at pH 3.2 by CD suggests that the cavity is large enough to accommodate three methyl or methylene groups without creating serious strains. A correlation was observed between the protein stability and the hydrophobicity of the substituted residue. As a result, a number of the mutant proteins were more stable than the wild-type protein. The stabilities of the mutant proteins with charged or extremely bulky residues at the cavity were lower than those expected from the hydrophobicities of the substituted residues, suggesting that considerable strains are created at the mutation sites in these mutant proteins. However, examination of the far- and near-UV CD spectra and the enzymatic activities suggest that all of the mutant proteins have structures similar to that of the wild-type protein.

The data thus far accumulated suggest that the following phenomena are characteristic to the core mutations. 1) Mutations do not completely abolish the protein functions, unless the hydrophobicity at the core is considerably changed. This means that the hydrophobicity is a sufficient criterion for the formation of a functional core. 2) Mutations to smaller hydrophobic residues usually create cavities, which are either vacant (9Eriksson A.E.

J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The protein stability decreases as the volume of such a cavity increases. In this case, the cost for the loss of a single methylene group has been reported to be 1.3 ± 0.5 kcal/mol (30Pace C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). 3) Mutations to much larger hydrophobic residues or those to polar residues seriously affect the protein structures due to unfavorable interactions in the cores, and thereby almost completely abolish the protein functions. These mutations also dramatically destabilize the proteins.Although the packing of the hydrophobic side chains is highly efficient in the interiors of globular proteins, it is not perfect, and cavities exist in virtually all large proteins, even within the protein cores (31Connolly M.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 28: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Rashin A.A. Iofin M. Honig B.

These cavities may be required to make the proteins highly functional, probably at the cost of reduced stability, because they serve to reduce the strains caused by dense packing of the hydrophobic side chains, and to provide conformational flexibility to proteins. Therefore, it seems likely that the tolerance of proteins to core mutations increases as the volume of the naturally existing cavity at the core increases.Escherichia coli RNase HI, 1The abbreviation used is: RNase HI, ribonuclease HI. 1The abbreviation used is: RNase HI, ribonuclease HI.which hydrolyzes only the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrids, is a small globular protein with 155 amino acid residues.

This protein is suitable for these studies for the following reasons: (i) highly refined coordinates of this protein are available (46Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M. Matsushima M. Ishikawa M. Kanaya S. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. Matsuzaki T. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 1029-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), (ii) an overproduction system for this protein is available (36Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 28: 117-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and (iii) this protein reversibly unfolds in a single cooperative fashion with thermal and chemical denaturations (38Kimura S. Nakamura H. Hashimoto T. Oobatake M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21535-21542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the hydrophobic core of this protein, a cavity exists, which is not occupied by water molecules. We have previously shown that cavity-filling mutations, such as Val74 → Leu and Ile, enhanced the protein stability by roughly 1 kcal/mol in ΔG(14Ishikawa K. Nakamura H. Morikawa K. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6171-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also found by random mutagenesis experiments that the mutation of Ala52 → Val also enhanced the protein stability by 1.7 kcal/mol, probably due to the reduction in the cavity volume around the mutation site (42Haruki M. Noguchi E. Akasako A. Oobatake M. Itaya M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26904-26911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results allowed us to propose that the replacement of a hydrophobic residue facing the cavity with a bulkier and more hydrophobic residue is a general method to increase protein stability. However, proteins are not always stabilized by this method. Karpusas et al. (1Karpusas M. Baase W.A. Matsumura M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8237-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found two large cavities in T4 lysozyme and designed two mutations (Leu133 → Phe and Ala129 → Val) to fill them. Eijsink et al. (8Eijsink V.G.H. Dijkstra B.W. Vriend G. van der Zee J.R. Veltman O.R. van der Vinne B. van den Burg B. Kempe S. Venema G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) introduced various mutations to fill the cavities in the neutral protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus. None of these mutations resulted in a significant increase in the protein stability. It was shown for the T4 lysozyme mutants that the hydrophobic effects gained by the mutation were canceled by the strains and van der Waals contacts. Determination of the crystal structures of the RNase HI mutants revealed that the conformation of the cavity was not seriously altered by the mutation, except for the mutation site, and the cavity volume around the mutation site was remarkably reduced (14Ishikawa K. Nakamura H. Morikawa K. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6171-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the conformation of the cavity in the hydrophobic core of E. coli RNase HI is rather rigid and stable. The difference in the conformational stability of the cavity may affect the dependence of the protein stability on the cavity-filling mutation. To examine whether E. coli RNase HI is tolerant to mutations in which polar or extremely bulky side chains are introduced into the cavity, we have constructed a series of single and double mutant proteins at Ala52 and Val74, and have analyzed their conformational stabilities and enzymatic activities.Here we report that the size of the cavity in the hydrophobic core ofE. coli RNase HI is large enough to introduce three methyl or methylene groups without causing significant steric hindrance. The thermal stabilities of a series of the mutant proteins suggest that this cavity is more effectively filled by the double mutations (Ala52 → Val and Val74 → Leu) than by the single mutation (Ala52 → Ile). We also report that this cavity seems to be conformationally fairly stable and the protein is tolerant to mutations that seriously affect the hydrophobicity and the packing of the cavity residues. Thus, the structure of this protein was not severely damaged when the cavity residues were replaced by either aromatic or charged residues, although these mutations greatly reduced both the protein stability and the enzymatic activity.DISCUSSIONAs previously reported for a series of tryptophan synthase α subunit mutants (52Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Tsujita T. Sugino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4441-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and T4 lysozyme mutants (53Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) with multiple amino acid substitutions at a unique position in the protein interior, a correlation was observed between the changes in the thermal stability (ΔΔG m) and the hydrophobicities of the substituted residues for the RNase HI variants with a series of mutations at Ala52 (Fig. 5). However, the data for the RNase HI variants substituted with Tyr, Phe, His, Lys, Pro, and Gly do not fall on the straight line that was obtained from a least-square fit of the data for 12 proteins with Ile, Leu, Cys, Val, Met, Ala, Thr, Ser, Gln, Asn, Glu, and Asp at position 52. The stabilities of the mutant proteins A52Y, A52F, A52H, A52K, A52P, and A52G are much lower than those expected from the hydrophobicities of the substituted residues.The mutant proteins A52Y, A52F, A52H, and A52K are unexpectedly unstable, probably because the introduction of an aromatic or ionized group into the cavity alters the protein conformation. In fact, the near-UV CD spectra of these mutant proteins are significantly different from that of the wild-type protein, whereas those of the other mutant proteins are similar to or only slightly different from that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). Of the six Trp residues in the protein molecule, Trp118 faces the cavity. Computer modeling suggests that this Trp residue is forced to change its orientation to avoid a collision with the bulky residues substituted for Ala52. 2R. Tanimura, personal communication. It is therefore likely that the changes in the near-UV CD spectra mainly reflect a conformational change of Trp118. This Trp residue, as well as other residues that are located around the cavity, may change their conformations, so that the strains caused by the introduction of an aromatic or ionized side chain into the cavity can be eliminated. However, these conformational changes must create additional interactions that are unfavorable for protein stability. Nevertheless, the mutant proteins A52Y, A52F, A52H, and A52K accumulated in the cells in an amount sufficient for purification. In contrast, the mutant proteins A52W and A52R did not accumulate in the cells. Since Trp and Arg are the largest aromatic and ionized residues, respectively, the mutations to these residues may create a serious conformational change that makes the protein extremely unstable. Considerable destabilization due to the introduction of aromatic residues or Arg into a space in the interior of the protein molecule has also been reported for the tryptophan synthase α subunit mutants (52Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Tsujita T. Sugino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4441-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).The stabilities of the RNase HI variants substituted with Glu and Asp were unexpectedly low, only when these residues were ionized. The poor cellular production levels of the mutant proteins A52E and A52D, and the normal cellular production level of A52H (data not shown), also suggest that these mutant proteins are considerably unstable only when the substituted residues are ionized. At around pH 7.0, at which the cells grow, Asp and Glu may be ionized, whereas His may not. Since the introduction of a polar group into the cavity neither unexpectedly destabilizes the protein nor seriously affects the near-UV CD spectrum of the protein, unless it is ionized, it seems likely that a polar group can be introduced into the cavity without creating significant strain. In addition to the hydrophobic residues that surround the cavity (Leu49, Ala52, Leu56, Leu67, Val74, Leu107, and Trp118), many hydrophobic residues, such as Val5, Ile7, Tyr22, Leu26, Tyr28, Phe35, Ile53, Leu59, Val65, Ile78, Leu103, Leu111, Ile116, and Trp120, form the hydrophobic core of the protein. The extensive hydrophobic interactions among these residues probably make the conformation of the cavity fairly stable and thereby make it tolerant of the mutations. In the wild-type protein, the cavity is vacant and is not occupied by water molecules. However, it remains to be determined whether the introduction of a polar group into the cavity is accompanied by the introduction of a water molecule.In contrast to the mutations to Tyr, Phe, His, and Lys, the mutations to Pro and Gly did not seriously affect the protein conformation, suggesting that these mutations do not create unfavorable van der Waals contacts within the cavity. Ala52 is located in the αI helix. Therefore, the instabilities of the mutant proteins A52P and A52G must reflect the intrinsic helix-destabilization associated with the mutation of Ala52 → Pro or Gly. Statistical analyses in natural proteins suggest that Pro is an α helix breaker, and the introduction of a Pro residue into an α helix kinks it by an average of 26 ± 5° (54Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). However, the similarities in the near-UV CD spectra and the enzymatic activity between the mutant protein A52P and the wild-type protein suggest that the conformation of the αI helix is not seriously affected by the mutation of Ala52 → Pro. Energy minimization was carried out to see the effect of the mutation of Ala52 → Pro on the protein structure by the molecular mechanics program PRESTO (55Morikami K. Nakai T. Kidera A. Saito M. Nakamura H. Comput. Chem. 1992; 16: 243-248Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The result supports the hypothesis that the αI helix is not appreciably kinked at the position where Pro is introduced (data not shown). The crystallographic (56Sauer U.H. Dao-pin S. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2393-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and computer (57Gray T.M. Arnoys E.J. Blankespoor S. Born T. Jagar R. Everman R. Plowman D. Stair A. Zhang D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) analyses for the structures of the mutant proteins of T4 lysozyme, in which Pro is introduced into α helices, also support this hypothesis. The long interdomain α helix in T4 lysozyme, which is originally kinked by 8.5°, was shown to be additionally kinked by only 5.5° by the mutation of Asp72 → Pro (56Sauer U.H. Dao-pin S. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2393-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mutant proteins of T4 lysozyme with Pro in the helix are dramatically less stable than the wild-type protein, by 2.7–8.2 kcal/mol. In contrast, the RNase HI mutant A52P is less stable than the wild-type protein by only 1.6 kcal/mol. In addition, this mutant protein is enzymatically fully active. The αI helix of E. coli RNase HI seems to be more tolerant to Pro substitutions than the α helices of T4 lysozyme, probably because the αI helix ofE. coli RNase HI is located in the interior of the protein molecule and is highly stabilized through extensive hydrophobic interactions with the rest of the protein. In fact, the mutation of either Ala51 or Ala55 → Pro within the αI helix neither seriously destabilizes the protein nor dramatically affects the enzymatic activity. 3M. Haruki, personal communication. The cavity-filling mutations effectively increase the stability ofE. coli RNase HI, probably because the conformation of the cavity is fairly stable. Some of the stabilized mutant proteins, such as A52C and A52M, are enzymatically as active as the wild-type protein. Therefore, this cavity may not provide flexibility to the protein, which is required to make it enzymatically active. However, the enzymatic activity of the protein is rather sensitive to mutations within the cavity, probably because the cavity is located close to the active site. The determination of the kinetic parameters of the mutant proteins with poor RNase H activities suggests that the mutations within the cavity affect the catalytic efficiency, rather than the substrate binding (Table II). Some of the catalytic residues, such as Asp10 and Asp70, may change their conformations when the conformation of the cavity is altered. Comparison of the effects of the mutations on the enzymatic activity, the protein stability, and the near-UV CD spectrum suggests that the changes in the enzymatic activity roughly correlate with the changes in the CD spectrum. However, some of the mutant proteins with small changes in the CD spectrum, such as A52L and A52Q, are considerably less active than the wild-type protein. These results indicate that conformational changes around the cavity that affect the enzymatic activity are not always detected by measuring the near-UV CD spectrum. The CD spectra of mutant proteins A52L and A52Q were measured at pH 3.2, instead of pH 8.0, at which the enzymatic activity was determined. However, it is unlikely that the CD spectra of these mutant proteins are considerably changed at pH 8.0. In contrast to the correlation between the changes in the enzymatic activity and the near-UV CD spectrum, the changes in the enzymatic activity do not correlate with the changes in the protein stability.Analyses of the stabilities of a series of double mutant proteins, in which Ala52 and Val74 are simultaneously replaced by other hydrophobic residues, allow us to discuss the effects of the mutations within the cavity on the protein stability in more detail. The changes in stability and conformation induced by the single and double mutations at positions 52 (Ala52 → Ile) and 74 (Val74 → Ala and Leu) are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. The mutation of Val74 → Ala increases the cavity volume, whereas the mutation of Val74→ Leu decreases it. The former destabilizes the protein by 2.3 kcal/mol and the latter stabilizes it by 1.1 kcal/mol. The mutation of Ala52 → Ile increases the stability of the V74A mutant by 3.5 kcal/mol. These results indicate that a single methyl or methylene group contributes to increase the protein stability by 1.1 kcal/mol. This value is comparable to the empirically derived value of 1.3 ± 0.5 kcal/mol reported by Pace (30Pace C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The Ile side chain within the cavity of the V74A mutant probably does not create a strain. In contrast, the mutation of Ala52 → Ile increases the stabilities of the wild-type protein and the V74L mutant by only 1.9 and 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, it seems likely that the stabilizing effect caused by the burial of the additional methyl or methylene groups is partially or almost fully canceled by the destabilizing effect caused by the unfavorable van der Waals contacts in these proteins.Figure 6Schematic illustration of the conformational changes around the cavity and the stability changes induced by the mutations. A gray oval represents the structure formed by the cavity residues and a dark circle represents a vacant space (cavity). Larger the size of the dark circle is, larger the cavity volume is. The size of the structure formed by the cavity residues of the wild-type protein is shown by broken line(s) in the structures of the mutant proteins A52I and A52I/V74L to indicate that it increases by the mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dependence of the protein stability on the number of the methyl or methylene group(s) that are introduced into or removed from the cavity is shown in Fig. 7. It suggests that the volume of the cavity in the wild-type protein is large enough to allow the introduction of three methyl or methylene groups without creating considerable strain. However, the ΔΔG m value varied from 1.3 to 2.4 kcal/mol for the mutant proteins A52V/V74L, A52I, and A52L, in which three methyl or methylene groups are introduced into the cavity. This suggests that the shape of the substituted residue is important for the cavity-filling mutations. The A52I and A52L mutants are less stable than the A52V/V74L mutant by 0.6 and 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively, probably due to unfavorable packing effects. Similar effects have been observed for the core mutations in T4 lysozyme (6Dao-pin S. Anderson D.E. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11521-11529Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and N-terminal domain of λ repressor (7Lim W.A. Farruggio D.C. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, the cavity must be most effectively filled in the A52V/V74L mutant. However, the strains still contribute to destabilizing this mutant protein. If the introduction of the double mutation of Ala52 → Val and Val74 → Leu into the wild-type protein did not create strain, it would increase the protein stability by ∼3.3 kcal/mol. However, the A52V/V74L mutant is more stable than the wild-type protein by only 2.4 kcal/mol.Figure 7Plot of ΔΔG m as a function of the change in the number of the methyl or methylene group. The data for the wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins with aliphatic residues at positions 52 and 74 are shown. The ΔΔG m value of each mutant protein is presented in Tables I and III. The straight line represents the correlation between the ΔΔG m and the change in the number of methyl or methylene group, which is drawn based on the assumption that the burial of a single methyl or"

We have separated a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, epiphycan, from decorin and biglycan by using dissociative extraction of bovine fetal epiphyseal cartilage, followed by sequential ion-exchange, gel permeation, hydrophobic, and Zn2+chelate chromatographic steps. Epiphycan is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family, contains seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), is related to osteoglycin (osteoinductive factor) (Bentz, H., Nathan, R. M., Rosen, D.

The intact proteoglycan had a median size of ∼133 kDa. The core protein was 46 kDa by electrophoretic analysis, had a calculated size of 34,271 Da, and had two approximately equimolar N termini (APTLES … and ETYDAT …) separated by 11 amino acids. There were at least three O-linked oligosaccharides in the N-terminal region of the protein, based on blank cycles in Edman degradation and corresponding serine or threonine residues in the translated cDNA sequence. The glycosaminoglycans ranged in size from 23 to 34 kDa were more heterogeneous than those in other dermatan sulfate small leucine-rich proteoglycans and were found in the acidic N-terminal region of the protein core, N-terminal to the LRRs. A four-cysteine cluster was present at the N terminus of the LRRs, and a disulfide-bonded cysteine pair was present at the C terminus of the protein core. The seventh LRR and an N-linked oligosaccharide were between the two C-terminal cysteines.

Particularly abundant are aggrecan and the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs 1The abbreviations used are: SLRPs, small leucine-rich proteoglycans; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; PG, proteoglycan; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SLRPs, small leucine-rich proteoglycans; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; PG, proteoglycan; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.)

Several other proteoglycans in cartilage have also been identified, including versican, perlecan, and the leucine-rich proteoglycans lumican and biglycan. The relative abundance of these proteoglycans varies during development and by location within the tissue. It is likely that this variation has a role in the differentiation and maintenance of tissue structure. The exact roles of the SLRPs are unclear at present, but it is thought that fibromodulin and decorin are involved in the process of collagen fibrillogenesis (2Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 3Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may play a crucial role in optimizing the diameter of collagen fibrils that will eventually be replaced during remodeling of the cartilage during calcification. It is possible that the SLRPs also have a role in regulating growth factors, e.g. transforming growth factor-β, which binds to decorin (4Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 5Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegård D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). A hallmark of the SLRPs are the cysteine clusters that flank the leucine-rich repeats. These cysteines form disulfide bonds and perhaps provide a structure that differs from leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins that do not contain this feature. The LRR motif was first identified by Patthy (6Patthy L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is characterized by an LXXLXLXXNXL sequence, whereX is any amino acid and L is often a leucine, but may be any amino acid with a hydrophobic aliphatic side chain (Ile, Val, and Met). The LRR motif is conserved throughout evolution, and the increasing number of members of this family includes a range of proteins with diverse functions and distributions (reviewed by Kobe (7Kobe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar)). The three-dimensional structure of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor, a member of the leucine-rich protein family, has been determined (8Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In this protein, the 15 individual LRRs adopt a stacked β-sheet/α-helix hairpin structure, resulting in an overall horseshoe shape and indicating that the LRR is likely to be primarily a folding motif and not an indicator of function. By using a novel purification protocol, we have isolated milligram quantities of an LRR-containing proteoglycan from bovine fetal epiphysis and determined its primary structure. We have named this proteoglycan epiphycan based on its isolation from the epiphysis and show it to be a mammalian homolog of the avian proteoglycan PG-Lb, isolated from developing chick limb (9Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence is very similar to a recently published mouse cDNA-derived sequence (10Kurita K. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Zako M. Kida D. Iwata H. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unlike other cartilage-derived LRR-containing proteoglycans and glycoproteins, epiphycan contains only seven LRRs instead of the more usual 10 or 11. We show that all of the glycosylation, with the exception of one N-linked oligosaccharide, occurs in the N-terminal domain. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was from Research Plus Laboratories.

Trypsin (sequencing-grade) and endoprotease Lys-C were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Zeta-probe GT membrane was purchased from Bio-Rad. Dermatan sulfate proteoglycans were isolated from bovine fetal epiphyseal cartilage, as described previously for skin and bovine articular cartilage, by ion-exchange followed by gel permeation chromatography (11Choi H.U.

The DEAE-bound and eluted proteoglycan-containing fractions from the gel permeation chromatography were applied to an octyl-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 2 m GdnHCl and 0.15 m sodium acetate, pH 6.3, at 25 °C and allowed to bind for 2 h. The column was washed with 3 volumes of 2 m GdnHCl, and the proteoglycans were eluted with a linear gradient of 2–6 mGdnHCl. Fractions were analyzed for uronate, revealing the presence of two major peaks. Fractions containing both epiphycan and decorin were pooled; concentrated to 5 mg/ml with an Amicon YM-2 filter; and dialyzed against 4 m GdnHCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Chelating Sepharose (50 ml) was charged with 500 ml of ZnCl2 (2 mg/ml) and then washed with water. The gel was packed into a 60-ml water-jacketed column on top of 10 ml of uncharged chelating Sepharose and equilibrated with 500 ml of Chelex 100-treated 0.15 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The concentrated and dialyzed eluate from the octyl-Sepharose column, containing a mixture of decorin and epiphycan, was dialyzed against Chelex-treated equilibration buffer and applied to the column. The sample was allowed to bind for 2 h at 25 °C. The column was eluted with 0.15 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 (300 ml), followed by a linear pH gradient from pH 8 to 4 (total volume of 300 ml). Fractions (7.2 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 40 ml/h and were monitored for uronate, protein, and pH and by SDS-PAGE. Protein and peptide samples were sequenced by established methods using an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer with on-line detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives on a 120A microbore HPLC. A purified sample of epiphycan was applied to an acetonitrile-wetted polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a ProSpin™ centrifugal filter, washed with water, and sequenced. The same protocol was used to identify the Superdex 75V 0 peak (below). Initial peptide mapping was performed using trypsin and a mixture of epiphycan and decorin as the substrate. Peptides that were unique to the map of epiphycan-containing material, as compared with purified decorin, were sequenced. Peptides were separated by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 12 column, followed by reversed-phase HPLC of individual fractions as described elsewhere (13Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, purified epiphycan was digested overnight with endoprotease Lys-C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of ∼1:25 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 37 °C. The products of the digest were partially separated by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75 column prior to analysis. The void volume peak from the Superdex 75 column was identified as being from the N terminus by Edman degradation. It was dialyzed against trypsin digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and further digested with trypsin. The products further separated on a Superdex 75 column, followed by reversed-phase HPLC. In this case, fractions were also assayed for sulfated GAGs by the dimethyl methylene blue assay (14Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). Peptides are numbered in order from the N terminus to the C terminus. The letter preceding the number indicates which enzyme released the peptide from the parent protein. Thus, K-1-T-1 is the N-terminal peptide (T-1) derived from subdigestion of the N-terminal endoprotease Lys-C-derived peptide (K-1) with trypsin. Initial protein sequence data enabled us to design two degenerate oligonucleotide primers (forward primer, HTAYTTYTAYWSHMGVTTYAA; and reverse primer, CCVARBCKRTTRTTGSWNAT) that, based on sequence similarity to chick PG-Lb, would be expected to give a product of 230 base pairs. Reverse transcription-PCR of bovine chondrocyte RNA, with an annealing temperature of 40 °C, gave a band of the expected size, which was excised from an agarose gel. The PCR product was reamplified using similar primers modified withEcoRI and BamHI clamps at the 5′-ends and cloned into pBluescript™. Sequence analysis of the cloned insert indicated that the PCR product corresponded to the determined protein sequence. A bovine cDNA λZAP library kit (Stratagene) was used to produce a cDNA library from bovine epiphyseal cartilage mRNA prepared by the method of Smale and Sasse (15Smale G. Sasse J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed based on the sequence obtained from the previously obtained PCR product and the DNA sequence of the λZAP library arms. The entire coding region for bovine epiphycan was PCR-amplified and sequenced in both directions, either by sequence analysis of cloned PCR products or by direct sequencing of the PCR products using the originating PCR primers. The SLRPs epiphycan, decorin, and biglycan (50 μg each) were radiolabeled with 0.5 mCi of [125I]iodine by the chloramine-T method (16Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The labeled proteoglycan was separated from unincorporated Na125I on a PD-10 column, followed by a 1-ml mono-Q-Sepharose column. Labeled proteoglycans were further purified on a 0.5-ml DEAE-Sepharose column. The molecular masses of the intact proteoglycans were estimated by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 10/30 column that was eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in 4 m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and 0.05% CHAPS and that had been calibrated with14C-labeled molecular mass markers. The125I-labeled SLRPs epiphycan, decorin, and biglycan (400,000 cpm each) were digested with chondroitinase ABC (10 units/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris, 30 mmsodium acetate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin A. The125I-labeled core proteins were applied either to a Superose 6 column as described above or onto a 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine the molecular mass. Proteoglycans (50 μg) in 3 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, were precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol for 1 h at −20 °C. The precipitated material was collected by centrifugation for 15 min, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried in a Speedvac™. The proteoglycans were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.05 m NaOH containing 5 mCi of NaB3H4 at a final concentration of 1 m and allowed to react for 24 h at 45 °C. The samples were placed on ice; 1 m acetic acid was added dropwise until gas was no longer released; and the samples were then dried in a Speedvac™. The tritiated samples were washed twice in 10% methanol and dried again. Finally, the samples were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextran sulfate and applied to a 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The column was washed with equilibration buffer, and the GAGs were eluted with 2.5 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Fractions were analyzed for radioactivity and analyzed by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 10/30 column as described above. Molecular size estimates for GAG chains are based on the data of Wasteson (17Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Small proteoglycans were isolated from bovine fetal epiphyseal cartilage as described previously for skin and bovine articular cartilage (11Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L.

The resultant material (Fig.1) contained a mixture of small proteoglycans.Figure 1Gel permeation chromatography of SLRPs (decorin, biglycan, and epiphycan) from bovine fetal epiphyseal cartilage on Sepharose CL-4B in 4 m GdnHCl. Fractions (14 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 5 ml/h and monitored for protein (A 280) and uronate (A 520) using the m-phenylphenol reaction (upper panel) and by SDS-PAGE (lower panel). The first peak that eluted in the void volume had an anomalous color in the m-phenylphenol reaction. As shown in the toluidine blue-stained 4–20% gradient slab gel, the secondm-phenylphenol-positive peak eluted atK av = 0.4–0.7 and contained the dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, which were pooled as shown by thehorizontal bar at the top of the chromatogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proteoglycan-containing fractions from the gel permeation chromatography were applied to an octyl-Sepharose column. The proteoglycans were eluted with a linear gradient of increasing GdnHCl concentration. Fractions were analyzed for uronate, which revealed the presence of two major peaks (Fig. 2). The material in these peaks was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and peptide mapping. The results indicated that the first peak contained biglycan, and the second peak contained decorin and a second somewhat larger proteoglycan. This unknown proteoglycan gave rise to unique tryptic peptides, which, when sequenced, showed homology to avian PG-Lb. This proteoglycan was named epiphycan. Fractions containing either biglycan or a mixture of epiphycan and decorin were pooled separately. The pooled mixture of epiphycan and decorin was passed over chelating Sepharose charged with Zn2+. Decorin bound to the Zn2+-charged column, whereas epiphycan was not retained. The column was eluted with a linear pH gradient from pH 8 to 4. Epiphycan was completely separated from decorin in this chromatographic step as determined by monitoring for uronate, protein, and pH and by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The fractions containing epiphycan were pooled as shown and assessed for homogeneity by SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of epiphycan was estimated by gel permeation chromatography of a125I-labeled sample on a Superose 6 10/30 column. The elution position of the epiphycan proteoglycan (Fig. 4) was compared with those of decorin and biglycan isolated from the same tissue and with 14C-labeled molecular mass standards. The elution profile for 125I-epiphycan showed one major peak with an elution position at K av = 0.31, which corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼130,000 Da. Epiphyseal125I-decorin and 125I-biglycan each eluted as single peaks at K av = 0.34 (120 kDa) and 0.29 (150 kDa), respectively. The molecular masses of the 125I-labeled core proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. Epiphycan, decorin, and biglycan core proteins were of similar size and migrated into the resolving gel to a position equivalent to a protein of 46 kDa (Fig. 5). The size of the GAG chains was estimated by gel permeation chromatography after reductive β-elimination in the presence of3H-labeled sodium borohydride. The radiolabeled GAG chains were purified on DEAE-Sepharose and analyzed on a Superose 6 column (Fig. 6). The epiphycan 3H-labeled GAGs eluted as a heterogeneous peak at K av = 0.46–0.57, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼23,000–34,000 Da. Tritium-labeled GAG chains derived from decorin and biglycan each eluted as one major peak at K av = 0.57 (23 kDa) and 0.54 (25 kDa), respectively. An endoprotease Lys-C digestion of unreduced epiphycan followed by gel permeation chromatography and reversed-phase separation of the products resulted in the isolation of peptides that were subsequently sequenced (Table I). A search of the GenBank™ Data Bank confirmed that all of the peptide sequences were highly homologous to the sequence of PG-Lb (9Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence determined from these peptides covered most of the epiphycan core protein (Fig.7).Table IPeptides identified by direct protein sequence analysisPeptidePositionSequenceN terminusAPTLESINYNN terminusETYDATLEDLxHLN terminusedldhlynyenipmgRAEIK-11 –142AEIEIAxVMPxgrxvxPxxQK-2*143 –153xTAYFYSRFNRIKK-4*160 –188NDFASLNDLRRINLTSNLISEIDEDAFRK-5189 –201LPQLRELVLRDNKK-6202 –225IRQLPELPTTLRFIDISNNRLGrKK-9+K-12234 –281DMYDLHxLYLTDNNLXXIPLXLXXXXNR305 –COOHTPQAYMxLPRLPIGSK-10282 –288XLTYIRKK-11289 –304ALEDIRLDGNPINLSKT-4*91 –142LIDGSSPQEPEFTGVXT-5143 –155xTAYFYSRFNRIKT-8/9156 –166KINKXDFASLNT-19/20229 –243xEAFkDMYDLXVXLYLK-1-T-491 –142LIDGXSPQEPeFTGVLGPQTNEdFTK-1-T-1b12 –53ETYDATLEqLXXLGNxxxIPMGK-1-T-1a1 –53xPTLExxIK-1-T-2 (late)54 –90AEIEIAXVMPXGNXELLXPPK-1-T-2 (early)54 –90AEIEIADVMPxGNxxLLTPppQPeptides are named based on the enzyme used to generate them (trypsin (T) and endoprotease Lys-C (K)) and their position in the protein, starting with the N terminus.

Alignment of the sequences of the tryptic peptides (Table I) generated from the decorin/epiphycan mixture (Fig.2) with the protein sequence of PG-Lb enabled two degenerate PCR primers to be designed (Fig. 7). Reverse transcription-PCR amplification of a pool of fetal cartilage mRNA resulted in the expected 230-base pair product. The product was gel-purified and reamplified with primers that had restriction site-containing clamps attached at the 5′-end. This product was cloned into pBluescript and sequenced, confirming that the product derived from DNA coding for epiphycan. Similar products were obtained by PCR amplification of a human cDNA library (18Deere M. Johnson H.J. Garza S. Harrison W.R. Yoon S. Elder F.B. Kucherlapati R. Höök M. Hecht J.T. Genomics. 1996; 38: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cloned PCR product was used to define specific primers that allowed the entire coding sequence to be amplified from a cDNA library generated from reverse-transcribed fetal epiphyseal cartilage mRNA. From this sequence, nested primers were used in a second round of PCR amplification to generate an 800-base pair PCR product, which was then excised and sequenced in both directions. The entire coding region of bovine epiphycan mRNA and the deduced amino acid sequence were determined (Fig. 7). The coding sequence of bovine epiphycan has 966 base pairs, corresponding to a translated protein of 321 amino acids. A signal peptide of 19 amino acids precedes the mature protein, which has a calculated size of 34,721 Da and a pI of 4.52. The shorter form has a calculated size of 33,531 Da and a pI of 4.54. Edman degradation of the intact protein indicated that epiphycan had two N-terminal sequences (APTLES … and ETYDAT …) in approximately equimolar amounts. The first N-terminal sequence (APTLES …) derived from removal of the signal peptide. The two sequences could be identified separately by virtue of the fact that a repeat of the second sequence beginning ETY … could be found after 11 cycles of sequencing. The second N terminus (ETYDAT …) may derive from the action of a protease or may be a result of cleavage by exopeptidases. Similar N-terminal processing occurs in biglycan (19Marcum J.A. Thompson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in decorin (20Bourdon M. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and, in these cases, appears to have a role in control of GAG chain length, either by altering the rate of intracellular transport of the proteoglycan or by altering the rate of synthesis of the GAG chain (21Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Moses J. Fransson L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A disulfide bond was unequivocally assigned between the two C-terminal cysteines. A peptide with two N termini (TPQ … and DMY …; K-9+K-12) (Table I) eluted from a Superdex 75 column at a position consistent with a size of 4–8 kDa. These two peptides have predicted molecular masses of 1859 and 5756 Da, respectively, and would not be expected to coelute on gel permeation chromatography. Reduction of this peptide allowed the isolation of a peptide (K-9R) that corresponded to one-half of the disulfide-bonded pair. Thus, Cys-278 and Cys-311 are linked by a disulfide bond. We have not been able to confirm the presence of a disulfide-bonded loop at the N terminus. Consensus sequences for N-linked oligosaccharides were present at positions 282 and 301. A peptide was found in which the N-terminal residue could not be identified (XLTYIRK, peptide K-10). The unidentified residue corresponded to residue 282, indicating the likely presence of an N-linked oligosaccharide. This peptide also eluted anomalously early on gel permeation chromatography with an estimated size of 3–6 kDa, despite its calculated molecular mass of 907 Da. Asparagine was detected at position 301 (peptide K-11), indicating that this residue was generally not substituted. Three likely O-substituted sites have been found at positions 60, 64, and 95 in peptide K-1, based on blanks in the Edman degradation and serine or threonine in the cDNA-derived sequence. Residue 60 in peptide K-1-T-2 (Table I) is a threonine (IEIATVMPSGN) in the cDNA-derived sequence and is likely substituted with an O-linked oligosaccharide. The GAG chain(s) are likely to be attached at serine residues (e.g.Ser-64 and/or Ser-95). Residue 64 also in peptide K-1-T-2 is a typical glycosaminoglycan attachment site (Ser-Gly) similar to the type found in decorin, biglycan, and aggrecan. To determine the sites of GAG substitution, the high molecular mass peptide K-1 was isolated and subdigested with trypsin. Two tryptic peptides, K-1-T-2 and K-1-T-4, were found in the void volume of a Superdex 75 column. This elution behavior suggested that the peptides were covalently linked to GAG chain(s) or large oligosaccharide(s). Reversed-phase analysis of this material resulted in a single, late eluting homogeneous peak with an N terminus corresponding to the sequence LIDG … (peptide K-1-T-4) (Table I and Fig.8) and a variety of earlier eluting, broad peaks, which had the same N termini (AEIE …; peptide K-1-T-2) (Table I and Fig. 8). Peptide K-1-T-2 contains Ser-64, which most likely is substituted with a GAG based on its heterogeneity on reversed-phase HPLC. The late eluting peptide K-1-T-4, which contains Ser-95, is probably substituted with an O-linked oligosaccharide based on its homogeneity on reversed-phase HPLC. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Ser-95 could also be substituted with a GAG chain. We have previously isolated decorin and biglycan from fetal skin and from bovine articular cartilage using a protocol involving dissociative extraction, ion-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography on octyl-Sepharose 4B (11Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rosenberg L. Choi H.U. Tang L.-H. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Webber C. Reiner A. Poole A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6304-6313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When small proteoglycans were isolated from fetal bovine epiphysis using the same procedure, we found three proteoglycans in roughly equal amounts. The third proteoglycan, which was named epiphycan based on its tissue source, was found to be the mammalian homolog of the avian proteoglycan PG-Lb. Epiphycan coeluted with decorin on octyl-Sepharose, but the two proteoglycans could be separated by metal chelate chromatography on Zn2+-charged columns. The ability to prepare significant amounts of proteoglycan (∼0.5 mg from 50 g of epiphysis) has enabled us to chemically characterize the proteoglycan. The peptide sequence data allowed degenerate oligonucleotide primers to be designed. The PCR product was sequenced, and this was used to initiate the determination of the cDNA sequence of bovine and mouse (10Kurita K. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Zako M. Kida D. Iwata H. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and human (18Deere M. Johnson H.J. Garza S. Harrison W.R. Yoon S. Elder F.B. Kucherlapati R. Höök M. Hecht J.T. Genomics. 1996; 38: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) epiphycan. N-terminal sequence analysis of intact epiphycan indicated the presence of two N termini. One of these (APTLESIN …) is generated by removal of the signal peptide. The other N terminus (ETYDAT …) did not conform to a signal peptide cleavage site and may derive from the action of a protease cleaving at NYNS-ETYD or from the action of exopeptidases. A similar two-step processing pathway has been noted for biglycan (19Marcum J.A. Thompson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Roughley P.J. White R.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The sizes of the two alternative core proteins calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (33,531 and 34,721 Da) were smaller than those of decorin (36,421 Da) and biglycan (37,113). There are one (epiphycan), two (biglycan), or three (decorin) N-linked oligosaccharides attached to these proteins. As determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5), there is little difference between the sizes of the core proteins of these three SLRPs after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. If N-linked oligosaccharides were the only substituents on the epiphycan core protein, then the difference between epiphycan and decorin or biglycan would be substantial (at least 6 kDa), implying that, in epiphycan, there are additional post-translational modifications that would increase the apparent core protein size to the same range as decorin and biglycan. These modifications are presumablyO-glycosylations; based on Edman degradation, there appear to be at least two O-linked oligosaccharides and oneO-linked glycosaminoglycan in epiphycan. Intact epiphycan is intermediary in size between decorin and biglycan. The core protein, with O- and N-linked oligosaccharides attached, is similar in size to both these proteoglycans. The average size of the GAG chains released from epiphycan is rather larger than that of the GAG chains obtained from either decorin or biglycan. This would be consistent with the presence of one GAG chain in epiphycan. The tryptic peptide containing Ser-64 elutes over a broad range on reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 8). This, coupled with its high molecular mass, suggests that it is substituted with a GAG chain. In contrast, Ser-95 is found on a peptide that elutes late and as a symmetrical peak on reversed-phase HPLC. This suggests that this peptide has a smaller and more homogeneous carbohydrate substituent, likely a conventional O-linked oligosaccharide. Epiphycan is the mammalian homolog of chick PG-Lb (9Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, within the LRR-containing region, is 78% identical. Epiphycan is also related (49% identity within the LRR-containing region) to osteoglycin (formerly named osteoinductive factor), which is a proteoglycan found in the extracellular matrix of developing bone (23Bentz H. Nathan R.M. Rosen D.M. Armstrong R.M. Thompson A.Y. Segarini P.R. Mathews M.C. Dasch J.R. Piez K.A. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epiphycan/PG-Lb family appears to be a separate branch of the leucine-rich proteoglycans. An unrooted phylogeny diagram is shown in Fig. 9, indicating the relationship of epiphycan to chick PG-Lb, to a partial sequence of a shark analog of these proteoglycans, 2P. J. Neame, unpublished data. and to osteoglycin, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican, PRELP, and chondroadherin. Each family appears to be essentially unrelated to the other families, although all have the common feature of LRRs. It is noteworthy that mammalian osteoglycin is more remotely related to mammalian epiphycan (47% identical to the LRR region of bovine epiphycan) than the partial shark-derived sequence (56% identical to the LRR region of bovine epiphycan), implying that it diverged from a common ancestor earlier than the cartilaginous fishes. It is therefore reasonable to assume that osteoglycin has a different role from epiphycan in the same way that decorin and biglycan are in the same subfamily, but have different properties and therefore, presumably, different roles in the extracellular matrix. The seven LRRs in epiphycan are heterogeneous in length. The start of the first detectable consensus sequence is 15 residues after the fourth cysteine. In common with other SLRPs, the first LRR is atypical, starting with a hydroxylamino acid and a weak consensus motif. This is likely to be due to a dramatic change in structure at this point, corresponding to the interface with the four-cysteine cluster. The lengths of the LRR-containing sequences are 24, 24, 20, 26, 21, 31, and 32 amino acids. The last LRR appears between the two C-terminal cysteines. This dimeric repeat pattern (long-short-long-short-long) differs from that of the proteoglycans decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican, which have a triplet repeat pattern (long-long-short) (24Bengtsson E. Neame P.J. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25639-25644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This, in turn, differs from the complete regularity of the RNase inhibitor, which has 15 LRRs spaced at intervals of 28 or 29 amino acids (8Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). A similar regularity is seen in chondroadherin, where the repeats are spaced at intervals of 24 amino acids (25Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of these patterns will probably become clear once the 3-dimensional structure of these domains has been determined, but may reflect a mechanism for changing the overall curvature of the molecule. 3P. J. Neame and C. Kay, unpublished data. Information on structurally important features of proteins can often be obtained by comparison of the same protein in different species. Comparison of chick PG-Lb, human epiphycan, and murine PG-Lb with bovine epiphycan shows that the majority of the canonical SLRP structure (cysteine-rich region, a series of LRRs, followed by a C-terminal disulfide bond(s)) is highly conserved (Fig.10). The majority of changes are conservative. In common with decorin and biglycan, the N terminus, in front of the first cysteine, differs considerably between species. However, a section of 30 amino acids in front of the first cysteine is quite conserved between members of this family. This region contains either anO-linked oligosaccharide (in epiphycan), as shown here, or a GAG chain (postulated in PG-Lb). The conservation of this region may indicate functional importance. Osteoglycin is the closest relative to epiphycan, but has almost no similarity in the N-terminal region and only 52% identity in the region from the first N-terminal cysteine cluster to the C-terminal cysteine cluster (Fig. 10). A shark proteoglycan that has been partially characterized2 is clearly related to these proteoglycans. It bears a greater similarity to bovine osteoglycin than to bovine epiphycan and so may be a shark counterpart to osteoglycin. It remains to be seen to what extent the mammalian homolog of PG-Lb mimics the avian proteoglycan. Immunolocalization of PG-Lb in developing chick limb indicated that PG-Lb was most abundant in the region that contained flattened chondrocytes (9Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would imply that epiphycan may have a function in a region of cartilage that is not associated with calcification, perhaps acting to delay the onset of calcification or to arrange the matrix so that it is ready for the extensive remodeling that occurs during calcification. It may control collagen fibrillogenesis in a region where the type II collagen will be completely removed and replaced with a calcified, type I collagen-containing extracellular matrix. We are grateful to Ray Boynton for preparation of the epiphyseal RNA."

During the last two decades, several ALDHs from different organisms were discovered. By aligning the sequences of 16 known ALDHs, it was found that only 23 amino acids were completely conserved (1Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). More recently, Vasiliou et al. (2Vasiliou V. Weiner H. Marselos Nebert D.W. Eur. J. Drug. 1995; 26: 53-64Google Scholar) classified 26 mammalian ALDHs based on divergent evolution and reported that same residues were conserved. We undertook a mutagenesis approach to investigate the role of the conserved residues in the human mitochondrial ALDH, which possessed a functional side chain. Since completion of the study, the three-dimensional structure of the corresponding beef liver enzyme has been determined to 2.65 Å (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D.

Prior to the advent of molecular biological techniques, chemical modifications were used to identify the components of the active site of the enzyme. Classical sulfhydryl reagents inactivated the enzyme (4Hempel J.D. Pietruszko R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10889-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weiner H. Lin F.-P. Sanny C.G.

Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1212-1217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other residues were identified by chemical modifications as being possibly involved in the catalytic process. These were Glu268 and Ser74 in the human (8Abroila D.P. Fields R. Stein S. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Pietruszko R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5679-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and sheep liver (9Loomes K.M. Midwinter G.G. Blackwell L.F. Buckley P.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) enzymes, respectively. It was shown later by site-directed mutagenesis studies that Cys302 is a nucleophile (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Glu268 (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H.

The reaction involves both acylation and deacylation steps during the oxidation of aldehyde to acid, or hydrolysis of nitrophenyl acetate. It was proposed that deacylation (k 7) (Fig. 1) was rate-limiting for horse liver ALDH2 (13Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol.

NAD+ and NADH were purchased from Sigma; Sequenase version 2.0 kit was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp.; propionaldehyde, chloroacetaldehyde, andp-nitrophenyl acetate were from Aldrich; Magic Minipreps DNA purification system and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega Corp.; alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit were from Bio-Rad; GeneClean kit was from Bio 101, Inc.; [α-35S]dATP was from Amersham Corp.; and the restriction enzymes used were from either New England Biolabs or Promega Corp. Native and mutant ALDH cDNAs were cloned on pT7-7 expression vector, a derivative of pT7-1 (16Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar), and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (17Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4832) Google Scholar), as reported previously (18Zheng C.-F. Wang T.T.Y. Weiner H. Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To construct the human ALDH2 R84E/Q, K192Q, T384A/S, K489E/Q, S471A/T, E398K, and E399Q mutants, the oligonucleotide primers containing the mutation were used for site-directed mutagenesis with the Mutagene Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutant colonies were selected by sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52658) Google Scholar). After the identification of mutant colonies, the cDNA fragments containing the mutants were exchanged with the corresponding fragments of the native ALDH2 cDNA from the pT7-7 plasmid and were transformed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells possessing the chloramphenicol resistance pLysS plasmid. The mutation was again confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing of the pT7-7 plasmid. All the enzymes were expressed and purified according to the methods described elsewhere (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed enzymes were purified by protamine sulfate treatment (1.25 mg/ml) and DEAE-cellulose and 4-hydroxyacetophenone-based affinity chromatography (20Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE using the Coomassie Blue staining procedure. Fractions containing only ALDH2 were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon unit (Amicon). The pure enzyme was stored at −20 °C in presence of 50% glycerol. The dehydrogenase activity assays were performed by measuring the rate of increase in the fluorescence of NADH formation in 100 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.4) at 25 °C (21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K mand V max values for NAD+ were determined in the presence of 14 μm propionaldehyde, andK m and V max values for propionaldehyde were determined in the presence of 7 mmNAD+ for the K192Q mutant, 5 mmNAD+ for the S471A/T mutants, 2 mm for the E399Q mutant, 2 mm for the E398K mutant, and 1 mm NAD+ for the rest of the mutants and the native ALDH2 enzymes. Assays for the bisubstrate reaction kinetics for the native, K192Q, and S471A mutant enzymes were performed at different concentrations of propionaldehyde and NAD+. The esterase activities of recombinantly expressed native and mutant enzymes were determined by assaying the rate of p-nitrophenol formation at 400 nm in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) with 800 μm p-nitrophenyl acetate as the substrate. A molar extinction coefficient of 18.3 × 103 at 400 nm for p-nitrophenolate and a pK a of 7.1 forp-nitrophenol were used to calculate the rate of thep-nitrophenol formation (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pre-steady state burst magnitude of NADH formation was determined with a Hitachi 2000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme and NAD+ were incubated in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) to establish a fluorescence base line. Concentrations of NAD+ were 1–7 mm for the native and different mutant enzymes. At a time called zero, propionaldehyde (140 μm) was added to initiate the reaction. The extrapolated line intersecting at time zero gave the magnitude of the burst of NADH formation. By calibrating the fluorometer with various concentrations of NADH, it was possible to calculate the moles of NADH produced prior to the steady state rate of NADH formation (12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Weiner H. Hu J.H.J. Sanny C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3853-3855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K d values for enzyme-NADH were determined for the native, S471A, and K192Q mutants in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) at 25 °C. The fluorescence emission of unbound and bound NADH was measured at 450 nm with excitation at 340 nm (12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi K. Weiner H. Hu J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 205: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with a Hitachi 2000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Recombinantly expressed native and the mutant forms of human liver ALDH2 were purified to homogeneity by established methods, as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Zheng C.-F. Wang T.T.Y. Weiner H. Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the native and mutant enzymes was also verified by Western blotting with antibodies against the beef liver ALDH2. R84Q, K192Q, T384A/S, K489Q, S471A/T, E398K, and E399Q mutants were expressed at a level similar to the native ALDH2, but, R84E, K192E, and K489E mutants were present at a much lower level. The expression of the S471T mutant was similar to that of the native enzyme, but this mutant was less stable. After purification the dehydrogenase activity of S471T decreased to 50% if kept overnight while the others were stable for several days at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. All the mutants examined were found to have lower activity compared with the native enzyme. Replacement of conserved residues by neutral amino acids had less effect on the activity than when oppositely charged amino acids were used (Table I). No major changes in theK m for propionaldehyde was found with the mutant enzymes, when compared with the native enzyme, as was observed for other mutants we previously characterized (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exception was with C302S, where the K m for propionaldehyde increased several thousandfold (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A significant variation, however, was observed when the K m for NAD+ was determined. In T384A, E398K, E399Q, and K489Q, theK m values obtained were within a factor of 3–8-fold higher than native enzyme. The values increased to approximately 100 and 50 times the native value for K192Q and S471A/T mutants, respectively. Other mutants, R84E/Q, T384S, and K489E hadK m for NAD+ similar to that found with the native enzyme. However, by comparing the second order rate constant values (V max/K m(NAD+)), it was observed that the rate constant was significantly lower with all the mutants except for R84Q, compared with the native enzyme.Table IKinetic properties of the native and mutant forms of the human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2)Enzyme1-aAll residues except Glu398 and Lys489were completely conserved among all known ALDHs.K m(NAD+)K m1-bThough individual average value were calculated, theK m for aldehyde mostly ranged from 0.22 to 0.92 with an average value of 0.48.

Open table in a new tab Earlier kinetic investigations suggested that the ALDH-catalyzed reaction followed a sequential mechanism with NAD+ being the first substrate followed by aldehyde binding (13Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (K ia) for NAD+ with ALDH2 was determined by bisubstrate kinetic analysis (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several concentrations of NAD+ and propionaldehyde were used for the analysis of the data. The kinetic constants were calculated by the Dalzeil graphical method (23Dalzeil K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar). The value of K ia increased to more that 50- and 25-fold in K192Q and S471A, respectively, compared with the native enzyme (Table II). The valuek cat/ Km (NAD+)) is k 1 (on velocity), which decreased 200-fold compared with the native enzyme. Similarly,k 2, the off velocity for NAD+ dissociation, was also affected.Table IIDetermination of NAD+ and NADH binding constants for the native, K192Q, and S471A mutant forms of human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2)Kinetic constantNativeK192QS471Ak cat(min−1)2004422K a(μm)5323001480K b(μm)0.53.40.15k 1(μm min)−13.90.0190.015k 2 (min)−131114.2k 3 (μmmin)−134010130K ia(μm)11590280K d(μm)3917K a is the K m for NAD+;K b is the K m for propionaldehyde;k 1 and k 2 refer to onand off velocity of NAD+, respectively.k 3 is the rate constant for acylation;K ia represents the dissociation constant for NAD+. k 1 was calculated fromk cat/K a, andk 2 was calculated fromK ia k 1.

K drepresents the dissociation constant for NADH determined by the NADH binding assay. The dissociation constant (K d) for NADH was calculated by measuring the increase in fluorescence observed when NADH binds to the enzyme (22Takahashi K. Weiner H. Hu J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 205: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analysis of the NADH binding data showed a very small increase in the dissociation constant with the mutant enzymes and no difference in the binding stoichiometry. These results are similar to the previously characterized S74A and E487K mutants, where the K m and K ia for NAD+ were increased significantly but the binding for NADH was not affected (12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of ALDH involves several intermediary steps, as shown in Fig. 1. It was observed that a pre-steady state burst of 2 mol of NADH/mol of tetrameric enzyme occurred with the recombinantly expressed human mitochondrial ALDH2 (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, the V max value was found to be dependent on the nature of the substrate (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 260-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting deacylation (k 7) was the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme. For most mutants a burst magnitude of essentially 2 mol of NADH/mol of enzyme was found, except with K192Q and E399Q, where no burst could be measured (Table I). It was shown that aldehydes possessing an electron withdrawing group were oxidized more rapidly than propionaldehyde by the liver enzymes (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 260-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of a substrate having an electron withdrawing group on velocity, the V max for the oxidation of chloroacetaldehyde was measured for both native and mutant enzymes (Table I). Chloroacetaldehyde was oxidized at a much faster rate than propionaldehyde under V max conditions with the native ALDH2 and all the mutants except K192Q and E399Q. A faster rate is indicative that hydride transfer is not the rate-limiting step. Therefore, based on pre-steady state burst and increase in the rate of the reaction with the chloroacetaldehyde, it can be concluded that for R84Q, T384A, T384S, E398K, S471A, S471T, and K489Q the rate-limiting step remains deacylation (k 7). For both K192Q and E399Q, where no pre-steady state burst of NADH formation and a decreased rate of the reaction with chloroacetaldehyde was found, hydride transfer appears to be the rate-limiting step (k 5). In addition to dehydrogenase activity, aldehyde dehydrogenase also possess esterase activity (13Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sidhu R.S. Blair A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7894-7898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mukherjee N. Pietruszko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reaction scheme for the esterase reaction is shown in Fig. 1. The mechanism for both the esterase and dehydrogenase reaction remains essentially the same except that the hydride transfer step is not involved in the esterase reaction. Although the esterase activity was decreased for the mutants, a relatively higher esterase activity was found, compared with their respective dehydrogenase activity (Table III). In all mutants the esterase activity was stimulated 2–7-fold by NAD+. Only Arg84 mutants did not show any NAD+ stimulation.Table IIIEsterase activity of the native and mutant forms of human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in the absence and presence of NAD+Enzymek cat3-aThe unit of the esterase activity is expressed in terms of min−1.

Open table in a new tab When we initiated the project to elucidate the role of the conserved amino acids found in all aldehyde dehydrogenases, no structure of the enzyme was known. After we completed the mutational analysis, the structure of the dimeric class three enzyme (27Liu Z.-J. Sun Y.-J. Rose J. Chung Y.-J. Hsiao D. Chang W.-R. Kuo I. Perozich J. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Wang B.-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and the beef liver mitochondria enzyme (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) were determined in the presence and absence of NAD+. From the latter structure, it is apparent that only residues Lys192 and Glu399 are in contact with the coenzyme, and that none of the other conserved residues make contact with the coenzyme or other components of the active site. Fig. 2 illustrates the location of each conserved residue in one subunit as well as a few others we found to affect activity. The enzyme is actually a pair of dimers, as shown elsewhere (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All the residues investigated were conserved or at least conserved in all mammalian ALDHs. Mutation of Ser471 to a threonine reduced the k cat to less than 5% of the value of the native enzyme. Converting the residue to an alanine produced an enzyme which retained 15% of the specific activity. Most surprisingly was to find that mutation of the two residues that interacted directly with the coenzyme did not more drastically affect the specific activity of the enzyme. In fact, the K m for NAD+was increased only when Lys192 was converted to a glutamine (100-fold). Mutation of the other ribose binding ligand, Glu399, caused the K m for NAD+ to increase just 4-fold. In contrast, Ser471, which is located approximately 9 Å from the coenzyme, caused the K m for NAD+ to increase over 50-fold. The effect is related to binding, for theK ia values for NAD+ to K192Q and S471A increased over 50- and 25-fold, respectively, as shown in Table II. While the binding of NAD+ was affected by mutations to Lys192 and Ser471, the interaction of NADH was not. Its value increased only 3- and 6-fold, respectively. Although none of the charged residues investigated in this study can be deemed essential, changing a residue to one with the opposite charge greatly affected the enzyme activity. This can be illustrated by the fact that K489E had only 3% the specific activity of the native enzyme while K489Q had nearly 40%. Similarly, R84E had just 2% activity while the Gln mutant had 32%. The reversal of the charge did not change the K m for NAD+ or aldehyde substantially. This was in contrast to what we found with E487K/Q (21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the Lys mutant possessed a very high K m for NAD+ while the Gln mutant had native likeK m values. Neither Glu487 or Lys489 are completely conserved, but a negative and a positive charge, respectively, are always found at these positions. We can now offer some structural arguments for the effects of the various mutants we investigated. Prior to this study, we reported that Cys302 is the active site nucleophile (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Glu268 is the general base (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is possible that a water attached to Glu268 may abstract the proton from Cys302 (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We previously showed that mutations to Ser74 drastically affected the K m for NAD+, while it did not affect K d for NADH (12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ser74 is located near the dimer interface and is associated with residues 69 and 71 which make contact between the pair of dimers. Similarly, Glu487 makes contact with arginine residues in its own subunit as well as in the other dimer pair (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). When this residue was mutated to a lysine to mimic what has been found in many Oriental people (21Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the K m for NAD+ increased and the specific activity decreased. We argued that disrupting the glutamate-arginine salt bonds was responsible for the observed effect. Lys489 also binds to the opposed subunit in the dimer pair, capping the C terminus of α helix between residues 436 and 445. Thus, its role appears to be in stabilizing subunit interactions (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Residue 384 (threonine) prefers to have a hydroxyl as the side chain in that the serine mutant is more native-like than is the alanine. This residue is located near the solvent surface but near a hydrophobic core that extends toward the coenzyme binding pocket. Potentially, of more important is that the hydroxyl group of Thr384 binds to the carbonyl back bone of Pro383. This interaction appears to maintain the local structure of the conserved Pro383 and Thr384 residues found in all ALDHs. Mutation to residue 471 (serine), as mentioned above, affects the K m for NAD+. It is located such that it interacts with residues 269 and 270. Conceivably a disruption of that interaction would alter the position of Glu268, the conserved general base. This disruption could explain the decrease in specific activity. From the structure it appears that Glu268 might have to move to accommodate the binding of NAD+. The calculatedk 1 term decreased 1500-fold in the S471A mutant and K ia increased 15-fold, consistent with the argument that an alteration near 268 could affect NAD+interactions with the enzyme for Ile269 is in van der Waal contact with the nicotinamide ring. Arg84 is part of a long helix between residues 81 and 110 and interacts through a water molecule with the C-terminal Ser500 in a different subunit. Furthermore, it serves to cap a helix in its own subunit by binding to the peptide carbonyls of residues 183 and 184. Removing the charge did not alter drastically the catalytic properties. A negative charge at this position affectedk cat without increasing K mfor either substrate. The Arg84 containing helix is located near the subunit interface. Lower concentrations of R84E and K489E were found after expressing the mutants in E. coli. Mutation to these residues could have affected assembly. It is not apparent why lower levels of K192E were also found. This residue appears to be exposed to solvent and might not be expected to affect assembly or stability. It will be necessary to study the stability of the mutants to determine if the point mutations did actually affect assembly. Both residues 192 and 399 bind to ribose hydroxyl groups and appear to be the only conserved residues that directly interacts with the coenzyme. It is surprising that mutation to only one drastically alters NAD+ binding. However, the nicotinamide ring appears to have to move during the catalytic process (3Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and since Glu399 is bound to the nicotinamide ribose, it may not be unexpected that this residue should be less important in the binding of NAD+. The major affect of mutating Glu399 is a change in the rate-limiting step, while mutating Lys192causes a change in both NAD+ binding and the rate-limiting step. Apparently the proper anchoring of the NAD+ is essential for the hydride transfer step. Our laboratory has argued that since substrates with an electron withdrawing group, such as chloroacetaldehyde, are oxidized more rapidly than propionaldehyde, and a pre-steady state burst was observed, deacylation, k 7 in Fig. 1, is rate-limiting for mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. Only with K192Q and E399Q were these properties not found. For those, the rate of oxidation of chloroacetaldehyde was not greater than that of propionaldehyde, showing that the rate-limiting step did not involve the attack of the nucleophile, k 3 ork 7. Further, as no burst was found,k 7 and k 9 were eliminated as the rate-limiting step. Therefore, we conclude that the rate-limiting step was changed to hydride transfer (k 5) for these two mutants. Detailed studies presented in the following paper will show that there is a primary isotope affect on aldehyde oxidation, verifying the fact that hydride transfer became rate-limiting for K192Q and E399Q mutants (15Ni L. Sheikh S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18823-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The termk cat/K m(propionaldehyde)is related to aldehyde interaction with the enzyme-NAD+complex (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).kcat/Km(propionaldehyde)=k3k5/(k4+k5)Equation 1 If it is assumed that the value of k 4 is small, due to the tight binding of aldehyde to enzyme-NAD+ complex, thenk cat/ K m(propionaldehyde)approximates to the value of k 3. Mutations of native amino acids decreased this value by 2–40-fold. Mitochondrial ALDH can hydrolyze activated esters such asp-nitrophenylacetate; presumably, both esterase and dehydrogenase reaction take place at the same active site (10Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Loomes K.M. Kitson T.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All the mutants produced in this study still hydrolyzed the ester. The esterase reaction involves many of the same steps that the dehydrogenase reaction use, except it does not include the hydride transfer step (k 5) (Fig. 1). The acylation step (k 3) is thought to be the rate-limiting step for the esterase reaction with horse (14Weiner H. Hu J.H.J. Sanny C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3853-3855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human liver ALDH2 (11Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This decreased esterase activity was found with the mutants that had a change in k 7 and those that produced a change ink 5 of the dehydrogenase reaction. The formation of the tetrahedral intermediate in the esterase reaction should be similar to that of the hemiacetal formation in the dehydrogenase reaction. Decrease in the esterase activity, irrespective of which step was involved in the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenase reaction, indicates that the mutation also affected thek 3 and k′ 3 steps, which are common to both esterase and dehydrogenase reaction (Reactions 1 and 2).E‖NAD++SH+RCHO↔k3H‖ESCR‖OH→k5O∥ESC­R‖NADH REACTION1.Dehydrogenase reaction. ESH+‖NAD+O ∥RCONP↔k3′OH‖ESCONP‖R →k5′O∥ESC­R ‖NAD+REACTION2.Esterase reaction.A correlation (r 2 ≈ 0.74) existed between the calculated k 3 values for dehydrogenase and the esterase velocity as shown in Fig. 3. The esterase activity of K192Q enzyme appeared to be higher than expected. This might be related to the fact that this mutant had higher activity with the aromatic substrates, as will be discussed in the accompanying paper (15Ni L. Sheikh S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18823-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the esterase reaction an additional, nonhydride transfer step (k′ 5) is required to form the acyl intermediate. Conceivably the mutations could affect this step as well as thek′ 3 step needed to form the tetrahedral intermediate. This study showed that of the conserved residues with reactive side chains, other than Cys302 and Glu268, only Lys192 and Glu399 could be considered to be involved in the active site of the enzyme. The other residues appear to make long ranged contacts with residues which make it possible for the catalytic residues to be properly aligned, analogous to Asp194 making a salt bond with Ile16 in chymotrypsin (29Abeles R.H. Frey P.A. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston1992: 126-129Google Scholar). The two ribose-binding residues were essential in catalysis in that the rate-limiting step for the enzyme changed when these were mutated. However, mutation of any completely or partially conserved residue appeared to affect more than one step in the catalytic reaction. Preliminary results on the mutational analysis of the conserved Glu377 in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase from luminescent bacteria (Vibrio harveyi) were reported to be similar to the corresponding Glu399 in mitochondrial ALDH2 (30Vedadi M.

Neither the physiological substrates nor the functional significance is known. Mice with a deficiency of LAP generated by targeted disruption of the LAP gene are fertile and develop normally. Microscopic examination of various peripheral organs revealed progredient lysosomal storage in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells of the kidney, with regionally different ultrastructural appearance of the stored material. Within the central nervous system, lysosomal storage was detected to a regionally different extent in microglia, ependymal cells, and astroglia concomitant with the development of a progressive astrogliosis and microglial activation.

From the age of 6 months onward, conspicuous alterations of bone structure became apparent, resulting in a kyphoscoliotic malformation of the lower thoracic vertebral column. We conclude from these findings that LAP has a unique function in only a subset of cells, where its deficiency causes the storage of a heterogeneously appearing material in lysosomes.

However, no isotope effect was observed for each mutant when α-[2H]benzaldehyde was the substrate. A pre-steady state burst of NADH formation was observed for the E399Q/K and K192Q mutants with benzaldehyde, and p-nitrobenzaldehyde was oxidized faster than benzaldehyde.

Lys192 bound the adenosine ribose, while Glu399 bound the nicotinamide ribose (1Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). When they were separately mutated to a glutamine residue, the mutants were found to have a small decreased specific activity and only the K192Q form showed a markedly enhanced K m for NAD+ (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was totally unexpected to find that the mutants caused a change in the rate-limiting step. In the native enzyme, the rate-limiting step is deacylation (k 7), while for the K192Q and E399Q, it appeared to have become hydride transfer (k 5, based on Fig. 1 of Ref. 2). Mutations to the other conserved residues which possessed a reactive side chain, while affecting some kinetic parameters, did not change the rate-limiting step. The exceptions were with Cys302 and Glu268, which have been shown previously to function as the essential nucleophile (3Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and general base (4Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), respectively. We extended the study to investigate additional mutations of the two ribose-binding residues. Primary isotope effects with both aromatic and aliphatic substrates were measured to verify that the rate-limiting step did indeed become hydride transfer. In addition, a more specific role for Glu399 was sought because, although it binds to the nicotinamide ribose, the E399Q mutant did not affect coenzyme binding. In contrast, mutation of Lys192, which binds to the adenosine ribose, did affect NAD+ binding. Furthermore, the results of the structure determination on ALDH2 suggested that the nicotinamide mononucleotide portion of NAD+ was not well ordered in the absence of Mg2+ ions. Thus, it appears that position 399 might play some role in catalysis other than binding to the coenzyme.

The purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Coomassie Blue staining procedure.

The K m and V maxvalues for NAD+ were determined in the presence of 14 μm propionaldehyde, whereas the K m andV max values for propionaldehyde were determined in the presence of 1 mm NAD+ for the native enzyme and the E399D mutant, 2 mm NAD+ for the E399Q and E399H mutants, 3 mm NAD+ for the E399K mutant, and 7 mm for the K192Q mutant. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was determined at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of acetaldehyde and [2H]acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and α-[2H]benzaldehyde. The pre-steady state burst magnitude of NADH formation was determined with propionaldehyde or benzaldehyde as the substrate, as described in the accompanying paper (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Concentrations of NAD+ were 1–7 mm for the native and different mutant enzymes. The propionaldehyde concentration was 140 μm, and the benzaldehyde concentration was 100 μm. Analytic isoelectric focusing was performed in a 1% agarose slab gel using Pharmalyte, pH 4–6.5. Focused samples were detected by protein staining with Coomassie Blue (10Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed native, Glu399, and Lys192 mutant forms of human liver mitochondrial (class 2) ALDH were purified to homogeneity by established methods, as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Wang X.-P. Weiner H.

It was estimated that all the new mutants except for K192E were expressed at levels similar to native ALDH2 based on the results of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Non-denatured PAGE showed that all of the mutants were still tetrameric enzymes. The isoelectric points (pI) of E399K and E399Q/H were different from that of the native enzyme. The removal of the negative charge caused an increase in the pI values from 4.9 to about 5.1 for E399K and about 5.0 for E399Q and E399H. The pI of the E399D mutant was the same as that of the native enzyme. Replacement of Lys192 by glutamine decreased the pI value to 4.8. The fact that pI changed when the two ribose-binding residues were mutated shows that they are exposed to the solvent in the absence of NAD+. The accompanying study showed that the E399Q mutant had approximately 10% of the dehydrogenase activity while the K192Q mutant had about 20% activity of the native ALDH2 (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Converting Glu399 to aspartate produced an enzyme that had 50% activity of the native ALDH2, while the E399H mutant had about 5% of the dehydrogenase activity. The E399K mutant had ak cat for dehydrogenase activity less than 1% of the native ALDH2 enzyme (Table I). This is similar to what was found with the E487K Oriental variant of human ALDH2 (9Farrés J. Wang X.-P. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and verified that the negative charge was important for the amino acid residue at position 399. Similarly, the positive charge at position 192 was also important; the K192Q mutant had about 20% activity of the native ALDH2, whereas the K192E mutant had less than 2% activity.Table IKinetic constants of the native and mutant forms of human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2)EnzymesK m(NAD+)K m(propionaldehyde)k catk catμ mμ mmin −1%Native270.5190100E399K3400.910.5E399Q1200.32011E399H2100.69.65.1E399D780.49650K192Q36003.53519K192E480.43.31.7The dehydrogenase activity assay was performed in the 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Open table in a new tab The dehydrogenase activity assay was performed in the 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The K m values for NAD+ and propionaldehyde were determined for these mutant enzymes. There was up to a 10-fold increase in the K m for NAD+for the Glu399 mutants, but the K mvalues for propionaldehyde were approximately the same as for the native enzyme. In contrast, the K m for both NAD+ and propionaldehyde were altered for the K192Q mutant; there was a 100-fold increase in the K m for NAD+ and a 7-fold increase for propionaldehyde. Unexpected, the K m values for NAD+ and propionaldehyde for the K192E mutant were more similar to that of the native enzyme, although the k cat was decreased. It was shown that there was a pre-steady state burst of NADH formation with human liver mitochondrial ALDH; the burst magnitude was approximately 2 mol of NADH/mol of tetrameric enzyme (4Wang X.-P. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This implied that deacylation (k 7) or NADH dissociation (k 9) was the rate-limiting step for the native ALDH2 enzyme (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 2). Other data proved that deacylation (k 7) was the rate-limiting step for the native ALDH2 enzyme (11Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 260-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klyosov A.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), no pre-steady state burst of NADH formation was observed with the E399K enzyme when propionaldehyde was used as the substrate (Table II). Furthermore, the E399K mutant oxidized chloroacetaldehyde slower than propionaldehyde (Table III), indicating that the rate-limiting step changed. Since the chloro group makes oxidation more difficult to occur, it implied that the rate-limiting step for the E399K became hydride transfer (k 5), as with the E399Q mutant.Table IIThe pre-steady state burst magnitude of NADH formation of the native and mutant forms of the human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2)EnzymeBurst magnitude2-aThe burst magnitude was expressed as the moles of NADH formation/mol of the tetrameric enzyme.PropionaldehydeBenzaldehydeNative1.6–2.02-bThe burst magnitude was in the range of 1.6–2.0 from different determinations.1.6–2.02-bThe burst magnitude was in the range of 1.6–2.0 from different determinations.E399KNone0.7E399QNone1.4E399H1.11.6E399D2.12.2K192QNone<0.32-a The burst magnitude was expressed as the moles of NADH formation/mol of the tetrameric enzyme.2-b The burst magnitude was in the range of 1.6–2.0 from different determinations.

No primary isotope effect was found for the native ALDH2 enzyme with either α-[2H]benzaldehyde or [2H]acetaldehyde, consistent with hydride transfer not being the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme, and also consistent with what we found for the horse liver mitochondrial ALDH (11Feldman R.I.

AV H/V D of 2.5, however, was observed for the E399Q and E399K mutant enzymes, when [2H]acetaldehyde was used as the substrate, consistent with hydride transfer (k 5) being at least a partial rate-limiting step.Table IVThe primary 2H isotope effect on the native and mutant forms of human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2)EnzymeV H/V D4-aV H refers to the dehydrogenase activity (n mol/min/mg protein) when acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde was used as the substrate; V D refers to the dehydrogenase activity when [2H]acetaldehyde or α-[2H]benzaldehyde was used as the substrate.AcetaldehydeBenzaldehydeV HV DV H/V D4-aV H refers to the dehydrogenase activity (n mol/min/mg protein) when acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde was used as the substrate; V D refers to the dehydrogenase activity when [2H]acetaldehyde or α-[2H]benzaldehyde was used as the substrate.V HV DV H/V D 4-aV H refers to the dehydrogenase activity (n mol/min/mg protein) when acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde was used as the substrate; V D refers to the dehydrogenase activity when [2H]acetaldehyde or α-[2H]benzaldehyde was used as the substrate.Native98098011701701E399K4.81.92.519191E399Q110432.550501E399H5151166661E399D490490171711K192Q19095217017014-a V H refers to the dehydrogenase activity (n mol/min/mg protein) when acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde was used as the substrate; V D refers to the dehydrogenase activity when [2H]acetaldehyde or α-[2H]benzaldehyde was used as the substrate. Open table in a new tab In contrast to what we found with [2H]acetaldehyde, no primary isotope effect was observed when α-[2H]benzaldehyde was used as the substrate. This indicated that the rate-limiting step was not hydride transfer (k 5) when benzaldehyde was used as the substrate for the E399Q/K mutants. This was verified by finding a pre-steady state burst when benzaldehyde was the substrate for the E399Q/K mutant enzymes (Table II). Furthermore, the k cat of aromatic aldehyde oxidation was related to the structure of the substrate. p-Nitrobenzaldehyde, an aromatic aldehyde having an electron-withdrawing group, was oxidized much faster than those lacking the group (Table V). This indicated that the rate-limiting step for aromatic substrates was still deacylation (k 7) for the E399Q/K mutant enzymes, as with the native ALDH2 enzyme.Table VThe dehydrogenase activities for the native and mutant forms of human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) when different aldehydes were used as substratesSubstrateNativeE399KE399QE399HE399DK192QAcetaldehyde9804.811051490190Propionaldehyde8704.39244440160Chloroacetaldehyde33703.06557161075Benzaldehyde17019506671170p-Nitrobenzaldehyde430912702603601490p-Metroxybenzaldehyde504.828153656The unit of activity is n mol/min/mg protein.

No pre-steady state burst of NADH formation was found with the K192Q enzyme when propionaldehyde was used as the substrate (Table II). We showed that the K192Q mutant oxidized chloroacetaldehyde slower than propionaldehyde (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that the rate-limiting step changed. Since the chloro group makes oxidation more difficult to occur, it implied that the rate-limiting step became hydride transfer (k 5), which was now verified by the pre-steady state burst data (Table II). A V H/V D of 2.0 was observed for the K192Q mutant enzyme (Table IV), when [2H]acetaldehyde was used as the substrate, consistent with hydride transfer (k 5) being involved in the rate-limiting step. In contrast, when α-[2H]benzaldehyde was used as the substrate for the K192Q mutant, no primary isotope effect was observed. This indicated that the rate-limiting step was not hydride transfer (k 5) when benzaldehyde was used as the substrate. Only a small pre-steady state burst of NADH formation was observed during the oxidation of benzaldehyde by the K192Q mutant enzyme (Table II). The k cat of aromatic aldehyde oxidation was related to the structure of the substrate.p-Nitrobenzaldehyde was oxidized much faster than the others (Table V). This indicates that the rate-limiting step was not hydride transfer (k 5) for the K192Q mutant when aromatic aldehydes were used as substrates. Thus, the rate-limiting step differed for the K192Q mutant when aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes were oxidized. The E399H/D mutants oxidized chloroacetaldehyde faster than propionaldehyde (TableIII). No isotope effects were found with the E399H/D mutants when using either α-[2H]benzaldehyde or [2H]acetaldehyde as substrates, showing that hydride transfer was not the rate-limiting step for the E399H/D mutants when either aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes were used as substrates (TableIV). Furthermore, a pre-steady state burst of NADH formation was observed for the E399H/D mutants during the oxidation of both propionaldehyde and benzaldehyde (Table II), and thek cat was a function of substrates (Table V). These results indicated that the rate-limiting step for the E399H/D mutants was still deacylation (k 7). E399H had many properties that mimic those of the native enzyme. TheK m for NAD+ increased 8-fold in the E399H mutant, and the k cat decreased to 5% of the native enzyme. Although the k cat of E399H was lower than the k cat of E399Q, the rate-limiting step remained deacylation (k 7) for E399H. Aspartate could replace glutamate at position 399. BothK m for NAD+ andk cat were native-like. This indicated that a negative charge was important for the proper function of the nicotinamide ribose-binding residue at position 399. It has been reported that the mammalian liver mitochondrial ALDHs can be activated by magnesium ions (9Farrés J. Wang X.-P. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Takahashi K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8206-8209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vallari R.C.

Res. 1988; 12: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Native ALDH2 and the E399H/D enzymes could be activated approximately 2-fold by Mg2+ ions when using either propionaldehyde or benzaldehyde as the substrate. In contrast, the E399Q/K and K192Q mutants were not activated by Mg2+ ions when propionaldehyde was used as the substrate. They could be activated 2–5-fold by Mg2+ ions when benzaldehyde was used as the substrate. The structure of mitochondrial ALDH reveals that Lys192 binds to the adenosine ribose and that Glu399 binds to the nicotinamide ribose. When the Mg2+ ions were present at low concentration in the crystals, a disordering of the nicotinamide portion of the coenzyme was observed (1Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.-G. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). ALDH is active in the absence of Mg2+ ions, but the presence of Mg2+ ions causes the enzyme to have an increased specific activity and the pre-steady state burst magnitude of NADH formation, at least for the enzyme from horse (14Takahashi K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8206-8209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (9Farrés J. Wang X.-P. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increases from 2 mol of NADH/mol of enzyme to 4. Here we found that only the E399H or E399D mutants were affected by the addition of Mg2+ ions, analogous to what is found with the native human enzyme. These two mutants had the most native-like behavior in that the rate-limiting step remained deacylation (k 7). A glutamate residue can replace the function of the lysine at position 192; the K m for NAD+ and the rate-limiting step for the K192E were native-like. The specific activity of K192E was depressed, compared with the native enzyme or even the glutamine mutation. Since residue 192 does not appear to be in direct contact with any residue in the substrate binding domain or near other components of the active site, as shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying paper (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we can only assume that the affect onk cat was due to a transitional state stabilization such that hydride transfer is not functioning efficiently when the adenosine ribose is not bound by the lysine residue. For the esterase reaction of the enzyme, where hydride transfer is not involved, the K192Q mutant was shown to have 50% the activity of the native enzyme, compared with 19% of the dehydrogenase activity (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finding that the esterase activity was diminished shows that residue 192 does indeed influence the catalytic site even in the absence of NAD+. In the accompanying paper (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we proposed that mutations to the two ribose-binding residues, Lys192 and Glu399, caused the rate-limiting step to change to hydride transfer. Here we show that when [2H]acetaldehyde was the substrate, a primary isotope effect was found with K192Q and E399Q (Table IV). Unlike native enzyme, where a pre-steady state burst of NADH was found, neither of the two mutants produced a burst, consistent with the other data presented, which indicated that the rate-limiting step did change. A most unexpected result was found when [2H]α-benzaldehyde was employed as the substrate. No primary isotope effect was found for the 192 and 399 mutants. This implies that the rate-limiting step with aromatic aldehydes remained deacylation. Finding that there was a pre-steady state burst and thatp-nitrobenzaldehyde was oxidized more rapidly than was benzaldehyde is consistent with this conclusion. It is not possible to unequivocally explain why for the two mutant enzymes did the rate-limiting step become hydride transfer with aliphatic aldehydes but remain deacylation with aromatic aldehydes. Cys302 is located 7.2 Å from Glu399 and 17 Å from Lys192. Thus, it is not possible for these two residues to interact directly with the substrate being oxidized, but their presence is clearly transmitted to the region surrounding the substrate pocket. Hydride transfer from aliphatic substrates appears to be more sensitive to the precise positioning of NAD+, which is held in place by Lys192 and Glu399. The transition state for hydride transfer from aromatic aldehydes could be partially stabilized by the presence of the Π electron cloud. If so, it could explain why the rate-limiting step differs. The E399K mutant was prepared since a lysine functions at position 192. Unlike with E399Q, the K m for NAD+increased 12-fold and the k cat decreased to 0.5% of the native enzyme. Thus, the ligand to the nicotinamide ribose can not be lysine. Aspartate could function well at that position; the E399D mutant had native-like properties. The corresponding histidine mutant had properties more like the glutamine mutant except that the rate-limiting step did not change to hydride transfer. The burst magnitude was lower than that of the native enzyme, at 1.1 mol of NADH/mol of enzyme compared with 1.6–2.0 for the native enzyme. Based on the mechanism of ALDH, the burst magnitude Π can be related to the ratio of the deacylation step (k 7) to one of the steps leading to it (k 5 ork 3).Π=ET/[1+(k7/kf)] 2Equation 1 k f is either k 5 ork 3, and E T is the concentration of active sites. The ratio ofk 7/k f would have to be between less than 0.05–0.1 to obtain a burst magnitude of 1.6–2.0. To obtained a burst magnitude of 1.1, as found with the E399H enzyme, the ratio would have to be around 0.4. Although the individual rate constants were not measured, it was possible to determine whether k f was governed by a change in k 5 or k 3. For the E399H mutant, no primary isotope effect was observed, showing thatk 7 was still the rate-limiting step (k cat in Table I). The ratiok cat/K m(propionaldehyde)is k 3 (3Farrés J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). From the data in Table I, it can be estimated that k 3 decreased from 380 to 16 μm−1min−1 in the E399H mutant, only a factor of 20. From the ratios of rate constants (k 7/k f) and thek cat values from Table I, it can be estimated that k f would be between 1900 and 3800 min−1 for the native and just 25 min−1 for the E399H mutant, a factor of 75–150. Since the factor of 20 ink 3 is far less than the factor of 75–150 ink f, it appears that k f is not governed by k 3, but must be related to a change in k 5. Thus it seems that any mutation to Glu399 causes a change to occur in the hydride transfer step (k 5). For the Gln and Lys mutants, the decrease was sufficient to make k 5 become the rate-limiting step, while for the His mutant, it was not. It was found that the aliphatic aldehydes were better substrates than were aromatic aldehydes for the native ALDH2 enzyme. However, K192Q oxidized aromatic aldehydes faster than aliphatic aldehydes. In fact, the specific activity when aromatic aldehydes were used as substrates was greater than that of the native enzyme.p-Nitrobenzaldehyde was oxidized approximately 4 times faster by the K192Q mutant than by the native enzyme. It appears that an aromatic-specific ALDH should have a glutamine binding to the adenosine ribose, but no ALDH was reported to have one. Addition of Mg2+ ions increases the activity of the mammalian ALDH2 by approximately 2-fold (9Farrés J. Wang X.-P. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol.

Res. 1988; 12: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of NADH binding remained 2 for the human ALDH2 in the presence of Mg2+ ions (data not shown), but it was increased to 4 for horse, beef, and rat ALDH2 (9Farrés J. Wang X.-P. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Guan K.-L. Pak Y.K. Tu G.-C. Cao Q.-N. Weiner H. Alcoholism Clin.

This suggested that for the human ALDH2 Mg2+ ions affected the rate-limiting step (k 7), while it increased the number of active site for the others. Consistent with the statement is the fact that Mg2+ ions only increased the activity of the E399Q/K and K192Q mutants when aromatic aldehydes were oxidized, where the rate-limiting step was still k 7. Between the data presented in this and the accompanying paper (2Sheikh S. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18817-18822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we show that, although many residues were completed conserved in the ALDH family of enzymes, only those at position 302 and 268 appear completely essential while those at 399 and 192 are important for hydride transfer. The first two are involved chemically, where the later most likely are involved in stabilizing the transition state, resulting from their binding to the ribose ring in NAD+."
https://openalex.org/W2070463473,"Luciferase (EC 1.13.12.7) from the North American firefly, Photinus pyralis, is widely used as a reporter enzyme in cell biology. One of its distinctive properties is a pronounced susceptibility to proteolytic degradation that causes luciferase to have a very short intracellular half-life. To define the structural basis for this behavior and possibly facilitate the design of more stable forms of luciferase, limited proteolysis studies were undertaken using trypsin and chymotrypsin to identify regions of the protein whose accessible and flexible character rendered them especially sensitive to cleavage. Regions of amino acid sequence 206–220 and 329–341 were found to be sensitive, and because the region around 206–220 had high homology with other luciferases, CoA ligases, and peptidyl synthetases, this region was selected for mutagenesis experiments intended to determine which of its amino acids were essential for activity. Surprisingly, many highly conserved residues including Ser198, Ser201, Thr202, and Gly203 could be mutated with little effect on the luminescent activity of P. pyralisluciferase. One mutation, however, S198T, caused several alterations in enzymatic properties including shifting the pH optimum from 8.1 to 8.7, lowering the K m for Mg-ATP by a factor of 4 and increasing the half-time for light emission decay by a factor of up to 150. While the S198T luciferase was less active than wild type, activity could be restored by the introduction of the additional L194F and N197Y mutations. In addition to indicating the involvement of this region in ATP binding, these results provide a new form of the enzyme that affords a more versatile reporter system.

Luciferase (EC 1.13.12.7) from the North American firefly,Photinus pyralis, is widely used as a reporter enzyme in studies of gene expression (1Gould S.J. Subramani S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase first catalyzes the formation of a bound luciferin-AMP, which then reacts with O2 to generate oxyluciferin-AMP in an excited state. Breakdown of this intermediate to oxyluciferin, CO2, and AMP is accompanied by the emission of a photon. The high quantum yield for this process, nearly a single photon emitted per reacted luciferin molecule (2Seliger H.H. McElroy W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1960; 88: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), reflects not only an efficient catalytic machinery but also a highly favorable environment for radiative decay of an excited state.Luciferase+luciferin+ATP→Mg2+luciferase·luciferyl­AMP+PPiEquation 1 Luciferase·luciferyl­AMP+O2→luciferase+oxyluciferin+AMP+CO2+hνEquation 2 The kinetics of light emission can be modulated by coenzyme A, but this is not a required substrate (3Airth R.L.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Luciferase can also function as a ligase (5Ortiz B. Fernandez V.M. Gunther-Sillero M.A. Sillero A. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1995; 29: 33-36Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as the AMP group of the enzyme·luciferyl-AMP complex can be transferred to ATP to produce diadenosine tetraphosphate. Despite many studies, relatively little was known about the structure of luciferase or the nature of its active site until recently. Cloning and sequencing of luciferase from the firefly (6de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and its homologues from several beetles (reviewed in Ref. 7Wood K.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 662-673Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have shown that these enzymes are related to certain acyltransferases (8Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K.

Alignment of these related sequences reveals conserved residues that may be important for enzymatic activity. For example, the high degree of homology in the 198–207 region of luciferase led to speculation that this region participates in acyladenylate formation (9Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The recent publication of the crystal structure of luciferase (10Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) will promote understanding of the significance of the conserved amino acids. Luciferase is highly susceptible to proteolysis in vitro and has a very short half-life in vivo (11Thompson J.F. Hayes L.S. Lloyd D.B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For different applications, this can create either an advantage or a disadvantage. Rapid intracellular turnover enables the level of the luciferase signal to respond rapidly to changes in transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, which enables kinetic studies that are impossible with the more stable reporter enzymes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or β-galactosidase. However, the same differences in protein stability among the reporters complicate their use as controls for the expression of luciferase and create a need for careful attention to the timing of signal variations. This paper describes new forms of luciferase with altered luminescent properties that may allow some of these problems to be circumvented. Proteolysis of luciferase was carried out as described previously (11Thompson J.F. Hayes L.S. Lloyd D.B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (0.5 mg/ml) was suspended in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 10 mm MgSO4) and then incubated at 23 or 37 °C with 1 μg/ml trypsin or chymotrypsin for varying lengths of time. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the gels were electroblotted to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.), and luciferase and its proteolytic fragments were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. Bands were subjected to sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase sequencer with on-line model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Luciferase-expressing plasmids were derived by removing the luciferase gene from pSV0Δ5 (a generous gift of Dr. Donald Helinski) by cutting withHindIII/BamHI and inserting it into pUC13 cut with the same enzymes to generate pLuxF3–13 (WT). 1The abbreviation used is: WT, wild type. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Genosys, and the restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim. Partial digestions of plasmids were carried out by cutting DNA with 4-fold serial dilutions of restriction enzymes from 116 unit/μg to 16 units/μg in conditions recommended by the manufacturer, electrophoresing the DNA on an agarose gel, and eluting the linearized plasmid with GeneClean (BIO 101, Inc.). This DNA was recut with the second enzyme, and the bands of desired size were purified and eluted as described above. This DNA was then ligated to the desired double-stranded oligonucleotides (100–1000-fold excess, unphosphorylated) and transfected intoEscherichia coli. To generate the series of plasmids denoted pLuxF44–pLuxF55, plasmid pLuxF3-13 was partially cleaved withEcoRI and completely cleaved with BstEII, and various double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated into the plasmid. For pLuxF93 and pLuxF105-X, oligonucleotides containing a mixture of 64 different sequences were synthesized to span the MunI andBstEII sites. This mixture was inserted into pLuxF44, which had been partially cleaved with MunI and then completely cleaved with BstEII. Because the luciferase (S199A) originally encoded by pLuxF44 was completely inactive, colonies derived from the parent plasmid that might contaminate the novel clones could be easily eliminated by assaying for luminescence (11Thompson J.F. Hayes L.S. Lloyd D.B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Plasmids recovered from colonies displaying luciferase activity were sequenced to determine which amino acid changes were compatible with activity. For larger quantities of luciferase, E. coli cultures were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of rich broth and harvested at late growth phase. Bacteria were pelleted (5000 × g, 25 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 1 mm EDTA and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspended cells were lysed by adding 2.5 ml of a stock aqueous solution of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and incubating at 0 °C for 5 min. Tween 20 was added (final concentration 0.2%, v/v) to the suspension, which was then incubated at 0 °C for an additional 5 min and centrifuged (25,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant, termed the crude extract, slowly lost activity on storage at 4 °C. To prevent this, the crude extract was immediately fractionated by subjecting it to 41% followed by 61% saturated ammonium sulfate (45 min stirring at 5 °C and centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The pelleted protein from the 61% saturated ammonium sulfate treatment was redissolved in 0.5–3.0 ml of NME (50 mm sodiumN-morpholinopropanesulfonate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2 mm EDTA) containing 0.8 m ammonium sulfate and 2% (v/v) glycerol. This protein mixture could be stored at 5 °C for several days without loss of activity. A 0.8-ml aliquot of the protein solution was centrifuged twice (20,000 × g, 10 min, 5 °C) and applied to a 1.6 × 50-cm Sephacryl S-200 column pre-equilibrated at 5 °C with NME buffer containing 0.4m ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The eluate was monitored byA 280, and 1.2-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots (10 μl) of each fraction were assayed for luciferase activity expressed in relative light units by using a flash height-based assay similar to that described previously (12Branchini B.R. Hayward M.M. Bamford S. Brennan P.M. Lajiness E.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fractions containing ∼80% of the total recovered bioluminescent activity were pooled and concentrated to ∼0.8 ml with a Centriplus-30 (Amicon, Inc.) device. Glycerol was added (final concentration 2%, v/v) to the concentrated protein solutions, which could be stored at 5 °C for several weeks without significant activity loss. For flash height measurements, data were acquired and stored with a Strawberry Tree, Inc. A/D converter and a Macintosh SE computer. Initial flash height measurements were made with a customized version of the workbench software. Assays were initiated by injecting 120 μl of 10 mm Mg-ATP in 25 mm glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.8) into 400 μl of the same buffer containing 30 μl ofd-luciferin and luciferase solutions (4 μl). For the integration-based assays, coenzyme A (0.1 mm final concentration) was included in the assay mixture. After injection of ATP and a 30-s delay, light emission was measured for 30 s to generate the integrated value. The kinetic profiles of the luciferase were evaluated with various concentrations of luciferin (1–75 μm) at pH 8.7 using 25 mm Tris with 0.1% (v/v) glycerol. Kinetic measurements were also made with varying concentrations of Mg-ATP (0.15 μm–2 mm) by injecting luciferin solution to initiate the reaction. Partial proteolysis of luciferase was undertaken to identify regions of the protein whose particular sensitivity to proteolysis would denote that they were flexible, accessible, and possibly near the active site. Cleavage with trypsin or chymotrypsin yielded similar product patterns with initial products of about 45 and 30 kDa followed by a number of smaller peptides (Fig. 1). The major bands were sequenced from electroblots to determine the N terminus of each fragment. The primary cleavages, which generated the initial bands at early times, occurred in two ranges of sequence: residues 206–220 or residues 329–341 (Fig. 2). Bands appearing later included C-terminally shortened versions of the original peptides as well as the products of new cleavages in the ranges of 31–34 and 383–446. In all cases analyzed, the sites of cleavage conformed to the canonical selectivity of the protease employed.Figure 2Native firefly luciferase proteolysis sites.

Since the region around residue 200 is highly homologous to all other luciferases, a variety of CoA ligases, and several antibiotic and polypeptide synthetases, this region was chosen for study in greater detail. Alignments for eight different luciferases and nine CoA ligases/acyl synthetases are shown in Fig. 3. Six of the luciferases are identical in 16 consecutive residues. The other sequences show more variability, but all are identical for 6 of 10 amino acids (corresponding to positions 198–207). To determine whether amino acids in this region could be changed without loss of function, each amino acid from 198 to 203 was individually mutated to alanine, and the resultant proteins were assayed for function. Amino acids 198, 201, 202, and 203 could be changed while retaining 10–100% of WT luminescent activity, but the S199A or G200A changes resulted in a complete loss of activity (<0.01% remaining). The ability of mutants in this region to retain activity led us to study additional changes. Positions 194, 196, 197, 198, and 201 were targeted with degenerate oligonucleotides because they demonstrated the greatest variation between luciferases and the other proteins. Active proteins were recovered that had changes in each position (Fig.4). Multiple mutations could be observed in a single novel protein, and the most active new protein (L194F/N197Y/S198T) had three changes relative to WT. To help separate the effects of the different mutations, other proteins were also constructed in which the only amino acid changed was position 198 (changed to Thr, Pro, Phe, Leu, Ala, Val, and Ile). Of these, only S198T and S198A retained greater than 10% of wild-type activity whereas S198P was about 500-fold less active than WT. To rationalize the properties of these novel proteins, three of the more active variants, L194F/N197Y/S198T, L194F/M196L, and S198T were partially purified and studied in detail. The effect of pH on the bioluminescence activity of highly purified native luciferase, partially purified WT (putatively the same sequence as native but prepared in E. coli in parallel to the mutant luciferases (13Branchini B.R. Magyar R.A. Murtishaw M.H. Magnasco N. Hinz L.K. Stroh J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), and mutant luciferases was investigated using flash height-based assays performed over the pH range 6.5–9.0. The results are shown in Fig. 5, and the pH optima data are summarized in Table I. L194F/M196L and WT have identical pH optima of 8.1. The other four luciferases, all of which have the S198T change, had pH optima shifted to 8.7–8.8. The observation that the single point mutant S198T had maximal activity at pH 8.7 indicated that this single conservative amino acid change was sufficient to cause the alkaline pH shift also found in L194F/S198T, L194F/N197Y/S198T, and L194Y/M196L/S198T/S201T (Table I and Fig. 5).Table ISpecific activities of luciferase enzymesEnzymeSpecific activity1-aEnzyme activities were determined by the standard flash height assay or 30-s integration assays.

Open table in a new tab Because pH had such a dramatic effect, the mutant luciferases were evaluated at pH 7.8 and 8.7 to enable a comparison of relative specific activities. Luciferase protein levels were estimated using Western blot analysis. The flash height and integration-based specific activity data at pH 7.8 and 8.7 for WT and the pH optimum-shifted mutants are presented in Table I. The ratios of pH-dependent specific activity measured by integration assays or by flash height-based measurements varied by more than a factor of 10 among the proteins. Among the four S198T-containing mutants, L194F/N197Y/S198T had the highest specific activity at pH 7.8 and 8.7 using either assay method. The time dependence of bioluminescence intensity for crude samples of S198T, L194F/N197Y/S198T, and WT at pH 7.8 and 8.7 (Fig.6) and the decay times for the purified recombinant proteins were determined (Table I). WT and native bioluminescence decay rates were maintained only by L194F/M196L, the mutant that retained Ser198. The single point mutation found in S198T was sufficient to dramatically decrease the rate of bioluminescence decay at pH 7.8 and 8.7 for crude and purified luciferase. In fact, at pH 7.8, the light emission from the purified S198T protein rose only slowly to its maximum value over 22 min and decayed to 40% of this value after approximately 3 h (data not shown). The decreased bioluminescence decay that resulted from the S198T mutation was still maintained, though much less so, in the L194F/N197Y/S198T mutant. The decay rates for the L194F/S198T mutant were intermediate with light emission intensity 50 and 30% of the initial values obtained after 90 s at pH 7.8 and 8.7, respectively (data not shown). The N197Y mutation increased bioluminescence efficiency and decay rates relative to both L194F/S198T and S198T. The effects of the amino acid changes in L194F/N197Y/S198T and S198T on substrate binding were investigated by determiningK m values for substrates luciferin and Mg-ATP at pH 8.7. For native and WT luciferases at pH 8.7, the K mvalues for Mg-ATP were 146 ± 22 and 180 ± 20 μm, respectively. The K m values for L194F/N197Y/S198T and S198T were 44 ± 4 and 39 ± 4 μm, indicating that the mutants bind Mg-ATP more tightly than the unaltered enzyme. The K m for luciferin with the native enzyme was 11.5 ± 2 μm and was essentially unchanged in the mutants. An evaluation of the mutants for proteolytic and thermal stability compared with the WT or native enzyme revealed only minor differences (data not shown). L194F/N197Y/S198T was found to be a slightly more stable protein than the other enzymes studied, including WT and native luciferases, based on modest improvements in stability to chymotrypsin hydrolysis and incubation at 42 °C (data not shown). To determine the usefulness of the L194F/N197Y/S198T protein as a reporter in mammalian cell systems, its expression level was examined in HepG2 cells, and no differences were found between mutant and WT. The ability to generate stable cell lines upon co-transfection with pSV2neo was also examined, and again no difference could be detected between the mutant and WT. Because WT and L194F/N197Y/S198T have different pH optima, the two proteins could potentially be distinguished in the same cell. This situation was simulated by adding progressively more L194F/N197Y/S198T to a constant amount of WT and measuring light intensity at both pH 6.6 (which favors WT) and pH 9.0 (which favors L194F/N197Y/S198T). The ratio of activities at these pH levels provides an accurate reflection of the relative amounts of the two proteins (Fig. 7). Because the decay kinetics for the proteins differ, a calibration curve of known ratios should be run to ensure accuracy. Firefly luciferase has been a very useful reporter protein because of the ease with which it is detected and its quick response to changes in transcription. Nevertheless, because there are times when altered properties would be desirable, we attempted to identify regions in which mutagenesis might lead to improved functional properties. The strategy of combining partial proteolysis with knowledge of protein family homologies was successful in allowing us to generate functionally interesting mutations. The K m results for L194F/N197Y/S198T and S198T provide an experimental basis for the involvement of the region around amino acid 200 in Mg-ATP binding. The single conservative change, S198T, results in a mutant luciferase with unaltered affinity for luciferin but a higher affinity for Mg-ATP than WT. This suggests that Ser198 and perhaps the conserved domain comprised of residues Ala193–Val208 is directly involved in Mg-ATP binding but not luciferin binding. Supporting this further is the observation that a T204D mutation in Luciola mingrelicaincreases the K m for ATP by a factor of 8 while leaving the specific activity unchanged (14Dementieva E.I. Zheleznova E.E. Kutuzova G.D. Lundovskikh I.A. Ugarova N.N. Biochemistry ( Moscow ). 1996; 61: 115-119Google Scholar). The homologous region of the Bacillus brevis tyrocidine synthetase protein has also been implicated in ATP binding based on mutational studies (15Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling suggested that ATP binding occurred at the equivalent of P. pyralis peptides Gly400–Ala410, Trp426–Arg437, and Val506–Phe518 (16Pavela-Vrancic M. Pfeifer E. van Liempt H. Schäfer H.-J. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but now that the luciferase structure is available (10Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), it can readily be seen that sites of photoaffinity labeling are spatially close to 198–207 even though they are distant in the primary structure. This region of the protein likely constitutes a portion of the ATP binding domain. Given the highly conserved nature of the 198–207 region, it was surprising that changes could be tolerated in so many positions. Furthermore, one of the positions that we find to be critical in luciferase (Gly200) can be changed to alanine in the homologous position of the B. brevis tyrocidine synthetase with only a minor loss of activity (15Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the G200A mutation, five further changes were also made (15Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these is identical to the G203A change we made. In both cases, no effect was seen on activity. We have not made the other mutations described (15Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but note that these authors found that altering the highly conserved Lys206 was detrimental to activity. Whereas the single mutations provide useful information, the compensating effects among some multiple mutations are particularly interesting. For example, L194F/N197Y/S198T has three changes relative to WT, L194F/S198T has two of the same changes, and S198T has only the single change shared by these proteins. The introduction of the single S198T change results in a significant loss of activity at pH 7.8, and the additional L194F change causes an even greater loss of activity. However, when the N197Y mutation is introduced in addition to the first two, significant activity is restored. Some properties of these novel proteins are dramatically affected. The pH optima of several of the luciferases shift from 8.1 to 8.7. This effect is due to the S198T mutation as it occurs in all proteins with the change and in none without it. The mechanistic rationale for this change is not yet known, but it is noteworthy that there are two charged residues in close proximity to amino acid 198, Lys206 and Glu344, both of which are absolutely conserved in 38 sequences that include the luciferases and acyladenylate-forming enzymes (10Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ser198 is hydrogen bonded to Glu344 in the crystal structure (10Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This is near the other region of luciferase, 329–341, which we observed to be hypersensitive to proteases and is also highly conserved among luciferases. Other luciferases have been observed to have altered pH optima (17Viviani V.R. Bechara E.J.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 490-495Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but these are shifted toward more acidic pH levels. Interestingly, each of the mutants with the altered pH optimum also has altered emission decay kinetics. The decay of L194F/N197Y/S198T is more than 10-fold slower than WT while S198T decays over 1000 times more slowly. The increased affinity for ATP may be related to the altered luminescent decay. Addition of CoA to the luciferase reaction is thought to have a similar effect (18Ford S.R. Buck L.M. Leach F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) on WT luciferase. The mutant luciferases examined here are also stimulated by addition of CoA (data not shown). The slow, steady decay of luminescence of L194F/N197Y/S198T is particularly useful in situations in which large numbers of samples prevent rapid assaying and in laboratories without access to rapid flash instrumentation. The luciferase mutations described in this work not only provide insight into how luciferase carries out its luminescent reaction but also provides an improved reporter system. Whereas transfection experiments in which gene expression is quantitated frequently contain internal controls, these controls are often flawed because of the different kinetic response and stability of the tested and control reporters. By using two versions of the same reporter, more reliable controls can be generated. For example, the activity of WT and mutant luciferase expressed under the control of two independent promoters can be separated by measuring the ratio of luminescence at pH 6.6 and 9.0. This can provide an accurate measure of the relative concentrations of WT and L194F/N197Y/S198T. Since the in vivo stability of the proteins is nearly identical, the two luciferases provide excellent controls for one another. The results of proteolysis and mutagenesis studies presented here are fully consistent with the crystal structure of firefly luciferase and provide some clues as to the enzymatic mechanism. Studies employing these data as a basis should provide more insight into the mechanism of the protein and possibly allow further improvements in its use as a reporter gene."

There was no change in the number of surface-exposed EGF receptors between G0/G1 and M phases of the cell cycle.

This M phase-specific negative regulation was overcome by overexpression of EGFR, which was responsive to ligand throughout the cell cycle and revealed ligand-induced signaling in the M phase. These findings indicate that EGFR does not respond to ligand stimulation in M phase and suggest that a negative regulation of ligand-receptor interactions in M phase may control the normal function of receptor tyrosine kinase and that receptor overexpression will disrupt this cell cycle-dependent regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases.

There are several lines of evidence that implicate the enhanced activity of this growth factor receptor with the progression of cancer. First, numerous clinically related studies reported overexpression of EGFR in various human cancers such as bladder (2Berger M.S. Greenfield C. Gullick W.J. Haley J. Downward J. Neal D.E. Harris A.L. Waterfield M.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1987; 56: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), brain (3Libermann T.A. Nusbaum H.R. Razon N. Kris R. Lax I. Soreq H. Whittle N.

Waterfield M.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the receptor tyrosine kinase plays a role in their progression. In addition, many cases of EGFR overexpression in cancer cells are accompanied by the expression of transforming growth factor α, a ligand for EGFR, suggesting the involvement of an autocrine activation mechanism in oncogenesis (6Derynck R. Goeddel D.V. Ullrich A. Gutterman J.U. Williams R.D. Bringman T.S. Berger W.H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 707-712PubMed Google Scholar, 7Di Marco E. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Kraus M.H. Molloy C.J. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 831-838PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the potent transforming ability of EGFR is confirmed by in vitroor in vivo experiments. For example, it was reported that both overexpression of EGFR (8Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Hazan R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S.A.

Indeed, v-erbB oncogene encoding a truncated form of chicken EGFR led to erythroleukemia and fibrosarcomas in chicks (12Frykberg L. Palmieri S. Beug H. Graf T. Hayman M.J. Vennstrom B.

Virology. 1976; 71: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These reports have shown that enhancement of the mitogenic signal from receptor tyrosine kinase is sufficient to induce the progression of cancer. Although many mitogenic signal transduction cascades involving receptor tyrosine kinases have been defined (15Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar,16McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the downstream mechanism of carcinogenesis still remains unclear. On the other hand, a number of reports have suggested that malfunction of the cell cycle control mechanism is directly involved in carcinogenesis. For example, it is well documented that an essential function of the protein products of tumor suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma gene and the p53 gene, whose abnormalities result in cancer progression, is to keep the cells in G0phase (17Hinds P.W. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors, p21 and p16 (which block the cell cycle progression at the check point of G0 to G1 or G1 to S by inhibiting cdk activity), function as tumor suppressors (18el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Nature. 1994; 368: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). The above findings indicate that the normal cell cycle control mechanism is important for the prevention of cancer progression. Considering the fact that an essential function of receptor tyrosine kinases is to promote the progression of the cell cycle, carcinogenesis may be regarded as a result of disrupted cell cycle regulation. Because receptor tyrosine kinases are believed to promote the transition of cells from the resting state to cell division cycle, most cell cycle-related studies involving receptor tyrosine kinases have focused on the cell's entry into the cell cycle. Even though the structures and activities of numerous growth-related molecules, such as Abl (22Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), Src (23Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), p53 (24Bischoff J.R. Friedman P.N. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), have been shown to be regulated throughout the cell cycle, how receptor tyrosine kinases affect the remaining cell cycle stages or how they are regulated throughout the entire cell cycle has not been well studied. In an attempt to understand the detailed mechanism of oncogenesis induced by enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, we investigated the relationship between the receptor tyrosine kinases and the entire cell cycle. Recently, we have reported that the structure and tyrosine kinase activity of another member of the EGFR family, ErbB-2, a protein product (185 kDa) of the neu or c-erbB-2/Her 2 proto-oncogene (26Schechter A.L.

Yan D.H. Brown M.E. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The next question we asked was about the relationship between the cell cycle-dependent regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases and ligand-induced signaling. Since a direct ligand for ErbB-2 is still unknown, despite the reports of several candidates (30Dobashi K. Weiner D.B. Greene M.I. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1989; 8: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Levy R.B. Yarden Y.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we have investigated the structural and functional changes of another member of this receptor tyrosine kinase family, the EGFR tyrosine kinase, and its relation to ligand stimulation during the cell cycle. In this report, we describe that in addition to the regulation of intrinsic kinase activity, ligand-induced signaling of EGFR is also tightly suppressed in the M phase at its basal level expression. However, although it showed structural modification in a cell cycle-specific manner, the overexpressed EGFR is still highly responsive to the ligand to induce ligand-mediated signaling in the M phase, suggesting that EGFR overexpression may overcome the M phase-specific negative regulation. Cell lines, A431, rat-1, MDA-MB-468, Swiss 3T3 (SW3T3), and HBL-100 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Her-5 cells (derived from NR-6 cells by stable transfection with the human EGFR expression vector) were provided by Dr. H.-J. Kung (Case Western Reserve University). NR-6 is a Swiss 3T3 variant that lacks EGF receptors (28Hung M.C. Schechter A.L. Chevray P.Y. Stern D.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Schneider C.A. Lim R.W. Terwilliger E. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium mixed with F-12 (1:1; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Aphidicolin, Hoechst 33342, and Protein A-agarose were supplied by Boehringer Mannheim. Nocodazole and thymidine were bought from Sigma. IODO-GEN and BS3 were from Pierce. Radioactive Na125I and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Corp. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Transduction Lab.) and monoclonal anti-PLC-γ antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) were used for immunoblotting. Monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody RP-13 (Amersham Corp.) and rabbit anti-PLC-γ antisera (a gift from Dr. Y. Yarden, The Weizmann Institute of Science) were used for immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal antibody to EGFR (528) was obtained from Neo Markers, CA. Sheep polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (Transduction Lab.) were used for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. A monoclonal antibody to cdc2 (Santa Cruz, sc-54) and rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Amersham Corp.) were also used. Cells were chemically synchronized at each cell cycle stage. To arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase, cells (50–60% confluent) were serum-starved in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FCS for 48 h (22Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). After serum starvation, cells were accumulated at pre-S phase by incubation in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FCS and aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) for 24 h (35Tobey R.A. Oishi N. Crissman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5104-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed with medium and placed in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FCS and Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 24 h to be accumulated in G2 phase (35Tobey R.A. Oishi N. Crissman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5104-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To synchronize cells in M phase, cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 with 10% FCS and nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml) for 12–24 h. After nocodazole treatment, about 50–90% cells had a highly rounded mitotic morphology and were collected by mechanical shake-off (23Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the case of A431 cells, because of the difficulty of shaking off, 2 × 106 cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 with 10% FCS and nocodazole in 15-cm plates for 12–24 h, a condition in which more than 80% of the cells had a mitotic shape as determined by microscopy, and then were collected by scraping. For DNA content analysis, trypsinized cells were fixed for 30 min at −20 °C in 70% ethanol, 30% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixture. After staining with PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 8 μg/ml RNase A, cells were analyzed on an EPICS PROFILE flow cytometer (Coulter) as described (23Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The results were analyzed with the MultiCycle computer program (Phoenix Flow System). For some experiments, rat-1 cells were blocked in G1 phase with 4 mm thymidine in serum-free medium for 16 h, and the block was released by removing the drug (washing) and supplementing the medium with 10% FCS. After 9–12 h, changes in EGFR were followed in cells (collected by a shake-off procedure) by DNA content analysis and/or electrophoresis. After each treatment, cells were solubilized for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mmNaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4), and the total protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 3 mA/cm2 using a semi-dry transblot system (Bio-Rad). After blocking with PBS containing 5% milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS followed by washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. After 30 min incubation with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and a subsequent washing with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, immunoblots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Corp.) for 1 min and exposed to film (Hyper-film, Amersham Corp.). For immunoprecipitations, 500 μg to 1 mg of cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of antibody and 50 μl of 50% protein-A agarose for 1 h. After several washes with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS, immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed. EGFR proteins were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of Her-5 cell lysates arrested in the G0/G1 or M phase as described above. After washing three times with PBS, the immune complexes on agarose beads were incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). After washing, the proteins were eluted into gel sample loading buffer and immunoblotted with anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody after electrophoresis. The IODO-GEN method (Pierce) was used to radioiodinate the proteins as follows. Human recombinant EGF (5 μg) or rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (50 μg) in PBS was mixed in an IODO-GEN-coated (∼1 μg/tube dissolved in chloroform and air-dried) tube with Na125I (1 mCi). Following 10 min at 23 °C, tyrosine was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the mixture was separated on a column of Excellulose GF-5 (Pierce). The specific activity varied between 2 and 5 × 105cpm/ng. Monolayers of cells in 24-well dishes were washed once with binding buffer (DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES). For ligand binding analysis, cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml125I-EGF in the same buffer, and unlabeled ligand, at different concentrations, was co-incubated with the radiolabeled ligand for 2 h at 4 °C. For Scatchard analysis, cells were incubated with different concentrations of 125I-EGF for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer and lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 37 °C, and the radioactivity was determined by using a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 1 μg/ml unlabeled EGF together with labeled EGF under the above incubation conditions. For some experiments, a mouse monoclonal antibody to EGFR or a control antibody was first used to bind the cells at 4 °C for 90 min, washed, and a radiolabeled second antibody against the mouse immunoglobulin G was used in binding. Cells synchronized in the G0/G1 or M phase were stimulated with or without EGF, collected in PBS by scraping, and then centrifuged. For some experiments cells were incubated with 125I-EGF (10 ng/ml) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing with PBS twice, cells were incubated with 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C with rocking. The cells were washed with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl and solubilized with PI/RIPA buffer (36Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). EGFR proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated on protein-A agarose beads as described above. After washing four times, once with PBS, twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and once with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2), immunoprecipitates were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer for 20 min at room temperature with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity >3000 Ci/mm, Amersham Corp.) and 10 μg of enolase (37Epstein R.J. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10746-10751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as an exogenous substrate. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 6 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample loading buffer. After separation on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and drying, the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. After in vitro immune complex kinase assay, EGF receptor bands were excised and extracted from the gel followed by hydrolyzation in 6 n constant boiling HCl for 60 min at 110 °C as described previously (38Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). After drying, hydrolysates were separated on thin layer chromatography plates with unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards by two-dimensional electrophoresis and then were exposed to x-ray film. The positions of phosphoamino acids were visualized by ninhydrin staining. Since we have reported the altered electrophoretic mobility of ErbB-2 in a cell cycle-specific manner by means of serine and/or threonine phosphorylation with alteration of its kinase activity (29Kiyokawa N. Yan D.H. Brown M.E. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the EGFR undergoes similar changes during the cell cycle. A human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, known for its overexpression of EGF receptors (∼2 × 106/cell), was first chemically arrested in different stages of the cell cycle for DNA content analysis. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1 A, serum starvation synchronized the cells in G0/G1, aphidicolin treatment accumulated the cells in pre-S phase and Hoechst in G2, and nocodazole arrested them in M phase of the cell cycle as expected. When the EGF receptor protein from the A431 cell lysate was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody, the 170-kDa EGF receptor band showed a retardation of its electrophoretic mobility notably in M phase (Fig. 1 A) suggestive of cell cycle-dependent structural alterations in the EGF receptor. Similar results were observed in Her-5, a mouse fibroblast cell line that was made to express the human EGF receptor by integrating a human EGFR expressing vector into NR-6, a subline of SW3T3 (Fig. 1 B), and in a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, that overexpresses the EGFR (Fig.1 D). To see whether the electrophoretic mobility changes are related to the level of EGFR expression, rat-1 cells, rat fibroblasts expressing a low level of EGFR (2.8 × 104receptors/cell), were synchronized at G0/G1 and M phase. The electrophoretic mobility was retarded again upon nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1 C), and similar results were obtained in HBL-100 (Fig. 1 D), a mammary epithelial cell line expressing a basal level of EGFR, indicating that the electrophoretic mobility retardation of the EGF receptor in M phase is independent of its expression level. It is interesting to note that the retardation in electrophoretic mobility of EGF receptor was observed in both the transformed cells (A431) and non-transformed cells (Her-5, rat-1). To address the question of whether the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR is also regulated in a cell cycle-specific manner, we next examined for an alteration of phosphotyrosine content in EGFR during the cell cycle which is thought to reflect changes in the gross functional activity of tyrosine kinase. When the protein extracts from A431 cells in different cell cycle stages were examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, EGFR showed different levels of phosphotyrosine content in a cell cycle-dependent manner: phosphotyrosine levels were highest in the G0/G1 phase, decreasing through the S and G2 phases, and reaching their lowest level in the M phase (Fig. 2 A). We also observed similar results with Her-5 cells that overexpress the human EGFR (Fig. 2 A). Considering these results together with those of in vitroimmune complex kinase assay which showed a reduced intrinsic kinase activity of EGFR in the M phase (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1 and3), we concluded that the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and is least active in the M phase.Figure 1DNA content analysis and changes in electrophoretic mobility of EGFR during cell cycle.

The Ca2+-dependent interactions of calmodulin (CaM) with its target proteins play an essential role in a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the interactions of G protein βγ subunits with CaM. We found that CaM binds to known βγ subunits and these interactions are Ca2+-dependent. The CaM-binding domain in Gβγ subunits is identified as Gβ residues 40–63. Peptides derived from the Gβ protein not only produce a Ca2+-dependent gel mobility shifting of CaM but also inhibit the CaM-mediated activation of CaM kinase II. Specific amino acid residues critical for the binding of Gβγ to CaM were also identified. We then investigated the potential function of these interactions and showed that binding of CaM to Gβγ inhibits the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo subunits, presumably by inhibiting heterotrimer formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interaction with CaM has little effect on the activation of phospholipase C-β2 by Gβγ subunits, supporting the notion that different domains of Gβγ are responsible for the interactions of different effectors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis for the interactions of Gβγ with Ca2+-CaM and point to the potential physiological significance of these interactions in cellular functions.

These findings shed light on the molecular basis for the interactions of Gβγ with Ca2+-CaM and point to the potential physiological significance of these interactions in cellular functions. In response to external stimuli or changes in ligand concentration, the activated seven-transmembrane receptors of the cell interact with heterotrimeric G proteins. These in turn activate or inhibit a variety of intracellular proteins through either the Gα subunits with GTP bound or the free Gβγ subunits or both, leading to the generation of second-messenger molecules and changes in the patterns of cellular metabolic activity and growth. Whereas direct interaction of G protein α subunits with effectors has been known for a long time, recently it has been demonstrated that Gβγ subunits also play critical roles in effector activation, in modulating the interaction among various G protein pathways, and in regulating cellular functions. For example, the Gβγ dimers have been shown to participate in interactions with adenylyl cyclases (1Tang W.J. Gilman A.G.

Calmodulin (CaM) has been known to act as an intracellular calcium sensor protein. When the intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases, CaM can bind up to four Ca2+ ions, changing its conformation and regulating cellular functions such as activation or inhibition of a large number of enzymes (19Klee C.B.

Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These Ca2+-dependent interactions of CaM with its target proteins have played an important role in intracellular Ca2+ signaling and in various cellular functions including cell growth and differentiation. There are reports demonstrating that G protein βγ complex can bind to CaM when passed through the CaM-agarose column (23Asano T. Ogasawara N. Kitajima S. Sano M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 135-138Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Katada T. Kusakabe K. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11897-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the precise nature of the interaction is not clear. In this report, we investigated the interaction of Ca2+-CaM with Gβγ subunits and the potential physiological significance of this interaction. We found that CaM not only binds to Gβγ subunits purified from brain but also to the most diverse Gβ5Lγ complex from retina. We then identified and characterized the CaM-binding domain of the Gβ subunit by using synthetic peptides and site-specific mutation. Furthermore, we showed that binding of CaM to βγ inhibits the βγ-dependent PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gα subunits. Using both brain Gβγ subunits and the CaM-binding peptide derived from the β subunit, we demonstrated that the Ca2+-CaM-dependent activation of CaM kinase II could be inhibited at a molar ratio of 1 (peptide/CaM). These studies provide insight into the molecular basis for the interactions of βγ with Ca2+-CaM and the potential functions of these interactions in modulating cellular signaling and other functions. Synthetic peptides were obtained from the Peptide Synthesis Facility (Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology). Peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and verified by mass spectrometry. Bovine brain CaM was purchased from Calbiochem. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PtdInsP2) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and Boehringer Manheim, respectively. [3H]PtdInsP2,myo-[2-3H]inositol, and [32P]NAD were obtained from DuPont NEN. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories Inc. Bleached bovine rod outer segment membranes were prepared from bovine retina as described (25Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Transducin was removed from the membranes by 6 × hypotonic elution with 100 μmGTPγS in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 (26Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The remaining membranes were solubilized for 12 h at 4 °C in 20 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% (by mass) sodium cholate. Unsolubilized material was pelleted for 40 min at 100,000 ×g, and the supernatant was diluted with 30 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.67 mm CaCl2 (final concentration: 1 mm CaCl2, 0.4% sodium cholate). The diluted supernatant was then applied at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min to a CaM-Sepharose column (10-ml bed volume, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with the above described buffer. The column was washed with 50 ml of the above buffer. Proteins bound to the CaM-Sepharose column were then isocratically eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.4% sodium cholate. Fractions of 600 μl were collected. 20 μl of the indicated fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the Gβ5-specific antiserum CT215 as described (27Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity binding of G protein β peptides to CaM was demonstrated by the gel mobility shifts of CaM in 12.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in the presence or absence of 4 m urea. Different concentrations of Gβ peptide were incubated with 1 μm CaM at room temperature for 30 min. To determine the Ca2+ dependence and binding stoichiometry, gels were run in the presence of either 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using SLM 4800 spectrofluorimeter. Excitation was at 295 nm. Excitation and emission band-passes were both 10 nm. Total fluorescence was determined by integration of emission spectra. The fluorescence titration data was used to determine the dissociation constant as described previously (28DeGrado W.F. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe Jr., H.R. O'Neil K.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1987; 2: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By plotting the fraction of bound peptide as a function of free CaM concentrations, we obtained the peptide-CaM titration curve. The dissociation constant for the peptide-CaM binding was obtained from the curve fitting. Mutations in the putative CaM-binding site of Gβ1were generated by polymerase chain reaction with the high fidelity DNA polymerase, Pfu (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing done in the DNA sequencing facility at Caltech. The β constructs were subcloned into pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transcription and translation were carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system from Promega at 30 °C for 90 min with amino acid mixtures without methionine. 5 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) was added to the reaction mixture to monitor the synthesis of new proteins. 1–2 μg of cDNAs were used in each translation. 2.5 μl aliquots of the translation mixture were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. The newly synthesized proteins were identified by autoradiography. After in vitro translation, the protein mixture was incubated with CaM-agarose beads in the presence of Ca2+ for 30 min at room temperature. Then the CaM-agarose beads were washed extensively to get rid of nonspecific binding. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by a buffer containing 10 mm EGTA. The eluted Gβ proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo was performed as described previously (29Slepak V.Z. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1414-1423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μg of recombinant Gαo was mixed with 0.1 μg of purified rat brain βγ subunits in the absence or presence of Ca2+-CaM and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of the reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 μm32P-labeled NAD (20,000 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg/ml pertussis toxin). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and terminated by adding 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Labeling of proteins was detected by autoradiography. The Ca2+-CaM-dependent activity of CaM kinase II was assayed essentially as described previously (30Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11213-11219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, different concentrations of Gβ peptide were preincubated with Ca2+-CaM for 30 min at room temperature. The phosphorylation reactions contained 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm CaM, 5–10 μg of CaM kinase II peptide substrate (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), and purified rat brain CaM kinase II (Calbiochem). All assays were initiated by the addition of kinase. cDNAs encoding PLC-β2, Gβγ, and CaM were cotransfected into COS-7 cells with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Then the cells were labeled with 10 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol the following day. 48 h after transfection, the activity of PLC-β2 was assayed by determining the levels of inositol phosphates as described previously (31Wu D. Lee C-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles containing 50 μm[3H]PtdInsP2 and 500 μmphophatidylethanolamine were prepared by mixing with chloroform solution, drying under a stream of N2, then sonicating with 88 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and 18 mm LiCl. Assays were performed in a 70-μl reaction mixture containing 20 ng of PLC-β2, 1.7 μm Gβγ from bovine retina, 50 μm CaCl2, 10 mm LiCl, and phospholipid vesicles. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of different concentrations of CaM. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.35 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (500:500:3). The released Ins-1,4,5-P3 was extracted by adding 0.1 ml of 1 m HCl with vigorous vortexing. The aqueous phase separated after centrifugation was subjected to scintillation counting. To demonstrate the direct interaction of Gβγ subunits with CaM, purified bovine brain βγ subunits were incubated with CaM-agarose gel in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. After extensively washing with Ca2+-containing buffer, the bound βγ subunits were eluted by buffer containing EGTA. As shown in Fig.1 A, brain βγ binds to CaM, and this binding is Ca2+-dependent. Direct binding was also observed in a gel overlay assay with 125I-labeled CaM (data not shown). There are five different G protein β subunits that have been characterized in mammalian systems. Among them, Gβ5 is the most diverse form and is expressed predominately in neuronal cells (27Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A splice variant of Gβ5, β5L, is found only in rod outer segment membrane. To examine whether CaM binding is a common feature in different βγ subunits, Gβ5Lγ extracts were obtained from bovine retina and passed through a CaM-agarose fast protein liquid chromatography column in the presence of Ca2+. Proteins bound to the CaM-agarose column were eluted with buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and detected by specific antibodies against the Gβ5 subunit. Like other βγ subunits, β5Lγ also binds to Ca2+-CaM (Fig.1 B), suggesting that the CaM-binding domain is conserved in all Gβγ subunits. To identify the CaM-binding domain on Gβγ subunits, the amino acid sequences of βγ were compared with those of known high affinity CaM-binding proteins. We found that the N terminus of all Gβ subunits contains a putative CaM-binding domain that exhibits the characteristics typical of CaM-binding peptides (32O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the alignment of the N-terminal domain sequences of Gβ subunits with well known CaM-binding domains of rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (RAT OCNC), skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (SK-MLCK), Ca2+ pump, calcineurin, Ras-like GTPase Kir/Gem, murine inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and CaM kinase II. To demonstrate that the small domain from amino acid residues Val-40–Trp-63 is indeed the CaM-binding domain of Gβ subunits, synthetic peptides representing the putative CaM-binding domain were prepared and tested for their abilities to bind CaM in the presence of Ca2+ using both gel mobility shifting assay and tryptophan fluorescence assays. Binding of peptides to CaM was first assayed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel shifting assay. Depending on the charges and hydrophobicity of the peptide, high affinity binding of the peptide to CaM was detected as a complex band with increased or decreased mobility compared with the unbound CaM band. In the presence of Ca2+, the mobility of CaM was decreased by the peptide corresponding to Gβ residues 40–63 (Fig.3 A). Several ratios of the peptide to CaM were used. In the absence of peptide, there is a single, fast-moving band reflecting pure Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 3 A, CaM alone). At ratios of 0.25 and 0.75 of peptide to CaM, two bands were visible on the gel, the fast-moving CaM band and the lower mobility peptide-Ca2+-CaM complex. At a 1:1 molar ratio of peptide to CaM, all of the CaM was gel-shifted, and the intensity of the peptide-Ca2+-CaM band was increased as the result of complex formation (Fig. 3 A). At still higher molar ratios, no new band was detected on the gel nor did the peptide-CaM complex band change in intensity, indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of peptide to CaM and the absence of multivalent peptide-CaM complexes (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained when gel shift assays were performed in the presence of 4 m urea. However, in the presence of Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, only the pure CaM bands were detected on the gel and no peptide-CaM complex band was visible (Fig. 3 B), indicating the complex formation is Ca2+-dependent. Peptides from other regions of the Gβ subunit had no effect on the mobility of CaM (data not shown). Since the synthetic peptide contains a tryptophan residue, whereas CaM contains none, binding of Gβ peptide to CaM was directly studied by monitoring the changes in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.4). When the peptide was excited at 295 nm, it exhibited an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission peak at 353 nm. Addition of CaM in the presence of Ca2+ not only caused a blue shift of the fluorescence peak but also increased the maximal fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4 A). Since Ca2+ alone has no effect on the emission spectrum, the observed change must have resulted from the binding of Ca2+-CaM to the peptide. The blue shift in fluorescence emission and the increase in total intensity indicate that the environment of the Gβ peptide became hydrophobic, presumably due to interactions with the hydrophobic domains of CaM upon formation of complex, further confirming the CaM binding property of the peptide. The changes in fluorescence property upon formation of the peptide-CaM complex were fully reversed by the addition of EGTA (Fig.4 A), indicating that the binding of CaM to the peptide is Ca2+-dependent. Titration of fixed amounts of peptide with different concentrations of CaM showed a saturation pattern. As shown in Fig. 4 B, when a 0.1 μmconcentration of peptide was used, the fluorescence intensity increased almost linearly with increasing CaM concentrations and reached a plateau at 0.1 μm CaM, confirming a 1:1 tight binding between the peptide and CaM. When the fraction of bound peptide was plotted as a function of free CaM concentration, the dissociation constant (K d) obtained was ∼40 nm(Fig. 4 C), indicating high affinity binding to Ca2+-CaM. The actual binding affinity could be higher than 40 nm; however, the limitation of this fluorescence measurement does not allow us to test low peptide concentration. To identify the key amino acids essential for CaM binding, two types of mutations were carried out in the putative CaM-binding domain by site-directed mutagenesis. One set contains a number of basic amino acid residues (Arg-42, Arg-48, Arg-49), and the other group involves hydrophobic residues (Ile-43, Leu-51, Leu-55). These specific amino acids were individually replaced by alanine residues. Mutant proteins were then compared with wild type protein for their ability to bind Ca2+-CaM. Both wild type and mutant cDNA were translated in vitro together with γ2 subunit in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of35S-labeled methionine. Fig. 5 Ashows the in vitro translated wild type and mutant Gβ proteins separated by SDS-gel and detected by autoradiography. The amount of wild type protein and mutant proteins synthesized are similar under these assay conditions. The in vitro translated protein mixtures were incubated with CaM-agarose beads to assess the CaM binding ability. After extensive washing with Ca2+-containing buffer (100–200 bead volume), the bound protein was eluted with EGTA buffer. As shown in Fig. 5 B, like the wild type Gβ protein, one of the mutants (R42A) retained its ability to bind CaM. However, the binding affinities of other mutants (I43A, L55A, R48A/R49A, and L51A) for CaM were reduced by varying degrees under the same assay conditions. For instance, mutations at residues Arg-48, Arg-49, and Leu-51 dramatically reduced the CaM binding ability of the protein (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that these residues are critical in the interactions. To further probe the conformation and activity of mutant Gβ subunits, we analyzed the formation of βγ dimers using in vitro translated proteins and coimmunoprecipitation with specific anti-Gγ2antibodies. The wild type Gβ and its mutant proteins can be precipitated by γ2 antibodies, and there is little difference in their ability to interact with γ subunits (data not shown), indicating that mutant β subunits could still fold into the native conformation and retain affinity for γ subunits. To explore the possible physiological functions of CaM binding to Gβγ subunits, we first examined the effects of CaM binding on βγ-dependent pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo subunit. PTX is a bacterial toxin that catalyzes the ribosylation of the C-terminal cysteine residues of Gαo, Gαi, and Gαt subunits. PTX modification blocks the interactions of Gα subunits with receptors and thus blocks the ligand-mediated signal transduction. The labeling of Gαo by PTX requires the Gαoβγ heterotrimer rather than the free Gαo subunit (33Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, ADP-ribosylation of αo can be used as a sensitive indicator of formation of αoβγ heterotrimers. Incubation of CaM with bovine brain Gβγ subunits in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+ inhibited the ribosylation reaction, as shown in Fig. 6. The reduction of labeling is concentration-dependent. At equal molar concentrations of CaM and βγ subunits, the PTX-catalyzed ribosylation of Gαo was almost completely blocked by Ca2+-CaM. Since Ca2+ alone had no effect on the reaction, the simplest interpretation of this observation is that Ca2+-CaM formed a complex with Gβγ subunits and this complex lost its ability to interact with Gαo subunit; therefore, CaM inhibited the βγ-dependent ADP-ribosylation of Gαo. To further investigate the nature of CaM binding on Gβγ subunits, we examined its effects on βγ-stimulated PLC-β2 activity. As shown in Fig.7 A, CaM has little effect on PLC-β2 activity stimulated by βγ subunits in an in vitroreconstituted system. To confirm the observations obtained in the reconstitution experiments, cDNAs encoding PLC-β2, Gβγ, and CaM were transfected into COS-7 cells. Coexpression of PLC-β2 and βγ subunits increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release 3–5 fold (Fig. 7 B, column 3). However, cotransfection of CaM expression plasmids had little effect on the βγ-stimulated PLC-β2 activity (Fig. 7 B, column 4). These results indicated that in the Gβ subunit, the domain responsible for PLC-β2 activation is distinct from the domain binding to CaM, suggesting that different domains of the β subunit are involved in interactions with different effector proteins. The putative CaM-binding domain of Gβ subunits was further characterized by using the synthetic peptide derived from Gβ to inhibit Ca2+-CaM-dependent activation of CaM kinase II. Concentration-dependent effects of the peptide on CaM kinase II activity were examined. As shown in Fig.8 A, the peptide was a potent inhibitor of CaM kinase II activity. At a 1:1 binding ratio of Gβ peptide to CaM, the peptide totally inhibited the Ca2+-CaM-dependent activation of CaM kinase II, suggesting that the binding affinity of Gβ peptide is comparable to the affinity of CaM kinase II toward Ca2+-CaM and should be in the nm range. Other peptides from the N-terminal regions had no effect on the Ca2+-CaM-stimulated enzymatic activity (data not shown). To examine whether Gβγ subunits can also inhibit the Ca2+-CaM-dependent CaM kinase II activity, Ca2+-CaM was incubated with brain Gβγ subunits for 30 min at room temperature. Then the Ca2+-CaM-stimulated CaM kinase II activity was assayed. Fig. 8 B shows that brain Gβγ subunits inhibited 70–80% of Ca2+-CaM-stimulated CaM kinase II activity, indicating that βγ can competitively bind to Ca2+-CaM. Previous studies have demonstrated that G protein subunits can act as potent inhibitors of the Ca2+-CaM-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity (23Asano T. Ogasawara N. Kitajima S. Sano M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 135-138Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Katada T. Kusakabe K. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11897-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably through interactions of Gβγ with CaM. In this report, we show direct binding of Gβγ subunits with CaM. This CaM-binding property of Gβ is Ca2+-dependent and conserved in known Gβ subunits, including the most diverse β5 subunit. We also identified and characterized the CaM-binding domain in βγ subunits using three different methods. In the gel mobility shifting assays and tryptophan fluorescence assay, a conserved 25-amino acid peptide in the N-terminal region of Gβ subunits was found to interact with CaM. By modifying specific amino acids in this region, we identified some key residues (Arg-48, Arg-49, Leu-51, Ile-43, Leu-55) that play an important role in the binding of βγ to CaM. The interaction between Gβγ subunits and CaM is Ca2+-dependent. Ca2+ is an important intracellular messenger in many cellular functions including cell growth and development (34Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar, 35Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). Many seven-transmembrane receptors activate the G protein subunits, which in turn activate PLC-β, resulting in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacyglycerol from PtdInsP2. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate acts as an intracellular second messenger by binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in the endoplasmic reticular membrane, triggering the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+ is also believed to organize and stabilize CaM domain structure in a conformational state that can bind target proteins (32O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar,36Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quicho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The calmodulin concentration in some cells, e.g.neuronal cells, is in the order of micromolar. Calcium release can thus convert 10–50% of these molecules to the Ca2+-bound form. The affinity of Gβγ for Ca2+-CaM is sufficiently high so that under these conditions much of the free βγ in the cells should be in the CaM-bound form. Therefore, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration could selectively regulate the interactions of Gβγ with a number of other proteins through binding with CaM. The interaction of Gβγ with Ca2+-CaM could play an important role in the cross-talk mechanism between different G protein pathways (37Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ca2+-CaM has been shown to regulate the formation and hydrolysis of cAMP. In the Gαs-coupled pathway, both adenylyl cyclases and phosphodiesterases are Ca2+-CaM-dependent, which could serve as the convergence point for Ca2+-dependent and Gαs-dependent stimuli. The primary structure of the identified CaM-binding domain of Gβγ shows features similar to some other CaM-binding proteins and inhibitors (21Liu M. Chen T.-Y. Ahamed B. Li J. Yau K.-Y.

For instance, the identified β CaM-binding domain contains a high percentage of hydrophobic residues and an excess of positively charged residues, a property found in all CaM-binding peptides. It is believed that the basic residues contribute to CaM binding via electrostatic interactions with acidic residues in CaM, whereas the hydrophobic amino acids seem to play a more important role in CaM binding through interactions with the hydrophobic patches of the globular domains of CaM (38Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhou G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 39Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quicho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). From x-ray structural analysis, 80% of all contacts are van der Waals interactions, and the interaction appears to involve two key hydrophobic amino acids separated by eight residues, although flexibility does exist in the interaction because of the flexible central helix of CaM (36Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quicho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). CaM contains two globular domains, and these two domains are connected by a long alpha helical segment (32O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 36Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quicho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). When different CaM binding targets are recognized, this long central segment allows different relative positioning of the two lobes of CaM. Therefore, although the secondary structure of the Gβ CaM-binding domain is not a typical amphipathic α helix (46Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), CaM could still position itself to bind to the Gβ protein, possibly by stabilizing a change in the conformation of the N-terminal domain of Gβ protein. On the other hand, a number of CaM-binding proteins have been identified and shown to contain sites that are not typical amphipathic helices but consist of basic amino acids interspersed with nonpolar amino acids (52Warr C.G. Kelly L.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 53Wes P.D. Yu M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 54Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The binding of CaM to Gβγ interfered with the formation of Gαβγ trimers as assayed by the inhibition of PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo. Based on the secondary structure of the β subunit, the N-terminal region of the β subunit is in close proximity to the N-terminal portion of Gα subunit (47Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 48Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Cell. 1996; 84: 175-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It has been reported that effector activation by the βγ subunits is blocked upon the addition of the Gα subunit presumably by heterotrimerization (1Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 13Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, by interacting with the N-terminal domain of β subunit, the Ca2+-CaM complex could affect the heterotrimer formation of Gαβγ. Interaction of CaM with βγ has little effect on the G protein βγ subunit-activated PLC-β2 activity. These results support the notion that interaction of different βγ-responsive effectors is mediated by distinct domains of Gβγ (50Zhang S. Coso O.A. Collins R. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20208-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 51Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17597-17600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By using a series of chimeras between Dictyostelium and mammalian β subunits, a small C-terminal segment of Gβ was identified as responsible for the activation of PLC-β2 (50Zhang S. Coso O.A. Collins R. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20208-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The CaM-binding domain of Gβ identified in this report is located in the N-terminal region. This region of Gβ was suggested to play a role in the interaction of adenylyl cyclase type 2, the muscarinic receptor-gated atrial inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK1), and in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (50Zhang S. Coso O.A. Collins R. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20208-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 51Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol.

It will be of great interest to determine whether binding of CaM to Gβγ can affect the activation of the potassium channels (GIRK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.

COX-1 protein remained elevated for at least 10 days and localized to the cytoplasm and neurites of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Moreover, basic fibroblast growth factor, but not epidermal growth factor, caused similar increases in COX-1, which is consistent with expression characteristics of other delayed response genes in PC12 cells.

Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NGF also induces several delayed response gene products including VGF (6Levi A. Eldridge J.D. Paterson B.M.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1587-1596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Like NGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induces PC12 cell differentiation (10Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) is mitogenic in PC12 cells (11Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These differential effects have been used to characterize the signal transduction pathway leading to the differentiated phenotype. NGF and bFGF both cause a prolonged activation of Ras resulting in a prolonged increase of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. In contrast, EGF causes transient activation of Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (12Qui M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism of delayed response gene induction is through the prolonged activation of Ras leading to the phosphorylation of the cAMP regulatory element-binding protein for up to several hours (13Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) that, along with immediate early gene products, leads to subsequent delayed response gene expression. Cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, exists as two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. In non-neuronal cells COX-2 behaves similarly to other immediate early genes in that it is rapidly and transiently induced by various growth factors and cytokines without requiring new protein synthesis (15O'Banion M.K. Winn V. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 16Herschman H.R. Gilbert R.S. Xie W. Luner S. Reddy S.T. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar). It is also rapidly induced in central nervous system neurons through synaptic activation (17Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). COX-1, on the other hand, is constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types (16Herschman H.R. Gilbert R.S. Xie W. Luner S. Reddy S.T. Adv.

Regulation of COX by neurotrophic factors has not been previously demonstrated in neuronal cells; however, NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells leads to elevated prostaglandin levels (21DeGeorge J.J. Walenga R. Carboetto S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 21: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We report for the first time that NGF induces COX-1 in PC12 cells, that this induction is inhibited by cycloheximide, and that bFGF (but not EGF) also induces COX-1, suggesting that COX-1 behaves as a delayed response gene in these cells. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, human recombinant bFGF, human recombinant EGF, fetal bovine serum, horse serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and TRIzol reagent were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. A monoclonal antibody to COX-2 was purchased from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY) and was found to have cross-reactivity to both ovine (Caymen Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and rat COX-1 antigen (a gift from Phyllis Whiteley, Roche Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA). Initial experiments were performed using NGF provided by Dr. Eugene Johnson who also kindly supplied the neutralizing antibody to NGF. Later experiments were performed using 2.5s NGF purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. No differences in response were noted between the two sources of NGF. Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). [α-32P]dCTP and PGE2 RIA kits were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Arachidonic acid was purchased from New Check Prep (Elysian, MN). All other products were from Sigma. PC12 cells were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin-streptomycin. For most studies, cells were plated at a density of 103 cells/cm2 and were grown to 70–80% confluency prior to the start of each experiment. PC12 cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells/well into 24-well dishes containing 12-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF or vehicle for 3 days, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and washed with PBS. Coverslips were incubated in PBS-T for 10 min followed by a 20-min incubation in −20 °C methanol. Samples were rehydrated in PBS-T for 10 min, blocked for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum, and then incubated in primary antibody (1:1000) for 2 days at 4°C. Following extensive washing with PBS-T, samples were incubated in Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 2 h. Coverslips were thoroughly washed, partially dried, and placed on glass slides coated with 50 μl of Prolong purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cells were viewed by epifluorescent microscopy, and images were captured by a Cohu (San Diego, CA) 4910 CCD video camera attached to a Zeiss Axioplan microscope and visualized using NIH Image/Adobe Photoshop software. COX was detected in parental PC12 cells; however, signal intensity varied within the population. We subcloned PC12 cells by standard methods to develop cell lines that uniformly expressed COX. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well dishes at a density of approximately 1 cell/well. Following 2–3 passages, subclones were plated separately onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and visualized following NGF treatment as described above. The majority of subclones tested expressed COX uniformly as detected by immunofluorescence, and two subclones (PCX and PCX25) with bright COX signal were chosen for further study. To measure COX protein levels, parental PC12, PCX, or PCX25 cells were plated in 6-well dishes. After treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and collected in 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were sonicated, and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Micro-BCA kit) purchased from Pierce. Ten-microgram protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 2% BSA, and 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody (1:1000) overnight in the same buffer. Following extensive washing and incubation for 2 h with peroxidase-linked secondary antibody at 1:5000 (Amersham Corp.), signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.) and exposure to Kodak X-AR film. Laser densitometry and quantification were accomplished with a system from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). Cyclooxygenase activity was measured by incubating cells for 15 min with 30 μm arachidonic acid as described previously (22O'Banion M.K. Dusel J.C. Chang J.W. Kaplan M.D. Coleman P.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PGE2 levels were determined by RIA and normalized to total cellular protein determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. In all accumulation and activity experiments, samples were collected from five or six parallel cultures. Total RNA was isolated from 60-mm plates using guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis followed by centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) or with TRIzol reagent. RNAs were quantified by absorbance measurements at 260 nm and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (24O'Banion M.K. Sadowski H.B. Winn V. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23261-23267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using random prime 32P-labeled probes. These consisted ofEcoRI fragments of murine COX-1 and COX-2 cDNA and a purchased fragment of human G3PDH from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). RNA molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were electrophoresed in parallel and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Hybridization signals were detected and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For COX sequence determination, total RNA from NGF-treated PCX cells was reverse transcribed using the Superscript II kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Complementary DNA samples were subjected to 40 cycles of polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: for COX-1, 5′-TTCTGCCCTCTGTACCCAAA-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-AAGGATGAGGCGAGTGGTCT-3′ (lower primer); for COX-2, 5′-GGTGTGAAAGGAAATAAGGAAC-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-GGAGGATGGAGTTGTTGTAGAG-3′ (lower primer). Reaction products were gel-purified and sequenced by the fluorescent dideoxy sequencing method using a 373 DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) at the University of Rochester Nucleic Acid Core facility. NGF induced COX protein in a dose-dependent fashion in PC12 cells (Fig. 1 A). This induction was 9.3 ± 1.4-fold over basal levels (mean ± S.E.;n = 4) at 50 ng/ml of NGF, a dose typically used to differentiate PC12 cells (25Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Rukenstein A. Green S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and was significantly blocked (p < 0.02) when added NGF (50 ng/ml) was preincubated for 30 min with 10-fold excess neutralizing antibody to NGF (Fig.1 B). These experiments were carried out after 4 days of NGF treatment; however, COX protein levels remained elevated for at least 10 days (data not shown). Initial immunocytochemical analysis revealed expression of COX in parental PC12 cells; however, signal intensity of COX immunofluorescence varied within the population. To obtain a more homogenous cell population for COX expression, we subcloned PC12 cells and selected two subclones, PCX and PCX25, to carry out the remainder of our experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 2, COX was readily detected in the cytoplasm and neurites of PCX cells after NGF-induced differentiation. A similar pattern was seen in the parental cell line and in PCX25 cells (data not shown).Figure 4Increases in COX-1 message following NGF treatment depend on new protein synthesis. In A, total RNA (10 μg) isolated from PCX cells treated for various intervals with 50 ng/ml NGF was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to Northern blot hybridization with random prime labeled COX-1 and G3PDH probes. In B, images of replicate experiments were captured by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Values were normalized to G3PDH and then graphically represented as the relative induction over control values (mean ± S.E.; n = 3). In C, PCX cells were pretreated for 30 min with 25 μm cycloheximide. Cultures were then treated ± 100 ng/ml NGF for 8 h prior to collection for Northern blot analysis as described for A.C, control; N, NGF-treated; CHX, cycloheximide-treated RNA samples. Data are representative of three replicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Localization of COX protein in PCX cells. PCX cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips ± 50 ng/ml NGF for 3 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to immunofluorescence for COX as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Scale bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine which isoform of COX was expressed in PCX cells, total RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. No COX-2 product was detected after 40 cycles of polymerase chain reaction, which is consistent with previously published data (26Kujubu D.A. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Herschman H.R. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a fragment of the expected size for COX-1 was generated with COX-1-specific primers. This fragment was gel-purified and sequenced to verify that COX-1 was present in these cells (data not shown). We evaluated whether COX-1 was functional in PCX cells by assessing prostaglandin production in NGF-differentiated cells. Four days following the addition of NGF, neuronal PCX cells showed a 11.5-fold increase (n = 5) in endogenous PGE2accumulation over 4 h relative to naive cells (Fig.3 A). To confirm that this increase in PGE2 was due to increased COX-1 activity, we tested whether exogenous substrate for COX (arachidonic acid) would lead to increases in PGE2 production. Fig. 3 B illustrates that COX-1 activity peaks at 2 days with a 9.7-fold induction over basal levels seen prior to NGF treatment (n = 5). Fig.3 C shows COX activity in differentiated PCX cells treated with NGF for 4 days to be 9.9-fold over levels in untreated cells at day 4 (n = 5), and this increase was inhibited by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin, with an IC50 of 35 nm, similar to that previously reported for COX-1 (27Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that COX-1 mRNA was elevated 6 h following NGF treatment (Fig. 4 A) with peak levels reached at 12 h (4.7 ± 0.8-fold over basal levels,n = 3; Fig. 4 B). COX-1 message remained elevated at 24 and 48 h. No message for COX-2 was detected (data not shown). Only a minimal increase in COX-1 message over basal levels was seen at 3 h suggesting that COX-1 requires new protein synthesis to be expressed. Indeed, pretreatment with cycloheximide (25 μm, applied 30 min prior to NGF) prevented COX-1 expression at 8 h (Fig. 4 C), indicating that COX-1 has characteristics of a delayed response gene following NGF treatment. To further characterize the induction of COX-1 in PC12 cells, we tested whether bFGF or EGF had any influence on COX-1 expression. bFGF causes neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, whereas EGF acts solely as a mitogen (10Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows that bFGF caused a similar increase in COX-1 message levels by 6 h as compared with NGF (Fig. 4 A); however, EGF had little to no effect on mRNA levels for COX-1. This pattern of induction was replicated at the protein level (Fig. 5 B). The time course for the induction of COX-1 by bFGF was similar to that seen following exposure to NGF, and similar results were seen with PCX25 cells (data not shown). In many cell systems COX-1 is constitutively expressed (16Herschman H.R. Gilbert R.S. Xie W. Luner S. Reddy S.T. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Banion M.K. Dusel J.C. Chang J.W. Kaplan M.D. Coleman P.D. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8504-8509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but there are some instances where COX-1 is regulated. For example, COX-1 message is induced in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3 cells treated with bFGF (18Kawaguchi H. Pilbeam C.C. Gronowicz G. Abreu C. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Raisz L.G. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line (20Smith C.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Marnett L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast to the transient induction of immediate early genes like c-fos (29Greenberg M.E. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and certain tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-induced sequences (26Kujubu D.A. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Herschman H.R. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar) in PC12 cells, the induction of COX-1 message was delayed and persisted following NGF and bFGF treatment in PCX cells (Figs. 4 A and 5 A). This pattern of expression is similar to other delayed response gene products in PC12 cells such as transin and VGF. Like COX-1, transin mRNA levels increase in response to NGF and bFGF, but not EGF, and this increase in message is blocked by cycloheximide (9Machida C.M. Rodland K.D. Matrisian L. Magun B.E. Ciment G. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1587-1596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). VGF shows similar inductive properties (7Salton S.R. Fischberg D.J. Dong K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). COX-1 induction by NGF and bFGF, but not EGF, is consistent with the idea that COX-1 induction is through the prolonged activation of Ras. Persistent Ras activation by either NGF or bFGF leads to neurite extension, whereas the transient activation of this signaling pathway by EGF does not (12Qui M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The induction of COX-1 by NGF in PC12 cells suggests that it may play a physiologic role in the differentiated phenotype. PC12 cells have been used to investigate the tyrosine hydroxylase pathway involved in the production of the bioactive amines: dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (4Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that pharmacologic manipulation of PC12 cells with PGE2 leads to an induction of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (30Li X.-M. Juorio A.V. Boulton A.A. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), an enzyme directly involved in the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. COX-1 may be intimately involved in determination of the differentiated phenotype of PC12 cells since prostaglandin levels have been reported to be elevated as early as 15 min following NGF treatment; however, this increase does not affect the morphological phenotype since indomethacin does not hinder NGF-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells (21DeGeorge J.J. Walenga R. Carboetto S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 21: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or in our PCX subclone (data not shown). Studies are under way to further understand the mechanism of COX-1 induction in these cells and to address whether other characteristics of the differentiated phenotype depend on COX-1 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2024587005,"This report confirms that human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated by A23187 produce platelet-activating factor (PAF) (22.4 ± 9.9 ng/106 cells/h; mean ± S.E.). A proportion of the PAF produced (56%) was released by cells into the medium. The PAF released, however, was not detected without prior organic extraction, and the method of organic extraction was critical for detection. Extraction with 80% ethanol was not successful, but a modified methanol/chloroform extraction method was. These observations may explain some of the conflicting reports in the literature on release of PAF by activated endothelial cells. The requirements for organic extraction may reflect the nature of cell-released PAF's binding by albumin; it was observed that PAF added to identical media could be detected in a bioassay without the requirement for extraction. Such PAF was also readily degraded by PAF-acetylhydrolase added to media, while PAF released from cells was resistant to such degradation, suggesting that it was released in a “protected” configuration. Stimulation of cells was performed in media with albumin as the only extracellular macromolecule. Limited proteolytic digestion of the albumin with trypsin and pepsin showed that PAF released by cells was located exclusively between amino acids 240 and 386 (domain II), while no synthetic PAF added to media was located on this region. These results are identical to those described for the release of PAF by the early embryo. Albumin exposed to embryos had a higher thiol concentration (0.77 ± 0.04 μmol of thiol/μmol of albumin; mean ± S.E.) than control media to which an equivalent amount of synthetic PAF was added (0.59 ± 0.02 μmol of thiol/μmol of albumin) (measured with Ellman's reagent). Furthermore, albumin from conditioned media was more susceptible to reduction by 10 mm dithiothreitol than control albumin, as assessed by its mobility on PAGE. The protected configuration of released PAF was caused by cell-dependent conformational changes to albumin involving cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds. Partial reduction with dithiothreitol of albumin exposed to cells resulted in released PAF being able to be detected directly in a bioassay without the requirement for prior organic extraction.

It may also have a role as a mediator in pathological states such as asthma, ischemia, gastric ulceration, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and shock.Many studies show that endothelial cells do not produce PAF under basal conditions in vitro, but synthesis can be stimulated by a variety of agonists (see Ref. 3Bratton D.

J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1847-1857PubMed Google Scholar) for extracting phospholipids prior to assay. A recent study (21Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that this method of extracting media was required to detect PAF released from preimplantation embryos, due apparently to PAF's exclusive binding to domain II of albumin. Binding of PAF at that site on albumin resulted in PAF being protected from the actions of PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF:AH) and also resulted in PAF being undetectable in bioassays without prior extraction. It was suggested that binding of PAF to domain II of albumin resulted in it being presented in a protected form (21Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PAF added to medium also bound to albumin but was not found on domain II and was not in a protected form. We were interested to determine whether binding of PAF to albumin in this protected configuration occurs for PAF released by cells other than embryos and also to investigate the nature of the interaction which results in the protected configuration.In this study we show that activation of endothelial cells results in the production of PAF and its release into medium. It is bound to albumin in a protected form, being exclusively located on domain II of albumin. It is also shown that binding of embryo-derived and endothelial cell-derived PAF to albumin was associated with conformational changes to albumin which involved modification of the cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds, while the the conformation conferred by disulfide bonds was necessary for PAF to remain in its “protected” configuration.DISCUSSIONThe results confirm that human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated by A23187 produce PAF. While a significant proportion of the PAF remained associated with the cells, much of it was released into medium. This PAF was not bioactive in media in a platelet aggregation assay, nor was it recovered following ethanolic extraction. This behavior of endothelial cell-derived PAF contrasts with that of synthetic PAF added to media under the same conditions.Synthetic PAF was readily detected by platelet aggregation without the requirement for extraction, and was also readily extracted by ethanol (80%). We have shown previously (21Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that this behavior of synthetic PAF is independent of the method of its preparation. Cell-released PAF was also apparently different from PAF retained by cells, which can be readily extracted by 80% ethanol treatment (11Stewart A.G. Dubbin P.N. Harris T. Dusting G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3215-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The reason why the modified Bligh-Dyer method was able to extract PAF from ECCM but 80% ethanol could not is not clear. The relative volume of methanol used was much greater, being 1:19 (media:methanol) compared with only 1:4 (media:ethanol). We have found that the very slow dropwise addition of media to the larger volume of methanol followed by incubation at room temperature is required for successful extraction. The subsequent secondary extraction of methanol with chloroform may also be important in the successful recovery of PAF. Systematic study of the variables is needed to define the minimum requirements for successful extraction of PAF from media released from cells.The failure of previous reports to detect the release of PAF from endothelial cells may have been due to the measurement of PAF without extraction, or following simple ethanolic extraction procedures, or using various other mixtures of chloroform and methanol (5Prescott S.M.

Immunol. 1983; 131: 2397-2403PubMed Google Scholar). It can be concluded that extraction of cell-conditioned media with the methods used in this report are required before release of PAF by cells can be excluded. It also shows that recovery of synthetic PAF added to media does not act as a suitable positive control for the recovery of cell-released PAF.One study (37Whatley R.E. Clay K.L. Chilton F.H. Triggiani M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre J.M. Prescott S.M. Prostaglandins. 1992; 432: 21-29Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that stimulated endothelial cells produce both PAF and its sn-1-acyl analogue (acyl-PAF), with acyl-PAF being the predominant product. That study measured the concentration of PAF and acyl-PAF remaining associated with the cells but did not determine whether either was released into medium. It was suggested that acyl-PAF can mimic the biological actions of PAF, but was substantially less potent. Thus measurement of the bioactive material released by endothelial cells does not exclude the possibility that it was induced by acyl-PAF. The antibody used in the RIA in the current study is more selective for PAF (38Smal M.A. Baldo B.A. Harle D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 168-172Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) than that used in earlier studies (39Sugatani J. Lee D.Y. Hughes K.T. Saito K. Life Sci. 1990; 46: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The good agreement on the amount of PAF released by cells detected by the bioassay and the RIA is unlikely if the bioactivity was due to acyl-PAF. The amount of released PAF detected by the RIA was similar after treatment of extracted material with phospholipase A1 (results not shown). Since acyl-PAF, but not PAF, is sensitive to digestion with phospholipase A1 (37Whatley R.E. Clay K.L. Chilton F.H. Triggiani M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre J.M. Prescott S.M. Prostaglandins. 1992; 432: 21-29Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we conclude that most of the bioactivity detected from endothelial cells was PAF. This does not exclude the possibility that acyl-PAF may also be released and bind in a similar fashion to PAF. This question could be addressed by mass spectrometric analysis of the released phospholipids.It has previously been demonstrated that extracellular albumin is an acceptor for PAF released by cells (40Ludwig J.C. Hoppens C. McManus L.M. Mott G.E. Pinckard R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), presumably by removing PAF from the lipophilic environment of the membrane. We observed (21Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the release of PAF by preimplantation embryos was exclusively at domain II of albumin, and the current study shows that this is also the binding site for PAF released by endothelial cells.BSA (583 amino acids) has 80% sequence homology with human serum albumin (41Brown J.R. Fed. Proc. 1974; 33: 1389Google Scholar), and most structural studies have been performed on human serum albumin. It is a “heart-shaped” globular molecule, similar to an equilateral triangle. It is proposed that there are three cylindrical peptide segments (domains I, II, and III) connected by solvent exposed α-helical chains, which are common sites of proteolytic cleavage. Domain II contains a hydrophobic core, which can provide a binding region for hydrophobic molecules (42Brodersen R. Andersen S. Vorium H. Nielsen S.U. Pedersen A.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 339-349Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Brown J.R. Shockley P. Jost P.C. Griffith O.H. Lipid-Protein Interactions. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 25-68Google Scholar). Clayet al. (44Clay K.L. Johnson C. Henson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) provided kinetic evidence that albumin possessed four binding sites for PAF which had an average dissociation constant of 0.1 μm. The rabbit PAF receptor has an estimatedk d for PAF of ∼0.5 nm (45Dent G. Ukena D. Barnes P.J. Barnes P.J. Page C.P. Henson P.M. Platelet Activating Factor and Human Disease. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1990: 23-57Google Scholar). Synthetic PAF added to control culture medium caused platelet aggregation in whole blood down to a concentration of 0.5 ng/ml (∼0.9 nm). However, at a concentration of 3.0 ng/ml (∼5.6 nm), endothelial cell-derived PAF in untreated culture medium did not cause platelet activation. This concentration was well below the stated k d for PAF binding by albumin, yet above the k d of the platelet receptor. It might therefore be expected that the kinetics would favor PAF transfer from albumin to the PAF-receptor, as was the case for synthetic PAF. The absence of this suggests that PAF released by cells either binds to sites on albumin that have a much higher affinity than those described by Clay et al. (44Clay K.L. Johnson C. Henson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), or that the conformation of albumin causes PAF bound at domain II to be solvent- or sterically protected in a way that does not occur for PAF binding to albumin in the absence of cells.The secondary and tertiary structure of albumin is highly dependent on the presence of 17 interchain disulfide bonds, which link 34 (of the available 35) cysteine residues. The free cysteine residue is generally at amino acid 34 in domain I of albumin. This should be detected as 1 μmol of thiol/μmol of BSA, yet approximately 0.5 μmol of thiol/μmol of albumin is normally detected (32Janatova J. Fuller J.K. Hunter M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3612-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ghiggeri G.M. Candiano G. Delfino G. Querirolo C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 130: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This may be the result of dimerization of albumin (47King T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: PC5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in solution or be due to the reactive Cys-34 being “solvent-protected” by the helices in some albumin molecules (48Carter D.C. He X.-M. Munson S.H. Twigg P.D. Gernert K.M. Broom M.B. Miller T.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 1195-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). BSA exposed to embryos expressed more reactive thiol residues than untreated medium with PAF added, showing that binding of PAF per se did not induce this increase in thiol concentration. The increase in thiol concentration was therefore apparently due to a cell-dependent process. The observation that albumin was more readily reduced by dithiothreitol after incubation with embryos suggests that the cell-dependent process involved conformational changes to albumin involving cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds. It has been shown (49Reed R.G. Burrington C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9867-9872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that interaction of albumin with cells or surfaces caused a conformational change resulting in a mixed population of albumin molecules. While the mechanisms of the change are not well understood, it appears to cause a flattening of the molecule giving it a greater surface area when bound to cells and a higher binding affinity. It has been proposed (49Reed R.G. Burrington C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9867-9872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that this conformational change promotes dissociation of passenger fatty acids, facilitating transfer from albumin to the cell. It will be of interest to determine whether a similar mechanism operates in reverse for the removal of PAF from cells.Exposure of embryo-conditioned media and endothelial cell-conditioned media to dithiothreitol, under conditions expected to cause reduction of albumin, resulted in a large proportion of the expected PAF activity present to be detected in a direct assay of platelet aggregation (without prior organic extraction). Control experiments confirmed that the aggregation was not caused by the dithiothreitol itself, nor did dithiothreitol reduce the sensitivity of the assay to PAF. This result suggests that binding of PAF to domain II of albumin, which results in its protected configuration, involves protein conformation that is dependent upon the disulfide bonds that can be reduced by dithiothreitol.The observation that PAF activity was lost with prolonged exposure to dithiothreitol may have several possible explanations. One is that as albumin was reduced (and thus changed conformation) it lost its affinity for PAF, resulting in PAF being adsorbed by the surfaces of the holding tube, as is known to occur in protein-free media (50Benveniste J. Henson P.M. Cochrane C.G. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 136: 1356-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Using different types of vessels may reduce this loss of activity. Confirmation that the cause of the time-dependent loss of activity was its loss to hydrophobic surfaces, was the ability to recover PAF from XAD-2 chromatography beads after incubation with dithiothreitol treated ECCM. The results indicate that as the conformation of albumin is altered with reduction, PAF becomes “exposed” and hence available to bind to the platelet receptor, causing platelet aggregation in the bioassay. As reduction proceeds, PAF seems to be readily lost from albumin and bound by other hydrophobic surfaces, such as the test tube or XAD-2 beads.These experiments provide indirect evidence that the protected nature of PAF's binding to albumin involves disulfide bonds between cysteine molecules. The observation that breaking these disulfide bonds is necessary for making PAF accessible in vitro infers that some form of disulfide isomerization or reduction may be required for PAF's “release” from the cell and binding on domain II of albumin. The changed thiol status of albumin following exposure to cells implicates cellular enzymes in this process.Studies with embryo-conditioned medium show that, while embryo-derived PAF in untreated media is inactive in vitro (21Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), upon injection into animals it can induce thrombocytopenia (51O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1985; 75: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such studies show that cellular-dependent factors must be involved in the creation and processing of cell-released PAF in its protected form and its exposure in vivo to allow it to be bioactive. Further experiments are required to determine the nature of this mechanism. One possibility may be the presence of cell surface protein disulfide isomerases (52Rubartelli A. Bajetto A. Allavena G. Wollman E. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24161-24164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Dean M.F. Martin H. Sansom P.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which might cause reduction of some disulfides resulting in solvent exposure of domain II, facilitating the loading of PAF at this site. It might be speculated that a similar process, in reverse, may be required to allow PAF to be made available at target cells.While there is some controversy regarding the ability of some cell types to release PAF, for some other cell types such as activated basophils, there is general agreement that PAF is released upon cellular activation. This might suggest that PAF released from some cell types, or under some conditions, is not in the protected configuration described in this report. Systematic investigations are required to assess this possibility.This study used defined culture media with albumin as the only extracellular macromolecule. The next important question to investigate will be to determine whether PAF binds to albumin in this protected form when a complex protein source such as serum is present. Several studies have detected PAF in blood (54Caramelo C. Fernandez-Gallardo S. Marin C.D. Inarrea P. Santos J.C. Lopez-Novoa J.M. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 55Caramelo C. Fernandez-Gallardo S. Santos J.C. Inarrea P. SanchezCrespo M. Lopez-Novoa J.M. Hernando L. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 17: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In view of the high PAF:AH levels present in blood, this is a surprising result, inferring that this PAF may be protected from PAF:AH.In conclusion, PAF released from embryos and endothelial cells binds to albumin at domain II (amino acids 240–386), protecting it from the hydrolytic effects of PAF:AH in vitro. PAF added to solution does not bind to this site on albumin in vitro. This binding makes extracting and measuring cell-released PAF difficult, but may also act to increase the half-life of PAF released from these cell types. Should such cryptic binding also occur in vivo, it may well influence PAF's half-life and hence its potential to act as a circulating mediator. The impact of such binding by albumin on the kinetics of its recognition by the PAF-receptor in vivorequires investigation.

It may also have a role as a mediator in pathological states such as asthma, ischemia, gastric ulceration, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and shock. Many studies show that endothelial cells do not produce PAF under basal conditions in vitro, but synthesis can be stimulated by a variety of agonists (see Ref. 3Bratton D. Henson P.M. Barnes P.J.

In transfected GH12C1 cells, both SSTR1 and SSTR2 coupled to inhibition of Ca2+ influx and hyperpolarization of membrane potential via a pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive mechanism. These effects reflected modulation of ion channel activities which are important for regulation of hormone secretion. Somatostatin analogs MK678 and CH275 acted as subtype selective agonists as expected. In transfected F4C1 cells, both SSTR1 and SSTR2 mediated somatostatin-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via a PTx-sensitive pathway. In addition, activation of SSTR2 in F4C1 cells, but not SSTR1, stimulated phospholipase C (PLC) activity and an increase in [Ca2+]i due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Unlike adenylyl cyclase inhibition, the PLC-mediated response was only partially sensitive to PTx. To determine the structural determinants in SSTR2 necessary for activation of PLC, we constructed chimeric receptors in which domains of SSTR2 were introduced into SSTR1. Chimeric receptors containing only the third intracellular loop, or all three intracellular loops from SSTR2, mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, but failed to stimulate PLC activity as did wild-type SSTR2. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of SSTR2 was not required for coupling to PLC. Thus, by expressing individual somatostatin receptor subtypes in pituitary cells, we have identified both overlapping and distinct signaling pathways for SSTR1 and SSTR2, and have shown that sequences other than simply the intracellular domains are required for SSTR2 to couple to the PLC signaling pathway.

It was first isolated and identified as an inhibitor of growth hormone (GH) secretion from the anterior pituitary gland (2Brazeau P. Vale W. Burgus R. Ling N. Butcher M. Rivier J. Guillemin R. Science. 1973; 179: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). It also inhibits secretion of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, and secretin (1Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 39Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, SS acts as a neuromodulator, regulating neuronal firing and facilitating release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (3Epelbaum J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1986; 27: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). SS acts by binding to specific membrane receptors (4Schonbrunn A. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Five SS receptor (SSTR) subtypes have been cloned and they belong to a family of receptors which couple via G proteins to cellular effector systems (5Yamada Y. Post S.R. Wang K. Tager H.S. Bell G.I.

In the pituitary gland, mRNAs for all five SSTRs are present (10Bruno J.F. Xu Y. Song J. Berelowitz M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the past, rat pituitary GH3 and GH4C1 cells have been used extensively to characterize endogenously expressed somatostatin receptors (11Koch B.D. Dorflinger L.J. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13138-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Koch B.D. Blalock J.B. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 216-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somatostatin was shown to activate K+ channels and inhibit voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) leading to inhibition of Ca2+ influx (12Koch B.D. Blalock J.B. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 216-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion of GH is regulated mainly by changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ level; thus, the action of SS on ion channel activity is critically relevant to the physiological role of SS as an inhibitor of secretion. Since both SSTR1 and SSTR2 are present in GH3 and GH4C1 cells (13Garcia P.D. Myers R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 402-409PubMed Google Scholar), the functional importance of each subtype is not known. Expression of a single SSTR subtype in heterologous cells such as COS and CHO cells does not allow studies of coupling of receptors to those specific ion channels that are characteristic of pituitary cells. In the first part of this report, we describe the expression of either SSTR1 or SSTR2 individually in pituitary GH12C1cells, which do not contain endogenous SSTRs, to study their independent roles in regulation of membrane ion channel activity. Expression of SSTR1 and SSTR2 in heterologous systems such as COS and CHO cells has given inconsistent results as to whether both subtypes couple to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (14Rens-Domiano S. Law S.F. Yamada Y. Seino S. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 28-34PubMed Google Scholar, 15Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is possible that coupling of SSTRs to a particular G protein is affected by the specific cellular environment in which the receptors are expressed. Therefore, it is essential to study SSTR signaling pathways in a cell type in which SSTRs are expressed physiologically. We describe in this report that SSTR1 and SSTR2 have both overlapping and distinct patterns of signaling in pituitary cells. In addition, we examined the structural basis for the difference in signaling using a chimeric receptor approach. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA).

The cDNA for the mouse SSTR2A isoform was used throughout this study (referred to as SSTR2). SSTR1 and SSTR2 cDNAs cloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were transfected into GH12C1 and F4C1 cells by the Lipofectin method according to the supplier's protocol, or by electroporation with a Bio-Rad electroporator. Briefly, 106cells were suspended in 0.4 ml of F10+ medium containing 16 μg of plasmid DNA, and electroporation was performed at 260 V and 960 microfarads capacitance. In cotransfection experiments, 8 μg of human parathyroid hormone receptor cDNA and 8 μg of SSTR cDNA were used. For stable transfection, cells were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 beginning 48 h after transfection. After several weeks of culture in selection medium, single clones were isolated and screened using a radioligand binding assay for SSTRs (see below). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers from the vector and coding region, and solution RNase protection assay using RNAs from different clones were used to confirm the expression of only the specific transfected SSTR isoform. 2J. Bruno and L. Chen, unpublished results. Cells were plated and grown in F10+ medium in 24-well dishes for at least 24 h. Cells were incubated with minimal essential medium containing various concentrations (30 pm to 1 nm) of [125I-Tyr11]SS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% bacitracin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 2 h at 37 °C. The dishes were then washed rapidly 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 0.1n NaOH and the lysates counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm SS. For [Ca2+]imeasurement, cells were harvested using a HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS, 118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm) KCl, 10 mmd-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.02% EDTA and then resuspended in HBSS containing 1 mm CaCl2. Cells were loaded using 1 μm fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed 3 times in HBSS containing 1 mm CaCl2. Fluorescence was measured using a Spex Fluorolog FIIIA spectrofluorometer at excitation wavelength of 342 nm and emission wavelength of 492 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm. [Ca2+]i was calibrated from the fluorescence signal as described previously (19Koshiyama H. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Changes inV m were monitored using an anionic fluorescent dye bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (bisoxonol) (12Koch B.D. Blalock J.B. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 216-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested as described above. About 5 × 106 cells were used for each run in the presence of 40 nm bisoxonol. Fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelength of 540 nm and emission wavelength of 580 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The whole cell voltage clamp technique (20Gonoi T. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was used to measure activity of VDCC in GH12C1 cells. The micropipet solution contained: 110 mm CsCl, 20 mmtetraethylammonium-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 4 mm BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with Tris. The extracellular solution contained: 130 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 10 mm BaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 100 nmtetrodotoxin (to block voltage-dependent Na+channels). Ba2+ was used as the cation charge carrier because Ba2+ minimizes Ca2+ current rundown and increases the amplitude of the Ca2+ channel current. Only cells with total capacitance of 15–45 picofarads were used for recording. The chamber was perfused continuously during the experiment at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. All experiments were performed at room temperature. F4C1 cells were plated in 24-well dishes after transient transfection. After 48 h, cells were incubated with test reagents in the presence of 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min at 37 °C. Intracellular cAMP was extracted with 50 mm HCl and quantitated by radioimmunoassay (21Bringhurst F.R. Jüppner H. Guo J. Urena P. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, F4C1 cells were split into 24-well dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated in F10+ medium containing [3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) for 20 h. Cells were then washed with 0.5 ml of assay medium (20 mm HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium without sodium bicarbonate) with 5 mm LiCl for 10 min and then incubated with 0.5 ml of assay medium containing 5 mmLiCl and somatostatin for 1 h. Cold (4 °C) formic acid (0.75 ml, 20 mm) was added to each well to lyse the cells. IP fractions were separated by AG1–8X Dowex column chromatography (22Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol polyphosphates were eluted with 2 m ammonium formate, 20 mm formic acid and counted in a scintillation counter. Chimeric receptors were constructed from parental mSSTR1 and mSSTR2 by the polymerase chain reaction and Kunkel's method (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The junctions for IC3 in CH1 and CH2 (see “Results”) were Leu233 and Val276. In CH2, the residues in IC1 and IC2 of SSTR1 were mutated one by one to the corresponding residues of SSTR2. In CH3, the junction is Val309. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52240) Google Scholar) to verify the constructs. In control untransfected GH12C1 cells or GH12C1cells transfected with the pCDNA3 vector alone, no specific high affinity receptors for SS were detected by radioligand binding assays, and SS had no effect on [Ca2+]i (Fig.1, top panel) or membrane potential (see below). Several stable clones of GH12C1expressing rat SSTR1 were obtained and a single clone expressing 4,600 receptors/cell was used for further study. To obtain stable clones expressing SSTR2, more than 200 clones were screened, and no clone with >1,000 receptors/cell was obtained. However, several clones expressed the transfected SSTR2 mRNA, and one of them was used in subsequent functional experiments. In those GH12C1 clones expressing either SSTR1 or SSTR2, SS caused a decrease in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, middle panels). Pretreatment of the cells with PTx completely abolished the decreases in [Ca2+]i mediated by either SSTR1 or SSTR2 (Fig. 1, bottom panels). The decreases in [Ca2+]i mediated by SSTR1 and SSTR2 (Fig. 2, top panel) were abolished by either chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA (Fig. 2,middle panels) or by incubating the cells with thel-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (Fig. 2,bottom panels). Thus, the decreases in [Ca2+]i induced by SS acting via SSTR1 and SSTR2 were mediated by inhibition of Ca2+ influx through VDCC. To verify this conclusion, the action of SS on Ca2+ channel activity was studied directly using the whole cell voltage clamp technique. Consistent with the effects of SS on [Ca2+]i, the inward Ca2+ currents were inhibited acutely by SS in cells expressing either SSTR1 (Fig.3 B) or SSTR2 (Fig. 3 C). The inhibition was reversed by washing out SS. No inhibition by SS was observed in GH12C1 cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Effects of SS on Ca2+ currents in GH12C1 cells. Whole cell Ca2+currents were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions by depolarizing pulses from −80 mV to −10 mV. Representative traces are shown.A, lack of effect of SS in control GH12C1 cells transfected with vector alone;B, effect of SS in GH12C1 cells expressing SSTR1; C, effect of SS in GH12C1 cells expressing SSTR2.Control indicates current before addition of SS;SS indicates currents during superfusion of the cells with 1 μm SS; and Washout indicates currents after removal of SS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the ligand specificity of the action of SS on [Ca2+]i using receptor subtype selective SS analogs. MK678, which binds preferably to SSTR2 (18Fitzpatrick V.D. Vandlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on [Ca2+]i in cells expressing only SSTR1, but it induced a decrease in [Ca2+]i in cells expressing SSTR2 (Fig. 4). A new SS analog CH275, reported to bind with high affinity only to SSTR1 (25Liapakis G. Hoeger C. Rivier J. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1089-1094PubMed Google Scholar), induced a decrease in [Ca2+]i in cells expressing SSTR1 but not in cells expressing SSTR2 (Fig. 4). These results are the first demonstration that CH275 acts as an agonist to activate SSTR1 selectively. Bisoxonol fluorescence has been used to measure changes in membrane potential in GH4C1 cells, and hyperpolarization of V m induced by SS in GH4C1cells was caused by activation of K+ channels (12Koch B.D. Blalock J.B. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 216-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this technique, SS caused a decrease in bisoxonol fluorescence in GH12C1 cells expressing either SSTR1 or SSTR2 (Fig. 5, middle panels), indicating that activation of each receptor subtype caused hyperpolarization of membrane potential. These responses were inhibited completely by preincubation with PTx (Fig. 5, bottom panels). Thus, both SSTR1 and SSTR2 mediate modulation of ion channel activity in GH12C1 cells, via a PTx-sensitive G protein, probably Go or Gi. We next examined the coupling of SSTR1 and SSTR2 to adenylyl cyclase activity in rat pituitary F4C1 cells, which also lack high affinity binding sites for SS. Stable clones of F4C1cells expressing 17,200 rat SSTR1/cell or 5,400 SSTR2/cell (determined by saturation binding assays) were used for the study of signaling properties. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by SS was determined by measuring the decrease in forskolin (Fsk)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. SS had no effect on basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in wild-type F4C1 cells not transfected with SSTRs (Fig. 6, left panel). However, SS acting via either SSTR1 or SSTR2 inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, and this process was reversed completely by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (Fig. 6, middle and right panels). These results demonstrate that both SSTR1 and SSTR2 can mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity via a PTx-sensitive G protein (possibly Gi/Go) in F4C1 cells. In GH12C1clones expressing either SSTR1 or SSTR2, SS did not inhibit vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated cAMP accumulation, while in the same cells carbachol, acting via endogenous acetylcholine receptors, did inhibit the vasoactive intestinal peptide effect (data not shown). Because several Gi-coupled receptors can activate more than one intracellular signaling pathway (26Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Peralta E.G. Peterson G.L. Schimerlik M.I. Capon D.J. Ramachandran J. Science. 1987; 238: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 27Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 239-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we examined the coupling of SSTR1 and SSTR2 to the inositol lipid pathway. In F4C1 cells stably expressing SSTR2, SS stimulated total inositol polyphosphate production about 5-fold over the basal level (Fig. 7). Stimulation was reduced about 35% by preincubation with PTx. In F4C1 cells expressing an even higher level of SSTR1, no stimulation of IP production was induced by SS (Fig. 7). The functional consequences of IP production were determined by measuring changes in [Ca2+]i. In control F4C1 cells or F4C1cells expressing only SSTR1, SS had no effect on [Ca2+]i, whereas in cells expressing SSTR2, SS induced an acute increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.8, top). The increase in [Ca2+]i in cells expressing SSTR2 was not abolished by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA (Fig. 8, middle panel). Preincubation of cells with 1 μm thapsigargin for 10 min, to deplete intracellular Ca2+ pools (28Law G.J. Pachter J.A. Thastrup O. Hanley M.R. Dannies P.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), abolished the increase of [Ca2+]i induced by SS (Fig. 8, bottom panel), supporting the conclusion that the increase in [Ca2+]i was due to release of Ca2+from IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. These results demonstrate that SSTR1 and SSTR2 differ in their ability to couple to the inositol lipid/[Ca2+]ipathway. To identify the structural determinants for SSTR2-mediated inositol lipid signaling, we constructed a series of SSTR1 and SSTR2 chimeras in which specific domains of SSTR2 were introduced into the SSTR1 backbone. From sequence comparison, SSTR1 and SSTR2 differ in the intracellular domains, especially the third intracellular loop (IC3) and C-terminal tail. Because the intracellular loops, especially IC3, have been identified as sites of interaction with G proteins for several heptahelical receptors (29Strader C.D. Dixon R.A.F. Cheung A.H.

Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), we replaced IC3 of SSTR1 with IC3 of SSTR2 in chimeric construct CH1 (Fig. 9). In CH2, the first, second, and third intracellular loops of SSTR1 were replaced with those of SSTR2. In another construct (CH3), the 7th transmembrane domain and the C-terminal tail of SSTR2 were replaced by the corresponding sequence from SSTR1 (Fig. 9). Each chimeric receptor was tested for its ability to express on the cell surface, to stimulate PLC activity, and to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in transient transfection assays. When transiently transfected into F4C1 cells, CH1, CH2, and CH3 expressed at levels comparable to wild-type SSTR1 and SSTR2 as determined by ligand binding experiments (Fig. 10). However, CH1 and CH2 did not couple to the inositol lipid pathway in response to SS as determined by the lack of rise in IP production. In F4C1 cells expressing CH3, SS induced formation of IPs as it did in cells expressing the intact SSTR2 (Fig.11). Therefore, the three intracellular loops of SSTR2 are not sufficient for coupling to the inositol lipid pathway, and the C-terminal domain of SSTR2 is not required for this pathway. To exclude the possibility that CH1 and CH2 are functionally impaired to couple to any G protein, we studied their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. To evaluate the action of SS on ligand-stimulated cAMP production, the human PTH receptor, a receptor known to couple to Gs (21Bringhurst F.R. Jüppner H. Guo J. Urena P. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transiently co-expressed with SSTR constructs in F4C1 cells. F4C1cells lack functional PTH receptors, and PTH does not stimulate cAMP accumulation in untransfected F4C1 cells (data not shown). SS had no effect on PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in F4C1 cells transfected with only the human parathyroid hormone receptor. All three chimeric receptors as well as wild-type SSTR1 and SSTR2 mediated inhibition of PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation by SS (Fig. 12). Thus, the lack of coupling to PLC in CH1 and CH2 was not due to global nonfunctionality of these constructs. The finding that replacement of all three intracellular loops of SSTR1 with those of SSTR2 was not sufficient to confer SSTR2-specific signaling suggests that additional domains of SSTR2, possibly the transmembrane helices, are involved in determining the specificity of coupling of SSTR2 to the inositol lipid signaling pathway.Figure 10Expression level of SSTR1/SSTR2 chimeras in F4C1 cells determined by ligand binding assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were incubated with minimal essential medium containing 30 pm[125I-Tyr11]SS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% bacitracin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 2 h at 37 °C.

Different SSTR isoforms have overlapping but distinct expression patterns (16Kaupmann K. Bruns C. Hoyer D. Seuwen K. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that some of the diverse actions of SS are mediated by different receptor subtypes. Alternatively, it is possible that a single receptor subtype can couple to more than one effector system and that such coupling may vary among cell types. It has been reported that SSTR1 and SSTR2 do not couple to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in CHO cells (14Rens-Domiano S. Law S.F. Yamada Y. Seino S. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 28-34PubMed Google Scholar); however, it has also been shown that SSTR1 and SSTR2 can couple, via Gi, to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in other cell types (15Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these differences is that the G protein and effector components differ between the cell types. In the present study, SS did not inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide in GH12C1 clones expressing either SSTR1 or SSTR2, while SS modulated ion channel activity in these cells. Both SSTR1 and SSTR2 mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in F4C1 cells. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of effect of SS on adenylyl cyclase in GH12C1 cells was due to a lower level of receptor expression, it is likely that SSTR coupling patterns to adenylyl cyclase depend on the specific cellular environment. Fujii et al. (31Fujii Y. Gonoi T. Yamada Y. Chihara K. Inagaki N. Seino S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported, that in rat insulinoma RINm5F cells, SSTR2, but not SSTR1, coupled to inhibition of VDCC, suggesting that there are subtype specific differences in regulation of ion channel activity. On the other hand, we have demonstrated that in GH12C1 cells, both SSTR1 and SSTR2 mediate inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These results again demonstrate that SSTR isoforms couple to specific signal transduction pathways depending on the specific type of cells in which they are expressed. Different signaling through the same receptor can be transduced by different G proteins (27Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 239-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Specifically, the α1, β1, and γ3 subunits of Go have been shown to mediate inhibition of Ca2+ channels by SSTRs in GH3 cells (32Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In a GH4C1 cell strain in which Go was knocked out by overexpressing antisense mRNA (33Liu Y.F. Jakobs K.H. Rasenick M.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13880-13886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of SS on Ca2+ influx was no longer observed; however, the effect of SS on membrane potential was not altered in these knockout cells. 3L. Chen, unpublished data. Thus, membrane hyperpolarization which is due to activation of K+ channels is not dependent on Go and may be mediated by Gi subunits. It is likely that in GH12C1 cells, SSTR1 and SSTR2 couple to their cognate G proteins with similar specificity. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing SSTR2, we have reported that SS activates PLC and increases [Ca2+]i (38Chen, L., and Tashjian, A. H., Jr. (1994) Prog. of the 76th Annual Meeting of The Endocrine Society, Abstr. 1555, 589.Google Scholar). Tomura et al. (34Tomura H. Okajima F. Akbar M. Abdul Majid M. Sho K. Kondo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported, that in COS cells expressing SSTR2, SS stimulated PLC/[Ca2+]i, while in cells expressing SSTR1, SS had little or no effect. In the present report, we have shown that in pituitary F4C1 cells expressing about 5,400 SSTR2 receptors/cell, that SS clearly activates the PLC/[Ca2+]i pathway. Because this response was only partially blocked by PTx, it was mediated, at least in part, by a PTx-insensitive G protein, possibly Gq/11. SS induced increases in [Ca2+]i have also been observed in normal cells, including astrocytes (35Marin P. Delumeau J.C. Tence M. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Premont J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9016-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and intestinal smooth muscle cells (36Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, coupling to multiple pathways by SSTR2 cannot be attributed to an artifact of the transfected cell systems. The intracellular domains of a receptor serve as contact sites for interacting with G proteins and, in many cases, determine the specificity of coupling (30Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was somewhat unexpected that the introduction of the putative intracellular domains of SSTR2 into SSTR1 did not confer SSTR2-like PLC activation in response to SS under conditions in which the chimeric receptors were expressed as well as wild-type receptors. Thus, the specificity of G protein coupling by SSTR2 is not determined solely by its intracellular domains. Additional structural determinants, probably from the transmembrane domains, are needed to enable coupling to the inositol lipid signaling pathway. These findings are consistent with the concept that the transmembrane domains of a G protein-coupled receptor act in concert with the intracellular loops to affect the conformation of the contact regions for the G protein (37Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the transmembrane sequences required, we tested a series of SSTR1/SSTR2 chimeras in which both transmembrane and intracellular domains were swapped. Unfortunately, these chimeras all expressed poorly on the cell surface, making it impossible to study their signaling properties. Further studies, using chimeras with more subtle exchanges and adequate receptor expression will be necessary to identify the critical transmembrane and intracellular sequences needed to confer SSTR2-specific signaling.

This recognition event induces a variety of molecular signal transduction pathways that activate the cell to proliferate (2Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The expanding population of T cells acquires killing potential through the de novo induction of a specific subset of genes that encode the proteins that constitute the killing machinery (3Berke G. Cell. 1995; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). One form of T cell-mediated killing involves the production of specialized granules that accumulate in the cytoplasm following activation. These granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin (4Liu C.-C. Walsh C.M. Ding-E Young J. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 194-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and a number of cytotoxic proteinases (granzymes) (5Atkinson E.A. Bleackley R.C. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 15: 359-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon contact of an activated T cell with a target cell displaying foreign antigen, the granules and their contents are directionally exocytosed into the intercellular junction in a calcium-dependent process. Target cells are believed to take up granule components in a process that is facilitated by perforin. The exact cytotoxic nature of granzymes remains unclear, but granzyme B has been implicated as a mediator of DNA fragmentation once inside the target cell, through the activation of CPP32-like proteinases (6Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Following T cell activation, granzyme B gene expression is induced at the level of transcription, and its mRNA level peaks after 3 or 4 days. This pattern of expression correlates well with the onset of potent killing potential under a variety of conditions and is a useful marker of CTL activation in vivo (7Prendergast J.A. Helgason C.D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that transcriptional regulation may be controlled by 5′-flanking promoter sequences (8Frégeau C.J. Bleackley R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5583-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A series of promoter deletion fragments ranging from 108 bp to 5 kilobases were examined for their ability to confer transcriptional activity on a reporter gene following transfection into T cells. It was found that two promoter fragments consistently generated the highest reporter gene activity: −828 and −243. The 243-bp granzyme B promoter contains five regions in which we have found evidence of transcription factor binding both in vitro and in vivo. Several distinct regions of protection were evident in DNase I footprinting experiments with nuclear extracts derived from T cells. These coincide with consensus sequence binding sites for two known ubiquitous transcription factors, activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding proteins (ATF/CREB) and activator protein-1 (AP1), and two lymphoid-specific factors, core-binding factor (CBF/PEBP2) and Ikaros.In vivo evidence that these sites are important in promoter function was demonstrated by in vivo footprinting and DNase I hypersensitivity analyses (9Babichuk C.K. Duggan B.L. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16485-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in T cell lines and in activated primary CD8+ T cells. Moreover, several of these transcription factor binding sites are evolutionarily conserved between the murine and human granzyme B promoters (10Haddad P. Wargnier A. Bourge J.-F. Sasportes M. Paul P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Hanson R.D. Grisolano J.L. Ley T.J. Blood. 1993; 9: 2749-2757Crossref Google Scholar, 12Wargnier A. Legros-Maida S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several distinct signal transduction pathways are activated via the T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules. These signals are integrated in the nucleus in the form of a particular subset of activated transcription factors that converge on a specifically targeted promoter and activate transcription. By studying the specialized requirements for T cell-specific gene expression in terms of transcription factor necessity we can further understand the molecular events that are associated with T cell activation. To determine whether any of the above mentioned binding sites are required for granzyme B transcription, point mutations were systematically introduced into each, either individually or in various combinations, and were assessed for their effect on the 243-bp promoter. We analyzed our promoter mutations by transient transfection assays in two distinct populations of T cells, freshly activated primary lymphocytes and an IL-2-dependent T cell clone (MTL). Primary lymphocytes were activated by a variety of nonchemical stimulation conditions and then transfected. MTL cells constitutively express the granzymes, and transfections were performed without any additional stimulation other than IL-2. Whether this immortalized state of activation reflects the state of primary activation is unknown; however, our transfection studies in these distinct cell types revealed some differences. These experiments enabled us to observe the effects of removing each transcription factor from the native promoter complex and assess its importance in the regulation of the granzyme B gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Granzyme B promoter fragments were obtained by restriction enzyme digestion or polymerase chain reaction amplification. They were inserted upstream of the promoterless luciferase reporter gene of the basic pGL2 vector (Promega), and orientation was confirmed by sequencing or directional primer amplification. SVβ-gal contains the bacterial β-galactosidase gene under the control of the SV2 viral promoter (Promega). Plasmids were grown in DH5α Escherichia coli, and high quality supercoiled DNA was purified for transfection by CsCl2density gradient centrifugation. DNA concentration and covalently closed circular content were determined by ethidium bromide fluorometric analysis in a Sequoia-Turner model 450 fluorometer. Primary splenocytes were obtained from 6–12-week old BALB/c mice. Spleen tissue was ground through a fine wire screen in RHFM/IL-2 medium, and the cells were pelleted. Red blood cells were lysed with buffered ammonium chloride lysis buffer. The IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T cell line MTL 2.8.2 was generated from CBA/J mice as described (13Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V. Havele C. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 758-767PubMed Google Scholar). MTL 2.8.2 cells and primary splenocytes were cultured in RHFM (RPMI supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum) in the presence of 60 units/ml human recombinant IL-2. Primary splenocytes were stimulated with 5 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA; Sigma) and 1:750 to 1:1,000 dilution (determined empirically) of hamster anti-mouse αCD3 monoclonal antibody supernatant. Transient transfections were performed using a DEAE-dextran transfection procedure optimized for cytotoxic T cells (8Frégeau C.J. Bleackley R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5583-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primary splenocytes were cultured at 3.0 × 106cells/ml in RHFM plus 60 units/ml IL-2, 1:750 dilution αCD3, and 5 μg/ml ConA for 20 h prior to transfection. Basically, 1.0 × 107 exponentially growing cells (MTL) or 2.0 × 107 (whole splenocytes) were washed twice in serum-free medium and resuspended in 1.0 ml of TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.7 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0)) with 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma), 15 μg of covalently closed circular luciferase reporter plasmid, and 5 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid. The DNA was adsorbed for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in serum-free medium and cultured at 2.5 × 105cells/ml (MTL) or 2.0 × 106 cells/ml (splenocytes) in RHFM + 60 units/ml IL-2 and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Primary splenocytes were stimulated with additional αCD3 and ConA following transfection. The cells were harvested after 48 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. Three aliquots of cell lysates (10–20 μl) were measured for 20 s following the injection of Luciferase Reagent (Luciferase Assay, Promega) by a LUMAT LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems Inc.). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Final activities are given as luciferase/β-galactosidase values. It was previously established by in vitro footprinting that within the 243-bp granzyme B promoter, there existed five distinct regions that were protected from DNase I digestion (9Babichuk C.K. Duggan B.L. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16485-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These regions correspond to transcription factor binding sites for ATF/CREB, AP1, CBF, and Ikaros, and specific DNA-protein interactions were observed asin vivo footprints in activated CD8+ T cells and MTLs. This region corresponds to a strong DNase I-hypersensitive site that was only detectable in activated T cells. To determine whether any of these binding sites were important for the high levels of reporter gene expression observed from the 243-bp promoter, we constructed a series of promoters with three nucleotide substitutions in each binding site. This strategy conserved the spacing and the helical orientation of the binding sites. The bp changes were primarily transversions in the consensus sequence binding sites and were chosen on the basis of previous methylation interference data, in vivo footprinting data, and site-directed mutagenesis data collected either on the granzyme B promoter or on similar binding sites in other gene promoters (Fig. 1). In addition to the single binding site mutations, various double mutant promoters were constructed, as well as a quadruple mutant promoter in which the AP1, Ikaros, and both CBF sites were abolished, leaving only the CRE intact. Each mutant binding site, with the exception of the CRE and 5′ CBF, was tested by electrophoretic mobility shift competition assays for the inability to compete for the wild type binding site with up to a 200 molar excess of mutant probe (data not shown). Following the mutagenesis reactions each construct was confirmed by sequencing and subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter gene plasmid. Plasmid DNA was purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation to obtain high quality supercoiled DNA. The concentration and percentage of covalently closed circular DNA was assessed by fluorometric analysis prior to every transfection, and the covalently closed circular DNA content was not less than 90% for any test plasmid used.Figure 1Nucleotide sequence of the proximal granzyme B promoter and the nucleotide substitutions present in the transcription factor binding sites.

Typically, the T cell portion of a whole splenocyte population expanded in culture to approximately 75% following stimulation with αCD3 or ConA for 3 days, as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. 2C. K. Babichuk, M. J. Pinkoski, and R. C. Bleackley, unpublished observations. The CD8+ population proliferated and expanded to approximately 50% of the total culture, whereas the CD4+ population remained constant at approximately 25%. Most of the non-T lymphocyte population did not survive in this type of culture, and we do not believe that they contributed significantly to reporter gene expression observed from the granzyme B promoter. The promoter/luciferase plasmid series was transfected, along with a β-galactosidase control plasmid, into whole primary lymphocyte cultures that were stimulated for 1 day prior to transfection and for 2 days following. The cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The luciferase reporter gene activity was significantly high in primary cells with the average relative light unit (RLU) value for the full-length −828 to +68 promoter being over 2,000 and background (promoterless plasmid) being approximately 200 RLU. Also, β-galactosidase activities were very reproducible within each transfection experiment. The averaged corrected values for two independent primary cell transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 2. These cells were stimulated with αCD3, ConA, and IL-2. The values on they axis represent the RLU of the luciferase assay divided by the absorbance of the β-galactosidase assays × 1,000. Because the β-galactosidase expression and incubation times of the assay differ between each transfection, the corrected values are only relative within a single experiment and are not compared between experiments or cell types. The promoterless pGL2 basic vector served as the negative control and gave luciferase values that were essentially background. The next three bars depict the promoter deletion series −108 to +29, −169 to +29, and −243 to +68. As transcription factor binding sites were added by increasing the length of the promoter to 243 bp, the luciferase activity increased substantially. The next eight bars represent the mutant promoter series in the context of the 243-bp promoter (−243 to +68). The largest effect for any single point mutation was observed for the CRE binding site, which lowered total promoter activity to 60% of wild type. A surprising finding was that the mutation of the AP1 binding site appeared to have relatively little impact on overall promoter activity (73% of wild type). Mutations in the 3′ CBF or Ikaros binding sites had slight negative effects on transcription, whereas the mutation of the 5′ CBF site had no effect on promoter activity. Overall, none of the single binding site mutations reduced activity to an extent where it was possible to conclude that any one factor was necessary for the expression of the 243-bp granzyme B promoter. We then looked at the mutant binding sites in combination. Promoters lacking either or both the 5′ and 3′ CBF binding sites consistently showed normal expression in transient assays. The 5′ CBF/Ikaros double mutant contained the same binding site compliment as the −169 promoter and was approximately as active. When the AP1, Ikaros, and both CBF elements were all ablated the result was a very dramatic decrease in overall activity, comparable to the expression observed from the −108 promoter. Therefore, no other elements distal to the CRE were involved in promoter transcription. Our primary cell cultures were initially stimulated with a combination of three potent activators of T cells (αCD3, ConA, and IL-2) in an effort to maximize granzyme B-luciferase reporter gene expression. This treatment, however, may mask contributions to overall promoter output by the individual transcription factors. The αCD3 antibody utilized in these experiments binds to the ε chain of the CD3/TCR complex (15Leo O. Foo M. Sachs D.H. Samelson L.E. Bluestone J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). This antibody, in combination with IL-2, is a sufficient stimulus to generate potent cytolytic activity in primary lymphocyte cultures. ConA is a widely employed mitogen that interacts nonspecifically with surface glycoproteins and is capable of activating T cells through the T cell receptor and likely through other glycosylated surface receptors. At high doses, IL-2 activates primary T lymphocytes to express perforin and granzyme B mRNAs, and these cells possess cytotoxic potential (16Liu C.-C. Rafii S. Granelli-Piperno A. Trapani J.A. Ding-E Young J. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2105-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Smyth M.J. Ortaldo J.R. Shinkai Y.-I. Yagita H. Nakata M. Okumura K. Young H.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Instead of using all three stimuli simultaneously, αCD3, ConA, and IL-2 were added in culture individually, or in combination, and the mutant promoter fragments were transfected as above and assessed for reporter gene expression. ConA alone or with added IL-2 appeared to be the best stimulus for this type of culture as the cells proliferated well and expressed high levels of luciferase activity from the granzyme B promoters. Fig.3 depicts the average expression profiles of the wild type and mutant granzyme B promoters in ConA- and ConA + IL-2-stimulated whole primary lymphocytes. In cells treated with ConA alone (panel A), mutations in the CRE and AP1 binding sites lowered overall promoter expression to approximately 60% of wild type. The Ikaros mutation and either CBF binding site mutations were somewhat inhibitory to promoter activity. Only the 4X mutant promoter, with mutations in the AP1, Ikaros, and both CBF sites, significantly decreased promoter activity to near background levels, similar to the 108-bp promoter fragment (data not shown). No major effect of any individual binding site mutations was evident in these transfection experiments with ConA stimulation alone. Continuous exposure to 60 units/ml exogenous IL-2 in addition to ConA did appear to enhance the effects of certain mutations slightly. Under these conditions, mutations in the CRE and AP1 binding sites lowered overall promoter activity to 54 and 40% of wild type, respectively, the greatest extent observed in any of the primary cell transfections (Fig. 3 B). The Ikaros and 5′ CBF were dispensable to promoter function in these transfections, but the 3′ CBF site may have been somewhat important as the expression of this mutant was only slightly higher than that of the CRE mutant. Transfection experiments with cells stimulated with αCD3 alone resulted in a very good transfection efficiency, as determined by the high levels of β-galactosidase expression from the control plasmid, but very little granzyme B promoter activity was observed from any of the mutant or wild type promoters (data not shown). The combination of αCD3 and IL-2 did stimulate the cells enough to detect significant luciferase levels when approximately twice the normal number of cells were transfected. The expression pattern was very similar to that obtained with ConA stimulation. The CRE and AP1 sites were most important, but neither mutation lowered promoter activity to a significant extent, and the Ikaros and both CBF binding sites were dispensable (data not shown). Finally, primary lymphocytes were treated with 5,000 units/ml human recombinant IL-2 and transfected with the longer 828-bp promoter after 20 h of initial stimulation. After further IL-2 treatment, no luciferase activity and only trace amounts of β-galactosidase activity were detectable after 1, 2, or 3 days post-transfection, and the cells failed to proliferate at any significant rate. It is likely that these cells were resistant to transfection and were unable to express the reporter gene. MTL 2.8.2 is an immortalized, IL-2 dependent, cytotoxic T cell clone that constitutively expresses the endogenous granzymes. These cells were transfected with the wild type and mutant promoter constructs and assayed for expression (Fig. 4). The absolute luciferase values were higher in MTL than in primary cells with the RLU reading for the full-length 828-bp promoter being greater than 10,000. The pGL2 promoterless vector served as the negative control and was essentially background. The activities of the minimal promoter deletion series are depicted in the next three bars. Luciferase activity increased proportionately as the length of the promoter was extended to 243 bp. Of the five individual promoter mutants (next five bars), the CRE binding site appeared to be the most important controlling factor (36% of wild type activity). The AP1 site was relatively important as well in that the promoter was transcribed at 64% of wild type levels in the absence of AP1 binding. Mutation of the 3′ CBF site had no effect on the promoter, and the 5′ CBF site had, if anything, a stimulatory effect in both the single mutant and the double CBF mutant. Neither the 5′ CBF or Ikaros mutation alone was inhibitory, but together they reduced expression to below that of the −169 promoter, to near background levels. This result was not observed in primary lymphocytes. As expected, the 4X mutant promoter was expressed at near background levels and was almost as low as its functional equivalent, the 108-bp promoter. In MTL cells, the CRE was the most important individual controlling element, and both the deletion analysis and the site-specific mutagenesis data indicate an important role for Ikaros and CBF in granzyme B expression. It was observed that when the AP1, Ikaros, and both CBF binding sites were abolished, expression dropped to near background levels. However, neither of the CBF sites appeared to be important for the observed high activity of the 243-bp fragment. To determine whether the AP1 and Ikaros binding sites were responsible for this dramatic loss of activity, a double mutant promoter was constructed in which both the AP1 and Ikaros sites were abolished. Additionally, when the AP1 and 3′ CBF sites were added to the −108 promoter (the −169 fragment), activity increased substantially, indicating that these two factors may be very important for promoter activity. A second double mutant promoter was constructed in which both the AP1 and 3′ CBF sites were abolished. The reporter gene activity of these new mutant constructs was compared with the wild type promoter, each single mutant, and the 4X mutant promoter. The averaged values for four independent transfection experiments in activated primary cells and two independent transfections in MTL cells are shown in Fig. 5. In primary cells, the AP1 mutation appeared to reduce promoter activity to 61% of wild type, and Ikaros had no inhibitory effect (panel A). The AP1 mutant was much less active in MTL cells (37% of wild type), and some inhibition was observed for the Ikaros mutant (panel B). When both the AP1 and Ikaros binding sites are abolished, promoter expression was reduced to an extent in primary cells (47% of wild type) and was approximately the same as the AP1 mutant in MTL (40%). When the AP1 and 3′ CBF binding sites are abolished, the promoter is still active in MTL cells (73%), despite the absence of a functional AP1 binding site. However, expression is reduced to background levels (20%) in primary cells, indicating that together these sites are very important in conferring high transcriptional activity. From this series of transfections we conclude that the presence of functional binding sites for AP1 and the 3′ CBF is primarily responsible for the high levels of expression observed from the granzyme B minimal promoter in primary lymphocytes. MTL cells, however, were primarily sensitive to mutations in the AP1 binding site alone but not in combination with the 3′ CBF. The granzyme B gene is transcriptionally induced upon antigenic stimulation of cytotoxic T cells. We have previously identified several transcription factors that are involved in the induction or maintenance of an active granzyme B promoter and have shown that they bind to their cognate sequences in the endogenous promoter. In our present studies, primary murine lymphocytes stimulated via the T cell and IL-2 receptors were utilized as the principal experimental system. Results from transfection studies in this physiologically relevant system were compared with data obtained from transfections of the same reporters in a T cell clone. Primary lymphocytes express granzyme B mRNA in a stimulation-dependent manner. They require at least two independent signals for proliferation and CTL-specific gene expression. First, they are stimulated through the T cell receptor, by presented antigen, and second by IL-2 through the IL-2 receptor. MTL cells are different in that they are an antigen-independent, IL-2 dependent, cytotoxic T cell line (13Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V. Havele C. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 758-767PubMed Google Scholar). MTL 2.8.2 cells were selected for antigen independence by culturing in the presence of high levels of IL-2 and the phorbol ester PMA (18Havele C. Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V.H. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1448-1454PubMed Google Scholar), and they constitutively express all of the granzyme genes. It was apparent from our previous transfection studies that reporter gene expression increased substantially as the length of the minimal prom"

The ability of the mutant allele to function in methyl-directed mismatch repair and UvrABC-mediated nucleotide excision repair was examined by genetic complementation assays. The R284A substitution abolished function in both DNA repair pathways. To identify the biochemical defects responsible for the loss of biological function, UvrD-R284A was purified to apparent homogeneity, and its biochemical properties were compared with wild-type UvrD. UvrD-R284A failed to unwind a 92-base pair duplex region and was severely compromised in unwinding a 20-base pair duplex region. TheK m of UvrD-R284A for ATP was significantly greater than 3 mm compared with 80 μm for UvrD. A large decrease in ATP binding was confirmed using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. These data suggested that the R284A mutation severely reduced the affinity of helicase II for ATP. The reduced unwinding activity and loss of biological function of UvrD-R284A was probably the result of decreased affinity for ATP.

These models are based on the formation of active oligomers, which provide multiple DNA binding sites for the helicase. Most, if not all, helicases appear capable of forming either a dimer or hexamer, and evidence suggests that the oligomer is an active species (7Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Extensive computer-assisted sequence analysis of numerous helicases has uncovered a series of short, conserved amino acid motifs (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 15Hodgman T.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This has allowed grouping of helicases into four families based on the extent of amino acid similarity and on the organization of these conserved regions. These families presumably represent evolutionary relationships. Superfamilies I and II are the largest and most closely related groups, whereas superfamily III and family IV have unique motif compositions that differ considerably from those in superfamilies I and II and from each other (16Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Analysis of helicases with mutations in highly conserved residues in several of the so-called “helicase motifs” has suggested a biochemical role of some of these regions in helicase function. For example, motifs I and II, first described as the Walker A and B sequences in a large family of NTP binding proteins (17Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar), have been directly implicated in NTP binding and/or hydrolysis (18George J.W. Robert M. Brosh J. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Washburn B.K. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 22Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6933-6940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the remaining helicase motifs is less clear. Roles for motif VI in nucleic acid binding and ATP hydrolysis have been proposed for various superfamily II RNA helicases (23Fernandez A. Lain S. Garcia J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pause A. Methot N. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Motif V has been implicated in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding (26Graves-Woodward K.L. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13629-13635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and motif III in coordination of ATP and ssDNA binding (27Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25360-25368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for superfamily I helicases. The recent crystal structure of PcrA, a superfamily I DNA helicase fromBacillus stearothermophilus, suggested that all seven of the conserved helicase motifs are clustered together in the vicinity of the ATP binding site (28Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Thus, all of the motifs may be involved in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, at least for those enzymes with structures similar to PcrA. Escherichia coli DNA helicase II, the product of theuvrD gene, is a well characterized DNA helicase. This enzyme is a required component of the UvrABC-mediated nucleotide excision repair pathway (29Husain I. Van-Houten B. Thomas D.C. Abdel-Monem M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6774-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Caron P.R. Kushner S.R. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Less defined roles in recombination and DNA replication have also been suggested (18George J.W. Robert M. Brosh J. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Horii Z.I. Clark A.J. J.

The purified enzyme unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity (41Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is capable of initiating unwinding from a nick, its presumed biological substrate in the repair pathways (42Runyon G.T. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17502-17512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Runyon G.T. Bear D.G. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

UvrD belongs to helicase superfamily I along with otherE. coli helicases such as Rep, RecB, RecD, TraI, and helicase IV (helD gene product) (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), as well as a large number of eukaryotic viral helicases and several yeast helicases. UvrD has previously been the subject of biochemical and genetic studies involving mutation of highly conserved residues in motifs I, II, and III (18George J.W. Robert M. Brosh J. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 572-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Currently, very little biochemical information exists on the specific role of motif IV in superfamily I and II helicases although its importance for biological function has been demonstrated in genetic studies (45Zhu L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 469-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Martinez R. Shao L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6735-6746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ma L. Westbroek A.

In this report, the functional significance of motif IV in E. coli DNA helicase II was addressed by site-directed mutagenesis of arginine residue 284, which is invariant among superfamily I helicases. The results indicated that the mutant protein had a significant decrease in affinity for ATP, implicating motif IV in nucleotide binding. This represents the first helicase mutation outside of motifs I and II that exhibits a severe defect in nucleotide binding. E. coli BL21(DE3) (F− ompT [lon] hsdS BrB− mB− gal dcmλDE3) was from Novagen, Inc.E. coli JH137 (K91lacZ dinD1::MudI (Apr lac)) was obtained from Dr. P. Model (Rockefeller University). BL21(DE3)ΔuvrD and JH137ΔuvrD were constructed previously in this laboratory (18George J.W. Robert M. Brosh J. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). pET81F1+ was from Dr. P. J. Laipis (University of Florida), and pET9d, pET11d, and pLysS were from Novagen, Inc. M13mp7 ssDNA was prepared as described previously (48Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled nucleotides were from U. S. Biochemicals Corp. Radioactively labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Corp. pET9d-UvrD and pET11d-UvrD were constructed previously in this laboratory (18George J.W. Robert M. Brosh J. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase I (large fragment), phage T4 DNA ligase, phage T7 DNA polymerase, and phage T7 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs Inc. and used as recommended by the supplier. To overexpress helicase II prior to purification, a 10-liter culture of mid-log phase BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells containing pET11d-UvrD or a 2-liter culture of mid-log phase BL21(DE3)ΔuvrD/pLysS cells containing pET9d-UvrD-R284A were induced for protein expression by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. Growth was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Wild-type and mutant helicase II proteins were purified using a procedure described previously (49Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified protein was determined by spectrophotometric absorbance readings at 280 nm using the previously published helicase II extinction coefficient of 1.29 ml mg−1 cm−1 (49Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Storage buffer for helicase II was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 200 mmNaCl, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50% glycerol. The plasmid pET81F1-UvrD (27Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25360-25368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), containing the full-length helicase II coding sequence cloned behind a T7 promoter, as well as the phage F1 origin of replication, was the template for site-directed mutagenesis by standard procedures (50Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide 5′-GCTGGTAGAGGCGTAGTTTTGCTCC-3′ altered codon 284 of helicase II from CGC(arginine) to GCC(alanine) and disrupted aBsrBI restriction site, allowing the initial screening of mutants by restriction digest. After mutagenesis, a 2.0-kilobase pairNcoI-BsiWI DNA fragment containing the desired mutation was sub-cloned into pET9d-UvrD, replacing the wild-typeNcoI-BsiWI fragment in this plasmid and generating pET9d-UvrD-R284A. The presence of a single mutation at the correct location was verified by sequence analysis of the entire helicase II gene in pET9d-UvrD-R284A using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencer. UV irradiation survival was determined as described (19Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The frequency of spontaneous mutant formation was determined as follows. Eleven independent transformants of each of the appropriate cell strains were grown overnight under antibiotic selection at 37 °C. Serial dilutions of each of the saturated cultures were made in M9 minimal media salts. Appropriate dilutions were plated on LB agar to determine cell titer and on LB agar plus 100 μg/ml rifampicin to determine the number of spontaneously arising rifampicin-resistant cells. After incubation at 37 °C for at least 24 h, colonies were counted, and the spontaneous mutant frequency was calculated for each strain by dividing the median value of rifampicin-resistant cells by the average total viable cells. Limited chymotrypsin cleavage of UvrD and UvrD-R284A was performed as described previously (51Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Chymotrypsin (5 ng) was added to reactions (15 μl) containing either 2 μm UvrD (monomer) or 1.8 μmUvrD-R284A (monomer), and the reaction was incubated for 2 min at room temperature (25 °C). Where indicated, 2 μm M13mp7 ssDNA was included. Reactions were stopped with 15 μl of gel loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3.4% SDS, 1.1m 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 2 min. Products were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (32:1 cross-linking ratio) in the presence of 0.1% SDS and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). The binding of UvrD and UvrD-R284A to ssDNA was determined by measuring the retention of [32P]DNA on nitrocellulose filters as described previously (52Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl) contained 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and a [32P]-labeled 92-bp partial duplex helicase substrate (approximately 1.3 μmnucleotide phosphate) (1.86 × 108 cpm μmol−1). Binding reactions were initiated with UvrD or UvrD-R284A over a concentration range of 0.7–84 nm(monomer). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 1 ml of reaction buffer (pre-warmed at 37 °C) was mixed with each sample, and the entire volume was passed through a nitrocellulose filter at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Filters were washed twice with 1 ml of pre-warmed reaction buffer, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Background binding in the absence of enzyme represented less than 0.5% of the total signal and was subtracted from the experimental data. Apparent K d values were calculated as described previously (27Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25360-25368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 53Yong Y. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24509-24517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]ATP to UvrD was also examined by nitrocellulose filter binding. Reactions (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 6.3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12.5% glycerol, and 2.3 μmUvrD or UvrD-R284A (monomer). Binding was initiated by addition of [3H]ATP (1.1 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 200 μm at 0 °C. After 4 min, 15 μl of each reaction was applied directly to a nitrocellulose filter presoaked in reaction buffer at 4 °C. Filters were rinsed once with 750 μl of reaction buffer at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Background binding in the absence of enzyme represented less than 1% of the total signal and was subtracted from the experimental data. The nitrocellulose filters used in the DNA and ATP binding experiments (0.45 μm type HA, Millipore Corp.) were pre-treated by soaking in 0.4 m KOH for 40 min followed by extensive washing with deionized, distilled water. The presence of a dimeric helicase II species was monitored by glutaraldehyde cross-linking as described previously (27Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25360-25368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 49Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tricine (pH 8.3), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 18% glycerol, and either 1.5 μm UvrD (monomer) or 1.4 μm UvrD-R284A (monomer). When present, the oligonucleotide (dT)10 and ATPγS were included at a concentration of 1.7 μm and 3 mm, respectively. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of glutaraldehyde (EM grade, Electron Microscopy Sciences) to a final concentration of 0.01%. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then quenched with 2 μl of 100 mm lysine acetate and 20 μl of gel-loading buffer (see above). Samples were boiled for 2 min, and the products were resolved on a 9.6% polyacrylamide gel (32:1 cross-linking ratio) in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The DNA unwinding activity of UvrD and UvrD-R284A was determined with 92- and 20-bp partial duplex [32P]DNA substrates prepared as described previously (19Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both substrates were purified by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel A5M column (Bio-Rad) prior to use. Helicase reactions (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm ATP, and the indicated partial duplex DNA substrate (approximately 1.3 μm nucleotide phosphate) (1.8 × 108 cpm μmol−1 for the 92-bp substrate and 1.6 × 108 cpm μmol−1 for the 20-bp substrate). Reactions were pre-warmed at 37 °C and initiated with the indicated amount of UvrD or UvrD-R284A. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were quenched with 10 μl of stop solution (37.5% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.05% each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue, and 0.3% SDS). Products were resolved on an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the results were quantified using phosphor storage technology and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The DNA-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP by UvrD and UvrD-R284A was measured as described previously (54Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase reaction mixtures were identical to those for the helicase reactions with the following exceptions. M13mp7 ssDNA (30 μmnucleotide phosphate) was substituted for the partial duplex helicase substrate, and [3H]ATP was substituted for unlabeled ATP. Reactions (20 μl) were pre-warmed at 37 °C and initiated with the indicated amount of [3H]ATP. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and duplicate samples (5 μl) were removed and quenched with 5 μl of stop solution (33 mm EDTA, 7 mm ATP, and 7 mm ADP) after 5 min for UvrD or 10 min for UvrD-R284A. Products were processed as described previously (54Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA helicase II (also called UvrD) has been included, along with a large number of other helicases and putative helicases, in a group designated helicase superfamily I based on conservation of amino acid sequence in seven distinct motifs (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Hodgman T.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Presumably, these motifs represent sites of functional significance that have been evolutionarily conserved. The amino acid sequences of motif IV from theE. coli superfamily I helicases, including UvrD, are shown in Fig. 1. To evaluate the functional significance of motif IV, a mutant uvrD allele was constructed containing an arginine to alanine substitution at position 284 (uvrD-R284A). This arginine is the most highly conserved residue in motif IV. It is found in all identified members of superfamily I. The ability of the mutant protein to substitute for the wild-type protein in two DNA repair pathways was examined in genetic complementation studies. In addition, the UvrD-R284A protein was purified and biochemically characterized. DNA helicase II is an essential component of two DNA repair pathways, methyl-directed mismatch repair and UvrABC-mediated nucleotide excision repair (29Husain I. Van-Houten B. Thomas D.C. Abdel-Monem M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6774-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Caron P.R. Kushner S.R. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ability of UvrD-R284A to function in each pathway was tested using genetic complementation assays. The frequency of spontaneous mutant formation in E. coli strain JH137ΔuvrD was 161-fold higher than its parent strain JH137 due to loss of a functional methyl-directed mismatch repair system (55Nevers P. Spatz H. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1975; 139: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 56Glickman B.W. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). JH137ΔuvrD was also highly sensitive to UV light due to loss of UvrABC-mediated nucleotide excision repair (57Kuemmerle N.B. Masker W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 535-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pET9d-UvrD and pET9d-UvrD-R284A were transformed into JH137ΔuvrD to examine the ability of UvrD and UvrD-R284A to restore the wild-type spontaneous mutant frequency and UV resistance. The level of uninduced expression of theuvrD gene from pET9d-UvrD in JH137ΔuvrD was determined previously and was only slightly less than expression from the JH137 chromosome (18George J.W. Robert M. Brosh J. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in this study (data not shown). The frequency of formation of spontaneous mutants at therpoB locus (Rifr phenotype) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild-typeuvrD, when introduced on the pET9d plasmid, fully restored methyl-directed mismatch repair function as indicated by a relative mutability of 0.6 compared with 1.0 for the parental strain JH137 (Table I). In contrast, the presence of theuvrD-R284A allele in JH137ΔuvrD resulted in a relative mutability of 121, suggesting that the mutant protein did not function in the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway.Table ISpontaneous mutant frequencies of JH137 and JH137 derivativesStrainRelevant genotypeSpontaneous mutant frequencyRelative mutability× 10 −9JH137uvrD +3.01JH137ΔuvrDΔuvrD485161JH137ΔuvrD/pET9d-UvrDuvrD +1.80.6JH137ΔuvrD/pET9d-UvrD-R284AuvrD-R284A362121The spontaneous mutant frequency was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Relative mutability was obtained by dividing the mutant frequency of each strain by the mutant frequency of JH137. Open table in a new tab The spontaneous mutant frequency was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Relative mutability was obtained by dividing the mutant frequency of each strain by the mutant frequency of JH137. The ability of UvrD-R284A to function in UvrABC-mediated nucleotide excision repair was assessed by exposing cells to UV light and determining survival at increasing UV fluences. Strains JH137, JH137ΔuvrD, JH137ΔuvrD/pET9d, JH137ΔuvrD/pET9d-UvrD, and JH137ΔuvrD/pET9d-UvrD-R284A were compared as shown in Fig.2. pET9d-UvrD completely restored the wild-type level of UV resistance. The mutant allele did not restore wild-type UV resistance and appeared to make the cells slightly hypersensitive to UV light as compared with JH137ΔuvrD. The significance of the latter observation was not explored. It was clear that UvrD-R284A was not able to substitute for UvrD in UvrABC-mediated nucleotide excision repair. To identify the biochemical defects responsible for the loss of biological function of UvrD-R284A, mutant and wild-type helicase II were purified as described previously (49Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). UvrD was purified to apparent homogeneity as evidenced by the presence of a single protein species on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3, lane A). Purified UvrD-R284A was contaminated by three faint species migrating slightly faster than UvrD-R284A (Fig. 3, lane D). These species appeared to"

Dimeric proteins with significantly increased stability to urea denaturation were formed by the introduction of the apolar amino acids Ala or Leu in lieu of Lys84 in concert with the deletion of 11 C-terminal amino acids. K84A/−11 deletion protein retained wild-type affinity for operator DNA, while K84L/−11 deletion protein displayed operator affinity similar to its parent tetramer. To assess further the influence of monomer-monomer interface stability on assembly and DNA binding, triple mutants were generated with Y282D, an alteration that disrupts assembly completely in the wild-type background. The triple mutants were dimeric, but they exhibited diminished dimer stability to urea denaturation and decreased operator affinity compared with the double mutations. These results demonstrate directly the stabilizing influence of apolar substitution at position 84 on the monomer-monomer interface.

High affinity binding of repressor to operator sequences within the lac operon inhibits transcription of mRNA for the lactose metabolic genes (1Miller, J. H., and Reznikoff, W. S.

These amino acids are spread over a significant portion of the primary sequence of the repressor protein. Lys84 and Tyr282 are each located in this interface and are positioned to make major energetic contributions to the association (14Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P.

However, the specific effects of side chain alterations along this interface on the stability of assembly have not been explored previously. In contrast to the monomer-monomer interface, the assembly of dimers to tetramer involves a short segment at the C terminus of the protein that forms a four-helix bundle (14Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Mutations or deletions in the C-terminal region have demonstrated directly the requirement for the leucine heptad repeat motif found in this region for dimer-dimer assembly (25Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Krämer H. Müller-Hill B. New Biol. 1991; 3: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar, 26Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B.

The importance of oligomerization to operator binding has been studied using the dimeric products of both missense and deletion mutations in the heptad repeat region (25Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Krämer H. Müller-Hill B. New Biol. 1991; 3: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chakerian A.E. Tesmer V.M. Manly S.P. Brackett J.K. Lynch M.J. Hoh J.T. Matthews K.S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10640-10649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The observed operator binding affinity of these dimeric proteins was 10–100-fold lower than that for wild-type protein due to a linked equilibrium between monomer association to dimer and dimer-operator binding (36Brenowitz M. Mandal N. Pickar A. Jamison E. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1281-1288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chen J. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8728-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the assembled dimer presumably presents the same face to the operator DNA sequence as the tetramer (14Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), the dimeric mutants dissociate more readily into monomers in the absence of the C-terminal coiled-coiled region, and the monomer binds with only very low affinity to DNA (20Schmitz A. Schmeissner U. Miller J.H. Lu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3359-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Daly T.J. Matthews K.S.

Thus, the apparentK d does not reflect the intrinsic DNA binding capacity of dimer species for which the dimer-dimer interface is destabilized (36Brenowitz M. Mandal N. Pickar A. Jamison E. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1281-1288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chen J. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8728-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to mutations that eliminate interaction at the C terminus, a construct in which the C terminus of the lac repressor was replaced with the GCN4 sequence that generates a very stable parallel coiled-coil structure (26Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3227-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) exhibited higher stability under denaturing conditions and wild-type DNA binding affinity, as would be anticipated for a stabilized dimer (30Chen J. Alberti S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12482-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chen J. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8728-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The repressor protein has been found to contain discrete regions that contribute to the different properties of the protein, reflected in the structure of the protein (14Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17602-17612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because DNA binding requires the dimeric structure and bidentate loop formation involving two operator sites requires tetramer, stable assembly of the repressor is crucial to its regulatory function. However, the unique influence of alterations in the monomer-monomer interface has been difficult to ascertain in the context of the tetrameric protein. To explore specifically the structural and functional effects of changes in the monomer-monomer interface, we have constructed combinatorial dimeric mutants with specific substitutions in the monomer-monomer interface. Plasmid pJC-1 was used as the expression vector (29Chen J. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13843-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli 71–18 (supE thi Δ(lac-proAB) F′[proAB+ lacIq lacZΔM15]) was used for DNA isolation, and E. coliTB-1 (ara, Δ(lac-pro), StrA,thi, φ80dlacZΔM15, r−, m+) was used for expression of proteins. Double-stranded DNA derivatives of pJC-1 encoding repressor mutants either at Lys84 or with the 11-amino acid deletion were isolated using the Promega WizardTM kit. The purified plasmid DNAs were cut with NarI andHindIII restriction enzymes. Appropriate bands were excised from agarose gels, and the DNA was isolated and used in ligation. The circularized derivative plasmid DNA was isolated and used directly in double-stranded sequencing following the protocol of the Sequenase® version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Complete sequencing was carried out to ensure mutation only at selected sites. Cells transformed with specific plasmids were grown in 2YT medium (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.6) in a shaking incubator at 37 °C overnight. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in breaking buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 m KCl, 0.01m magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glucose) containing 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a protease inhibitor) and 250 μg/ml lysozyme at a volume 3 times the cell weight, and frozen. The cells were thawed slowly with the addition of 1–2 ml of 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and ∼7 μl of DNase (10 mg/ml). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with ammonium sulfate (23.1 g/100-ml volume), and the resuspended precipitate was dialyzed overnight against 0.08 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 4 °C. The protein solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a phosphocellulose column (2.5 × 25 cm) preequilibrated with 0.08 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.3 mmdithiothreitol and 5% glucose. The column was eluted with the same buffer followed by 0.12 m potassium phosphate buffer. Protein purity (>90% for all proteins) was assessed using SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein (2, 10, and 50 μg) in a total volume of 100 μl was reacted with SDS (0%, 0.01%, and 0.02%) at room temperature for 15 min. The solutions were then filtered onto nitrocellulose paper (presoaked with phosphate-buffered saline), and the proteins were reacted with B-2 antibody as described previously (40Sams C.F. Hemelt V.B. Pinkerton F.D. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1185-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only difference was that the secondary antibody reaction employed a chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Life Science, with the resulting reactions visualized through exposure to x-ray film. Each protein (0.25 mg/ml in 0.12m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) was incubated with 2% (w/w) trypsin (in 0.001 n HCl) for 30 min at room temperature. For control reactions, 0.001 n HCl was added in lieu of trypsin. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (in 100% ethanol). The digested proteins were then run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and protein products were visualized using Coomassie Blue staining. Double sector cells were used for sedimentation velocity studies, and six channel cells were used for equilibrium analysis using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. In each case, a minimum of three protein concentrations was studied for each mutant. For velocity sedimentation, ∼400 μl of protein (0.06–0.6 mg/ml) was loaded, the samples were centrifuged at a maximum speed of 42,000 rpm, and the cells were scanned at 280 nm. The data were analyzed using a software package provided by Beckman, and the sedimentation coefficient was determined at each concentration point using two methods: 1) the second moment algorithm (41Goldberg R.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1953; 57: 194-202Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 42Muramatsu N. Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and 2) the time derivative method (43Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 44Stafford III, W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J.

Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA1993Google Scholar). For equilibrium sedimentation, the cells were loaded with ∼100–110 μl of protein at varying concentrations. Samples were centrifuged at 8,000, 10,000, and 16,000 rpm, allowing the sample to reach equilibrium before increasing the speed. Using the data analysis software, plots of ln(C r) versus r 2 were fit using a least squares algorithm, where C r is the concentration at a specific radial position, r.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was used. Protein at various dilutions was mixed with 32P-end-labeled 40-base pair operator DNA (∼10−12m). After a short incubation, reactions were filtered on nitrocellulose using a 96-well plate, and the nitrocellulose was dried and exposed to a Fuji bio-imaging for visualization. The plate was read on a Fuji BAS1000 bio-imaging analyzer, and the radioactivity was quantitated using the program MacBas version 2.0 on a Macintosh computer. Free operator DNA bound to nitrocellulose was used as background in lieu of IPTG 1The abbreviation used is: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. additions due to the very slow inducer association rate for the mutants in this study. After subtracting background intensity, the values were expressed as fractional saturation (R) and plotted against log protein concentration. The data were fit by nonlinear least squares analysis using the equation,R=[protein]Kd+[protein]Equation 1 utilizing the program Igor Pro on a Macintosh computer. All experiments were performed in 0.1 m potassium sulfate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, 5% Me2SO, pH 7.5, buffer. To reduce nonspecific binding, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to buffer used for dilutions and filtration. From previously reported data, proteins containing Lys84 substitutions had K dvalues for IPTG binding similar to wild-type (K d∼10−6m) but bound to inducer much more slowly than wild type (35Chang W.-I. Olson J.S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17613-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), precluding use of the standard IPTG binding assay. A new procedure was developed using individual reactions of 1.5 ml of protein solution at 1 × 10−7mconcentration (tetramer) with varying concentrations of IPTG. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, total fluorescence was measured using an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 285 nm directed through a filter (7-54, Corning), and emission fluorescence was measured using a 350-nm cut-off filter (O-52, Corning). Fluorescence intensity was converted to fractional saturation (R), and the data were fit by nonlinear least squares analysis using the equation,R=[IPTG] nKdn+[IPTG] nEquation 2 with the program Igor Pro, where K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant and n is the Hill coefficient for IPTG binding. Buffers used were 0.1 mpotassium sulfate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl at both pH 7.5 and pH 9.2. Stock solutions of either urea (10 or 7 m) or guanidine hydrochloride (6.5 or 4 m) were made fresh daily in 0.1 m potassium sulfate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The concentrations of the solutions were confirmed with a refractometer. Protein (10 μg/ml) was incubated for a minimum of 2 h to reach equilibrium. Using an SLM model AB-2 spectrofluorometer, the solutions were excited at 285 nm, the intensity at 340 nm was utilized for the data analysis, and the intensity was converted to fraction unfolded (F u) using the equation,Fu=Yf−YYf−YuEquation 3 where Y f is the extrapolated value for fluorescence at [denaturant]i from the slope of the data at low concentrations of urea before unfolding (pretransition), andY u is the extrapolated value at [denaturant]i from the data for completely unfolded protein (posttransition), and Y is the measured fluorescence at [denaturant]i. Using a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm, the free energy of the reaction could be determined based on the following assumptions: 1) the reaction is reversible; 2) the unfolding process is best described by a transition from dimer to unfolded monomer (M2 ↔ 2U) (30Chen J. Alberti S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12482-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) the free energy change for this transition in the absence of denaturant can be determined via linear extrapolation (ΔG = ΔG 0 + m[denaturant]) to zero denaturant concentration (49Greene Jr., R.F.

Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1989: 311-330Google Scholar) (where m represents a measure of the dependence of ΔG on denaturant concentration). Equation 3 was used to fit the data after conversion to fraction unfolded (F u) versus urea concentration,Fu=e −ΔG0+m[urea]RT2+8e −ΔG0+m[urea]RT[protein]1/2−e −ΔG0+m[urea]RT4[protein]Equation 4 where [protein] is total monomer protein concentration (38Chen J. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8728-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For experiments to determine reversibility, the protein of interest was fully denatured in a high concentration of denaturant and allowed to reach equilibrium, and then buffer was added to dilute the denaturant to final concentrations comparable with those used in the unfolding experiments. Using restriction enzymes sites that flank the selected regions, the −11 deletion coding sequence was combined with the K84A, K84L, K84A/Y282D, and K84L/Y282D coding sequences to generate double and triple mutations. The entire coding region for these combinatorial mutants was sequenced to verify the desired changes and to eliminate the possibility of other alterations. Purification of the repressor mutants utilized the affinity of the DNA binding domain for phosphocellulose. SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting indicate high purity of the purified mutant proteins (Fig. 2). The yield for triple mutant proteins was lower than that for double mutant proteins, the first suggestion that the triple mutant proteins were less stable. Antibody binding under denaturing conditions allows an indirect measurement of conformation and stability of a mutant protein as compared with wild-type repressor (40Sams C.F. Hemelt V.B. Pinkerton F.D. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1185-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that native wild-type protein will react with B-2 monoclonal antibody only in the presence of low concentrations of SDS, while monomeric repressor protein is reactive with this monoclonal antibody in the absence of SDS (33Daly T.J. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5474-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Sams C.F. Hemelt V.B. Pinkerton F.D. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1185-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results for dimeric proteins examined previously tend to fall somewhere in between these two extremes (29Chen J. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13843-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen J. Alberti S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10640-10649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The double mutants in this study reacted more strongly in the absence of SDS and demonstrated only partial reactivity in the presence of SDS (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the mutations at residue 84 impart conformational changes that expose the antibody epitope located in the C term"

https://openalex.org/W1981857633,"This work describes the phosphorylation ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae Ras proteins and explores the physiological role of the phosphorylation of Ras2 protein. Proteins expressed from activated alleles of RAS were less stable and less phosphorylated than proteins from cells expressing wild-type alleles of RAS. This difference in phosphorylation level did not result from increased signaling through the Ras-cAMP pathway or reflect the primarily GTP-bound nature of activated forms of Ras protein per se. In addition, phosphorylation of Ras protein was not dependent on proper localization of the Ras2 protein to the plasma membrane nor on the interaction of Ras2p with its exchange factor, Cdc25p. The preferred phosphorylation site on Ras2 protein was identified as serine 214. This site, when mutated to alanine, led to promiscuous phosphorylation of Ras2 protein on nearby serine residues. A decrease in phosphorylation may lead to a decrease in signaling through the Ras-cAMP pathway.

The RAS genes were discovered as the transforming factors of acutely oncogenic retroviruses and were later recognized as virally transduced forms of cellular proto-oncogenes. CellularRAS genes are activated by mutation in a wide variety of human cancers, providing the first example of a common molecular oncogenic mechanism for cancer (1Capon D.J. Seeburg P.H. McGrath J.P.

A. 1984; 81: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ras genes encode small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Mammalian cells have at least three distinct Ras proteins, Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and Ki-Ras (6Hall A. Marshall C.J. Spurr N.K. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1983; 303: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), all of which can act as oncogenes when activated by certain mutations. The Ras superfamily of proteins function as molecular switches that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Ras protein is in its active form when bound to GTP and in its inactive form when bound to GDP. In this way, the ratio of GTP to GDP-bound forms of Ras protein determines the amount of Ras-mediated signaling. The proper function of Ras protein requires cycling between the GTP and GDP-bound states in response to a nutrient or differentiation signal. All Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity, and the regulation of the ratio of GTP to GDP-bound forms of the protein is modulated partially through regulation of this activity by proteins that stimulate the GTPase activity (7McCormick F. Martin G.A. Clark R. Bollag G. Polakis P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fact, mutant forms of Ras protein that fail to hydrolyze GTP produce unregulated cell growth or inappropriate differentiation. Signal transduction pathways involving Ras proteins are responsible for the developmental fates of several different tissues in metazoans (8Simon M.A. Bowtell D.D.L. Dodson G.S. Laverty T.R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 701-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 9Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 10Aroian R.V. Koga M. Mendel J.E. Ohshima Y. Sternberg P.W.

Studies of Ras in these signal transduction cascades have led to a unified model for metazoan Ras signaling through a mitogen-activated kinase cascade. Saccharomyces cerevisiaecontains two RAS genes, RAS1 and RAS2(12Kataoka T. Powers S. McGill C. Fasano O. Strathern J. Broach J. Wigler M. Cell. 1984; 37: 437-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), that both modulate growth. In contrast to all metazoans studied to date, the effector for RAS in S. cerevisiae is adenylyl cyclase, rather than a member of the mitogen-activated kinase pathway (13Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Thus, although the function of RAS is conserved from S. cerevisiae to metazoans, the effectors for these Ras proteins have diverged. In all species examined, Ras proteins are subject to several post-translational modifications at their carboxyl termini. These carboxyl-terminal modifications are conserved among Ras proteins from metazoans to yeast and are dependent on the presence of a carboxyl-terminal prenylation motif. The modifications include farnesylation of the most carboxyl-terminal cysteine (14Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), followed by endoproteolytic removal of the three carboxyl-terminal residues (15Ashby M.N. Rine J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and subsequent methylation of the carboxyl group on the newly generated carboxyl-terminal prenyl-cysteine (16Deschenes R.J. Stimmel J.B. Clarke S. Stock J. Broach J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11865-11873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There may also be a reversible palmitoylation of the cysteine residue adjacent to the prenyl-cysteine (17Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). These modifications play a significant role in the proper localization of Ras protein to the plasma membrane. The activity of some alleles of Ha-Ras is modulated by phosphorylation (18Gibbs J.B. Ellis R.W. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2674-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Some naturally occurring activated mutant Ha-RasVal12 proteins have a second mutation that changes an alanine to a threonine at position 59 (A59T). Phosphorylation occurs on these Ha-RasVal12–Thr59 mutant proteins on threonine 59. This A59T mutation has been detected only in viral Ras oncoproteins that also contain the G12V mutation as well, and may arise as a suppressor of G12V. Indeed, Ha-RasVal12–Thr59protein transforms fibroblasts less efficiently than does Ha-RasVal12 protein (18Gibbs J.B. Ellis R.W. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2674-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The two yeast Ras proteins, Ras1p and Ras2p, are also phosphorylated (19Cobitz A.R. Yim E.H. Brown W.R. Perou C.M. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However these phosphorylations have not been characterized with respect to their position in the protein or their biological function. Because phosphorylation frequently plays a regulatory role in biology, and because the regulation of Ras proteins in yeast is still poorly understood, we characterized the phosphorylation of yeast Ras protein to determine what role(s) it might play. Yeast strains were grown in casamino acid medium lacking uracil and/or tryptophan (CAA), yeast minimal medium (YM), or rich medium (YPD) (Difco) containing 2% glucose (Sigma). 5-FOA was used at a concentration of 1 g/liter to select against URA3 function. Diploids were sporulated on minimal sporulation medium (20Barnes G. Hansen W.J. Holcomb C.L. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2381-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Solid media contained 2% agar (Difco). Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153 (2nd Ed.): 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Doubling times of yeast strains were determined by measuring theA 600 of logarithmically growing cultures at 30 °C. For analysis of growth of phosphorylation mutants, all drugs or compounds were added to the YPD media after autoclaving. All cloning and other molecular methods were performed according to standard methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise specified. DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded templates by the di-deoxy chain termination method, either using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) on double-stranded denatured templates with35S-dATP or by using cycle sequencing with fluorescent nucleotides on double-stranded templates and an ABI automated sequencer. All PCR products for cloning were made with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) at 1 unit per 100-μl reaction. The reactions were in buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 μm each dNTP, 1 μm each primer, and 1–10 ng of template DNA. Denaturing temperature was 94 °C. Annealing temperature was 2–5 °C below the T m of the primer with the lowest T m. Extension was at 72 °C for 1 min for each kilobase of DNA amplified. Amplification was for 35 cycles. To sew PCR products together, 2 μl of each template product were added to the standard buffer above with no oligo primers and an addition of 0.1 mm tetramethylammonium chloride. Five cycles were then run in this buffer in the absence of primers to generate full-length product template; the flanking primers were then added at 1 μm concentration, and 35 additional cycles were done to amplify the full-length product. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using single-stranded DNA generated from RAS2 plasmid pJR1039 andRAS2 Val19 plasmid pJR1040. Analysis of heat shock sensitivity was performed by growing strains for 2 days at 30 °C into stationary phase (A 600 4–5) in liquid casamino acid medium lacking tryptophan. Cells were diluted 10 × in distilled H2O and subjected to a 90-s heat shock at 55 °C in a thermocycler (MJ Research Inc.). Cells were then further diluted in distilled H2O and plated onto solid casamino acid medium lacking tryptophan. Percentage survival from heat shock was calculated by comparing the number of colonies arising from heat-shocked cells to the number obtained from cells from the same initial dilution that had not been heat shocked. Cells deleted for CDC25 and carrying a CEN TRP1-marked CDC25 plasmid (pCDC25-TRP1) were transformed with a high copyURA3-marked plasmid carrying TPK1 (pJR1857). The resulting strain RAS1 RAS2 cdc25Δ pCDC25-TRP1pTPK1-URA3 (JRY5416) was grown in medium containing tryptophan to allow loss of the CDC25-TRP1 plasmid. These cells were then replica-plated to medium lacking tryptophan to identify colonies that had lost the CDC25-TRP1 plasmid, one of which became strain RAS1 RAS2 cdc25Δ pTPK1-URA3(JRY5417), which is genotypically cdc25Δ but otherwise isogenic to JRY5416. The ras1Δ ras2Δ pTPK1 strain (JRY5404) was constructed in several steps, JRY3001 MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 (W303 background) was transformed with a PCR product designed to disrupt the RAS1 open reading frame. The PCR product was synthesized using Vent DNA polymerase using oligo primers JW040 and JW041. Primer JW040 5′-CAGGTAAACAAAATTTTCCCTTTTTAGAACCATATG GTACTGAGAGTGCACC-3′ contained 30 bp complementary to the non-coding strand ofRAS1 just upstream of the ATG start codon and generated aNdeI site (underlined) utilizing the ATG start codon. The remaining 16 bp (in bold type) were complementary to the region of the pRS vectors (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) flanking the insertion of the selectable marker genes for these vectors. Primer JW041 5′-CAAAACCATGTCATATCAAGAGAGCAGGATCGCGGTATTTCACACCGC-3′ contained 31 bp complementary to the coding strand ofRAS1 just downstream of the stop codon and 16 bp (in bold type) complementary to the vector flanking the insertion of the selectable marker genes for these vectors. This primer pair was used to amplify the HIS3 gene from vector pRS303. The resulting PCR product contained the entire HIS3 gene flanked by 30 and 31 bp of RAS1 sequence 5′ and 3′ of the HIS3 gene, respectively, to target recombination of HIS3 into theRAS1 locus. The PCR product was used to transform JRY3001, and His+ transformants were selected. In approximately half the His+ transformants, the RAS1 gene was replaced by HIS3, as confirmed by DNA blot hybridization (data not shown). The resulting strain, MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 ras1Δ::HIS3, was JRY5412. This strain was the parent of the bcy1Δ strain described below (JRY5410). The ras1Δ::HIS3 strain was transformed with the TPK1-URA3 high copy plasmid pJR1857 (JRY5427) and then deleted for RAS2 using aras2Δ::LEU2 disruption plasmid (pJR1858). In this ras2::LEU2 the LEU2 gene replaced the RAS2 coding region from the ClaI site 560 bp upstream of the ATG start codon to the MscI site 636 bp into the open reading frame. Disruption was confirmed by the inability of resulting LEU2 transformants to grow on solid medium containing 5-FOA, which selects against the pTPK1-URA3plasmid, which is required for viability in the ras1Δ ras2Δ strain. Approximately half the resulting LEU2transformants were unable to grow on 5-FOA. One of these was designated JRY5404 and had the genotype MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 ras1Δ::HIS3 ras2Δ::LEU2pTPK1-URA3. The bcy1Δ strain (JRY5410) was constructed using theras1Δ::HIS3 strain described above (JRY5412) using a linear fragment from plasmid pJR1071 that contained theBCY1 gene disrupted by the LEU2 gene. The disruption was confirmed by testing heat shock sensitivity of theLEU2 transformants (data not shown). The ras1Δ::HIS3 strains (JRY5407 and JRY5408) were constructed in two steps to create an unmarked deletion (25Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene ( Amst .). 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). TheRAS1 disruption plasmid (pJR1877) lacked the 270-bpHpaI-MscI fragment internal to RAS1. A partial digest of this plasmid with HindIII, which cut within the remaining RAS1 sequence, created a linear fragment that directed insertion to the RAS1 locus (JRY5428). The resulting URA3 transformants were streaked on 5-FOA medium to select for a recombination event that removed the vector with the URA3 gene, leaving behind an unmarked partial deletion allele of RAS1 (JRY5407). The disruption allele was confirmed by DNA blot hybridization. The strain with theras1 disruption allele was transformed with a URA3 RAS2 Val19 plasmid (pJR1861) (JRY5408). The phenotypes of various RAS2 alleles were evaluated after integrating these alleles in a strain lacking the wild-type RAS1 and RAS2 alleles (JRY5404). To construct TRP1-integrating versions of the desiredRAS2 allele the XhoI-BamHI fragment containing the RAS2 alleles from various plasmids was subcloned into TRP1-marked integrating vector YIplac204, which had been digested with both SalI and BamHI. The resulting plasmids were then digested with NdeI and re-ligated to remove the small polylinker-containing region, makingEcoRV a unique site within the TRP1 gene. Linearization of these plasmids with EcoRV directs integration into the TRP1 locus. The high copy TRP1-markedRAS2 plasmid (pJR1244) was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kbEcoRI-SalI fragment containing the entireRAS2 gene from pJR827 into pRS424. TheTRP1-marked CEN RAS2 plasmid (pJR1051) was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment into pRS314. The TRP1-marked CENRAS2 Val19 plasmid (pJR1052) was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment containing the entire RAS2 Val19 gene from pJR828 into pRS314. Plasmid pJR827 was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kbClaI-HindIII RAS2 gene into pRS306. Plasmid pJR828 was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kbClaI-HindIII fragment containing the entireRAS2 Val19 gene into pRS306. Plasmid pJR1039 was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kb EcoRI-SalIRAS2 fragment from pJR827 into pRS316. Plasmid pJR1040 was constructed by cloning the 1.9-kb EcoRI-SalIRAS2 Val19 fragment from pJR828 into pRS316. The CENTRP1-marked RAS2 plasmid (pJR1878) was generated by cloning a XhoI-BamHI fragment containing the entire RAS2 gene from pJR1039 into pRS414. The high copy URA3-marked TPK1 plasmid (pJR1857) was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment containing the entireTPK1 gene into pRS426. The TPK1 PCR product was amplified using Vent DNA polymerase using oligo primers JW094 and JW095. Primer JW094, 5′-GGAAGCTTGCAAAGCCAGTGTCCCAACG-3′ was complementary to the non-coding strand at the 5′ end of theTPK1 gene and generated a HindIII site. Primer JW095, 5′-GGAAGCTTGAACGCCGTTCCATCTCCG-3′ was complementary to the coding strand at the 3′ end of TPK1 and also generated a HindIII site. The resulting PCR product was purified with a Millipore ultrafree-MC microcentrifuge unit, digested with HindIII, gel-purified, and cloned into pRS426, resulting in pJW167, in which the open reading frame of TPK1was in the same orientation as URA3. The high copy RAS1 plasmid pJR1859 was constructed by cloning a HindIII fragment containing the entireRAS1 gene into the high copy TRP1 vector YEplac112. In the resulting plasmid (pJR1859) the RAS1 was in the same orientation as TRP1. The high copyRAS1 Val19 plasmid (pJR1860) was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment containing the entireRAS1 Val19 gene into the high copy TRP1vector YEplac112. The RAS1 Val19 PCR fragment was generated by the PCR sewing method. First, two PCR products were made both of which incorporated the RAS1 Val19 mutation into the product by use of a mutagenic oligo primer. One product amplified the RAS1 region 5′ of amino acid 19, utilizing oligonucleotides JW134 and T7 as primers. T7 annealed to the polylinker region of RAS1 plasmid pJW99 that was used as the template for the PCR reaction. Primer JW134 5′-GCAGATTTACCAACGCCA A CTCCACCGACAACTAC-3′ was complementary to the coding strand of RAS1 and introduced the Gly-19 → Val mutation (bold type, underlined). The other product amplified the RAS1 region 3′ of amino acid 19, utilizing oligonucleotide JW133 and reverse as primers. Reverse primer annealed to the polylinker region of RAS1 plasmid pJW99 which was used as the template for the PCR reaction. Primer JW133 5′-GTAGTTGTCGGTGGAG T TGGCGGTGGTAAATCTGC-3′ was complementary to the non-coding strand of RAS1 and introduced the Gly-19 → Val mutation (bold type, underlined). Both products were purified, and 2 μl of each of the previous products were used as template for a PCR sewing reaction (see below) utilizing primers T7 and reverse. The resulting full-lengthRAS1 Val19 PCR product was purified, digested withHindIII, and cloned into the TRP1-marked high copy vector YCplac112 to create pJR1860, in whichRAS1 Val19 was in the same orientation as theTRP1 gene. The presence of the RAS1 Val19 mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The RAS1 plasmid used as template for the PCR reactions described above (pJR1879) was constructed by cloning the HindIII fragment containingRAS1 into the polylinker of pRS425. A plasmid encoding a fusion protein in which the green fluorescence protein (GFP-S65Y) was joined to the amino terminus of theRAS2 coding region was used to evaluate the localization of Ras2p in living cells. This plasmid was derived from a high copyTRP1-marked vector (pJR1136, a gift from Cindy Trueblood) that contained a HindIII-XbaI fragment with the strong constitutive GPD promoter and the PGK1 terminator. TheRAS2 coding region was inserted between the promoter and the terminator by inserting an EcoRI-SalI fragment (from pJR1880) into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pJR1136, forming pJR1881. As a result, RAS2 was under the control of the GPD promoter. In the next step, a very bright variant of the GFP gene (S65Y) (26Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) was amplified from a plasmid pRH431 (a gift from Randy Hampton) with the oligonucleotide primers JW121 and JW122. 5′-CCGAGCTC ATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC-3′ (JW121) was complementary to the non-coding strand of vbGFP and introduced a SacI site (underlined) just 5′ of the ATG start codon of vbGFP (in bold type), and 5′-CCGAATTCTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATG-3′ (JW122) was complementary to the coding strand of vbGFP and introduced anEcoRI site (underlined) just 5′ of the stop codon for vbGFP. This EcoRI site allowed aSacI-EcoRI fragment of GFP to be cloned into theGPD-RAS2 plasmid (pJR1881) creating an amino-terminal fusion of GFP to the RAS2 gene (pJR1862). TheGFP-ras2-SSIIS plasmid (pJR1863) was constructed by substituting the wild-type RAS2 gene on anEcoRI-SalI fragment from pJR1862 with anEcoRI-SalI PCR fragment containing theras2-SSIIS allele. The ras2-SSIIS PCR fragment was generated as above from plasmid pEG(KG)RAS2-SSIISutilizing oligonucleotide primers JW067 and JW127. 5′-CCGAATTC ATGCCTTTGAACAAG-3′ (JW067) was complementary to the non-coding strand at the 5′ end ofRAS2, and 5′-CCGTCGACGCGTTTCTACAACTATTTCC-3′ (JW127) was complementary to the coding strand of the RAS2gene prior to the cysteine to serine mutations. Plasmids marked with the TRP1 gene and containing the serine to alanine mutations at RAS2 positions 198, 202, 207, and 214 (pJR1864, pJR1865, pJR1866, and pJR1867) were created by subcloning the 1.0-kb PstI fragments from pJR1868, pJR1869, pJR1870, and pJR1871, respectively, into the vector fragment ofPstI-digested RAS2 plasmid pJR1244 and selecting the correct orientation. Plasmid pJR1868, pJR1869, pJR1870, and pJR1871 were generated by oligo-directed mutagenesis using single-stranded DNA from RAS2 Val19 plasmid pJR1040 as template. Oligonucleotide primers JW115, JW116, JW117, and JW118 which were complementary to the coding strand were used to generate pJR1868, pJR1869, pJR1870, and pJR1871, respectively. PCR products were generated under standard conditions, and sewing products were made as described above using flanking primers JW137 and JW124. These sewing products were transformed into aras1Δ ras2Δ yeast strain (JRY5404) that carries aURA3-marked RAS2 plasmid, simultaneously with linearized TRP1-marked RAS2-gap plasmid, pJR1882, that was deleted for the HpaI fragment of RAS2, and TRP1 transformants were selected. Strains were then grown on medium containing 5-FOA to select for successful gap repair. Plasmids from these strains were recovered (27Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar) and transformed intoEscherichia coli strain DH5α. DNA sequencing was used as a final check on the sequence of each mutation created. The RAS2-gap plasmid, pJR1882, was constructed by digestingRAS2 plasmid pJR1244 with HpaI and re-ligating to remove the 1.5-kb RAS2-containing insert. Samples were harvested at various culture densities, as described, and frozen at −80 °C until processing. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (28Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), only the rat monoclonal antibody, Y13-259 (Oncogene Sciences), was used at a 1:250 dilution at 4 °C. Cells were grown to anA 600 of approximately 1.0 in medium with 5 μm KH2PO4 and 10 μm(NH4)2SO4 to limit cells for phosphate and sulfate (LPSM). 2 A 600 units of cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml of fresh LPSM. 1 mCi of inorganic 32P (Amersham Corp.) or 1 mCi of35S-trans-label (ICN) was added to cells that were metabolically labeled at 30 °C for 3 h, unless otherwise specified. Labeled cells were then pelleted and washed with 1 ml of YM media with 0.1% NaN3, and the pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Labeled cells were thawed and resuspended on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (NLB) at 10 OD/ml. Cells were disrupted with glass beads (29Trueblood C.E. Ohya Y. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4260-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were removed to a clean chilled tube, and glass beads were washed with one additional volume of NLB. Lysate and wash were pooled and centrifuged at full speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet cell debris. The supernatants were added to 1.5 × volume of bovine serum albumin-pretreated activated charcoal, vortexed, and pelleted repeatedly until no charcoal residue remained. Protein G-Sepharose beads conjugated to the anti-Ras antibody Y13–259 (Oncogene Sciences) were prepared using standard procedures (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-523Google Scholar). Equivalent protein for each lysate was added to a 10-μl bed volume (100-μl slurry) of protein G-Sepharose/Y13–259 beads and incubated end over end at 4 °C for 2 h. Lysate was removed, and beads were washed 3 × 100 cv with ice-cold NLB, and then with 3 × 100 cv with ice-cold NLB lacking Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from beads in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 2 mm GTP, 2 mm GDP at 70 °C for 5 min. Eluate was removed from beads, spun at 4 °C for 5 min to remove any insoluble material, and stored at −20 °C. Proteins from immunoprecipitations were electrophoretically separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, unless otherwise stated. Gels were fixed in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% HOAc for 30 min, dried at 60 °C for 1 h, and placed on film at −80 °C and/or exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette (Molecular Dynamics). A yeast strain deleted for RAS1 and RAS2 and carrying the p(EG)KG-RAS2 plasmid (31Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which expresses a GST-Ras2 fusion protein from the galactose-inducible Gal1 promoter (JRY5429), was grown in 5 liters of YM with 2% raffinose as a carbon source to anA 600 of 0.2 at 30 °C. Galactose was added to 4% and the cells continued to grow overnight at 30 °C for 4 more doublings. Cells were harvested and washed with STMN (0.3 msorbitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and frozen at −80 °C. Protein was purified as published (31Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) only no detergent was added. Protein was eluted by digesting the bead-bound protein with thrombin 2 × for 30 min at room temperature. Purification of Ras2p with 12 amino acids from GST was to near-homogeneity from the single affinity chromatographic step. A total of 5 mg of Ras2 protein was obtained from the 5 liters of induced cells. The identity of this protein as Ras was confirmed by immunoblot (data not shown). The resulting Ras2 protein was then further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column. The protein invariably eluted as two peaks that could not be resolved under the conditions used. A portion of the purified protein was treated with alkaline phosphatase, and the treated protein was eluted as a single peak on high performance liquid chromatography analysis, indicating that the second peak represented phosphorylated Ras2p. Ras2 peptides were generated by digestion with LysC, AspN, or ArgC (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's instructions. Peptides were then individually purified by high performance liquid chromatography over a C18 reverse phase column and subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry. In most cases in which phosphorylation plays a regulatory role on a protein, the half-life of phosphorylation is shorter than the half-life of the protein. Therefore we compared the half-life of the entire Ras2 protein pool and the half-life of phosphorylated Ras2 protein. A strain deleted for ras1 andras2 and carrying a high copy RAS2 plasmid (JRY5430) was pulse-labeled with either 32Pi or35S-trans-label and chased into cold medium. The Ras2p was then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The half-life of the Ras2 protein pool under these conditions was greater than 5 h, whereas the half-life of the phosphorylated pool was less than 1 h (Fig. 1). Based on these data, phosphorylation of Ras2p was dynamic and was therefore potentially a regulatory modification. If phosphorylation of Ras2p regulated its activity, then mutations that affect the activity of Ras2p might"

Antigenically pure core histone H4 was prepared from chicken erythrocytes and used to produce anti-histone H4 antisera. IgG fractions were isolated from purified anti-H4 antibodies and used as antigens to produce “second generation” antisera. Epitopes cross-reacting with the second generation antisera were then identified within chromosomal proteins. These epitopes were presumed to mimic the complementary molecular surface of the original anti-H4 antibodies, and thus proteins containing these epitopes were putatively identified as specific ligands of H4 in chromatin. Surprisingly, we found this immunoreactivity was predominantly directed against H1 compared with H5 from chicken erythrocytes. Further, the immunoreactive epitopes were located within the C-terminal tail domain of the linker histones. These results suggest similar complementary interactions occur between H4 and the C-terminal tail domain of H1s in native chromatin. This could occur either within a single nucleosome as suggested by a previous report (Banères, J.-L., Essalouh, L., Jariel-Encontre, I., Mesnier, D., Garrod, S., and Parello, J. (1994) J. Mol. Biol., 243, 48–59) or between neighboring nucleosomes within the condensed chromatin fiber. The implications of these results with regard to the structure of the chromatin fiber and the future utility of this technique are discussed.

Biol., 243, 48–59) or between neighboring nucleosomes within the condensed chromatin fiber. The implications of these results with regard to the structure of the chromatin fiber and the future utility of this technique are discussed. The primary repeating subunit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex composed of a histone protein octamer, (H2A/H2B/H3/H4)2, a single linker histone protein, and approximately 200 base pairs of DNA (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). Adjacent nucleosomes are connected together by a DNA linker of variable length depending on the species (3Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 931-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Nucleosomal structures are generally considered to have a fundamental role in many nuclear activities which involve DNA, such as transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair (2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). Modifications of histone proteins may modulate the condensation/decondensation of the chromatin fiber, which in turn changes the accessibility of the DNA to enzymes or factors involved in these nuclear activities (2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar, 4Muller S. Chaix M.L. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Mol.

Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The histone octamer is comprised of four heterotypic dimers comprised of either H2A and H2B or H3 and H4. The majority of each histone protein is contained within an evolutionarily conserved structure know as the “histone fold,” which is comprised of a long, central α-helix flanked on each side by a short loop and a short α-helix (9Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 10Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Two histone fold proteins interlock via the “handshake” motif with extensive complementary surfaces between heterodimerization partners (10Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Histone dimers associate in an end-to-end fashion to form essentially a H2A/H2B-H4/H3-H3/H4-H2B/H2A helical tetramer of dimers onto which the DNA is wrapped (9Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C.

Despite the well characterized nature of intra-core histone interactions, other histone-histone interactions likely to be found in chromatin have not been as well described. For example, in the compacted chromatin fiber it is likely that core histone proteins from nearby nucleosomes are brought into close proximity, and it has been proposed that inter-nucleosomal core or even histone-histone interactions are instrumental in directing the condensation of the fiber (13Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One manifestation of these interactions may be the propensity with which core histone octamers “close-pack” together when reconstituted with long DNA in vitro in the absence of linker histones (15Tatchell K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 24: 5295-5303Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, the interactions of many non-histone chromosomal proteins such as HMGs 1/2 or 14/17, which are likely to interact with multiple proteins within chromatin (16Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have not been well defined. Immunological approaches for analyzing the structural relationships between chromatin proteins have been extremely useful in the investigation of protein structures within chromatin (17Bustin M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1979; 88: 105-142PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, since Stollar and Ward (18Stollar B.D. Ward M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first demonstrated that histones are adequate immunogens when complexed with RNA, numerous laboratories have obtained anti-histone antisera. The use of such antisera and anti-histone antibodies as probes has allowed the detection of many details of the surface of chromatin subunits, despite the limited amount of information concerning the molecular structure of epitopes found at the surface of these structures (19Muller S. Erard M. Burggraf E. Couppez M. Sautière P. Champagne M. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Muller S. Himmelspach K. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further, Muller and colleagues have demonstrated that the production of antisera to synthetic peptides that mimic linear histone regions (21Hacques M.-F. Muller S. De Murcia G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Marion C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) could be used to detect the histone regions accessible to anti-peptide antibodies inside chromatin (4Muller S. Chaix M.L. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Muller S. Erard M. Burggraf E. Couppez M. Sautière P. Champagne M.

Commun. 1990; 168: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anti-histone immunochemical reagents also have been instrumental in the elucidation of the role of histone posttranslational modifications in nuclear processes such as transcription and replication (6Hebbes T.R. Thome A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 22Turner B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present report, we present a novel immunological approach to detect potential protein-protein interactions within chromatin. This approach is based on the complementarity of surfaces that are in contact within interacting systems. This phenomenon is exemplified by hormone/hormone receptor systems in which it has been demonstrated that antibodies to anti-hormone antibodies are able to mimic physiological effects of hormones (reviewed in Ref. 24Strosberg A.D. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1983; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; see “Discussion”). This effect is due to the complementary structures of the receptor and ligand within these systems and the fact that anti-anti-hormone antibodies recapitulate many of the key facets of the original hormone structure (see Fig. 1). Here we demonstrate that IgG fractions from anti-H4 antibodies are able to induce production of antibodies that react with the original IgG fractions and also demonstrate specific immunoreactivity against the C-terminal tail domain of linker histones. Chicken erythrocyte nuclei were isolated according to the procedure of Nothacker and Hildebrandt (25Nothacker K.D. Hildebrandt A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 278-282Google Scholar) with the modifications described by Loidl and Gröbner (26Loidl P. Gröbner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10195-10199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histones were extracted from nuclei with H2SO4as described by Helliger et al. (27Helliger W. Lindner H. Hautplorenz S. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Histone H4 was purified by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-60 (Bio-Rad) column (28Von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.de A. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by a series of chromatographic fractionations on Sephadex G-100 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 50 mmsodium acetate successively at pH 5 and 4 as reported by Muller and Van Regenmortel (29Muller S. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum immunoreactive against all histone proteins (RAAHC) 1The abbreviations used are: RAAHC, rabbit antiserum raised against all histone proteins; MAH4, mouse antisera raised against the anti-H4; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. was prepared using acid extractable proteins from chicken erythrocyte nuclei. The purity of histone H4 was then assessed by Western blot probed the RAAHC antiserum. Antisera against purified histone H4 of chicken erythrocyte were obtained by immunizing mice biweekly with H4·RNA complexes (3:1, w/w) as previously reported by Stollar and Ward (18Stollar B.D. Ward M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each vaccination, each animal received by subcutaneous injection 10 μg of histone H4 emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant for the first injection or in incomplete Freund's adjuvant for the subsequent injections. Antisera against IgG fractions either from anti-H4 antibodies or from antibodies recognizing no histone (control) were obtained by immunizing mice biweekly by subcutaneous injections with 5 μg of IgG molecules emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant for the first injection or in incomplete Freund's adjuvant for subsequent injections. Antiserum was collected at regular intervals over a period of 20 weeks. Specific antibodies against H4 were isolated from anti-H4 antiserum by immunoaffinity on a nitrocellulose sheet according to the procedure described by Olmsted (30Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, chicken erythrocyte histones are resolved by preparative SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose sheet (31Thiriet C. Albert P. Electrophoresis. 1995; 18: 357-361Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The edge of the membrane was stained with Amido Black to localize histone H4 on the nitrocellulose sheet. After cutting out the band corresponding to H4, the nitrocellulose strip is saturated with 1% ovalbumin diluted in PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20). Then the strip was incubated with anti-H4 antiserum diluted 1:10 in PBS-T for 1 h under gentle agitation. Unbound components from the antiserum were removed by washing the nitrocellulose strip three times in PBS-T for 5 min each with gentle agitation. Specific H4-antibody complexes were then eluted by washing the strip in 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, three times for 5 min each at room temperature with gentle agitation. The three acid washes were combined, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7 by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9, and the solution was dialyzed overnight against PBS. Control serum was prepared from mice immunized with mouse IgG molecules depleted of any trace anti-histone immunoreactivity by exhaustive immunoaffinity on nitrocellulose sheets onto which all histone proteins had been adsorbed. This procedure was repeated three times, and then fractions were dialyzed overnight against PBS. Control and anti-H4 IgG fractions were then isolated by affinity chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B covalently linked with Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pharmacia). Protein A-antibody complexes were separated as described above, the IgG fractions were finally dialyzed overnight against PBS, and the absence of detectable amounts of histones was confirmed by Western blot. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (31Thiriet C. Albert P. Electrophoresis. 1995; 18: 357-361Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose sheets were blocked in (PBS-T) and 1% ovalbumin for 30 min at room temperature. The filters were then incubated with diluted primary antiserum for 1 h, washed three times for 5 min with PBS-T, and incubated for 1 h with diluted peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (Jackson, Interchim, France) or with peroxidase-coupled protein A. The membranes were finally washed thoroughly in PBS-T, and peroxidase was detected as described by Harlow and Lane (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). The same procedure was followed for the Dot Blot assay. For inhibition experiments, nonimmune serum, anti-H4 antiserum, or purified histones were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antiserum directed against anti-H4 IgG fractions. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used to immunoprobe histones resolved by SDS-PAGE. The reactivity of immune response was monitored by measurement of the optical density with a gel scan analyzer (Vilber Lourmat, France). Calf thymus and chicken erythrocyte linker histones were prepared as described previously (34Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed H1°a and the C-terminal deletion mutant of this protein containing residues 1–101 were prepared as described elsewhere (35Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11931-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified Tetrahymena H1 was a gift from Dr. David Allis, University of Rochester. H1 globular domain was prepared by treating 50 μg of total acid-extracted calf thymus H1 with 100 ng of trypsin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl for 45–60 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington) and used directly for SDS-PAGE. Our approach was to raise antibodies against purified anti-H4 antibodies and then to determine which chromatin proteins cross-react with this antiserum (Fig. 1). Thus, we required antigenically pure H4. To ensure the purity of our H4 preparation we first isolated this histone by chromatographic methods and detected the protein by Western blot of fractions resolved on SDS-PAGE with antiserum directed against all histone proteins (RAAHC, see “Materials and Methods”). We obtained a fraction that clearly yielded a single band corresponding to histone H4 (data not shown but see Fig. 2). We then immunized three mice with the highly purified H4 fraction and monitored the resulting immune response over an extremely long immunization period. The results obtained with one animal are shown in Fig. 2 Aand correspond to the intensity of the immune response 1 week after each vaccination with the antigenic mixture. We observed that the immune response remained specific to histone H4 throughout the immunization period, although insignificant responses against H3 were observed at the beginning of the series of immunizations with this animal. Moreover, from the 5th to the 10th and final vaccination, the intensity of the immune response against H4 did not increase, but the antisera remained specific to histone H4. It is clear from the Western blot presented in Fig. 2 B corresponding to the analysis of antiserum obtained after the 10th immunization that this antiserum is specific only to histone H4 when it is tested against all acid-extractable nuclear proteins. Thus, we have obtained even after a long immunization period specific antisera directed against histone H4, which is considered to be the least immunogenic chromosomal protein (17Bustin M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1979; 88: 105-142PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that our H4 preparation is highly antigenically pure and raises an immune response only against H4 protein within the mice. The antiserum produced against this preparation of H4 was selected as a source of anti-H4 antibodies for further studies and will be referred to as MAH4 antiserum. To easily determine whether the IgG fractions from anti-H4 antiserum were able to mimic any histone epitopes, we carried out the Dot Blot shown in Fig. 3. Different amounts of IgG fractions purified from MAH4 antiserum or mouse preimmune serum were deposited on a nitrocellulose sheet. The IgG fractions were then probed with RAAHC. Note that the use of the IgG fractions from two different species was required to ensure that secondary antibodies only will detect interactions between the IgG from MAH4 antiserum (mouse) and the RAAHC antiserum (rabbit) used as primary antibodies. We observed significant immunoreactions with the IgG fractions from MAH4 but not those prepared from preimmune serum. Clearly IgG molecules from anti-histone H4 antiserum are capable of mimicking histone epitopes. As a control we also determined that the anti-H4 IgG preparation exhibited no detectable immunoreaction against the co-injected RNA (results not shown). We wished to determine by immunochemical means which histone proteins contained the epitopes mimicked by the anti-H4 IgG fractions. To this end, we first purified the antibody fraction directed against H4 by nitrocellulose immunoaffinity fractionation of the antiserum as described previously by Olmsted (30Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified antibody fraction was then deposited on a protein A column, and the IgG fractions were purified from other anti-H4 antibodies. The purity of the IgG fractions was finally assessed with RAAHC antiserum. The results presented in Fig. 4 show that there is no evidence of any histone protein contaminating these purified anti-H4 IgG fractions. Interestingly, in this Western blot, we observe immunodetection of the heavy chains of the IgG fractions, even when the RAAHC antiserum was omitted (data not shown). It seems therefore that denaturation of mouse IgG molecules in SDS-polyacrylamide gel exposes common epitopes between mouse IgG and rabbit IgG molecules, which are not revealed when the IgG molecules are folded in their native state (compare the IgG from preimmune serum in Fig. 3 and the IgG lane in Fig. 4). The purified anti-H4 IgG fractions were then used as antigens to induce antibody production in mice. Three animals were immunized by a series of subcutaneous injections of 5 μg each of anti-H4 IgG molecules over a period of 5 months. After a series of immunizations one mouse failed to respond against histone, but the other two mice induced similar and satisfactory immune responses. As a control for any immune response against histones due to the IgG molecules themselves, several mice were immunized with mouse IgG molecules that had been exhaustively depleted of immunoreactivity against any of the histone proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). Sera from mice immunized with the purified anti-H4 IgG fractions were tested for immunoreactivity against all histone subtypes. Western blots of acid-extracted chromatin proteins were probed with antiserum from the two mice that developed antibodies against histones and from two control mice immunized with IgG fractions depleted of anti-H4 immunoreactivity. A time profile of the immunological response from the serum obtained from these mice is shown in Fig. 5. After one immunization with purified anti-H4 IgG an unusually rapid and very weak response was detected against histone H3 (Fig. 5). In contrast, after seven to eight immunizations with the purified anti-H4 IgG fractions, a much stronger and more typical response was detected against linker histones (Fig. 5). Moreover, the intensity of immune response against linker histones increased to much higher levels than the response against histone H3 (Fig. 5 B). No reactivity against either linker histone or H3 is detected with antisera raised against IgG molecules that were depleted of anti-histone immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, no such reactivity was observed after similar numbers of immunizations with purified H4 (Fig. 4) or with over 50 mice immunized with various histone antigens. 2C. Thiriet, unpublished results. To confirm that the specific immunoreactivity we detected was actually induced by the H4-complementary portions of the anti-H4 antibodies, we carried out inhibition assays. Increasing quantities of either control serum or anti-H4 antiserum (MAH4 antiserum) were added to the mouse antisera raised against the anti-H4 IgG fractions, and the effects on the immunoreactivity of the latter serum were determined. When increasing amounts of the control serum were added, there was no evidence of any inhibition of the immunoreactivity of the mouse antiserum raised against anti-H4 IgG to either immobilized linker histones (Fig. 6 A) or H3 (results not shown). In contrast, increasing quantities of MAH4 antiserum clearly inhibited the binding of anti-anti-H4 IgG fractions to these immobilized proteins. Moreover, Western blots of IgG fractions purified from anti-H4 antiserum and probed with antiserum from mice immunized with these antigens showed no evidence of any specific recognition of denatured IgG molecules and the antiserum (results not shown). This result strongly suggests that only native IgG purified from anti-H4 antibodies and not the IgG molecules themselves are able to induce immune responses against histones and that antibodies raised against anti-H4 IgG fractions are directed against the idiotopes of the anti-H4 antibodies. We thus conclude from these experiments that IgG fractions from anti-H4 antibodies induced the production of antibodies that are directed against linker histones, and that this effect is dependent upon the original H4 epitopes. We wished to further isolate the epitopes responsible for the observed specific immunoreation. Because of the atypical and weak profile of reactivity detected against H3, we chose to further characterize only the immunoreactivity detected against linker histone. A blot of H1s from calf thymus, bacterially expressed Xenopus H1°, and linker histones isolated from chicken erythrocytes andTetrahymena revealed strong reactivity against H1 subtypes (Fig. 7). Interestingly, much less relative response was detected against the H5 or H1° subtypes compared with H1s (Fig. 7; compare bands in lane 2 and lanes 1 versus 3). We also observed specific immunoreactivity against the TetrahymenaH1, a protein that does not have a protease-resistant globular domain (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 35Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11931-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that the common epitopes reside in the flexible N- or C-terminal tail domains. Indeed, we find the reactive epitopes are not present within a preparation containing only the protease-resistant globular domain of linker histones (Fig. 7,lane 5) or in a linker histone peptide lacking only the C-terminal tail domain (lane 6). The major conclusion of this study is that antibodies directed against histone H4 can serve as antigens to induce the production of antibodies directed against other histone proteins and that this method has identified specific protein-protein interactions that might occur within native chromatin (Figs. 5 and 6). We demonstrated that immunization of mice with purified IgG fractions from anti-H4 antibodies induced the production of antibodies against the antigen but, significantly, these antibodies also specifically recognized linker histones and, perhaps, to lesser extent histone H3. However, the kinetics of these two responses were quite different (Fig. 6), and it is unclear at this time why the response against H3 was so unexpectedly rapid and weak in nature, and why it did not increase with subsequent injections. Nonetheless, the response against linker histones followed a kinetic profile typical for an immunogenic reaction and yielded a much higher antibody titer. For these reasons we further characterized only the anti-linker histone immunoreactivity. Several lines of evidence suggest that the specific response observed is most likely due to antibodies produced specifically against anti-H4 IgG. First, immunization with IgG fractions depleted of anti-H4 immunoreactivity did not give rise to antisera that exhibit immunoreactivity against any histone proteins. Second, we found the response is specific, such that either linker histones or the purified anti-H4 IgG fraction can effectively inhibit the anti-linker histone reactivity of antisera raised against anti-H4 IgG. Finally, similar specific responses were obtained with two mice against only certain histone proteins and were not obtained with control mice immunized with control IgG fractions. Interestingly, the immunoreactivity is largely directed against the H1-type histones relative to the H5 or H1° subtypes (Fig. 6). Thus, anti-idiotypic reactivity is predominantly against the least-represented subtype of linker histone found in the erythrocyte cells from which the H4 was prepared, arguing against contamination of the H4 preparation by linker histone. Previous work has demonstrated that H1 exists in close proximity to the N-terminal tail of histone H4 within chromatin (36Banères J.-L. Essalouh L. Jariel-Encontre I. Mesnier D. Garrod S. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We detected cross-species H1 reactivity, suggesting the putative H4-H1 interaction is a general feature of H1-containing chromatin. We have demonstrated that the simultaneous recognition of IgG fractions from anti-H4 antibodies and the histone proteins occurs via the same immunoreactive entity. Thus both the IgG fractions and linker histones possessed elements of complementary structures with the anti-anti H4 antibodies (summarized in Fig. 1). Interestingly, the immunoreactive epitopes existed within the C-terminal tail domain of H1 (Fig. 7). We conclude that the C-terminal tail domain of H1s must possess surfaces or structures that are complementary with histone H4 and that possibly the H4 N-terminal tail domain specifically interacts with linker histonesin vivo. A recent model of the binding of linker histone to the nucleosome suggests that the globular domain of this protein is situated near a point where the H4 N-terminal tail cross-links to the DNA (37Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinge J. Hayes J.J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This would bring the H1 C-terminal domain into close proximity to the H4 tail. Alternatively, it is possible that H4 makes contact with linker histone internucleosomally, i.e. between neighboring nucleosomes, which are made when the chromatin fiber is compacted. Experiments to determine the availability of linker histone epitopes in extended and condensed chromatin fiber are presently underway. Further characterization of the epitopes which exhibit complementary structures with H4 can be made by employing peptides from identified proteins (21Hacques M.-F. Muller S. De Murcia G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Marion C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Preliminary results with the mouse antiserum raised against anti-H4 IgG used in the present work suggested that the epitopes within linker histone are located near the end of the C-terminal tail domain.2 It is interesting to note that antibodies induced by immunization with anti-histone antibodies possessed a high degree of specificity for histones. The use of monoclonal antibodies may also allow a finer determination of exactly what epitopes are complementary but the production of monoclonal antibodies against histones is somewhat problematic (39Turner B.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 24: 266-274PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mendelson E. Bustin M. Biochemistry. 1984; 17: 3459-3466Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Muller S. Jockers-Wretou E. Sekeris C.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Bautz F.A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Dousson S. Gorka C. Gilly C. Lawrence J.-J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Clearly, our approach does not detect all species interacting with the substrate in question. Within the histone octamer, H4 makes some contacts with histones H2B at the dimerization interface between the H4/H4 and H2A/H2B dimers (9Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). There are several possibilities for absence of reactivity of anti-anti-H4 with H2B. All regions of H4 are not immunogenic (4Muller S. Chaix M.L. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the anti-H4 IgG fraction may not contain antibodies specific for the region of H4 that interacts with H2B. It is possible that this surface within H4 may be somewhat masked within the H4·RNA complex used to raise the initial anti-H4 antisera. The conformation of H4 within the H4·RNA complex is probably very different from that when this protein is complexed with histone H3 (43Karantza V. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, the H2B-interacting surface of H4 may be more properly presented within the (H3/H4)2 complex. Experiments to test this possibility are underway. We have investigated whether the histones interacting with H4 could be detected by antibodies by using the strategy successfully applied to hormone/hormone receptor systems (reviewed in Ref. 24Strosberg A.D. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1983; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The novel immunological probes described in the present work demonstrate that the interactions between H4 and the linker histone are probably due to the recognition of complementary motifs found at the surface of these histones. Future applications of this approach could detect other interactions between histone proteins which may be relevant to contacts made between nucleosomes within the chromatin fiber as well as shed light on the poorly defined protein-protein interactions made by the many non-histone chromosomal proteins within chromatin.
