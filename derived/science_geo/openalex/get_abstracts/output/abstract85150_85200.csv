https://openalex.org/W1481123143,"A Ca2+-dependent protease I), which hydrolyzes casein at Ca2+ concentrations lower than the 10(-5) M range, is purified roughly 4000-fold from the soluble fraction of rat brain. This protease is able to activate Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) by limited proteolysis analogously to the previously known Ca2+-dependent analogously to the previously known Ca2+-dependent protease (Ca2+ protease II) which is active at the millimolar range of Ca2+ (Inoue, M., Kishimoto, A., Takai, Y., and Nishizuka, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7610-7616). The protein kinase fragment thus produced shows a molecular weight of about 5.1 X 10(4), and is significantly smaller than native protein kinase C (Mr = 7.7 X 10(4). Although protein kinase C may be normally activated in a reversible manner by the simultaneous presence of phospholipid and diacylglycerol at Ca2+ concentrations less than 10(-6) M, this enzyme fragment is fully active without any lipid fractions and independent of Ca2+. The limited proteolysis of protein kinase C is markedly enhanced in the velocity by the addition of phospholipid and diacylglycerol, which are both required for the reversible activation of the enzyme. However, casein hydrolysis by this protease is not affected by phospholipid and diacylglycerol. Available evidence suggests that, at lower concentrations of this divalent cation, Ca2+ protease I reacts preferentially with the active form of protein kinase C which is associated with membrane, and converts it to the permanently active form. In contrast, the inactive form of protein kinase C, which is free of membrane phospholipid, does not appear to be very susceptible to the proteolytic attack. It remains unknown, however, whether this mechanism of irreversible activation of protein kinase C does operate in physiological processes. It is noted that Ca2+ protease II, which is active at higher concentrations of Ca2+, proteolytically activates protein kinase C irrespective of the presence and absence of phospholipid and diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1485278468,"Islet activating protein (IAP), a toxin isolated from Bordetella pertussis, blocks the ability of inhibitory hormones to attenuate adenylate cyclase activity and enhances the ability of stimulatory hormones to activate the enzyme. The toxin appears to act by catalyzing the transfer of ADP ribose from NAD to a 41,000-dalton protein in target cell membranes. A protein purified from rabbit liver membranes, apparently composed of 41,000- and 35,000-dalton subunits, is shown to be a specific substrate for IAP. Cholera toxin does not ADP-ribosylate this protein. In contrast, the purified guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase (G/F), which is ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin, is not covalently modified by IAP. Equilibrium binding studies and photoaffinity labeling experiments demonstrate that the 41,000-dalton subunit of the IAP substrate has a specific binding site for guanine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1577793849,"The addition of thrombin to human platelets prelabeled with 32Pi led to significant loss of radioactivity in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate within 5 s, followed by recovery or even increase by 2 min. Loss of label from phosphatidylinositol phosphate was much less marked. Stimulated loss of label from phosphatidylinositol was not seen, while labeled phosphatidate increased severalfold. The principal labeled water-soluble phosphates observed, in addition to 32Pi and [32P] ATP, co-migrated with inositol diphosphate and inositol triphosphate. This suggests that a pool of polyphosphoinositides is constantly undergoing phosphodiesteratic cleavage and resynthesis. Thrombin addition led to rapid increase in radioactivity in inositol triphosphate, but not in inositol diphosphate. We conclude that this early consequence of the thrombin-platelet interaction is the result of an increase in the phosphodiesteratic cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1555536872,"Monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor antibodies were used as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of the role of the receptor molecule in the transduction of the biological effects mediated by EGF. The specificity of the antibodies was established by immunoprecipitation of the receptor from biosynthetically labeled cells. The previously described (Schreiber, A. B., Lax, I., Yarden, Y., Eshhar, Z., and Schlessinger, J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 78, 7535-7539) 2F2-IgM antibody binds to or close to the binding site of the growth factor on the receptor molecule; it induces receptor clustering and internalization and triggers early and delayed effects of EGF. A monovalent Fab fragment of the 2G2-IgM antibody stimulates the EGF-receptor sensitive protein kinase, but does not induce receptor clustering and DNA synthesis. When cell-bound 2G2-Fab fragments are cross-linked with anti-mouse Ig antibodies, both receptor clustering and mitogenic activity are restored. A second monoclonal antibody against EGF-receptor denoted TL5-IgG does not interfere with the binding of EGF to the receptor, fails to induce receptor clustering, and does not possess any intrinsic bioactivity. The cross-linking of cell-bound TL5-IgG with anti-mouse Ig antibodies leads to the stimulation of DNA synthesis. It is concluded that the EGF-receptor, when properly triggered, contains all the biochemical attributes necessary for the initiation of biological effects. Receptor clustering, even when mediated via domains distinct from the hormone binding site on the receptor molecule, appears as a necessary and sufficient signal for the induction of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489551586,"The nucleotide sequence of the promoter region and part of the coding region of the crystal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-1-Dipel has been determined by analysis of a recombinant plasmid from Escherichia coli. The start points for transcription of the gene in B. thuringiensis and in the E. coli strain carrying the recombinant plasmid were located by S1 nuclease mapping. Two adjacent start sites were identified using RNAs synthesized during sporulation of B. thuringiensis: transcription was initiated from one site early in sporulation and from the other site in the middle of sporulation. A good correlation was found between the appearance of the crystal protein gene-specific RNA and the production of the protein, indicating that the gene is primarily under transcriptional control during sporulation. Parallel studies with the recombinant strain of E. coli revealed the presence of only a single species of gene-specific RNA, regardless of the growth phase of the cells; the crystal protein was produced at all stages of growth. The sequence for eight amino acids at the NH2 terminus of the crystal protein was determined and the corresponding coding sequence was located in the DNA sequence. A potential ribosome binding site of 11 nucleotides was found, located three nucleotides upstream from the initiator ATG codon. The deduced sequence for the first 333 amino acids of the crystal protein is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1606959373,"The gene for Escherichia coli ribonuclease H has been studied by use of a plasmid which contains a segment of the E. coli chromosome. The genomic DNA was subcloned from pLC28-22 to pBR322 by use of various restriction enzymes. Such subcloning limited the RNase H gene to a piece of DNA no longer than 760 base pairs. Cells bearing plasmids containing the RNase H gene produce as much as 10-15 times the normal amount of RNase H without any drastic effect on maintenance of the plasmid or cell growth. DNA sequence analysis has permitted the prediction of a protein whose molecular weight is 17,559 (155 amino acid residues). The predicted sequence was confirmed by amino acid analysis, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and size determination of highly purified RNase H."
https://openalex.org/W1511715997,"Abstract CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase was located in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions from Chinese hamster ovary cells. The activity of the cytosolic form of the enzyme was greatly enhanced by incubation with sonicated preparations of several different lipids, although incubations with either phosphatidylcholine or 1,2-sn-diolein did not increase activity. The activation of the cytidylyltransferase in Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens occurred with a concomitant shift in the subcellular distribution of the enzyme from cytosolic to particulate fractions. This shift was rapid and did not require protein synthesis. Removal of phospholipase C from the cell cultures resulted in a return to basal levels of incorporation of [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine, a decrease in the activity of cytidylyltransferase, and a loss of the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. Similar experiments with LM cells, which are resistant to exogenous phospholipase C, showed no change in subcellular distribution of cytidylyltransferase, suggesting that the activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase required a change in membrane phospholipid composition. The results presented are discussed in terms of a mechanism of regulation of phosphatidylcholine production involving monitoring of membrane phospholipid composition."
https://openalex.org/W1533887373,"GTP-dependent light activation of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase in bovine rod disc membranes was quenched by ATP. ATP reduced both initial velocity (V0) and turn off time (toff) of phosphodiesterase activated by a flash that bleached 1.5 X 10(-5) of the rhodopsin present. In the absence of rhodopsin kinase, ATP had no effect on either V0 or toff of reconstituted preparations containing phosphodiesterase and GTP*-binding protein. Addition of partially purified rhodopsin kinase to such reconstitutions again permitted ATP to quench both initial velocity and turn off time. It is thus likely that kinase-mediated phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin reduces and arrests light-induced phosphodiesterase activation. Thermolysin cleavage of rhodopsin's COOH-terminal dodecapeptide eliminated ATP's effect on toff, but did not diminish its effect on V0. Thus, the effects of ATP and kinase on V0 may be mediated by sites proximal to and effects on toff by sites distal to the thermolysin cleavage point at rhodopsin's COOH-terminal end."
https://openalex.org/W1576533381,"Diacylglycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.-) was purified 1,650-fold from pig brain cytosol. The purified enzyme showed a single protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight of the kinase was estimated to be 78,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A similar value (76,000) was obtained by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration. The activity of the purified enzyme was markedly enhanced by either deoxycholate or phospholipids. The extent of activation by phospholipids was in the order of phosphatidylcholine greater than lysophosphatidylcholine greater than phosphatidylethanolamine approximately equal to phosphatidylserine greater than sphingomyelin. Other phospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids were ineffective. Phosphatidylcholines from egg yolk and pig brain, and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine were similarly effective. Saturated phosphatidylcholines with acyl chain lengths shorter than palmitate also gave a considerable activation. The activity with phosphatidylcholine was from 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than that measured with deoxycholate. A very small amount of phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylglycerol potently inhibited the phosphatidylcholine-dependent (but not deoxycholate-dependent) kinase activity. The inhibition by phosphatidylinositol was varied according to its molar ratio to phosphatidylcholine. As little as about 2.5 mol per cent of phosphatidylinositol resulted in 50% inhibition of the phosphatidylcholine-dependent kinase activity. The deoxycholate- and phosphatidylcholine-dependent kinase activities showed almost the same Km values for the substrates. In both cases, the apparent Km values for ATP and diacylglycerol were 300 microM and about 60 microM, respectively. The kinase required Mg2+ for its activity. When compared to deoxycholate, phosphatidylcholine was more effective at higher Mg2+ concentrations. The deoxycholate-dependent activity showed a broad pH optimum at around 8.0, whereas the phosphatidylcholine-dependent activity formed a clear peak at pH 7.4."
https://openalex.org/W1605514151,"Specific immunochemical techniques were used to quantitate the levels of eight isozymes of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) and epoxide hydrolase in liver microsomes of untreated rats and rats treated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, a mixture of these two compounds, nine individual polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) congeners, and a commercial mixture of PBBs. Levels of two 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible P-450s (designated P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G) varied over two orders of magnitude and were highly correlated. The levels of four phenobarbital-inducible P-450s (designated P-450PB-B, P-450PB-C, P-450PB-D, and P-450PB/PCN-E) were all correlated to each other. The level of one form, P-450UT-A, which was present at substantial levels in untreated rats, was inversely correlated to the levels of P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G. Among the PBB congeners which were examined, the presence of bromine at carbons o to the biphenyl bridge favored the induction of P-450PB-B, P-450PB-C, P-450PG-D, and P-450PB/PCN-E but did not necessarily eliminate the ability to induce P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF-ISF-G. PBB congeners with 2,2'-dibromo substitution induced P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G if one of the biphenyl rings contained bromines at positions 2,3, and 4. The induction of P-450UT-F was found to occur to a small extent with three of the compounds and is not readily explained in terms of structure-activity relationships. Although correlations were found among levels of some of the forms of P-450, several important exceptions were noted in relative levels of the individual enzymes. While the correlative data are useful in predicting induction patterns, all eight forms of P-450 appear to be independently regulated to some extent."
https://openalex.org/W1574893341,"The oxidative metabolism of hydralazine, isoniazid, iproniazid, and phenylhydrazine has been studied using spin-trapping techniques. The oxidation of these hydrazine derivatives, catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase and prostaglandin synthetase, produces reactive free radical intermediates. Enzymatic activation of hydralazine produce the nitrogen-centered hydralazyl radical (RNHNH); phenylhydrazine formed only the phenyl radical. Iproniazid, on the other hand, formed both the isopropyl radical and a hydroperoxy radical. The formation of the hydroperoxy radical was not inhibited by superoxide dismutase. The horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of isoniazid produced two different carbon-centered radicals. The identity of these radicals is not clear; however, they may arise from an acyl (RCO) radical and an alkyl (R) radical."

https://openalex.org/W1550328350,"Isolated microsomes catalyze an NADPH-dependent oxidation of typical hydroxyl radical scavenging agents. To determine which microsomal components participate in the oxidation of the scavengers, experiments were carried out with purified NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 isolated from phenobarbital-treated rats. The production of ethylene from 4-ketothiomethylbutyrate or of formaldehyde from either dimethyl sulfoxide or tertiary butyl alcohol was measured in the presence of NADPH plus reductase or NADPH plus reductase plus cytochrome P-450. The reductase-dependent system itself catalyzed the oxidation of the three scavengers. Addition of cytochrome P-450 had no effect on the rates of oxidation of the scavengers. Relative rates of oxidation of the scavengers reflected the amount of the reductase in the assay system. Varying the amount of cytochrome P-450 at a fixed concentration of the reductase did not result in rates different from that observed in the absence of cytochrome P-450. Dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine appeared to have a stimulatory role in these oxidations, whereas cytochrome P-450 reductase and NADPH were obligatory components. The reductase-dependent oxidation of the scavengers was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and competing hydroxyl radical scavenging agents suggesting that superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and an oxygen radical with the oxidizing power of the hydroxyl radical played a role in these oxidations. Further, these oxidations were inhibited by the iron-chelator desferrioxamine but stimulated by either EDTA or by iron. These results suggest that an iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction might be involved in the mechanism by which purified cytochrome P-450 reductase mediates the oxidation of typical hydroxyl radical scavengers. The results demonstrated that NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase may represent an important locus of oxygen activation leading to the production of a highly oxidizing species characteristic of the hydroxyl radical."
https://openalex.org/W1481406139,"A partially purified pig heart phosphoprotein phosphatase was dissociated into three distinct components, namely alpha, beta, and gamma, by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex in the presence of 6 M urea. Although alpha itself had phosphatase activities toward P-H2B histone, P-H1 histone, phosphorylase a, and glycogen synthase b, beta and gamma had no activity toward these substrates even in the presence of 1 mM Mn2+. The beta component (Mr = 80,000) combined with alpha (Mr = 31,000) in the absence of urea to produce Form 2 (Mr = 123,000) with concomitant increase in P-H1 histone phosphatase activity and Mg2+ requirement for P-H2B histone phosphatase activity (Imazu, M., Imaoka, T., Usui, H., Kinohara, N., and Takeda, M. (1981) J. Biochem. 90, 851-862). The gamma component (Mr = 62,000) reassociated with Form 2 to produce Form 1 (Mr = 199,000) which was similar to the original phosphoprotein phosphatase in substrate specificity and Mg2+ requirement. Binding of gamma to Form 2 strongly suppressed the phosphatase activities toward phosphorylase a and glycogen synthase b with marginal effects on the other phosphatase activities and Mg2+ requirement. However, gamma alone could not associate with alpha. The gamma component was sensitive to treatment with heat (60 degrees C for 2 min) or trypsin and was resistant to treatment with DNase or RNase. The pig heart phosphoprotein phosphatase was further purified to near homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis revealed that the purified enzyme (Mr = 171,000) was composed of three polypeptide components, namely alpha', beta', and gamma' with molecular weights of 34,000, 69,000, and 56,000, respectively. The component stoichiometry was determined to be alpha' 1 beta' 1 gamma' 1 by densitometric tracing of the Coomassie blue-stained bands on the acrylamide gel. After dissociation of alpha ' and other components by gel filtration of the purified enzyme on Sephacryl S-200 in the presence of 6 M urea, one alpha ' combined with one beta' to produce Form 2' of Mr = 106,000. Since Form 1 and the purified enzyme as well as Form 2 and Form 2' had similar catalytic properties and s20,w values, respectively, component compositions are suggested to be alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 for Form 1 and alpha 1 beta 1 for Form Form 2."
https://openalex.org/W1581909083,"The activity and subcellular distribution of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in LM and Chinese hamster ovary cells in which the phospholipid composition had been altered by supplementary feeding with choline analogues were examined. Decreased levels of cellular phosphatidylcholine with corresponding increased levels of either phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, or phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine resulted in increased CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity in cell homogenates. In addition, a significantly larger fraction of the total cytidylyltransferase activity was membrane-bound in these cells. The activity of the cytidylyltransferase from cytosolic extracts of both cell types was found to be greatly increased when assayed in the presence of either phosphatidylmonomethyl ethanolamine or phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine. The lysophosphatide forms of these lipids were found to be poor activators of the cytidylyltransferase. These findings suggest that the regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis is at least partially dependent on information transfer from membranes to CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. That is, in the presence of phosphatidylcholine-deficient membranes of cytidylyltransferase becomes activated and associated with the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1521015756,"Addition of phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens to cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulted in rapid degradation of cellular phosphatidylcholine with concomitant release of phosphocholine. The rate of incorporation of radiolabeled choline into lipids was increased 2-fold in phospholipase C-treated CHO cells as compared to untreated controls. The only enzyme in the pathway of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis with increased activity in phospholipase C-treated cells was CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, indicating that the cytidylyltransferase plays an important role in the stimulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The phospholipase treatment was toxic to a CHO mutant cell line with abnormally low cytidylyltransferase activity. Mouse LM fibroblasts were resistant to enzymatic attack by phospholipase C, and cytidylyltransferase activity in LM cells did not change upon phospholipase C treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1492499939,"Chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase hysteresis in response to modifiers was uncovered by carrying out the enzyme assays in two consecutive steps. The activity of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, assayed at low concentrations of both fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and Mg2+, was enhanced by preincubating the enzyme with dithiothreitol, thioredoxin f, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and Ca2+. In the time-dependent activation process, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and Ca2+ could be replaced by other sugar biphosphates and Mn2+, respectively. Once activated, chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase hydrolyzed fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Fe2+. The A0.5 for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (activator) was lowered by reduced thioredoxin f and remained unchanged when Mg2+ was varied during the assay of activity. On the contrary, the S0.5 for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (substrate) was unaffected by reduced thioredoxin f and depended on the concentration of Mg2+. Ca2+ played a dual role on the activity of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; it was a component of the concerted activation and an inhibitor in the catalytic step. Provided dithiothreitol was present, the activating effectors were not required to maintain the enzyme in the active form. Considered together these results strongly suggest that the regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in chloroplast occurs at two different levels, the activation of the enzyme and the catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1494415844,"The inhibition of hepatocyte 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase by glucagon was suppressed by insulin when the enzyme was measured in crude extracts. However, no effect of either hormone was observed after the removal of allosteric effectors from the enzyme, suggesting that the alterations in activity may be due to changes in the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of the enzyme. Insulin opposed the action of both glucagon and exogenous cyclic AMP to lower fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. The concentration of glucagon and of cyclic AMP that gave a half-maximal decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels was increased in the presence of 10 nM insulin from 0.03 to 0.09 nM and from 12 to 36 microM, respectively. Insulin also counteracted the effect of maximal concentrations of epinephrine on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. In the presence of 0.02 nM glucagon or 10 microM epinephrine, 10 nM insulin enhanced 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and decreased fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity in (NH4)2SO4-treated hepatocyte extracts. The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase was shown to be a substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase but not for phosphorylase kinase. It was concluded that insulin opposed the action of glucagon and epinephrine by affecting the phosphorylation state of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels were decreased in liver cells from diabetic rats. Addition of 30 mM glucose elevated fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels in cells from fed and 24-h-starved rats but not in cells from diabetic rats. This was probably due to decreases in both 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and glucokinase activity in the diabetic state. These results show that insulin has both short and long term effects on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate metabolism in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1906199389,"E-5-(2-Bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BrvdUrd) produced a dose-dependent shift in the density of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA at concentrations which yielded potent inhibition of virus replication in cultured Vero cells. Although the density of cellular DNA was not altered by these concentrations of BrvdUrd, incorporation of this analogue into cellular DNA of HSV-1-infected cells has been previously observed in this laboratory. The degree of inhibition correlated with the amount of BrvdUrd substituted for thymidine in HSV-1 DNA. BrvdUrd-substituted DNA was more labile as determined by a dose-dependent increase in single strand breaks when examined by centrifugation in alkaline sucrose gradients. Thus, the potent antiviral action of BrvdUrd observed in cell culture correlates not only with its incorporation into HSV-1 DNA but also with an altered stability of this DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2113575354,"A recently developed photometric version of polyelectrolyte titration was applied for the determination of the number of charged residues on globular proteins. Based on the observation that oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form, in general, stoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes, the protein solutions were incubated in excess with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte, and the residual amount was back-titrated using o-toluidine blue for end point detection. It was found that within the range pH 2 to pH 9 the interaction of the polyelectrolytes, potassium polyvinylsulfate, polydiallylammonium chloride, and N-methylglycolchitosan iodide, with various proteins of known amino acid composition (ribonuclease A, trypsin, chymotrypsin A, pepsin, cytochrome c) occurs stoichiometrically through 1:1 ion pair interaction, irrespective of the spatial distribution of the interacting ionic sites. The close correspondence between the experimental data for the net charge and the calculated balance of ionized residues for the proteins at a given pH indicates that in the native structure of these proteins oppositely charged ionic functions are largely neutralized by the formation of intramolecular salt linkages. It is concluded that polyelectrolyte titration offers an easy access to the determination of the surface charge of proteins and other biopolymers. The data further support the notion of the importance of electrostatic cooperative interactions in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1563060027,"We have separately coupled a modified thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) molecule to two diphtheria toxin-related polypeptides, CRM26 and CRM45. Both polypeptides are enzymatically active but only CRM45 contains the hydrophobic domain of the toxin molecule. The TRH-CRM45 conjugate caused a 50% inhibition of protein synthesis in GH3 rat pituitary cells at 3 X 10(-9) M. CRM45 alone was 200 to 500 times less toxic than the conjugate. Intoxication by TRH-CRM45 was prevented by excess TRH, preincubation with diphtheria antitoxin, or reduction of the disulfide cross-link. In addition, TRH-CRM45 was no more toxic than CRM45 itself to 3T3 cells which lack TRH receptors. In contrast, TRH-CRM26, although it retained enzymatic activity, was nontoxic for GH3 cells even at 10(-7) M. Binding experiments showed that both conjugates compete for TRH receptors with comparable affinities. The potential role of the hydrophobic domain in toxin entry is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1569894114,"The pH gradient and membrane potential of submitochondrial particles from bovine heart were estimated by the uptake of [14C]ethylamine and [36Cl]perchlorate, using filtration through a glass fiber prefilter and Millipore filter without washing to separate the vesicles from the medium. An external volume probe of [3H] sucrose was also used. Internal volume of the vesicles was measured by the extent of uptake of glucose, which equilibrates slowly across the membrane. The electrochemical potential gradient of H+ (delta micro H+) calculated from uptake of ethylamine and perchlorate, assuming the ions taken up were free in solution inside the vesicles, was 23 to 24 kJ/mol of H+ (240-250 mV) during respiration in the absence of ATP. The ratio of the free energy of ATP synthesis (delta GATP) to delta micro H+ was 2.2 to 2.3 during oxidative phosphorylation and only slightly higher during ATP hydrolysis indicating that the H+-translocating ATPase is close to equilibrium under both conditions. The nonintegral ratio suggests there is a systematic error in the measurement of delta micro H+. The value of delta micro H+ calculated from ion uptake could be too high if some of the ions taken up are bound to the membrane or concentrated into the electric double layer at the inner membrane-water interface. The effects of vesicle volume (varied osmotically) and permeant ions (which affect internal ionic strength and pH) on the ratio of delta GATP to delta micro H+ suggested that ion association with the membrane in fact caused significant overestimation of delta micro H+. Association of ethylammonium and perchlorate ions with unenergized submitochondrial particles was measured by centrifugation, in the presence of a high concentration of impermeant salt to minimize association with the external surface. The results were used to estimate the extent of binding during the ion uptake assays, and delta micro H+ was recalculated taking this binding into account. The resulting values were between 19 and 20 kJ/mol of H+ (197-207 mV) during respiration in the absence of ADP, and the ratio of delta GATP to delta micro H+ was about 3 during oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1560020187,"The DNA polymerases and thymidine kinases induced by three drug-resistant mutants of herpes simplex virus type 1 (S1, Tr7, and B3) and their common parent strain, SC16, have been purified and their properties compared. No significant differences were seen in the affinities of the polymerases for TTP and dGTP, or for the triphosphates of 9-(2-hydroxyethyloxymethyl)guanine (acyclovir) or (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVdU) (drugs used in their isolation). In contrast all three mutants induced abnormal thymidine kinases. Those induced by the acyclovir-resistant mutants, S1 and Tr7, showed reduced affinities for thymidine, acyclovir, and also BVdU. Thymidine kinase induced by the BVdU-resistant mutant B3 showed reduced affinity for BVdU, but its affinities for thymidine and acyclovir were similar to those of the wild type enzyme. Thus, it appears that these variants of herpes simplex virus express altered thymidine kinases with impaired ability to phosphorylate particular nucleoside analogue drugs and these characteristics probably account for the drug resistance of the viruses. This strategy for resistance is important as it may result in variants with undiminished pathogenicity."

Radiation inactivation of the binding of radiolabeled derivatives of the toxins was consistent with Mr = 260,000 for the tetrodotoxin receptor and Mr = 266,000 for the receptor specific for two scorpion toxins, toxin II from Centruroides suffusus suffusus and toxin gamma from Tityus serrulatus serrulatus. Covalent cross-linking of the latter to its receptor similarly indicated Mr = 270,000. It seems most likely that these two distinct receptors reside on the same molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1486782364,"We have isolated the yeast HSP90 gene which encodes the Mr = 90,000 heat shock-inducible protein of this organism. When this gene is introduced into yeast on a multicopy plasmid vector, a dramatic increase is observed in the level of synthesis of the Mr = 90,000 heat shock-inducible protein. This protein overproduction is due to expression of the plasmid-borne HSP90 gene, which is under the same heat shock regulation as its chromosomal counterpart. The presence of an increased dosage of the HSP90 gene has no effect on the synthesis of the other major heat shock-inducible proteins and does not alter the heat shock-associated phenotype of thermal tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1605904469,"The uptake of tritium-labeled [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin ([3H]DADLE) by mouse neuroblastoma cells (N4TG1) was investigated under conditions which are optimal for ligand-induced receptor loss (down regulation). Uptake of [3H]DADLE was a receptor-mediated process, since it was inhibited by opiate receptor ligands and the (i) time course, (ii) dose-response curve, and (iii) temperature dependence of uptake were similar to those for enkephalin-receptor down regulation. Cells in suspension showed less uptake than those in monolayer culture and both uptake and down regulation were decreased by the inhibitors of metabolic energy production, sodium azide, and 2,4-dinitrophenol. Comparison of the effects of these metabolic inhibitors on the processes of receptor loss and ligand uptake showed that these cells accumulate [3H]DADLE in excess of their surface receptor number, suggesting that receptor recycling normally occurs under the conditions studied. The lysosomotrophic amines, chloroquine and methylamine, inhibited dissociation of cell-associated [3H]DADLE but did not affect down regulation. The data are consistent with the idea that enkephalin is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The possible fate of the down-regulated receptors is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1535889139,"alpha-Galactosidase (alpha-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.22), an enzyme responsible for mobilizing the raffinose family of oligosaccharides in legume seeds, has been isolated from lentils (Lens culinaris) and purified about 4,000-fold. The Sephadex gel filtration profile showed the presence of two forms of the enzyme, alpha-galactosidase I with an apparent Mr = 160,000 and alpha-galactosidase II of Mr = 40,000. Enzyme II readily aggregates to form I when any attempt is made to concentrate the solution. Thus, only enzyme I was purified and its properties studied. The multistep purification procedure included affinity binding of the enzyme to concanavalin A-Sepharose, indicating its glycoprotein nature with glucose/mannose termini of the carbohydrate moieties. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions of the native enzyme and that of the glycopeptide obtained from pronase-digested, denatured enzyme have been determined. Asparagine seems to be involved in forming the linkage with the carbohydrate moiety. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of enzyme I shows a single protein band with Mr = 40,000 which also stains with periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Thus, the enzyme consists of four identical glycoprotein subunits. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is 8.0. The pH optima of enzyme I and II are 6.1 and 4.7, respectively. The substrate specificity and the mode of substrate inhibition of enzyme I is discussed. The effect of temperature on Vmax and Km of the enzyme is presented; at pH 6.1 the energy of activation is 62.1 kJ/mol and the delta H value is -34.3 kJ/mol in the temperature range 20-50 degrees C. Preliminary studies show that enzyme I possesses hemagglutinating properties with glucose/mannose specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1489494746,"The effects of distal glutamine (E7) replacement in elephant myoglobin were studied by comparing the temperature-dependent nitrosyl electron spin resonance spectra, redox potentials, and the acid-alkaline equilibria of elephant and human myoglobins. For myoglobins containing a distal histidine, the nitrosyl ESR spectra do not exhibit superhyperfine splitting until near liquid helium temperatures (Yoshimura, T., Ozaki, T., Shintani, Y., and Watanabe, H. (1979) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 193, 301-313). Studies presented here show that the ESR spectra of nitrosyl elephant myoglobin exhibit 9-line superhyperfine splitting well above liquid nitrogen temperatures, similar to the temperature profiles of isolated heme complexes (Morse, R.H. (1980) Fed. Proc. 39, 2006). It is concluded that the shift in the spectral equilibrium to higher temperature indicates a diminished interaction between NO and the distal position in elephant myoglobin. In addition, the redox potential of elephant myoglobin was found to be nearly 100 mV greater than that of human myoglobin, and the pKa of the acid-alkaline equilibrium (oxidized myoglobin) was 8.5, being 0.4 unit less than that of other vertebrate myoglobins. These different reactivities between elephant and human myoglobins are discussed based on the nature of charge interactions between polar ligands and distal glutamine and histidine."
https://openalex.org/W1501224989,"Protein phosphatase type 1 and type 2 activities (designated PP-1 and PP-2, respectively) from rabbit reticulocyte lysates have been identified and characterized based on criteria previously established for similar activities in rabbit skeletal muscle and rabbit liver. These include (a) chromatographic separation on DEAE-cellulose, (b) substrate specificity toward glycogen phosphorylase a and the alpha- and beta-subunits of phosphorylase kinase, (c) differential sensitivity to the heat-stable protein phosphatase inhibitors-1 and -2, and (d) sensitivity to MgATP. When total lysate phosphatases are assayed in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2, protein phosphatase type 2 represents 84% of lysate phosphorylase phosphatase activity. However, when phosphatase assays are carried out with MgATP concentrations similar to those in the lysate, type 2 activity is diminished, and the levels of type 1 (41%) and type 2 (59%) phosphatase activities are comparable. A small proportion (6%) of total lysate phosphatase is tightly bound to the ribosomes, where type 1 phosphatase predominates. At least five species of protein phosphatases can be identified in lysates. These constitute two forms of protein phosphatase type 1, one of which (designated FC) is dependent on MgATP and a lysate activator protein FA; both FC and FA have been identified previously in skeletal muscle. Three species of protein phosphatase type 2 have been identified and designated PP-2B, PP-2A1, and PP-2A2 based on criteria recently established for rabbit skeletal muscle and rabbit liver phosphatases, which display similar phosphatase profiles. Lysate protein phosphatases types 1, FC, 2A1, and 2A2 can all act on phosphorylase a and the alpha- (type 2) or beta-(type 1) subunit of phosphorylase kinase. PP-2B, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, specifically dephosphorylates the alpha-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, but does not act on phosphorylase alpha. The heat-stable protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 from skeletal muscle completely blocks the activity of the two type 1 phosphatases (PP-1, FC), but has no effect on the three species of type 2 protein phosphatase. A preliminary assay of the two heat-stable phosphatase inhibitors in lysates indicates significant levels of inhibitor-2, but little or no detectable inhibitor-1."

Yeast topoisomerase I will remove both positive and negative turns in DNA supercoils in the absence of ATP and magnesium ion. The products of the catenating activity of the enzyme were examined on agarose gels and in the electron microscope. These analyses indicate that yeast topoisomerase I will generate large catenated DNA networks which appear to rearrange to multimeric linear structures upon long incubation time."

Although the relatively lower specific activity of the pathway compared with that in the avian liver preparation previously described (Rowe, P. B., McCairns, E., Madsen, G., Sauer, D., and Elliott, H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7711-7721) limited the extent of purification, a number of properties were established: (i) Ammonia could be utilized as readily as glutamine for the synthesis of phosphoribosylamine but only glutamine provided N-3 of the purine ring; (ii) in the presence of either GTP or NAD, AMP or GMP were synthesized; (iii) purine synthesis was inhibited at the level of phosphoribosylamine synthesis by both AMP and GMP, irrespective of whether ammonia or glutamine was the N donor; (iv) while the synthesis of AMP and GMP from IMP was self-regulated, GTP also appeared to be an inhibitor of the synthesis of GMP from IMP; (v) amidophosphoribosyltransferase was isolated from both transformed and nontransformed cells in a low molecular weight form which was converted to a high molecular weight form in the presence of GMP; and (vi) no evidence was obtained for the existence of a classical multienzyme complex for purine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1568181612,"Increasing concentrations of glucose (1-5%) in the growth medium depressed ubiquinone-6 biosynthesis in continuously cultured wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, an early intermediate in the pathway of ubiquinone-6 biosynthesis, i.e. 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate (3,4-DHHB), was found to accumulate. The increase in 3,4-DHHB levels varied inversely with the diminished levels of ubiquinone-6, suggesting that O-methylation of 3,4-DHHB is a regulated step in catabolite repression. Experiments using protoplasts demonstrated that the effect of catabolite repression on this pathway was reversible by 1.2 mM cAMP but not by other nucleotides and cyclic nucleotides. This response to cAMP was unaltered by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that the regulatory control for this reaction must occur at the enzymatic level. Additional experiments demonstrated the presence of a heat-labile component of the cytoplasm, which was essential for this effect of cAMP. This observation suggests that this cytosolic effector may be translocated to the inner membrane of the mitochondria, the intracellular site for ubiquinone-6 biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1556742955,"Chick embryo skin fibroblasts and vertebral chondroblasts were infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus, LA24A, and were grown at permissive (36 degrees C) and nonpermissive (41 degrees C) temperatures. During exponential growth, infected and parallel uninfected cultures were labeled with D-[3H]glucosamine, and newly synthesized glycosaminoglycans were identified by anion exchange chromatography and by selective enzymatic and chemical degradations. Control fibroblasts synthesized low levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), and dermatan sulfate (DS), moderate levels of heparan sulfate (HS), and high levels of chondroitin sulfate (CS). In contrast, control chondroblasts synthesized very low levels of HA and DS, no HS, and very high levels of CS. Following transformation and growth at 36 degrees C, both cell types showed a dramatic increase in HA synthesis and a significant decrease in CS synthesis. In addition, transformed chondroblasts initiated the synthesis of HS and increased their synthesis of DS to levels that matched those of transformed fibroblasts. The CS chains synthesized by control chondroblasts were partially undersulfated, while those synthesized by both normal and transformed fibroblasts were fully sulfated. Upon transformation, chondroblasts grown at 36 degrees C initiated the synthesis of fully sulfated CS chains. Most of the above biosynthetic alterations were completely reversed when infected cells were grown at 41 degrees C, indicating that they were dependent on the transforming gene product of LA24A. Clearly, the profound differences that distinguish normal fibroblasts from normal chondroblasts are lost upon transformation, and these two types of terminally differentiated cells converge toward a common, though not identical, biosynthetic program for glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1563157727,"Proton nmr studies of the hyperfine resonances of cytochrome c peroxidase reveal that two pH-dependent processes can be monitored. One of these is the simple pH titration of a resonance which has been previously assigned to the alpha-vinyl proton at heme position 4. Combined with this proton's temperature dependence, the pH data indicate that the rotational position of vinyl 4 is changing with a pK which is similar to that which regulates the enzyme's activity. The second process, slow on the nmr time scale, occurs above pH 8. This is beyond what is normally considered to be the optimum pH range for cytochrome c peroxidase's activity and we interpret this to indicate a protein conformational change."

The pH-dependent characteristics of the spectra have been analyzed in terms of two pK values at approximately 6 and approximately 8, the latter of which appears to correspond to the previously observed transition between an acidic species and a neutral species for this class of proteins. Previously determined rate constants (J. T. Jackson, G. N. La Mar, R. G. Bartsch, and M. A. Cusanovich, manuscript in preparation) permit, for the first time, connection between the downfield hyperfine shifted resonances of the two forms by spectral simulation. Contrary to previous suggestions (Emptage, M. H., Xavier, A. V., Wood, J.M., Alsaadi, B. M., Moore, G. R., Pitt, R. C., Williams, R. J. P., Ambler, R. P., and Bartsch, R. G.

Soc. 103, 4405-4410), the data indicate that no additional ligand is involved in the transition but that the bonding between the iron and the axial histidyl ligand is severely altered. It is shown that this is consistent with extensive imidazolate character for the axial ligand in the neutral form."

From complementation measurements in vitro and from earlier genetic evidence, these workers suggested that the product of gene 60 (p60) was also a component of the DNA topoisomerase complex. This paper now establishes the identity of p60 and unequivocally shows that this protein is a component of the enzyme complex. T4 DNA topoisomerase was purified by a simplified two-column procedure and found to be a stable complex of p39, p52, and a protein with a relative molecular weight of 18,000. The 18,000-dalton chain has been unambiguously shown to be the product of gene 60 through the use of an amber mutant of gene 60 with Sup+ and Sup- hosts and analyses by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. While p39 and p52 were tightly associated in the wild type enzyme complex, they were readily separated on a hydroxylapatite column from extracts of cells infected by an amber mutant of gene 60. These findings suggest that p60 plays a structural/functional role in the enzyme complex by holding the larger p39 and p52 in juxtaposition."
https://openalex.org/W1580955334,"A rat liver DNA genomic library was prepared using the lambda phage cloning vector Charon 28. Recombinant phage were screened with a cDNA clone (pOR-7) containing sequences complementary to mRNA coding for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase. This cDNA clone contains the poly(A) addition site and 60% of the mRNA sequence (Gonzalez, F. J., and Kasper, C. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5962-5968). Four positive phage were identifed and plaque-purified, and their DNA was isolated and subjected to restriction endonuclease mapping. All phage DNA inserts, which ranged from 11 to 16 kilobases, contained several overlapping restriction fragments. The clone with the largest insert (lambda OR-2) was found to contain restriction fragments identical with those of rat DNA when both were subjected to Southern blotting with nick-translated pOR-7 DNA; this finding established the presence in lambda OR-2 of the 3' end (poly(A) addition site) of the oxidoreductase gene. When [32P]cDNA synthesized from enriched oxidoreductase poly(A) RNA was utilized as a probe, additional fragments were identified. The fragment most distal to the 3'-specific fragment was assumed to contain the 5' cap site and was subcloned into pBR322 for further analysis. Restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis further localized the 5' end of the gene to an AvaII fragment of 540 base pairs (bp). Hybridization of this fragment with oxidoreductase mRNA-enriched poly(A) RNA resulted in the arrest of translation of oxidoreductase; this confirmed that it contained an exon region of the oxidoreductase gene. S1 nuclease mapping and DNA sequencing identified to within +/- 1 bp the 5' cap site of the gene which corresponds to an A start. DNA sequencing of the 5'p flanking region revealed no TATA box in the vicinity of -25 to -30 bp of the cap site. R-loop analysis of lambda OR-2 revealed the presence of a minimum of seven introns in the 6000-bp oxidoreductase gene and eight exons with a total length of approximately 2600 bp."

https://openalex.org/W1534813403,"hemoglobins have been prepared which are substituted with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or pyridoxal 5'-deoxymethylenephosphonate at both NH2-terminal amino groups of either the alpha or the beta chains. 31P NMR titration curves of the 5' side chain show a substantial decrease in acid strength in hemoglobins pyridoxylated at the alpha chains and the reverse effect in the hemoglobins labeled in the beta chains. These changes can readily be explained by the interaction of the 5' side chains with surrounding residues which provide specific binding sites for the monoanion at the alpha chain termini and for the dianion in the case of the beta chains. Since the proportion of monoanion is at lest ten times greater for pyridoxal 5'-deoxymethylenephosphonate than for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at neutral pH, the phosphonate reacts preferentially with the alpha chain NH2-terminal amino groups and the phosphate with the beta chain ones."

Experiments with mastocytoma cells showed that a hydrogen is stereospecifically eliminated from C-10 during the conversion of eicosapentaenoic acid to leukotriene C5. The hydrogen lost has the pro-S (D) configuration. 5-Hydroxy-6,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid, formed in the same experiments, was enriched in tritium when the (10D), but not when the (10L), isomer of labeled eicosapentaenoic acid was used. This indicates that oxygenation of the acid at C-5 occurred before the elimination of hydrogen and suggests that removal of the pro-S hydrogen at C-10 in 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid initiates its transformation to trans-5(S),6(S)-oxido-7,9-trans-11,14,17-cis-eicosapentaenoic acid (leukotriene A5)."
https://openalex.org/W1508673049,"Snail ganglia possess an anion-sensitive adenylate cyclase. This enzyme was stimulated 100% by chloride in a strictly GTP-dependent manner. The apparent affinity of chloride for adenylate cyclase was 2 X 10(-4) M. Halogens were found to be the most active anions. Some inorganic anions such as SO4(2-) and H2PO4- were inactive, as were all the organic anions tested. Stimulation was not cumulative for any maximal concentration of the active anions except fluoride. Chloride potentiated the effect of fluoride, indicating that the anion effect is not fluoride-like. Another striking result is that chloride enhanced adenylate cyclase sensitivity to the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. The absence of chloride stimulation when Mg2+ was replaced by Mn2+ further indicates a role of the GTP-binding protein (the G/F unit). Chloride could reversibly stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity already maximally stimulated by guanyl 5'-imidodiphosphate. We therefore suggest that, in snail ganglia, chloride raises the activity of the G/F unit-catalytic unit complex at some stage after its formation. The same specific anion-sensitive adenylate cyclase was also found in some of the rat tissues tested."

Five major products ranging between 60 and 150 nucleotides were characterized by hybridization. Three of them originate from the vector pBR322 and two from the yeast DNA insert. Based on a RNA primer extension reaction with recombinant M13 DNAs as template, a method allowing the mapping of the short abortive RNA products has been developed. An initiation site within the yeast DNA insert has thus precisely been mapped. The DNA sequence in this region was determined and showed several relevant features. The in vitro initiation site is preceded by a potential TATATATA box at -40 base pairs and at -105 by the sequence GTTAATCT similar to the consensus sequence GCTCAATCT usually found around 80 base pairs upstream from the cap site. Large blocks of alternated purine pyrimidine residues are found in this region as for several known yeast promotors. The 5' end of the RNA initiated from this site contains several potential signals for the initiation of translation. The possibility that a B to Z transition of DNA could be important for the interaction of the RNA polymerase with its template is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1487646074,"Exposure of rat prostatic tissues to isoproterenol resulted in rapid desensitization of their catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase which was associated with reduction of available beta-adrenoceptors and a loss of guanine nucleotide-mediated regulation of agonist binding to these receptors. The effect of isoproterenol treatment on responsiveness of the adenylate cyclase was prevented by acetylcholine, high potassium ion, or the calcium ionophore A23187. Preservation of responsiveness was not accompanied by maintenance of available beta-adrenoceptors or maintenance of guanine nucleotide regulation of agonist bindings. These results suggest that the lesion of the guanine nucleotide regulating components coupled to the catalytic moiety of the enzyme complex is a crucial factor in the desensitization of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase and the preservation of enzyme reaction could be accomplished by agents increasing intracellular calcium, which in turn, maintain the nucleotide regulatory components coupling to the cyclase in a protective environment from desensitization."

Comparison to the previously measured rapid in vivo dissociation curve (t1/2 approximately 50 s) (Perry, D. C., Rosenbaum, J. S., Kurowski, M., and Sadee, W. (1982) Mol. Pharmacol. 21, 272-279) revealed that brain homogenization and membrane washing procedures significantly prolonged the dissociation rate, even when measured in the presence of Na+ and guanyl nucleotide. The in vivo dissociation rate could only be reproduced in vitro when labeling occurred in vivo and brain homogenization occurred in the presence of these regulatory factors. The prolonged in vitro [3H]etorphine dissociation curve was predominately a result of a decreased sensitivity to guanine nucleotide rather than to Na+. These data suggest that partial functional uncoupling of the opiate receptor-effector system may occur in vitro."
