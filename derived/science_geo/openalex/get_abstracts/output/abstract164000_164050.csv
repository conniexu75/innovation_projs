Here we provide evidence for the existence of an ionic lock that constrains the relative mobility of the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6 in the inactive state of the β2-adrenergic receptor. We propose that the highly conserved Arg-1313.50 at the cytoplasmic end of TM3 interacts both with the adjacent Asp-1303.49 and with Glu-2686.30 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Such a network of ionic interactions has now been directly supported by the high-resolution structure of the inactive state of rhodopsin. We hypothesized that the network of interactions would serve to constrain the receptor in the inactive state, and the release of this ionic lock could be a key step in receptor activation. To test this hypothesis, we made charge-neutralizing mutations of Glu-2686.30 and of Asp-1303.49 in the β2-adrenergic receptor. Alone and in combination, we observed a significant increase in basal and pindolol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the mutant receptors. Moreover, based on the increased accessibility of Cys-2856.47 in TM6, we provide evidence for a conformational rearrangement of TM6 that is highly correlated with the extent of constitutive activity of the different mutants. The present experimental data together with the recent high-resolution structure of rhodopsin suggest that ionic interactions between Asp/Glu3.49, Arg3.50, and Glu6.30may constitute a common switch governing the activation of many rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors.

The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) belongs to the subfamily of rhodopsin-like receptors and has been used as a prototype GPCR in numerous studies (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D.

Low-resolution structures of rhodopsin, resolved by Schertler and co-workers (4Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 5Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), have demonstrated the presence of seven membrane-spanning α-helical segments and have provided important insights into the organization of the transmembrane bundle, allowing the development of tertiary structure models of GPCRs (6Ballesteros J.A.

Importantly, a high-resolution structure of rhodopsin has now become available (9Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar) making it possible to consider the functional roles of individual side chains from the perspective of an atomic resolution structure of a homologous GPCR. Understanding the function of GPCRs at a molecular level requires an understanding of how agonist binding to the receptor is converted into receptor activation (3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Studies based on EPR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, alterations in cysteine accessibility, and engineering of metal-binding sites have altogether pointed to a key role for conformational changes of TM3 and TM6 in receptor activation (10Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 11Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9279-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that underlie the movements of TM3 and TM6 and govern the transition of the receptor between its inactive and active states have nonetheless remained unclear. It has been suggested that the protonation of the aspartic acid in the highly conserved (D/E)RY motif at the cytoplasmic side of TM3 leads to a release of constraining intramolecular interactions, thereby resulting in the movements of TM3 and TM6 and a conversion of the receptor to the active state (7Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been supported by the observation that charge-neutralizing mutations of the aspartic acid (or glutamic acid) in TM3 lead to increased agonist-independent activation of a number of GPCRs (7Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, direct evidence has been obtained indicating that the photoactivation of rhodopsin is accompanied by the uptake of a proton by this residue (16Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In β2AR, lowering of the pH has also been shown to facilitate the transition of the receptor to the activated state (19Ghanouni P. Schambye H. Seifert R. Lee T.W. Rasmussen S.G. Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3121-3127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the network of constraining intramolecular interactions that maintain the receptor in its inactive state has not been clear. Based on simulations in the α1B-adrenergic receptor, Scheer et al. (7Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) suggested that Arg3.50 in the inactive state is constrained in a “polar pocket” formed by residues in TMs 1, 2, and 7. The specific ionic counterpart of the arginine in the inactive state in this scheme was predicted to be the conserved aspartic acid in TM2 (Asp2.50, Asp-79 in β2AR) (7Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ballesteros et al.(20Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) proposed that the ionic counterpart of Arg3.50 in the inactive state could be the adjacent Asp3.49. Experiments using cysteine cross-linking and engineered metal ion-binding sites (10Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 11Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 21Sheikh S.P. Vilardarga J.P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) suggest that the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6 are in close proximity. Exploring these proposed proximities in a three-dimensional molecular model of the β2AR supports an orientation of the conserved Arg3.50 in TM3 facing a conserved Glu6.30 in TM6. Therefore, we further propose that in the inactive state, Arg3.50 in addition to interacting with Asp3.49 also interacts with the conserved Glu6.30 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 (Fig. 1), and that this interaction maintains the receptor in the inactive state by holding together the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6. To test this structural hypothesis, we have generated charge-neutralizing mutations of Glu-268 6.30 in the β2AR and have studied these mutants alone and in combination with mutations of Asp-1303.49. We find that the disruption of the interaction between TM3 and TM6 produces constitutive receptor activation, and that the extent of constitutive activation is highly correlated with the extent of conformational rearrangement in TM6. Our hypothesis and results are remarkably consistent with the recent high-resolution structure of the inactive state of rhodopsin, which showed that Arg3.50 in this receptor is positioned to form an ionic interaction with both Glu3.49 and Glu6.30 in this receptor. Residues are numbered according to their positions in the human β2AR sequence. We also index residues relative to the most conserved residue in the TM in which it is located (6Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). By definition, the most conserved residue is assigned the position index “50”, e.g. Pro-2886.50and therefore Leu-2876.49 and Phe-2896.51. This indexing simplifies the identification of aligned residues in different GPCRs. The cDNA sequence encoding the human β2AR, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with a cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG-epitope (Sigma) and tagged with six histidines at the carboxyl terminus, was a gift from Dr. B. Kobilka (Stanford, CA) (22Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Mutants are named as wild-type residue, residue number, and mutant residue where the residues are given in single letter codes. The polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragments containing the mutations were subcloned into the appropriate plasmid. The mutations were identified initially through the presence of diagnostic restriction sites introduced via the mutated oligonucleotides and subsequently verified by DNA-sequencing analysis of the polymerase chain reaction-generated segments. For transient expression in COS-7 cells, the cDNA was subcloned into pTEJ8 (23Johansen T.E. Scholler M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For stable expression in HEK 293 cells, this cDNA was subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pcin4 (24Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. S. Rees (Glaxo Wellcome), thereby creating the vector pcin4-SFβ2AR6His. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient expression, COS-7 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Gether U. Marray T. Schwartz T.W. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using 10–60 µg of the pTEJ-8 constructs/6 × 106 cells in 175-cm2flasks. The amount of DNA used in the transfections was modified to achieve various expression levels of the constructs. HEK 293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 3.15 g/liter of glucose in 10% bovine calf serum. The HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 µg of the pCIN4 constructs using the LipofectAMINE/Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) transfection system, and a stably transfected pool was selected with Geneticin as described previously (13Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To increase the expression of the constitutively active mutants, 10 µm sotalol was added to the growth medium of HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant β2AR for 1–2 days. To remove the sotalol, the cells were washed with 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca-Mg-EDTA and then incubated in 10 ml of Opti-MEM for 30–60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were washed again with 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and dissociated in 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. Membranes were prepared as described previously (14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the membrane pellets from one confluent 100-mm dish for each of the mutants except D130N and D130N/E268A (2–4 dishes) were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.006% bovine serum albumin). The membrane suspensions were diluted (typically 1:20–1:40 but 1:6–1:16 for the mutants D130N/E268A,D130N and D130N/E268Q) in binding buffer and used for radioligand-binding studies. [3H]CGP-12177 binding was performed as described previously (13Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Data for saturation and competition binding were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), andK d, B max, and IC50 values were determined. K i values were determined using the equation K i = IC50/(1 + L/K D) where L is the radioligand concentration (26Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar). The cAMP accumulation assay was performed essentially as described previously (14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Hjorth S.A. Orskov C. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transiently expressing the WT and mutant receptors were cultured in 12-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well plate) and incubated overnight with medium containing 2 µCi/ml of [3H]adenine (TRK311, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before carrying out the experiment (14Rasmussen S.G.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) The methanethiosulfonate reagent assay was carried out as described previously (13Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Washed dissociated HEK 293 cells stably expressing the mutants were resuspended in 400 µl of buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.006% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Aliquots of whole cell suspension (50 µl) were incubated with different concentrations of freshly prepared methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) (Toronto Research Biochemicals, Toronto, Canada) for 2 min at room temperature, and after dilution, the binding of [3H]CGP-12177 was determined as described previously (14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To simulate the bending of TM6 by Pro at 6.50, 100 α-helices of 31 amino acids with a Pro at position 21 from the amino terminus and Ala at other positions were generated using a molecular dynamics simulation with Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics (28Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar) to probe the conformational space of a Pro kink. The simulation was started from the torsion angles taken from average values of Pro kinks (29Sankararamakrishnan R. Vishveshwara S. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Sankararamakrishnan R. Vishveshwara S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 39: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and a dielectric constant of 4 was used. The system was heated to 300 K and equilibrated. After the major parameters were stable in the production phase, a structure was taken every 2 picoseconds. The resulting structures (shown in Fig. 5as blue ribbons) were superimposed from position 1 to 17 onto the corresponding parts of TM6 (6.30–6.46). To illustrate the interactions at the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6, a β2AR three-dimensional model was made based on the backbone of the rhodopsin structure. The rhodopsin residues were substituted by those of the β2AR (or mutants) at aligned positions. The side chain clashes were removed manually. The conserved glutamic acid at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 (Glu-2686.30) (Fig.1) was mutated to glutamine or alanine (E268Q or E268A). The aspartic acid in the conserved DRY motif of the β2AR (Asp-1303.49, see Fig. 1) was mutated to asparagine (D130N) as described previously (14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These mutations were also combined to produce D130N/E268Q and D130N/E268A. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (left panels), these charge-neutralizing mutations caused a clear elevation of basal agonist-independent cAMP accumulation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells as compared with the WT receptor. The basal activity increased linearly with increasing receptor expression. There was a progressive increase in basal activity in the mutants in the following rank order from lowest to highest: WT (slope = 8.7 ± 1.5 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), E268Q (slope = 137 ± 29 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), E268A (slope = 540 ± 103 CPM × pmol×1 × mg of protein), D130N (slope = 938 ± 170 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), D130N/E268Q (slope = 1,390 ± 372 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), and D130N/E268A (slope = 997 ± 441 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein). It was difficult to differentiate the very high basal activity of the latter three mutants because of our inability to express sufficiently high amounts of receptor to generate an accurate slope. This low level of expression is consistent with previous observations and with the decreased stability of constitutively active receptors (14Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Jacobs E.H. Smit M.J. Roovers E. Cotecchia S. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Stimulation of COS-7 cells transiently expressing the WT or mutant receptors with a saturating concentration of the partial agonist pindolol (1 µm) caused a clear increase in cAMP accumulation that rose with increasing expression of the individual receptor constructs (Fig. 2, right panels). Similar to the effects observed for the basal activity, the increase in cAMP accumulation was most significant for D130N/E268A (slope = 34,500 ± 23,900 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein) followed by D130N/E268Q (slope = 6030 ± 939 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein) and D130N (slope = 6050 ± 994 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), E268A (slope = 2530 ± 500 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), E268Q (slope = 1340 ± 255 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein), and WT (slope = 384 ± 97 CPM × pmol−1 × mg of protein). The data indicate an increased efficacy of pindolol at all the mutant receptors. An increased efficacy of partial agonists has previously been described for other constitutively active mutants and is consistent with an enhanced ability of the mutant receptors to assume an activated state (32Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the full agonist isoproterenol significantly increased cAMP levels in untransfected COS-7 cells by stimulating endogenous β2-adrenergic receptors present at low levels (data not shown), it was not possible to investigate the response of the mutant receptors to full agonists. However, the partial agonist pindolol did not affect cAMP production in untransfected cells (data not shown). Saturation-binding experiments with the antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 showed a slightly decreased affinity for D130N/E268A as compared with the WT with all the other mutants having an affinity within ∼2-fold of WT (TableI). However, the receptor expression was markedly reduced for D130N and especially for D130N/E268A (Table I). E268A and E268Q, which were less constitutively active, expressed at near WT levels. Surprisingly, D130N/E268Q was found to express well in the HEK 293 cells despite its high constitutive activity. However, as it is clear from Fig. 2, the apparent expression level was much lower than the WT and comparable to D130N/E268A upon transient expression in COS-7 cells (Table I and Fig. 2). It should be noted that whereas theB max determinations for the COS-7 cells in Fig.2 represent many individual transfections, theB max determinations in the HEK 293 cells are based on the analysis of pool clones from single stable transfections.Table IBinding properties of WT β2AR and mutantsReceptorsCGP-12177 Mean [S.E. interval]CGP-12177 Mean [S.E. interval]-fold increase in affinityIsoproterenol Mean [S.E. interval]-fold increase in affinityPindolol Mean [S.E. interval]-fold increase in affinityBmax (fmol/cm2 plate)Kd(nm)-foldKi(nm)-foldKi (nm)-foldWT66 [53–79]0.06 [0.05–0.06]45 [38–53]0.06 [0.04–0.08]E268Q110 [87–134]0.12 [0.10–0.14]0.532 [28–38]1.40.36 [0.20–0.66]0.2E268A61 [49–74]0.14 [0.13–0.16]0.416 [13–20]2.80.20 [0.16–0.26]0.3D130N6 [4–8]0.06 [0.05–0.06]10.4 [0.3–0.7]1100.11 [0.09–0.15]0.5E268Q/E130N41 [30–53]0.15 [0.12–0.18]0.40.6 [0.60–0.7]750.18 [0.14–0.23]0.3E268A/D130N0.5 [0.4–0.7]0.24 [0.22–0.25]0.251.4 [1.1–1.9]320.05 [0.02–0.16]1.2Saturation and competition binding studies were performed on membrane preparations from HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant receptors as described under “Materials and Methods.”K d, B max, and IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis andK i values were determined from the IC50values according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (26Cheng Y.

Consistent with the elevated basal activities, isoproterenol competition binding showed a very small increase in the affinity for E268Q relative to WT, a 3-fold increase in affinity for E268A, and a 30–100-fold increase in affinity for D130N and the two double mutants (Table I). Thus, the charge-neutralizing mutations of Glu-268 and Asp-130 lead to an increase in apparent agonist affinity, consistent with a higher propensity of the receptors to assume the activated R* state (32Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competition-binding experiments with pindolol demonstrated unchanged affinities for the mutant receptors as compared with the WT (Table I). This finding is consistent with the unchanged affinities previously observed for weak partial agonists such as pindolol in another constitutively active mutant β2AR (32Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment of cells expressing the WT β2AR with the charged sulfhydryl-specific agent MTSEA did not affect the binding of the radioligand [3H]CGP-12177 to the β2AR (13Javitch J.A. Fu D.

High concentrations of MTSEA, however, inhibited the binding of [3H]CGP-12177 to the constitutively activated mutant a constitutively active mutant (L266S/K267R/H269K/L272A) (13Javitch J.A. Fu D.

Expression of OPN is often co-localized with members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. We report that OPN is a novel substrate for two MMPs, MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) and MMP-7 (matrilysin). Three cleavage sites were identified for MMP-3 in human OPN, and two of those sites were also cleaved by MMP-7. These include hydrolysis of the human Gly166-Leu167, Ala201-Tyr202 (MMP-3 only), and Asp210-Leu211 peptide bonds. Only the N-terminal Gly-Leu cleavage site is conserved in rat OPN (Gly151-Leu152). These sites are distinct from previously reported cleavage sites in OPN for the proteases thrombin or enterokinase. We found evidence for the predicted MMP cleavage fragments of OPN in vitro in tumor cell lines, and in vivo in remodeling tissues such as the postpartum uterus, where OPN and MMPs are co-expressed. Furthermore, cleavage of OPN by MMP-3 or MMP-7 potentiated the function of OPN as an adhesive and migratory stimulus in vitro through cell surface integrins. We predict that interaction of MMPs with OPN at tumor and wound healing sites in vivo may be a mechanism of regulation of OPN bioactivity.

The fact that no other proteins seem to share a redundant activity with OPN under these conditions suggests that OPN has a unique functional role during tissue injury and stress. Interestingly, several members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are also induced during injury/disease processes in patterns overlapping that of OPN (13McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In particular, we have found that during squamous cell carcinoma progression, OPN and MMP-3 expression correspond both in a temporal and cell-specific fashion (9Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Liaw L.

In addition, functional properties of thrombin-cleaved OPN differ from the intact protein (21O'Regan A.W. Chupp G.L. Lowry J.A. Goetschkes M. Mulligan N. Berman J.S. J.

Pathol. 1996; 149: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that proteolytic cleavage is one mechanism of regulating the bioactivity of OPN. In the present study, we have identified and characterized novel cleavage sites in OPN for two members of the MMP family, MMP-3 and MMP-7. Furthermore, we show that lower molecular weight forms of OPN corresponding to predicted MMP cleavage fragments are present in cell lines in vitro and in tissues in vivo. Biological assays demonstrate that the MMP-cleaved OPN has increased activity in promoting both cell adhesion and migration compared with full-length OPN. In addition, using inhibitory reagents, we have determined that the same receptors that interact with OPN also mediate interaction of MMP-cleaved OPN with tumor cells. These data suggest that active forms of OPN at sites of tissue injury may be regulated by the activity of proteases including MMPs and that the differences in activity of modified OPN may be explained by differences in binding affinity of integrins or distinct downstream signaling events. Recombinant rat OPN (LP432, CHO expression) and human OPN (LP462, Escherichia coliexpression) were generously provided by SmithKline Beecham. Active MMP-3 and MMP-7 were obtained from Chemicon, and the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (cat) was a kind gift of Dr. Hideaki Nagase (University of Kansas Medical Center). Thrombin was purchased from Sigma. The following antibodies were used as described. The anti-OPN antibodies were a goat polyclonal IgG OP199 (25Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonals anti-human OPN, LP209, and LP210 (SmithKline Beecham). The anti-αvβ3 integrin clone LM609, anti-αvβ5 integrin clone P1F6, anti-α9β1 integrin clone Y9A2, anti-α4 integrin clone AV1, and anti-α5integrin clone NK1-SAM-1 were obtained from Chemicon. The peptides GRGDSP and GRGESP were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. In some experiments, recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα, R&D Systems) was used at a concentration of 1 ng/ml. AsPC-1 and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI (Life Technologies) with 20% fetal bovine serum (AsPC-1) and minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary mouse macrophages were obtained by peritoneal injection of 3% thioglycollate medium, with collection of exudate after 4 days. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml gentamycin. Primary chondrocytes were prepared from intervertebral discs as previously described (26Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. MacDougall J.R. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 µg/ml ascorbic acid, and 50 µg/ml gentamycin. Co-cultures of macrophages with chondrocytes were performed using cell culture inserts in six-well dishes with chondrocytes in the insert and macrophages in the wells as described (26Haro H.

Mo and Moαv subclones of M21 melanoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Mark H. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute) and cultured as described. While Mo does not express αvintegrins, Moαv expresses high levels of αvintegrins at the cell surface (27Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat and human OPN were cleaved by MMPs (enzyme/substrate ratio varied from 1:5 to 1:20 to maximize yield of cleavage fragments) and thrombin (0.25 units/µg of OPN) in equal volume of cleavage buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm CaCl2) for 5–15 min at 37 °C. The amount of OPN was kept constant at 200 ng, and the enzyme amount varied according to the enzyme/substrate ratio used. For most biological assays, 10 ng of MMP was used with 200 ng of OPN for cleavage assays. The mixture of cleaved OPN fragments was separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and then transferred to a 0.2-µm immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was washed with 50% methanol and stained with fresh Coomassie Brilliant Blue for less than 1 min and then destained with 50% methanol. Visible protein bands were excised by a razor-sharp blade and allowed to dry for about 1 h at room temperature and then shipped for sequencing. The N-terminal amino-terminal sequence was determined by modified automated Edman degradation (ProSeq Inc., Boxford, MA). For immunodetection, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as above. For samples of chondrocyte/macrophage co-cultures, 22.5 µg of protein were present in each lane. For tumor cells and tissue lysates, 200 µg of protein were run per lane. The nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was incubated in a combination of three primary anti-OPN antibodies, OPN199 goat IgG (1:1000) and LP209 and LP210 rabbit IgG (1:2000), in 10% milk TBS-T for 1 h and then in horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit and horseradish peroxidase rabbit anti-goat (1:2000) for another 1 h. The OPN bands were visualized using chemiluminescent reagent containing 250 mm 3-aminophthalydrazide and 90 mm p-coumaric acid. In situ hybridization on tissue sections was performed as previously described (9Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Liaw L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5206-5215PubMed Google Scholar) using sense and antisense riboprobes to the mouse OPN cDNA 2ar (28Craig A.M. Nemir M. Mukherjee B.B. Chambers A.F. Denhardt D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Adhesion and migration assays were performed as previously described (25Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, for adhesion assays, test substrates were coated onto wells of Maxisorp 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C, wells were rinsed, and detached cells were plated for 1 h at 37 °C (AsPC-1 and HeLa cells plated at 30,000 cells/well and melanoma cell strains plated at 80,000 cells/well). Nonadherent cells were washed off, and attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained, and quantitated. Migration assays were performed using test substrates in the lower chamber of a modified Boyden chamber apparatus, separated from cells with a polycarbonate filter with 8-µm pores. After the migration period, cells on the upper surface of the filter (cells that did not migrate) were scraped off, and cells that had migrated through the pores to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 100% MeOH and stained with hematoxylin. Migrated cells were quantitated by cell counts of three random fields/well for six wells per test condition. For biological assays with protease cleaved OPN, cleavage of the substrate was verified by Western blot in all instances with an aliquot of the cleaved material before it was used for adhesion or migration assays. Inhibitory anti-integrin antibodies were used at a concentration of 25 µg/ml, and peptides were used at a concentration of 200 µg/ml. These reagents were incubated with cells for 15 min at 37 °C before cells were plated in adhesion assays. We have previously characterized a model of herniated disc resorption, allowing the study of the interaction of inflammatory cells with chondrocytes (26Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. MacDougall J.R. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this system, both MMP-3 and MMP-7 are activated (26Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. MacDougall J.R. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MMP-3 is necessary for the generation of a macrophage chemoattractant (26Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. MacDougall J.R. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), while MMP-7 cleaves TNFα (29Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and both events contribute to disc resorption. Because of the prevalence of OPN during inflammation, we were interested in possible interactions of these MMPs with OPN in this system. When we examined chondrocyte cultures in the presence or absence of macrophages, we found high levels of OPN in chondrocytes alone, but additional lower molecular weight forms detectable following co-culture with macrophages (Fig.1A). Since the co-culture system has been previously shown to induce the production of MMP-3 (26Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. MacDougall J.R. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we tested whether MMP-3 might be responsible for the presence of the lower molecular weight forms of OPN. Using purified native rat OPN (25Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and active MMP-3, cleavage assays were performed, and similar OPN bands at apparent molecular masses of 40 and 32 kDa were seen as a result of this cleavage (Fig. 1 B). In order to confirm the direct effect of MMP-3 in the co-cultures, two approaches were taken. Chondrocytes were cultured alone or in the presence of TNFα, a cytokine known to stimulate MMP-3 production (29Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the absence of cytokines or macrophages, only full-length OPN was observed (Fig.1 C, lane 2), while a predominant 40-kDa band was additionally found in chondrocyte cultures treated with TNFα (lane 3). Furthermore, we utilized macrophages derived from wild type or MMP-3 null animals (30Mudgett J.S. Hutchinson N.I. Chartrain N.A. Forsyth A.J. McDonnell J. Singer I.I. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J. Kawka D. Shen C.F. Stevens K. Chen H. Trumbauer M. Visco D.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) to confirm that MMP-3 was necessary for the generation of OPN fragments in the co-culture system. As shown in Fig. 1 C, chondrocytes co-cultured with macrophages from MMP-3 null (−/−) animals produced only the full-length OPN (lane 4; compare with chondrocytes cultured alone, (Fig. 1 A)), while co-cultures of chondrocytes and macrophages from wild type animals generated OPN cleavage fragments (lane 5). These data show that purified MMP-3 can cleave native OPN and that in the co-culture system, cleavage of endogenously produced OPN is dependent on the presence of endogenous MMP-3. To further characterize the proteolytic cleavage of OPN by MMPs, we studied recombinant OPN and active MMP-3 and MMP-7. We used recombinant human and rat OPN and found that both were substrates for MMP cleavage, although the cleavage pattern was slightly different (Fig.2). Similar to our results using native rat OPN (Fig. 1 A), recombinant rat OPN was cleaved by MMP-3 to generate two fragments at apparent molecular masses of 40 and 32 kDa (Fig. 2 A). However, the pattern of cleavage of recombinant human OPN (huOPN) differed (Fig. 2 B), and in addition to 40- and 32-kDa bands, MMP-3-cleaved huOPN additionally generated a 25-kDa band. Following MMP-7 cleavage of huOPN, 25-, 20-, and 15-kDa bands were generated. All MMP-cleaved OPN fragments were distinct from those generated by thrombin cleavage (Fig. 2 C), which generated 30- and 28-kDa bands in both rat and human recombinant OPN. Titration of enzyme/substrate ratios and cleavage times showed that with limiting amounts of enzyme and/or shorter cleavage times with MMP-7, huOPN also generated the 40- and 32-kDa bands, suggesting that these are intermediate forms in the reaction (Fig. 2 D). All cleavage products of both MMP-3 and MMP-7-cleaved rat and huOPN were analyzed by protein sequencing for determination of cleavage sites. The determined cleavage recognition sites are shown in Fig.3. The predominant cleavage site found for both MMP-3 and MMP-7 in rat and huOPN was a Gly-Leu bond (Gly166-Leu167 in huOPN, Gly151-Leu152 in rat OPN) just five amino acid residues C-terminal to the RGD sequence. Additionally, both MMP-3 and MMP-7 were found to cleave huOPN at the Asp210-Leu211 bond, but only MMP-3 displayed a minor cleavage site at Ala201-Tyr202 in huOPN. These cleavage sites corresponded with the apparent size of the fragments on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A schematic showing cleavage patterns and OPN fragments generated is depicted in Fig. 4. At the present time, the only unidentified fragments that we expect should be generated are the small molecular weight fragments derived from MMP-3 cleavage of the 32-kDa band giving rise to the 25-kDa band and the MMP-7 cleavage of the 25-kDa band to generate the 20-kDa band (Fig. 4, question marks). These predicted fragments have not been detected even in high percentage gels, suggesting that they may be further degraded.Figure 3Identified MMP-3 and MMP-7 cleavage sites in rat and human OPN.

Cytokine. 2000; 12: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Attiga F.A. Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R.

Cancer Lett. 2000; 155: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, CHO cells that were either stably transfected with MMP-3 or vector alone were compared. Both conditioned medium and cell lysates were analyzed, and although OPN was detected in both compartments, there was consistently more protein detectable in the cell lysates. This was probably due to the fact that secreted OPN binds to cell surface proteoglycans and is found in the extracellular space (5Liaw L. Birk D.E. Ballas C.B. Whitsitt J.S. Davidson J.M. Hogan B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sometimes bound to other extracellular matrix proteins (35Mukherjee B.B. Nemir M. Beninati S. Cordella-Miele E. Singh K. Chackalaparampil I. Shanmugam V. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, a large proportion of secreted OPN remained associated with the cell layer and extracellular matrix. The observation that a member of the MMP family, MMP-2, may associate with cell surface receptors (36Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar) indicates a potential interaction of MMP with substrates at the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu. As shown in Fig. 5A, vector-transfected CHO cells did not produce detectable amounts of OPN protein by immunoblotting (lane 2). However, in CHO cells stably expressing MMP-3, OPN was detected in three forms, a faint species corresponding to full-length and two lower molecular weight forms running at 40 and 32 kDa (lanes 3and 4). In addition, in the tumor lines DU-145, a human prostate cancer cell line, and AsPC-1, a human pancreatic cancer line, multiple forms of OPN were detected, including bands corresponding to full-length OPN, as well as species with apparent molecular masses of 40, 32, 25, and 15 kDa (lanes 5–8). In vivo, the epithelial cells of the mouse postpartum uterus have been shown to be a region of high MMP-7 expression (15Wilson C.L. Heppner K.J. Rudolph L.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), in a pattern overlapping that of OPN expression (Fig. 5, B andC). MMP-7 and OPN expression overlap precisely in the epithelial cell layer of the remodeling uterus. Tissue extracts from 24-h mouse postpartum uterus (PPU) also showed strong lower molecular weight OPN bands in addition to the full-length protein (Fig.5 A). OPN is a well characterized adhesive protein and migratory stimulus. To test the regulation of bioactivity of OPN by MMP cleavage, adhesion and migration assays were performed using either recombinant full-length protein or OPN cleaved by MMP-3, MMP-7, or thrombin as a comparison. Full-length OPN was cleaved with MMPs or thrombin and used in adhesion assays in comparison with the same concentrations of OPN treated similarly but in the absence of enzyme. As a control, reactions were prepared with enzyme but in the absence of OPN (Fig.6A). HPLC-purified 40-kDa fragment was also used and gave similar results as the unpurified MMP-cleaved OPN. We found that the cleavage of OPN (either human or rat OPN gave similar results) with MMP-3, MMP-7, the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (cat), or thrombin significantly increased adhesion of tumor cells in comparison with full-length OPN alone. Interestingly, the sensitivity of the cells to protease-cleaved OPN was greatly enhanced compared with full-length OPN, as seen in dose comparison experiments (Fig. 6 A). Using 200 ng of OPN as a substrate, cleavage by MMP-3 and MMP-7 increased adhesion by ∼2-fold. However, with 50 ng of OPN as a substrate, MMP-3 and MMP-7 cleavage enhanced adhesion by 10- and 18-fold, respectively. Several cell lines were screened and found to display enhanced adhesion to MMP-cleaved OPN, including A5 and B9 murine squamous cell carcinoma lines, rat smooth muscle cells, human aortic endothelial cells, and NIH3T3 fibroblasts (p < 0.01 for all). Similarly, migration was tested using full-length OPN or MMP-3-cleaved OPN as a stimulus, and we found that macrophage migration toward MMP-3-cleaved OPN was significantly enhanced compared with full-length OPN (Fig. 6 B). Again, several cell types showed the same increased migratory response to MMP-3-cleaved OPN compared with full-length OPN, including A5 cells and B9 cells (p < 0.01), rat smooth muscle cells, human aortic endothelial cells, and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These data show that the bioactivity of OPN toward cells can be regulated by proteolysis by MMPs. Although in many instances, the adhesive and migratory activity of MMP-cleaved OPN appeared similar to thrombin-cleaved OPN (Fig.6 A), we found situations in which the functional consequences of these proteolytic modifications were rather distinct. For example, HeLa carcinoma cell lines displayed a poor adhesion to full-length OPN and significantly higher, but not impressive, adhesion to MMP-cleaved OPN (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, high levels of adhesion were seen on a thrombin-cleaved OPN substrate. These findings imply that the activities of thrombin-cleaved versusMMP-cleaved OPN are distinct, and this may be related to receptor specificity on individual cell lines. One possibility explaining the enhanced bioactivity of MMP-cleaved OPN in comparison with full-length OPN is that different and additional receptors are activated. Indeed, this is the case with thrombin-cleaved OPN, where an α9β1 and α4β1 binding site is revealed after cleavage (19Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since most OPN interaction with cells is integrin-mediated, we tested if known integrins were active in mediating cell responses to MMP-cleaved OPN. Using GRGDSP or GRGESP peptides, we found that interaction of the RGD sequence of either full-length OPN or MMP-cleaved OPN could account for virtually all of the adhesion of AsPC-"

WAT mass is a reflection of the number of adipocytes and their volume. The latter is dependent upon the amount of fat stored in the individual fat cell, whereas the former increases as a result of new adipocyte differentiation from pre-adipocytes. Because mature adipocytes do not undergo cell division and lose their ability to propagate, any increase in their number reflects the process of differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 2Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This process of differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes culminates in increased transcription of certain genes and expression of specific proteins such as the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT-4 (3Panlouskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054PubMed Google Scholar), fatty acid synthase (FAS) (4Spiegelman B.M. Frnak M. Green H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Understanding the process of adipocyte differentiation becomes vitally important for unraveling the pathogenesis of obesity that is characterized by increased WAT mass. Several excellent reviews have summarized the current understanding of the mechanism of adipocyte differentiation (6Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Closson M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 7Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These reviews emphasize that during adipocyte differentiation, regardless of the nature of the triggering event, a series of transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β, δ, and α, PPARγ, etc. is induced in a specific sequence (6Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Closson M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 7Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In in vitro studies, a combination of dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and insulin is commonly used to induce this sequence of events. Understanding the role of insulin, the most potent among the three inducers, appears to be of special importance, because of the potential influence of in vivohyperinsulinemia on the development of obesity. Although insulin within its physiologic range has been shown to induce lipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation (11Gagnon A. Sorisky A. Obesity Res. 1998; 6: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the mechanism of its action on adipogenesis is incompletely understood. From the point of view of insulin signaling, the presence of the insulin receptor appears to be required for adipocyte differentiation (12Accili D. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Chaika O.V. Charka N. Bolle D.J. Wilden P.A. Pirrucello S.J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11968-11974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been shown to block insulin-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (14Magus R. Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Paardasani D. Lin Y. Chabot J. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 1997; 137: 3590-3593Google Scholar, 15Sosa H. Arimura S. Nishio E. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because a variety of other agents also activate PI 3-kinase and its downstream targets without any effect on adipocyte differentiation, it is plausible that insulin engages other branch(es) of its signaling pathways into its action on adipogenesis. We have recently determined that prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins is regulated by insulin (16Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27585-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that prenylation of these proteins is significantly augmented by ambient hyperinsulinemia either present in insulin-resistant humans and animals or induced experimentally in controls (18Goalstone M.L.

Insulin appears to promote the phosphorylation and activation of farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) by a mechanism independent of PI 3-kinase (20Goalstone M.L.

Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1165-1177Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 23Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter has been shown to phosphorylate and activate cyclic AMP responseelement binding (CREB) protein that is critically important for adipogenesis (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the ability of insulin to promote prenylation of the Ras family of GTPases may constitute an additional mechanism of the insulin effect on adipogenesis. In this study, we examined whether inhibition of prenylation of p21ras and Rho-A can affect insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. All standard chemicals were from Sigma and anti-Ras monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibodies to PPARγ2, GLUT-4, leptin, and Rho-A antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-active MAP kinase antibody, CREB, and phospho-CREB specific antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and anti-fatty acid synthetase antibody was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). All supplies and reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), and the chemiluminescence kit was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL). Cell culture media and supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Beverly, MA), Gemini Bioproducts (Gaithersburg, MD), and Specialty Media, Inc. (Lavalletee, NJ). FTase inhibitor (FTI), α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid, was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and GGTase I inhibitor-286 (GGTI) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The Ecdysone inducible expression system (pIND, pVgRXR vectors, zeocin, and ponasterone A) was from Invitrogen (Madison, WI). An expression vector for the constitutively active CREB-DIEML (25Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Richard Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence in fibroblast growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 0.5 µg/ml fungizone). Differentiation was initiated by addition of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 500 µm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (or 3 mmBt2cAMP), 1 µm dexamethasone, and 1 µg/ml insulin. After 2 days, cells were transferred to adipocyte growth medium containing 25 mm glucose, 50 µg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 0.5 µg/ml fungizone, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, and 1 µg/ml insulin and re-fed every 2 days. Differentiation of fibroblasts into mature adipocytes was confirmed by Oil Red O staining (26Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). FTase inhibitor (FTI) and GGTase I inhibitor (GGTI) were used in concentrations of 1 µmand 3 µm, respectively. Plates of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to 70–80% confluency and transfected with the indicated plasmids with Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells stably transfected with the plasmid pVgRXR were selected in conventional medium containing 500 µg/ml Zeocin, and cells stably transfected with pIND-VP16-CREB, pIND-CREB-DIEDML or pIND-LacZ plasmids were selected in medium containing 500 µg/ml Geneticin. Large, rapidly growing, well separated colonies were isolated 10–12 days after selection was begun with either antibiotic. Isolated clones were passaged in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and 500 µg/ml each of Zeocin and Geneticin. VP16-CREB, CREB-DIEDML, or LacZ expression was induced through the addition of 5 µm Ponasterone A to the growth medium as indicated in the figure legends. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to mature adipocytes was followed by observing the accumulation of triacylglycerol in Oil Red O staining vesicles and by the appearance of adipocyte markers: PPARγ2, GLUT-4, fatty acid synthase, and leptin. Differentiation assays were performed on cells growing on 8-chamber microscope slides. Ten days following the initiation of differentiation, the cells were stained with Oil Red O as previously described (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), and counterstained with Hematoxylin to visualize cell morphology. Cells were observed by brightfield microscopy, and representative fields were photographed with Kodak 200 film. Alternately, cells growing on multiwell slides were lysed directly in Laemmli SDS gel loading buffer, and the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis for marker protein expression. The Ecdysone-inducible expression system was employed to prepare stably transfected 3T3-L1cells in which we could induce the expression of VP16-CREB and CREB-DIEDML as described previously (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). After correcting for protein concentrations, lysates from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes treated as described in the figure legends were prepared in Laemmli SDS loading buffer, resolved on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (for PPARγ2, FAS, GLUT-4, and leptin) or 12% acrylamide gels (for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, CREB, phospho-CREB, ERK (MAP), and phospho-ERK), and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20, and then treated with antibodies that recognize C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, CREB, phospho-CREB, ERK (MAP), phospho-ERK, PPARγ2, FAS, GLUT-4, or leptin. The blots were washed and subsequently treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. After the blots were washed, specific immune complexes for PPARγ2, FAS, GLUT-4, or leptin were visualized with bromo-chloro-indoyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium, whereas the remaining proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence. All statistics were analyzed by Student's t test, with a p value of <0.5 considered significant. In the initial set of experiments, we examined the effect of the inhibitors of FTase (1 µm) and GGTase I (3 µm) on the insulin-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. The inhibitors were added either individually or together at the time of the induction and kept in the medium throughout the differentiation period (days 1–10). The presence of either inhibitor alone or in a combination in the differentiation mixture completely blocked differentiation of these cells into mature adipocytes (Fig.1). We then examined the effect of the prenylation inhibitors on the expression of the transcription proteins participating in the pre-adipocyte differentiation process. In control cells, C/EBPβ was expressed on day 2 and C/EBPα appeared on day 4. Both inhibitors, FTI and GGTI, blocked the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPα (Fig.2), thus indicating that farnesylation and geranylgeranylation are necessary for the induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPα expression. Because insulin stimulates prenylation of p21 Ras and Rho-A (16Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol.

In the absence of either FTI or GGTI, insulin induced the phosphorylation of both MAP kinase (Fig. 3, A andB, upper panels) and CREB (Fig.4, A and B,upper panels). The effect of insulin was clearly evident when the results were expressed as ratios of phosphoproteins to the total amount of MAP kinase and CREB (Figs. 3 and 4, lower panels). The inhibitor of FTase significantly decreased the ability of insulin to activate MAP kinase (Fig. 3 A) and to phosphorylate CREB (Fig. 4 A) without affecting the amounts of either MAP kinase or CREB protein (Figs. 3 A and4 A, middle panels). In contrast, inhibition of GGTase I did not affect the ability of insulin to promote the phosphorylation of either MAP kinase or CREB (Figs. 3 B and4 B, upper and lower panels), indicating that the geranylgeranylation process is not related to the activation of MAP kinase and CREB.Figure 4Effect of FTI and GGTI on insulin-induced phosphorylation of CREB in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts.

Because CREB enters the differentiation process downstream of farnesylated and activated p21ras, we examined whether two distinct constitutively active CREB constructs (VP16-CREB and CREB-DIEDML) can rescue the differentiation process from an arrest induced by prenylation inhibitors. Both constitutively active constructs were inducible by ponasterone A and both promoted adipocyte differentiation, even in the absence of the differentiation mixture (Fig. 5). As expected, the differentiation mixture induced PPARγ2, FAS, leptin, and GLUT-4 proteins, and both constructs of the constitutively active CREB mimicked this effect in the absence of the differentiation mixture (Fig. 6). Moreover, induction of either of the two constructs rescued adipocyte differentiation from the inhibitory influence of prenyltransferase inhibitors (Fig.7). Induction of constitutively active CREB with ponasterone A stimulated expression of PPARγ2, leptin, and FAS in cells treated with FTI and/or GGTI (Fig.8).Figure 6Effect of VP16 CREB or CRED-DIEDML on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells as determined by expression of adipocyte-specific genes.

Weight gain and obesity occur when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, and excess energy is deposited in adipocytes. At the cellular level, obesity is characterized by both adipocyte hypertrophy and increased number of adipocytes (30Hirsch J. Batchelor B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1976; 5: 299-311Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 31Ginsberg-Fellner F. Knittle J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1981; 15: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). New adipocytes largely arise in the process of differentiation of pre-adipocytes. Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of knowledge about intrinsic regulatory mechanisms determining adipocyte differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 6Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Closson M. McKnight S.L.

It has been determined that adipocyte differentiation is a highly regulated process that involves sequential activation of several transcription factors, such as C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ, culminating in the removal of adipocytes from the cell cycle and induction of highly specific proteins, such as GLUT-4, FAS, and others (1Spiegelman B.M.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nutritional influence, as well as the presence of insulin and glucocorticosteroids appears to be among the most important triggers of the differentiation process. Insulin, however, occupies a special place among various factors regulating white adipose tissue mass. Fasting and/or glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia are characteristic features of obesity. Whether or not hyperinsulinemia can participate in further augmentation of WAT mass remains to be defined further. Clearly, hyperinsulinemia, induced either by administration of exogenous insulin (intensive therapy with insulin) or increases in production of endogenous insulin (insulinoma), is associated with significant weight gain. It is plausible, but not yet proven, that endogenous hyperinsulinemia elicited by excessive food intake can promote adipogenesis, significantly increases WAT mass, and cause obesity with secondary metabolic resistance to insulin. However, it is obvious that insulin has a strong anti-lipolytic action, stimulates lipogenesis, and triggers and promotes new adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Even though recent studies have demonstrated a requirement for the insulin receptor and activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt in the process of adipogenesis (12Accili D. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Chaika O.V. Charka N. Bolle D.J. Wilden P.A. Pirrucello S.J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol.

Commun. 1995; 212: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism connecting insulin signaling with the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation remains obscure. The present data strongly suggest that at least one mechanism whereby insulin triggers the intrinsic cascade of adipocyte differentiation is via its ability to stimulate prenylation. Inhibitors of prenylation completely blocked insulin-induced differentiation of adipocytes and prevented induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPα. Inhibition of FTase also blocked the ability of insulin to activate MAP kinase and CREB. Recently, the phosphorylation of CREB has been found to be necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Inducible expression of a constitutively active VP16-CREB alone was sufficient to initiate adipogenesis as determined by triacylglycerol storage, cell morphology, and the expression of adipocyte marker genes, PPARγ and FAS (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Alternatively, expression of a non-DNA binding dominant negative mutant of CREB, KCREB, blocked adipocyte differentiation in cells treated with insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Finally, recombinant or endogenous CREB in pre-adipocyte nuclear extracts was shown to bind to putative CRE sequences in the promoters of several adipocyte-specific genes (24Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), further supporting the role of CREB in adipogenesis. Because insulin is known to promote the phosphorylation of MAP kinase and CREB (32Cheatham G. Kahn C.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and because its effect was blocked by an inhibitor of FTase, we suggest that the connection between the insulin-signaling cascade and the intrinsic cascade of adipocyte differentiation occurs via the insulin-induced and MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, downstream of farnesylated Ras (Fig.9). Shc, via its SH2 domain, and MAP kinase mediate insulin effect on FTase (20Goalstone M.L. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Berhanu P. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12805-12812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). FTase, in turn, farnesylates additional molecules of p21ras and increases its availability for subsequent stimulation. This leads to the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase and CREB, with the latter connecting insulin signaling with the intrinsic cascade of adipogenesis. This pathway does not negate or minimize the importance of the possible parallel insulin signaling via PI 3-kinase and Akt. In fact, our own studies (not shown), in concert with reports from other laboratories (14Magus R. Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Paardasani D. Lin Y. Chabot J. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 1997; 137: 3590-3593Google Scholar, 15Sosa H. Arimura S. Nishio E. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), demonstrate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin blocked adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, insulin has been also shown to exert a post-transcriptional control of adipocyte differentiation through an activation of PI 3-kinase (34Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that might complement its effect via prenylation. Our present data outline the importance of prenylation and the role of CREB in this process. The role of geranylgeranylation of Rho-A in the process of adipocyte differentiation is not understood. Clearly, an inhibitor of GGTase I prevented normal insulin-induced differentiation of adipocytes (Figs. 1and 5). Inhibition of GGTase I had no effect on either the phosphorylation of MAP kinase or CREB (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that it arrests adipogenesis at a different step that is independent of CREB signaling and possibly downstream of CREB. However, induction of the constitutively active CREB still rescued the cells from an inhibitory influence of GGTI (Fig. 7), suggesting that the CREB- and Rho-A-dependent steps are independent of one another, and the CREB pathway can overcome inhibition induced by blocked geranylgeranylation. Further studies are needed to determine the role of Rho-A in this process. Interesting studies comparing insulin with PDGF (35Hill M.N. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24313-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 36Gagnon A.M. Chen C.-S. Sorisky A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have found that even though both hormones activate PI 3-kinase, PDGF failed to promote adipocyte differentiation. In our previous studies, we observed that PDGF also failed to stimulate the prenylation process (17Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). If both PI 3-kinase- and prenylation-dependent pathways are indeed needed for physiological activation of adipogenesis, it becomes clear why insulin and not PDGF stimulates this process. Previous data from our laboratory have demonstrated that only insulin, and not PDGF, IGF-1, or EGF, augments the process of prenylation (17Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I.

Only insulin promotes the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the FTase and GGTase I and increases the activity of these enzymes. The effect of insulin appears to involve activation of the MAP kinase (20Goalstone M.L. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an additional signal involving the Shc SH2 domain (21Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Berhanu P. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12805-12812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). In summary, the present observations outline the role of prenylation in the process of the insulin-induced adipogenesis. The current findings also suggest that both the PI 3-kinase and the prenylation pathways are physiologically important to promote adipogenesis, and that insulin, a potent activator of both pathways, is a major regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Inhibition of prenylation with either specific inhibitors or statins (37Nishio E. Tomiyama K. Nakata H. Watanabe Y. Eur. J.

In vitro, DNA-PK undergoes phosphorylation of all three protein subunits (DNA-PK catalytic subunit, Ku70 and Ku80) and phosphorylation correlates with inactivation of the serine/threonine protein kinase activity of DNA-PK. Here we show that phosphorylation-induced loss of the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK is restored by the addition of the purified catalytic subunit of either protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and that this reactivation is blocked by the potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin. We also show that treating human lymphoblastoid cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin, at PP2A-selective concentrations, causes a 50–60% decrease in DNA-PK protein kinase activity, although the protein phosphatase 1 activity in these cells was unaffected. In vivo phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 was observed when cells were labeled with [32P]inorganic phosphate in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic protein phosphatases comprise several families of enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of intracellular phosphoproteins. The protein phosphatases responsible for dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of eukaryotic cells are encoded by thePPP and PPM gene families, which are defined by distinct amino acid sequences and tertiary structures (2Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The type 1, 2A, and 2B protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, respectively)1 belong to the PPP family. This family also includes a growing list of novel protein phosphatases (e.g. protein phosphatase 4, 5, 6, and 7) (2Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar,3Kutuzo M.A. Evans D.E. Andreeva A.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of protein (serine/threonine) phosphatases include endogenous proteins that regulate protein phosphatases in eukaryotic cells, such as inhibitor-1, DARPP 32, and inhibitor-2, which specifically inhibit PP1 (4MacKintosh C.

Several toxins, drugs, and tumor promotors, including okadaic acid, microcystins, tautomycin, nodularin, cantharidin, endothall, calyculin A, and fostriecin, are also highly specific inhibitors of members belonging to the PPP family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. These toxins bind to the same site on the enzymes but with different relative affinities (6MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem.

MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The differential sensitivities to these inhibitors have provided methods to identify and quantitate the levels of PP1 and PP2A in cell and tissue extracts (8Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Several of these inhibitors, including okadaic acid and fostriecin, are membrane-permeable and potently inhibit phosphatase activity in intact cells. Due to their differential affinities to PP1 and PP2A and their distinct permeation properties, these two inhibitors can inhibit PP1 and PP2A in a highly selective manner (9Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We have used these inhibitors at PP2A-selective concentrations to investigate the regulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) by protein phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. DNA-PK is composed of a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a heterodimeric DNA end-binding protein, Ku70/Ku80. DNA-PKcs and Ku are required for the repair of ionizing radiation induced DNA damage via the process of nonhomologous end joining (reviewed in Ref. 10Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of DNA-PKcs and Ku in nonhomologous end joining has yet to be determined, in vitro, DNA-PK acts as a serine/threonine protein kinase and phosphorylates a variety of protein substrates including p53 and the 32-kDa subunit of DNA replication protein A (reviewed in Refs. 10Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar and 11Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Several in vitroDNA-PK phosphorylation sites (e.g. serine 15 of human p53 and serines and threonines in the amino-terminal 30 amino acids of the replication protein A 32-kDa subunit) are phosphorylated in vivo in response to DNA damage (12Siliciano J.D.

The DNA-PK phosphorylation sites on DNA-PKcs are presently unknown; however, Ku70 is phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro predominantly at serine 6, while Ku80 is phosphorylated on at least three carboxyl-terminal sites, including serines 577 and 580 and threonine 715 (16Chan D.W. Ye R. Veillette C.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the physiological substrates of DNA-PK are unknown, a conserved aspartic acid residue in the kinase domain of DNA-PKcs is required to rescue the radiosensitive phenotype associated with deficiency of DNA-PKcs in rodent cells (17Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that DNA-PK acts as a protein kinase in vivo. Ku is phosphorylated in vivo (18Yaneva M. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5057-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although the sites of in vivophosphorylation have yet to be identified. Here we have examined the effects of protein dephosphorylation on the activity of in vitro DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and Ku. We show that dephosphorylation of self-phosphorylated DNA-PK results in reactivation of DNA-PK protein kinase activity. Moreover, we show that DNA-PK protein kinase activity is significantly reduced in cells that have been treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and fostriecin and that inhibition of protein phosphatase activity by okadaic acid significantly increases the in vivo phosphorylation state of DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80. Together, our data show that DNA-PK protein kinase activity can be regulated by reversible protein phosphorylationin vitro and that DNA-PK is a target of protein kinases and protein phosphatases in vivo. Bovine serum albumin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Tris base, EGTA, leupeptin, pepstatin, and wortmannin were from Sigma. A Mono Q (HR5/5) column and 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Okadaic acid (OA) and microcystin-LR were from Calbiochem. Dithiothreitol was from BDH. Fostriecin was a kind gift from Dr. Michel Roberge (University of British Columbia). Lymphoblastoid cells (BT) and MO59J cells were maintained in RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Log phase cells (1 × 106 cells/10-ml dish) were incubated in media containing OA or fostriecin. OA was prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide, and fostriecin was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm ascorbic acid. Control incubations included that same amount of vehicle alone. Cells were harvested either by centrifugation (BT) or trypsinization (MO59J), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by a single freeze thaw cycle as described previously (19Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic (S10) and nuclear (P10) extracts were prepared as described (20Allalunis-Turner M.J. Lintott L.G. Barron G.M. Day III, R.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5200-5202PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Human PP1γ1 cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a human (brain) cDNA library (CLONTECH) incorporating an NdeI site at the initiator codon (ATG) and a HindIII site immediately following the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCRTOPO (Invitrogen), and the sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The modified cDNA was then cloned into the NdeI/HindIII sites of the pCW vector (a kind gift from Dr. F. W. Dalhqvist, University of Oregon) and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α by standard techniques. Cells were grown in LB medium plus 1 mmMnCl2, and, after reaching anA 600 of 0.3, cells were induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 16 h and then pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min. Cells from 0.75 liters of suspension were resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMnCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% β−mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed and put through a French press cell (SIM Aminco) one time at 1100 p.s.i., and the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified extract was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a 20-ml column of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 3 ml/min. The column was equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% β−mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmMnCl2). PP1γ1 was eluted with a gradient from 0–500 mm NaCl over 200 ml with 5-ml fractions. PP1γ1 was further purified on a Mono-Q column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was developed at 1 ml/min from 0–500 mm NaCl over 40 ml, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Peak fractions were dialyzed into buffer A containing 50% glycerol and 50 mm NaCl and stored at −20 °C. The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A was purified from bovine heart as described (21Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung H.Y.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled glycogen phosphorylase a containing 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit was prepared using phosphorylase b (22Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 65-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylase kinase (23Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by the methods described. Details of the assay can be found in Ref. 4MacKintosh C. Moorhead G.B.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1999Google Scholar. Briefly, assays were performed at 30 °C in a total volume of 30 μl that included 10 μl of protein phosphatase diluted as required into buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 °C), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) plus 10 μl of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 °C), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35 plus inhibitors/activators as required). The assays were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 30 μm32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase a. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 μmol of phosphate in 1 min. In all cases, dephosphorylation of substrates was kept less than 20% to ensure the linearity of the assay. Rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-2 was purified according to Cohen et al. (24Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. Holmes C.F.B. Nimmo G.A. Tonks N.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and used at a final concentration of 200 nm in assays. All assays that included protein phosphatase inhibitors were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min before initiating the assay with substrate. Inhibitor-2 was diluted in assay buffer C immediately before use. The DNA-PKcs and Ku subunits of DNA-PK were purified from human placenta as described previously (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Kinase assays using purified proteins or cell extracts from MO59J (3 μg) or lymphoblastoid cells (3 μg) were as described (19Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) except that the synthetic peptide substrate used was PESQEAFADLWKK (26Anderson C.W. Connelly M.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Lintott L.G. Zhang H. Sipley J.A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Atassi M.Z. Methods in Protein Structure Analysis. Plenum Press, New York1995: 395-406Crossref Google Scholar). The peptide, PESEQAFADLWKK, which is not phosphorylated by DNA-PK, was used as a control (26Anderson C.W. Connelly M.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Lintott L.G. Zhang H. Sipley J.A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Atassi M.Z. Methods in Protein Structure Analysis. Plenum Press, New York1995: 395-406Crossref Google Scholar). Reactions contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 mmsynthetic peptide, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA plus 10 μg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA, and 0.25 mm ATP containing stabilized [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 500–1000 dpm/pmol) and were started by the addition of purified DNA-PK proteins (concentration as indicated). Reactions were at 30 °C for 5 min, and DNA-PK protein kinase activity was calculated as nmol of phosphate incorporated into the peptide substrate/min/mg of protein. Synthetic peptides were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Purified DNA-PKcs and Ku proteins were preincubated at 30 °C as described for activity assays, except that synthetic peptide was not present. Radiolabeled ATP was present where indicated at 0.25 mm. After 0–10 min, aliquots were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In order to reassay samples for remaining protein kinase activity, aliquots corresponding to 5–10% (v/v) or the percentage indicated of the preincubation reaction were removed and reassayed under standard kinase assay conditions with a full complement of synthetic peptide, DNA, and radiolabeled ATP as described above. For “add-back” experiments, after the indicated times, either the free catalytic subunit of PP1 (50 milliunits/ml final concentration), the free catalytic subunit of PP2A (50 milliunits/ml final concentration) or protein extracts from lymphoblastoid or MO59J cells (treated with Me2SO, OA, or fostriecin) were added to aliquots from preincubation reactions containing phosphorylated DNA-PK. At timed intervals, aliquots corresponding to 5–10% (v/v) of this reaction were removed and reassayed under standard kinase assay conditions with a full complement of synthetic peptide, DNA, and radiolabeled ATP. In identical experiments, aliquots were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of in vitrophosphorylated DNA-PKcs was estimated by excising the phosphorylated bands from the dried Coomassie-stained gels and measuring32P incorporation by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation counter. The specific activity of the radioactive ATP was calculated in cpm/pmol, and the amount of DNA-PKcs and Ku was estimated from the predicted molecular masses (∼470, 80, and 70 kDa, respectively) and the protein concentration as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. BT cells were grown to approximately midlog phase, and then cells were transferred to 15-ml conical tubes and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. Cells were then rinsed twice with phosphate-free RPMI medium. For each experiment, ∼2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-free medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated with okadaic acid (1 μm) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO for 1 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were allowed to incorporate 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (0.75 millicuries/ml) for a further 1 h, and then the label was removed and cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmNaF. DNA-PKcs and Ku were immunoprecipitated as described previously (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C and then probed with an antibody to either Ku70 or DNA-PKcs as described in Fig. 6. Approximately 2 × 107 cpm of lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation reaction. We have previously shown that incubation of purified DNA-PKcs and Ku heterodimer with DNA and Mg-ATP results in phosphorylation of all three subunits of the DNA-PK holoenzyme and time-dependent loss of protein kinase activity (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Loss of DNA-PK protein kinase activity did not occur when the purified protein was incubated with Mg-ATP in the absence of DNA or with DNA, magnesium, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of DNA-PK protein kinase activity correlates with phosphorylation of one or more of the DNA-PK subunits. An important prediction of these results is that treatment with a protein phosphatase would reverse the phosphorylation-induced loss of DNA-PK protein kinase activity. In order to test this hypothesis, purified DNA-PKcs and Ku were first incubated with DNA and Mg-ATP in order to produce phosphorylated, inactive DNA-PK. Following this 10-min incubation period, the purified catalytic subunit of either PP1 or PP2A was added to the reactions, and DNA-PK protein kinase activity was assayed. The addition of the catalytic subunit of either PP1 or PP2A resulted in a complete (PP1) or partial (PP2A) restoration of DNA-PK protein kinase activity (Fig. 1,A and B, open symbols). In contrast, when the catalytic subunit of PP1 or PP2A was preincubated with microcystin, a potent inhibitor of both protein phosphatases, no significant increase in DNA-PK protein kinase activity was observed (Fig. 1, A and B, closed symbols). Moreover, both PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits were capable of removing phosphate from DNA-PKcs, Ku70, or Ku80 (Fig.2, A and B). These results strongly support our hypothesis that the loss of DNA-PK protein kinase activity in vitro is due to reversible protein phosphorylation.Figure 2The catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A are capable of dephosphorylating in vitroautophosphorylated DNA-PK. DNA-PKcs (0.04 μg/μl) and Ku (0.013 μg/μl) (1 μg of DNA-PK total protein) were preincubated in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, and 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 20 μl for 10 min. Following the first incubation period, various concentrations of recombinant PP1 catalytic subunit (A) or PP2A catalytic subunit (purified from bovine heart) (B) were added to the reaction at 15-s intervals (as shown), and incubations were continued for a further 10 min. Following the second incubation period, microcystin-LR (1 μm final) was added at 15-s intervals to stop the dephosphorylation reactions, and samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Shown are separate exposures for DNA-PKcs (5 h at −80 °C with intensifying screens) and Ku (overnight at −80 °C with intensifying screens).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity of most known protein phosphatases is regulated by association with regulatory subunits that can target the protein phosphatase to certain subcellular locations or directly affect its activity by allosteric or other effects. It was therefore important to determine if the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK was affected by phosphorylation in vivo. Specific protein phosphatases can be inhibited by treatment of cells with particular cell-permeable protein phosphatase inhibitors. For example, treatment of human cells with okadaic acid at 1 μm results in loss of PP2A activity but not PP1 activity (27Yan Y. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31917-31924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Human lymphoblastoid (BT) cells were incubated with either Me2SO (control), okadaic acid, or fostriecin at PP2A-selective concentrations and were assayed for protein phosphatase activity using radiolabeled phosphorylasea as a substrate. Extracts were assayed either with no additions (Fig. 3 A,solid bars), with the addition of the PP1 inhibitor, inhibitor-2, at 200 nm final (Fig.3 A, open bars) or inhibitor-2 (200 nm final concentration) plus 5 nm okadaic acid (Fig. 3 A, hatched bars). In this experiment, the activity of both PP1 and PP2A is shown in assays with no additions (solid bars), whereas in assays that contained inhibitor-2, only PP2A-like protein phosphatases would be active (open bars), and in assays that contained okadaic acid (at a concentration of 5 nm final) and inhibitor-2 (hatched bars), neither of the protein phosphatases would be active. These data show that of the total phosphorylase phosphatase activity in BT cells, ∼40% is PP1 protein phosphatase activity and 60% is PP2A-like protein phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 A, DMSO, open bars compared with closed bars). Treatment of cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin, which, at the specified concentrations used, is predicted to inhibit only PP2A-like protein phosphatase activity, resulted in an ∼50% loss of phosphorylase phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 A, OA or fostriecin, solid bar). The further addition of inhibitor-2 (200 nm) to these extracts abolished the majority of the remaining protein phosphatase activity, and this is unaltered by the further addition of 5 nm OA to these extracts. This indicates that treatment of cells with either OA or fostriecin abolishes PP2A-like activity, leaving PP1 unaffected. Having established this, the same extracts were used to assay for DNA-PK protein kinase activity, and the DNA-PK protein kinase activity was reduced by ∼50% in the extracts from cells that had been treated with either okadaic acid or fostriecin (Fig. 3 B). No change in the amount of DNA-PKcs protein was detected after treatment of cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin (Fig. 3 C). These data support a model in which DNA-PK protein kinase activity is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation in vivo and indicate that, in vivo, protein phosphatases are required for maintaining DNA-PK in a highly active state. Consequently, this model would predict that DNA-PK is phosphorylated in vivo, and as the phosphorylation state of DNA-PK increases, its activity decreases. Our data therefore suggest that a protein phosphatase activity acts on DNA-PK in vivo. It was therefore important to show that in cell extracts there exists a protein phosphatase activity capable of removing phosphate from DNA-PK. Purified DNA-PK was phosphorylated and inactivated by incubation with DNA and radioactively labeled Mg-ATP. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of wortmannin to 10 μm, and in vitrophosphorylated DNA-PK protein was incubated with extracts from cells that were either untreated, treated with okadaic acid, or treated with fostriecin. The results show that extracts from untreated cells contained an activity capable of removing phosphate from in vitro phosphorylated DNA-PKcs and that the presence of inhibitor-2 (a PP1 inhibitor) had no inhibitory effect on the dephosphorylation reaction (Fig. 4, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Significantly, when cells were treated with okadaic acid or fostriecin, at PP2A-selective concentrations, no significant loss of DNA-PK phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 4–7). Again, treatment of extracts with the PP1 inhibitor, inhibitor-2, had no effect on dephosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, strongly suggesting that the phosphatase in these extracts responsible for dephosphorylating in vitro autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs is a PP2A-like enzyme. Identical results were observed for Ku70 and Ku80 (data not shown). Although the data shown in Fig. 1 suggests that PP1 is more efficient than PP2A at dephosphorylating and activating DNA-PKin vitro, it is important to note that these experiments were carried out using the free catalytic subunits of either PP1 or PP2A. These enzymes therefore lack their regulatory subunit(s) and consequently would be expected to have different properties from the naturally occurring enzymes. In order to determine whether cell extracts that had been treated with okadaic acid or fostriecin were incapable of reactivating phosphorylated DNA-PK, purified DNA-PK was phosphorylated and inactivated in vitro and then incubated with extracts from cells that were either untreated or treated with PP2A-selective concentrations of okadaic acid or fostriecin. Since BT cells contain abundant DNA-PK protein kinase activity, which would complicate interpretation of results, a human cell line that lacks DNA-PKcs protein (MO59J) was used for these experiments (28Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M.W. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Protein extracts from untreated MO59J cells contained an activity that was capable of reactivating DNA-PK, whereas treatment of MO59J cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin significantly decreased the ability of these extracts to reactivate DNA-PK (Fig. 5). These data again support our hypothesis that human cells contain a PP2A-like enzyme that can both remove phosphate groups from in vitro phosphorylated DNA-PK and reverse phosphorylation-induced loss of protein kinase activity. Although our data show that a PP2A-like enzyme can dephosphorylate DNA-PK that has been phosphorylated in vitro, it was important to determine whether DNA-PK is phosphorylated in vivo. Ku70 and Ku80 have previously been shown to be phosphorylated on serine in vivo (18Yaneva M. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5057-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); however, to date,in vivo phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs has not been reported. Human lymphoblastoid (BT) cells were therefore incubated with32P-labeled inorganic phosphate in phosphate-free RPMI in the absence or presence of okadaic acid (1 μm final). DNA-PKcs and Ku70/Ku80 subunits were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (42-27) and a polyclonal antibody to recombinant Ku70 (Ab68) respectively, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. Treatment with okadaic acid was found to cause a dramatic increase in the in vivo phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 6 A), indicating that DNA-PK undergoes reversible phosphorylation in vivo. In addition, treatment of cells with okadaic acid increased the endogenous levels of phosphorylation of both Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that both DNA-PKcs and Ku are modified by reversible phosphorylation in vivo. Western blotting of the membrane with antibodies to either DNA-PKcs (Figs. 6 B) or Ku70 (Fig.6 D) shows that equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated. Purified DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 undergo DNA-dependent phosphorylation in vitro, and that phosphorylation is associated with loss of DNA-PK protein kinase activity (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We have previously mapped the major in vitroKu phosphorylation sites, and identification of the in vitrophosphorylation sites in DNA-PKcs is in progress. 2Y. Yu, D. Chan and S. P. Lees-Miller, unpublished results. In this study, we show that the catalytic subunit of either PP1 or PP2A is capable of dephosphorylating DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 in vitro and that this results in restoration of DNA-PK protein kinase activity. These data therefore strongly suggest that phosphorylation of one or more of the DNA-PK subunits is directly responsible for the loss of protein kinase activity. We estimate that in vitro, DNA-PKcs was phosphorylated on at least seven sites after 1 h of incubation under the conditions used in these experiments. Phosphorylation occurs predominantly on serine residues (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Studies with synthetic peptides indicate that the protein phosphorylation consensus for DNA-PKcs is serine or threonine followed by glutamine (19Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, DNA-PK can also phosphorylate serines that are followed by tyrosine (16Chan D.W. Ye R. Veillette C.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Anderson C.W. Connelly M.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Lintott L.G. Zhang H. Sipley J.A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Atassi M.Z. Methods in Protein Structure Analysis. Plenum Press, New York1995: 395-406Crossref Google Scholar), or valine (29Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the phosphorylation recognition motif may be more complex than originally proposed. The cDNA sequence of DNA-PKcs predicts 29 serine or threonine residues that are in an SQ or TQ motif, any of which could be a potential autophosphorylation site. The Ku heterodimer is also phosphorylated at several sites in vitro, one major site on Ku70 and at least three on Ku80 (16Chan D.W. Ye R. Veillette C.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At this time, it is not known if one single phosphorylation event is sufficient to inactivate DNA-PK or whether several phosphorylation events contribute to loss of protein kinase activity. We previously showed that DNA-PK-phosphorylated Ku70 is able to bind DNA and that phosphorylated DNA-PKcs dissociates from DNA-bound Ku (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loss of kinase activity is due to inactivation of DNA-PKcs and not Ku. However, at this time, we cannot exclude the possibility that phosphorylation of Ku also plays a role in regulating the activity of DNA-PK. We show, for the first time, that DNA-PKcs is phosphorylatedin vivo. In preliminary experiments, low levels of phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs were observed in the absence of okadaic acid 3D. Chan and S. P. Lees-Miller, unpublished data.; however, here we show that the addition of okadaic acid significantly increased the phosphorylation state of DNA-PKcs in vivo (Fig.6 A). These data suggest that DNA-PKcs is the target of protein phosphatases and protein kinases in vivo and that the activity of protein phosphatases is required to maintain DNA-PK in a highly active state. A prediction of this hypothesis is that DNA-PK would be expected to be largely dephosphorylated in its active form and highly phosphorylated in its inactive form. We have shown that,in vitro, autophosphorylation results in loss of DNA-PK protein kinase activity, again suggesting that DNA-PK is active in a dephosphorylated form and inactive in its phosphorylated form. In vitro, co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs results in dissociation of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs from phosphorylated DNA-bound Ku (15Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Again, this is consistent with phosphorylation resulting in an inactive form of DNA-PK. It remains to be seen whether DNA-PK is regulated by autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by other protein kinasesin vivo. These observations also have implications for the repair of DNA double strand breaks by nonhomologous end joiningin vivo. We speculate that Ku and DNA-PKcs assemble at the site of a DNA strand break in an ordered fashion, thus generating the active protein kinase. Subsequently, phosphorylation of DNA-PK, either by itself or by another protein kinase, may serve to inactivate DNA-PK and possibly remove DNA-PKcs from the site of the DNA lesion. DNA-PKcs is a member of a growing family of serine/threonine protein kinases that bears significant amino acid similarity to the catalytic domain of phosphoinositide 3 kinases (30Hartley K.O. Gell D.

Interestingly, the p110 subunit of the class 1A phosphoinositide-3 kinases has serine/threonine protein kinase activity toward the Src homology 2 domain-containing targeting subunit, p85, and increased incorporation of phosphate into p85 is associated with a dramatic decrease in phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity (33Dhand R.

Also, autophosphorylation of the p110δ subunit of the class II phosphoinositide 3 kinases down-regulates its lipid kinase activity (34Vanhaesbroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S.

Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation-dependent inactivation may be a characteristic of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like family of enzymes. We have demonstrated the presence of a protein phosphatase activity in crude extracts of human cells that is capable of dephosphorylating DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 and restoring the kinase activity of phosphorylated inactivated DNA-PK. This activity has properties expected of a PP2A-like enzyme, since its activity is inhibited at PP2A-selective concentrations of okadaic acid and fostriecin. Further studies will be required in order to identify the protein phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating DNA-PK in vivo. We thank Seong-Cheol Son for supplying highly purified DNA-PKcs and Ku for these studies. Doug Chan is acknowledged for preliminary in vivo labeling experiments. We also thank Dr. Michel Roberge for providing a sample of fostriecin and Dr. Jim Lees-Miller for reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1973231543,"For many years, polyclonal antibodies raised against the plant glycoprotein horseradish peroxidase have been used to specifically stain the neural and male reproductive tissue of Drosophila melanogaster. This epitope is considered to be of carbohydrate origin, but no glycan structure from Drosophila has yet been isolated that could account for this cross-reactivity. Here we report that N-glycan core alpha1,3-linked fucose is, as judged by preabsorption experiments, indispensable for recognition of Drosophila embryonic nervous system by anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody. Further, we describe the identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography of two Drosophila N-glycans that, as already detected in other insects, carry both alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-linked fucose residues on the proximal core GlcNAc. Moreover, we have isolated three cDNAs encoding alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues from Drosophila. One of the cDNAs, when transformed into Pichia pastoris, was found to direct expression of core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase activity. This recombinant enzyme preferred as substrate a biantennary core alpha1,6-fucosylated N-glycan carrying two non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine residues (GnGnF6; Km 11 microm) over the same structure lacking a core fucose residue (GnGn; Km 46 microm). The Drosophila core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase enzyme was also shown to be able to fucosylate N-glycan structures of human transferrin in vitro, this modification correlating with the acquisition of binding to anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1521876081,"Type IV collagen, the major component of basement membranes (BMs), is a family of six homologous chains (α1–α6) that have a tissue-specific distribution. The chains assemble into supramolecular networks that differ in the chain composition. In this study, a novel network was identified and characterized in the smooth muscle BMs of aorta and bladder. The noncollagenous (NC1) hexamers solubilized by collagenase digestion were fractionated by affinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies against the α5 and α6 NC1 domains and then characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Both BMs were found to contain a novel α1·α2·α5·α6 network besides the classical α1·α2 network.

Moreover, degradation andde novo synthesis of vascular BMs are critical events in the angiogenesis processes. BMs function is impaired in hereditary and acquired diseases in which type IV collagen is affected, including Alport's syndrome, a hereditary form of progressive renal disease; diffuse leiomyomatosis, a benign proliferation of smooth muscle cells; and Goodpasture syndrome, an anti-type IV collagen autoimmune disease (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Type IV collagen is the major structural component of the BM, and it consists of a family of six homologous α(IV) chains, designated α1–α6 (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each chain is characterized by a long collagenous domain of ∼1400 residues of Gly-X-Y repeats, interrupted by ∼20 short noncollagenous sequences, and by a noncollagenous (NC1) domain of ∼230 residues at the carboxyl terminus. Three α(IV) chains assemble into triple-helical molecules (protomers) that further associate to form supramolecular networks by dimerization at the carboxyl terminus through NC1 domains and by formation of tetramers at the amino terminus (2Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The chain composition, and thus the properties of the type IV collagen networks are influenced by two factors. First, the chain composition of networks is limited by chain availability: the six chains show a tissue-specific expression pattern, with the α1 and α2 chains being ubiquitous and the α3–α6 chains having a more restricted distribution. Second, the NC1 domain confers specificity to the chain-specific assembly of networks (3Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30716-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); thus, yet unidentified recognition sequences must exist within the NC1 domain that direct the selection of chains to form triple-helical protomers and of triple-helical protomers to form networks. For instance, although the α1–α5 chains are coexpressed in glomerular BM, they segregate into an α1·α2 network and a disulfide cross-linked α3·α4·α5 network, characterized by loops and supercoiling (4Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The existence of the latter network provides an explanation for the glomerular BM defect in Alport's syndrome, in which mutations in the genes encoding any of the α3, α4, and α5 chains perturb the assembly of the α3·α4·α5 network with the consequent loss of all three chains and progressive renal failure (3Boutaud A.

These include the smooth muscle BMs of bladder, uterus, stomach, esophagus, small intestine, vasculature as well as the BMs of skin and the Bowman's capsule of the kidney (5Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M.

The existence of a novel α5·α6 network was suggested based on the immunohistochemical co-localization of these chains, but a link between α5 and α6 has not yet been biochemically proven. Mutations in the COL4A5gene encoding the α5 chain of type IV collagen also cause the loss of the α6 chain from these BMs in the X-linked form of Alport's syndrome (9Peissel B. Geng L. Kalluri R. Kashtan C. Rennke H.G. Gallo G.R. Yoshioka K. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. Zhou J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Hino S. Takemura T. Sado Y.

In rare instances of X-linked Alport's syndrome associated with diffuse leiomyomatosis, deletions occur in both the COL4A5 gene and the adjacent COL4A6 gene (encoding the α6 chain), leading to both renal failure and a benign proliferation of smooth muscle cells (12Zhou J.

Science. 1993; 261: 1167-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).In this study, the network organization of the α5 and α6 chains of the smooth muscle BMs of aorta and bladder was investigated to acquire knowledge important for understanding their structure, function, and defects in disease. Surprisingly, the findings revealed the existence of a novel network composed of the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains together, but not of the predicted network composed solely of the α5 and α6 chains. Evidence was obtained that supports our previous finding that the NC1 domains play a recognition role in the chain-specific assembly of networks. The linkage between the α5 and α6 chains in the α1·α2·α5·α6 network provides a molecular explanation for the loss of both α5 and α6 chains in X-linked Alport's syndrome, in which the α5 chain is mutated.RESULTSChain Composition of Type IV Collagen of Bovine Smooth Muscle BMPrevious studies have shown that the α5 and α6 chains, along with the α1 and α2 chains, are co-localized in the smooth muscle BMs of murine, canine, and human tissues (5Ninomiya Y.

In this study, bovine aorta and bladder BMs were chosen as prototypes for the smooth muscle BMs of the vasculature and viscera because bovine tissues are amenable for isolation of sufficient quantities of type IV collagen for biochemical analyses (3Boutaud A.

Immunostaining with chain-specific mAbs (Fig. 1) showed that bovine aorta (a–g) and bladder (h–n) BMs contained the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains, but were devoid of the α3 and α4 chains. The staining pattern for the aorta showed co-localization of the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains in the smooth muscle BMs of the media. An arteriole, recognized as a circle of blue-colored nuclei and characterized by a thick wall of smooth muscle cells, also stained for all four chains in adventitia. In contrast, subendothelial BM, recognized as a thin layer of intima lining the upper end of the arterial wall, contained only the α1 and α2 chains. In bladder, the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains were co-localized throughout the smooth muscle BMs of the lamina propria and media as well as in epithelial cell BM. The capillaries, recognized as rings with a thin membrane, contained only the α1 and α2 chains. These results show that the smooth muscle BMs of both bovine aorta and bladder are composed of α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains. These four chains can be arranged in several possible networks: separate α1·α2 and α5·α6 networks; a composite α1·α2·α5·α6 network; or a mixture of networks with chain compositions of α1·α2·α5, α1·α2·α6, α1·α5·α6, and α2·α5·α6. Because all chains were co-localized, immunohistochemical analysis alone could not distinguish among these possibilities.Arrangement of Chains in Protomers and NetworksAnalysis of the Type IV Collagen Networks from Aorta BM by Digestion with PseudolysinOur previous studies (4Gunwar S.

Moreover, digestion of glomerular BM at 4 °C followed by digestion at 25 °C differentially solubilized two distinct networks, one composed of the α1 and α2 chains and the other composed of the α3, α4, and α5 chains (3Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Thus, pseudolysin cleavage can reveal information about the protomer and network organization of chains. In the case of aorta BM, rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed that the truncated protomers existed as dimers, connected through NC1-NC1 domain interactions (Fig. 2 b). Unlike glomerular BM, no differential solubilization of networks was observed for aorta BM, as the relative quantities of the NC1 domains of the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains solubilized at 4 °C (Fig. 2 c) and at 25 °C (Fig. 2 d) did not differ. These results indicate that the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains are arranged in triple-helical protomers, connected through NC1-NC1 interactions, forming one or more networks that are equally susceptible to pseudolysin digestion.Figure 2Analysis of pseudolysin-solubilized aorta BM by electron microscopy and Western blotting. Digestion with pseudolysin solubilized truncated protomers of type IV collagen that retained the NC1-NC1 junction between two protomers (the NC1 hexamer) and a long triple-helical fragment (a). Truncated protomers were solubilized from aorta BM for 24 h at 4 °C and examined by rotary shadowing electron microscopy (b); the barrepresents 100 nm. The chain compositions of truncated protomers solubilized from aorta BM by pseudolysin digestion at 4 °C (c) and 25 °C (d) were analyzed by collagenase digestion of the protomers, followed by Western blotting with mAbs H11 (α1) and H22 (α2), mAb5 (α5), and rabbit anti-α6 synthetic peptide (α6). D and M indicate the positions of NC1 dimers and monomers on the Western blot, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Precipitating mAbs to α5 and α6 NC1 DomainsThe arrangement of the α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains was investigated by characterization of the NC1 hexamers isolated from aorta and bladder BMs by collagenase digestion. The monomer and dimer subunits of an NC1 hexamer reflect the identity of the chains composing two triple-helical protomers that are adjoined by their NC1 domains forming a network (24Kuhn K.

Engel J. Wiedemann H. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 2In the type IV collagen suprastructure, two protomers interact at the carboxyl terminus via their NC1 domains, thus forming a stable NC1 hexamer complex (three NC1 domains from each protomer) that can be excised by digestion of the BMs with bacterial collagenase. Because of the special position of the NC1 hexamers in the suprastructure (connecting two adjoining protomers), the chain composition of the hexamers reflects the chain composition of the parent network. Moreover, the dimer subunits (disulfide-linked monomers) of dissociated hexamers reflect which chains are cross-linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds and therefore which chains exist in each of the adjoining protomers. In previous studies of glomerular BM, a strategy has been perfected to (a) separate NC1 hexamers of varying compositions using chain-specific mAbs that have the capacity to immunoprecipitate native hexamers and to (b) identify the chain identity of hexamer subunits by Western blot analysis using chain-specific monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mouse mAb1 and mAb3, targeted to the α1 and α3 NC1 domains, respectively, were used to separate two subpopulations of NC1 hexamers, an α1·α2 NC1 and an α3·α4·α5 NC1 hexamer, establishing the existence of the α1·α2(IV) and α3·α4·α5(IV) networks in glomerular BM (3Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

In a previous study (6Seki T. Naito I. Oohashi T. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), mAbs B51 and B66 were produced using native NC1 hexamers from bovine glomerular BM as the immunogen. The specificity and precipitating properties of these mAbs were investigated herein. As shown in Fig. 3a, mAbs B51 and B66 are specific for the α5 and α6 NC1 domains, respectively, as determined by their reactivity against α1–α6 NC1 domains. The capacity of mAbs B51 and B66 to bind native NC1 hexamers was demonstrated by (a) their capacity to stain tissue sections without acid/urea treatment (data not shown), (b) their capacity to coprecipitate the α5 and α6 NC1 domains along with other NC1 domains in immunoprecipitation experiments or in affinity chromatography (see below), and (c) preferential reactivity with native rather than dissociated NC1 hexamers as measured by ELISA (Fig. 3 b). Thus, mAbs B51 and B66 have the required properties for structural studies of NC1 hexamers, analogous to those of the well described mAb1 and mAb3 (see above). In contrast, the H-series of mAbs, previously prepared for the six distinct NC1 domains using short synthetic peptides rather than the NC1 hexamer (5Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M. Iyama K. Naito I. Kishiro Y.

Renal BM hexamers were coated at 300 ng/well under native (phosphate-buffered saline; black bars) and dissociating (6 m guanidinium hydrochloride;hatched bars) conditions. mAbs B51 and B66 preferentially bound to native hexamers, similar to the precipitating mAb1 and mAb3. In contrast, non-precipitating antibody (non-pp. Ab) H52 and mAb5 raised against the α5 NC1 domain and the rabbit antibodies raised against the α6 NC1 domain, all produced against synthetic peptides, showed little reactivity for the native hexamers, but reacted well with the dissociated hexamers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fractionation and Composition of NC1 Hexamers from Aorta BMThe NC1 hexamers of aorta BM, chosen as a prototype for the vascular smooth muscle BMs, were solubilized by collagenase digestion and then fractionated according to their composition by immunoaffinity chromatography (or immunoprecipitation) using mAbs B51 and B66 and mAb1. Collagenase digests the triple-helical collagenous domain, 3A small number of Gly-X-Yrepeats (typically two) remain at the amino terminus of the NC1 domains solubilized by collagenase digestion of type IV collagen networks (35Gunwar S.

These short sequences constitute the junction between the triple-helical domain and the NC1 domain. but leaves intact the NC1 hexamer that constitutes the interface between two adjacent protomers (Fig. 4, top). The unfractionated hexamers were characterized by Western blot analysis and shown to be composed of the α1, α2, α5, and α6 NC1 domains, but devoid of the α3 and α4 NC1 domains (Fig. 4 a), consistent with the tissue staining patterns shown in Fig.1 a. The hexamers bound to mAb B51 contained all four NC1 domains, indicating that α5 coexists in hexamers with the α1, α2, and α6 NC1 domains (Fig. 4 b); this fraction amounted to 12% of the total hexamers. Hexamers not bound to B51 mAb (the remaining 88%) contained exclusively α1 and α2 NC1 domains (Fig.4 c). The absence of the α6 NC1 domain in the unbound fraction demonstrates that the α6 NC1 domain always accompanies the α5 NC1 domain in hexamers, thus ruling out the existence of α6 homohexamers and of α1·α6, α2·α6, and α1·α2·α6 heterohexamers. Similarly, the hexamers bound to B66 mAb contained all four NC1 domains (Fig. 4 d), whereas those not bound consisted of α1 and α2 NC1 domains only (Fig. 4 e). This indicates that, in turn, the α5 NC1 domain always accompanies the α6 NC1 domain in hexamers, thus further excluding the existence of α5 homohexamers and of α1·α5, α2·α5, and α1·α2·α5 heterohexamers.Figure 4Analysis of the NC1 hexamers from aorta BM.

Center, the aorta NC1 hexamers were fractionated using mAbs B51 (b andc) and B66 (d and e) and mAb1 (f and g), and then the bound (b,d, and f) and unbound (c,e, and g) fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with chain-specific antibodies as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Bottom, the fractionation of the two NC1 hexamer populations of aorta BMs is shown schematically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The allowable NC1 hexamer combinations that remain are the α1 and α2 homohexamers as well as the α1·α2, α5·α6, α1·α5·α6, α2·α5·α6, and α1·α2·α5·α6 heterohexamers. To further distinguish among these possibilities, the aorta BM hexamers were fractionated with mAb1: all four NC1 domains were bound (Fig. 4 f), and none remained unbound (Fig.4 g). This indicates that not only α2 NC1 domains, but also α5 and α6 NC1 domains must always be associated with α1 NC1 domains in hexamers, ruling out the existence of the α2 NC1 homohexamers as well as that of the α5·α6 and α2·α5·α6 NC1 heterohexamers. The permitted combinations remaining are hexamers of α1 only, α1·α2, α1·α5·α6, and α1·α2·α5·α6 NC1. The first two represent the allowable combinations in the hexamer fraction that did not bind to mAb B51 (or B66): the α1·α2 NC1 hexamer must exist to account for the coprecipitation of α2 by mAb1, but the coexistence of an α1 homohexamer could not be ruled out because a precipitating mAb to α2 was not available. The last two represent the allowable combinations in the hexamer fraction bound to mAbs B51 and B66. The α1·α2·α5·α6 NC1 hexamer must exist to account for the coprecipitation of α2 by mAbs B51 and B66. The coexistence of the α1·α5·α6 NC1 hexamer cannot be entirely ruled out based on these data alone, but it is inconsistent with the two-dimensional PAGE analysis (see below). Thus, aorta BMs consist of two NC1 hexamer populations, α1·α2 and α1·α2·α5·α6, representing 88 and 12% abundance, respectively (Fig. 4, bottom); the experimental evidence for the depicted organization of subunits in the NC1 hexamers is described below. Importantly, these results also exclude the existence of hexamers composed of α5 NC1 only, α6 NC1 only, and α5·α6 NC1, which eliminates certain arrangements of the α5 and α6 chains in protomers (see below). These findings allow an interpretation of the sites in the aorta tissue for which the respective chains are localized. Hence, subendothelial BM contains the α1·α2 NC1 hexamer, whereas smooth muscle BM contains both the α1·α2 NC1 hexamer and the α1·α2·α5·α6 NC1 hexamer.Fractionation and Composition of NC1 Hexamers from Bladder BMThe NC1 hexamers of bladder BMs, chosen as a prototype of visceral smooth muscle BM, were analyzed in an analogous fashion to determine whether the composition of smooth muscle BMs is tissue-specific. Fractionation of the bladder BM hexamers using mAbs B51 (Fig. 5, b andc), B66 (d and e) and mAb1 (f and g) yielded the same qualitative results as the analysis of aorta hexamers. However, the α1·α2·α5·α6(IV) hexamer population was more abundant in bladder BM (∼30%) than in aorta BM (∼18%). These results establish that the smooth muscle BM of the bladder contains hexamers composed of α1·α2 and α1·α2·α5·α6 NC1 domains, representing 70 and 30% abundance, respectively (Fig. 5,bottom). These results indicate that the basic organization of NC1 hexamers is the same in the smooth muscle BMs of two distinct tissues.Figure 5Analysis of the NC1 hexamers from bladder BM.

The dimer subunits of these NC1 hexamers, observed under the dissociative conditions of SDS-PAGE, contain intermolecular disulfide bonds that connect NC1 domains of chains from each of two adjoining protomers (25Weber S. Engel J. Wiedemann H. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. J. Biol.

The identities of NC1 dimers as well as monomers were determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with chain-specific mAbs (Fig. 6 a). To simplify the analysis, the α1·α2 and α1·α2·α5·α6 NC1 hexamers of bladder BM were separately studied.Figure 6Organization of the chains in the NC1 hexamers analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis."

Biol. 1999; 63: 189-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn is associated with high malignancy and poor prognosis. A complex network of structural and regulatory factors ensures that chromosomes segregate evenly in daughter cells and prevents resumption of DNA synthesis before mitosis has been completed. This process is subject to control mechanisms collectively referred to as the post-mitotic checkpoint (3Lanni J.S. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A large body of data clearly documents the key role of thep53 tumor suppressor gene in the G1/S checkpoint in response to DNA damage, whereby DNA replication is prevented until repair has occurred, or apoptosis is induced when repair is ineffective (reviewed in Ref. 4Bates S. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Both p53 and its major regulatory target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, also act at later cell cycle stages and are implicated in the G2 checkpoint, which prevents mitotic entry following post-replicative DNA damage (5Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar,6O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These p53-dependent regulatory pathways rest upon the ability of p53 to act as a “sensor”; of DNA damage and are now well clarified. A more intricate aspect of cell cycle checkpoints is being unraveled in a growing number of studies that indicate that p53 also contributes to a checkpoint triggered in response to mitotic spindle defects (3, 7, 8; reviewed in Ref. 9Meek D.W. Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar). Nocodazole (Noc)1 is a well known tubulin-depolymerizing agent that inhibits spindle assembly and triggers a response known as the mitotic spindle checkpoint, following which mitotic progression is arrested (10Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 310-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 11Kirsch-Volders M. Cundari E. Verdoodt B.

Mutagenesis. 1999; 14: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and references therein). In previous work (13Casenghi M. Mangiacasale R. Tuynder M. Caillet-Fauquet P. Elhajouji A. Lavia P. Mousset S. Kirsch-Volders M. Cundari E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) we sought to investigate the requirement of p53 activity in response to failure of the mitotic spindle. Two human isogenic cell lines, i.e. the K562 (p53-negative) erythroleukemia cell line and a parvovirus-resistant derivative clone named KS, which reexpresses p53, were continuously exposed to Noc. Human lymphoblastoid AHH1 cells were also examined in parallel experiments. We found that the activation of the proper spindle checkpoint, revealed by a delay in mitotic progression in the presence of spindle damage, was independent of p53. However, mitotic arrest was transient, and, after a delay of variable length, cells achieved mitotic exit even in the absence of spindle (mitotic slippage). At that stage, the cell cycle patterns of cell lines differed dramatically depending on their p53 status; only p53-deficient K562 cells progressed through the cell cycle in the presence of Noc, resuming DNA synthesis and hence entering a polyploid cell cycle. On the contrary, p53-expressing KS and AHH1 cells stopped cell cycle progression after the first mitotic round, degraded cyclin B, and arrested in the following G1 phase with a 4C DNA content. These results converge with data obtained by other groups (reviewed in Ref. 9Meek D.W. Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that G1 arrest in tetraploid cells (post-mitotic checkpoint) is p53-dependent. In a further step to understand the mechanism of action of p53 in the post-mitotic checkpoint, we examined the response of cells to transient exposure to Noc, i.e. over the duration of one cell cycle only. We report here that transient exposure to Noc generates a prolonged signal for p53 activation, which persists during the first cell cycle after Noc removal, i.e. when a functional spindle is in fact allowed to reassemble. In addition, Noc alters the subcellular localization of p53 during mitosis. Indeed, p53 associates with centrosomes in normal mitotic cells; in contrast, this association is disrupted by Noc and is not reestablished in cells that achieve mitotic exit after transient exposure to Noc. Thus, the inhibition of spindle assembly by Noc is reflected by the failure of p53 to associate with structures of the mitotic apparatus; in turn, delocalization and prolonged activation of p53 are associated with maintenance of a cell cycle inhibitory signal in the G1 phase that follows the removal of the spindle-damaging agent. Human cell lines AHH1 (non-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line) and K562 (erythroleukemic cell line) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cultures were used for all experiments. Where indicated, AHH1 cells were transfected by electroporation (975 microfarads and 250 V) with a geneticin (G418)-resistant construct encoding a temperature-sensitive version of the p53 protein (p53Val135), which at 38 °C acts as a dominant negative factor for wild-type p53. Control cells in these experiments were generated by transfection with empty vector carrying the G418 resistance gene alone, yielding the control cell line henceforth designated AHH1neo. Both transfected cell lines were kept under selection by culturing in the presence of 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained as polyclonal populations (AHH1dnp53cells). Cell cultures were exposed to Noc for 20 h, then washed in fresh medium, and cultured in Noc-free medium for the times indicated in the text. Noc was dissolved in Me2SO (both from Sigma) at a 1 mg/ml concentration. The required volume of 1 mg/ml Noc solution was directly added to exponentially growing cultures so as to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Aliquots of 5 × 106 cells were withdrawn from the cultures at the indicated times and centrifuged at low speed at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and lysed as described (14Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts were resuspended in loading buffer (4% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue), boiled for 8 min, briefly centrifuged, and finally subjected to 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresed proteins were electrotransferred at 100 mA for 75 min onto a Trans-blot nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) low fat milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following primary antibodies in 5% milk, TBST: anti-cyclin B1 (GNS1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-245), anti-p53 (DO-7, Dako, M7001), anti-p21 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-397), anti-cyclin E (Ab-1, Calbiochem, CC05). All primary antibodies were used at 0.5 μg/ml. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA replication was monitored essentially as described (15Battistoni A. Guarguaglini G. Degrassi F. Pittoggi C. Palena A. Di Matteo G. Pisano C. Cundari E. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2345-2357PubMed Google Scholar) after addition of BrdUrd (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, 45 μm final concentration) to the culture medium 30 min before harvesting the cells. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol (30 min, 4 °C), washed twice in 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 3 m HCl for 45 min to denature the DNA. Cells were then exposed to anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Dako clone Bu20a, M0744) and to secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (Vector Laboratories, FI2000) and were finally stained with propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed using a FACStar (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) Plus flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) and the WinMDI software. 10,000 events were recorded for each sample. The amplification scale was logarithmic for FSC-H and FL1-H parameters and linear for SSC-H, FL2-A, FL2-H, and FL2-W. Photomultiplier tension was set so as to place the peak corresponding to 2C DNA content (G0/G1) at channel 200 in the FL2-H histogram. A similar procedure, except for the HCl step, was adapted to measure the DNA content and the fluorescence associated with anti-cyclin B1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 (see above for details), and MPM-2 (16; Dako M3514) antibodies. A negative control was also prepared for each sample by treating the cells with a mouse nonspecific IgG and secondary FITC-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In all types of analysis, cell aggregates were carefully gated out using FL2-Wversus FL2-A bivariant graphs. Cells were washed, spread on glass coverslips by centrifugation, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell preparations were permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature and 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Fixed and permeabilized cells were pre-incubated in 20% goat serum for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber and then incubated for 2 h with anti-p53 antibody. Mouse monoclonal clone DO-7 (Dako M 7001, 1:100) was mostly used (4 μg/ml); in certain experiments sheep polyclonal clone Ab-7 (Oncogene Science PC35, 1:200) was used. Antibodies to centrosomal components included the following: rabbit anti-centrin antibody, described in Ref. 17Bobinnec Y. Khodjakov A. Mir L.M. Rieder C.L. Eddé B. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1575-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar (1:500 dilution), rabbit anti-γ tubulin (Sigma T3559, 1:2000 dilution), and anti-glutamylated tubulin (GT335), as indicated in Ref. 17Bobinnec Y.

After three washes in 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody against centrin or γ-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc2091, 1:400) for 30 min at 37 °C. After three more washes cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories FI2000, 1:300) directed against anti-p53 antibody for 30 min. Cell spreads were counterstained with 0.2 μg/ml DAPI for 10 min at room temperature to stain the DNA and mounted on glass slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cell preparations were examined under an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with epifluorescence, and photographs were taken (× 100 objective) using a cooled camera device (Photometrics). In previous experiments designed to analyze the mechanisms preventing polyploidization, we examined human non-transformed AHH1 cells that were continuously cultured in the presence of Noc. The cell cycle progressed normally until the first mitotic division; after a transient mitotic delay, cells resumed mitosis and eventually arrested in a G1-like tetraploid state. This pattern was similar to that observed in the p53-proficient KS cell line and differed from that of K562 cells, which lack functional p53 and continue to progress into the cell cycle in the presence of Noc (13Casenghi M. Mangiacasale R. Tuynder M. Caillet-Fauquet P. Elhajouji A. Lavia P. Mousset S. Kirsch-Volders M. Cundari E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 2M. Ciciarello, R. Mangiacasale, and E. Cundari, unpublished data.Thus, Noc activates a similar post-mitotic checkpoint pathway both in AHH1 cells and in KS cells. To further investigate the cell cycle inhibitory mechanisms triggered by spindle failure, we examined cell cultures that were exposed to Noc for a length of time allowing one cell division and subsequently cultured in the absence of Noc. AHH1 and K562 cells were exposed to Noc for 20 h, then washed, and further incubated in Noc-free growth medium. Cell cycle progression was examined by simultaneous FACS analysis of BrdUrd incorporation into newly replicating DNA and of the genomic content revealed by propidium iodide incorporation. In these experiments both cell lines were effectively arrested in G2/M in the presence of Noc. Upon Noc removal, both cell lines rapidly exited mitosis; 2 h after the block release, about 50% of the cells had reached the G1 phase (Fig.1 A). Thereafter a dramatic difference in cell cycle resumption was observed between cell lines; 20 h after Noc removal, DNA replication was actively resumed in p53-deficient K562 cells, the cell cycle profile of which was similar to that of asynchronously cycling cultures (Fig. 1 A,lower row). In contrast, AHH1 cultures remained blocked with a similar cell cycle profile for at least 20 h after release from Noc arrest (Fig. 1 A, upper row); after 48 h some resumption of cell cycle progression began; only 72 h after Noc removal, roughly corresponding to the length of three cell cycles in normal conditions, did AHH1 cells eventually recover the typical distribution of asynchronously cycling cultures (Fig. 1 A). These data therefore depict a significant difference between p53-proficient and p53-defective cells in the ability to induce a durable arrest after spindle failure; this difference is most evident 20 h after Noc release. By Western immunoblotting assays (Fig. 1 B), AHH1 cells accumulated p53 during Noc exposure as expected (13Casenghi M. Mangiacasale R. Tuynder M. Caillet-Fauquet P. Elhajouji A. Lavia P. Mousset S. Kirsch-Volders M. Cundari E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Stewart Z.A. Tang L.J. Pietenpol J.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); furthermore, p53 levels peaked at 20 h after Noc removal and gradually declined thereafter (Fig. 1 B). The gene encoding p21 is the best characterized transcriptional target of p53, and its expression is triggered by several cell cycle-disrupting agents. Our experiments show that p21 protein levels also peak 20 h after release from Noc arrest and substantially parallel the p53 pattern of expression. Thus, the persistence of G1 arrest in AHH1 cultures in the first cell cycle after removal of Noc coincides with the highest induction of the p53/p21 pathway. The expression of cell cycle markers was examined to determine the molecular features associated with the induction of prolonged arrest in AHH1 cell cultures. In these experiments we focused on the interval of time during which the checkpoint was effective, i.e. the first cell cycle after Noc removal. A time course analysis of AHH1 cell extracts by Western immunoblotting (Fig.2 A) shows that during the first 20 h of culture in the presence of Noc, cells accumulate cyclin B, as expected; subsequently, cyclin B becomes fully degraded within the first 4 h of release and fails to be newly synthesized for as long as 20 h after Noc release. Concomitantly, cells gradually accumulate cyclin E during the first 4 h after Noc removal, indicating that mitotic exit has occurred; cyclin E continues to be highly expressed thereafter. Thus, only a minor fraction, if any, of the AHH1 cells that had been seen to be arrested with a 4C DNA content after 20 h from Noc removal (Fig. 1 A,upper row) are capable of reexpressing cyclin B, whereas most of the cell population maintains high levels of cyclin E expression (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that the 4C-containing subpopulation is in fact constituted by tetraploid cells produced by mitotic slippage and arrested in a G1-like state. To further confirm this interpretation, cyclin B expression was directly investigated in AHH1 cell populations separated for their DNA content by biparametric FACS analysis (Fig. 2 B). We also investigated the expression of a subset of mitotic markers independent of cyclins, i.e. the G2/M-specific phosphoepitopes reactive to the MPM2 antibody (16Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). FACS analysis unambiguously indicates that AHH1 cells exit mitosis after Noc removal, as indicated by the disappearance both of cyclin B and of MPM2 antigens in the entire cell population, regardless of the genome content. Thus, exposure of AHH1 cells to Noc during one cell cycle induces a prolonged arrest in the G1 phase of the following cell cycle, in cell populations with a diploid or tetraploid content. We and others previously showed that the post-mitotic checkpoint activated in the presence of Noc is p53-dependent (3Lanni J.S. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 5Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

To assess whether p53 activity was also implicated after release from Noc arrest, we preliminarily used biparametric FACS analysis to determine p53 immunoreactivity in AHH1 cell populations of different genome size; we detected an increased p53 signal in the presence of Noc,i.e. when the cell population is essentially G2/M-arrested; after Noc removal p53 levels continued to increase, consistent with the data in Fig. 1B, and 20 h after removal most AHH1 cells in both the 2C and 4C subpopulations express p53 (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that p53 is functionally implicated in sustaining the prolonged arrest observed in response to transient Noc exposure. To directly assess that hypothesis, we constructed AHH1 cell lines defective for p53 function. AHH1 cell cultures were stably transfected with a neomycin-resistant expression vector directing the synthesis of a dominant negative allele of p53 (dnp53) (19Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The dnp53 protein acts in these cells (henceforth designated AHH1dnp53) as a dominant negative mutant, because it retains the ability to interact with the endogenous, wild-type p53 protein and sequesters it into a functionally inactive complex. AHH1dnp53 cells express significantly higher steady-state levels of protein compared with both AHH1 and AHH1neo cells, reflecting the exogenous expression of mutant p53 from the transfected plasmid. FACS analysis was employed to monitor cell cycle progression in AHH1 cell cultures subjected to Noc block and release in the presence or absence of functional p53. AHH1 cells transfected with vector alone (indicated as AHH1neo cells) responded to transient Noc exposure with a durable cell cycle arrest, revealed by the lack of BrdUrd incorporation, that was indistinguishable from that of the parental AHH1 cell line (Fig. 3,upper row). On the contrary, the AHH1dnp53 cell culture, in which the function of endogenous p53 was impaired, failed to induce a post-mitotic arrest (Fig. 3, lower row), similar to what we had previously observed with the p53-defective K562 cell line (see Fig.1 A). Together, these data indicate that the G1arrest that follows the transient inhibition of the mitotic spindle is dependent on p53 function. By Western immunoblotting (Fig.4 A, left panel) both the parental (AHH1) and vector-transfected (AHH1neo) cell cultures showed a progressive increase in p53 levels during the first 20 h from Noc release. In contrast, the AHH1dnp53 cell line failed to up-regulate p53 levels after exposure to Noc. In reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments p21 mRNA transcription was significantly up-regulated in AHH1 cells during Noc block and release, but not in p53-deficient K562 cells under similar conditions (data not shown). We directly examined the abundance of the p21 protein in vector-transfected and mutant p53-transfected AHH1 cells by Western blotting assays (Fig. 4 A, right panel). In AHH1 and AHH1neo cells, p21 levels increased in the presence of Noc and continued to further increase during the first 20 h of release, substantially paralleling those of p53. In contrast, AHH1dnp53cells failed to express comparably high levels of p21 when exposed to Noc and after Noc removal. Actually, a low level of p21 induction was observed at late release times (20 h after Noc removal), possibly reflecting the activity of residual wild-type p53 that had evidently not been completely inactivated by the dominant negative mutant. Microdensitometric analysis of the signal intensity (Fig.4 B) indicated, however, that p21 was induced only 2-fold and 3-fold after 8 and 20 h, respectively, of Noc release in AHH1dnp53 cells, compared with 15- and 17-fold, respectively, in AHH1neo cells. Together these results indicate that p53-dependent G1 arrest after spindle damage is associated with up-regulation of p21 protein levels. The results thus far indicate that p53 is central in mediating a prolonged cell cycle arrest that persists for several hours after removal of the spindle-damaging agent, when spindle assembly can actually be recovered. We therefore decided to investigate the intracellular distribution of p53 before and after induction of spindle damage by indirect immunofluorescence. In normal interphase cells, p53 shows a weak and diffuse pattern throughout nuclei (Fig. 5 A). During mitosis, p53 is redistributed in a typical organization consisting of discrete spots. Because the number and arrangement of p53 spots in mitotic cells resembled that of centrosomes, double immunofluorescence experiments were performed using anti-p53 antibody in combination with antibodies against centrosomal markers,i.e. centrin, a major constituent of centrioles (20Paoletti A.

Khodjakov A. Mir L.M. Rieder C.L. Eddé B. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1575-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Fig. 5, B andC, shows results obtained with anti-centrin antibody in normal mitotic cells; p53 spots are associated with or in close proximity of centriole pairs visualized by centrin staining. Similar results were obtained using two anti-p53 antibodies of different clonal origin, in combination with antibodies against independent centrosomal markers (see below). We then examined cells exposed to Noc, i.e. typically blocked in prometaphase and completing mitosis during the release from Noc arrest (Fig. 6). In Noc-exposed prometaphase-arrested cultures the intensity of the p53 signal increased compared with mitotic cells from asynchronous cultures; most importantly, p53-positive spots failed to associate with centrosomes (Fig. 6 A) and were organized in variable numbers. Furthermore, p53 was neither down-regulated in abundance nor redistributed in its normal pattern after Noc removal, despite the rapid resumption of mitotic progression; indeed, within 80 min from Noc removal cells had progressed to ana-telophase (Fig. 6, B andC), with a substantial recovery of their chromosome segregation capability at each pole, and yet p53 spots continued to be intense in fluorescence and variable in number and did not reassociate with centrosomes. The abundance of p53 continued to increase even after cells had completed mitosis and reached the following G1, when p53 massively reentered the nucleus (Fig. 6 D). To fully assess the significance of these findings, we had to rule out the possibility that the effect in Fig. 6 reflected merely an increase in centriole splitting following Noc exposure. We first sought to quantify the actual occurrence of centriole splitting in NOC-arrested prometaphase cells by analyzing anti-centrin reactive spots. No evidence of splitting was seen in 95 of 100 examined mitoses, three cells showed more than two centriole pairs, and only in two cells were centrioles abnormally separated; these figures are not significantly different from mitotic figures from asynchronous cultures. Immunofluorescence experiments were also repeated in cells processed with anti-p53 and anti-g-tubulin antibodies (Fig.7); these experiments confirmed that in control mitotic cells p53 spots colocalize with g-tubulin, as indicated by the yellow pseudocoloration of centrosomes (Fig. 7, A andB). In contrast, in Noc-arrested and released cultures, the association of p53 with centrosomes was again found to be inhibited (Fig. 7, C and D). Similar patterns were observed in cultures processed using an anti-glutamylated tubulin antibody (data not shown).Figure 7Colocalization of p53 and centrosomes is lost in Noc-exposed cells.

A yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic domains of the tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel rNav1.9a (NaN) led to the identification of fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 1B (FHF1B), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, as an interacting partner of rNav1.9a. FHF1B selectively interacts with the C-terminal region but not the other four intracellular segments of rNav1.9a. FHF1B binds directly to the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a both in vitro and in mammalian cell lines. The N-terminal 5–77 amino acid residues of FHF1B are essential for binding to rNav1.9a. FHF1B did not interact with C termini of two other sodium channels hNav1.7a (hNaNE) and rNav1.8a (SNS), which share 50% similarity to the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a. FHF1B is the first growth factor found to bind specifically to a sodium channel. Although the functional significance of this interaction is not clear, FHF1B may affect the rNav1.9a channel directly or by recruiting other proteins to the channel complex.

The α-subunits of sodium channels have been shown to interact with a number of proteins in addition to the auxiliary β subunits of the channel that affect their subcellular localization, their amplitude, and/or their kinetic properties. The C terminus of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle α-subunits, SkM1 and SkM2, respectively, bind to syntrophin via their PDZ domain, thus linking these channels to the cortical actin network and extracellular matrix through the association of syntrophin with the dystrophin-associated protein complex (10Gee S.H.

Peripheral sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG)1 and trigeminal ganglia produce pharmacologically and physiologically distinguishable Na+ currents, some of which are sensitive to the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX-S), and others which are resistant to this toxin (TTX-R).

To identify proteins that interact with the rNav1.9a C terminus, we screened brain Y2H cDNA library using a construct that encodes the C-terminal 198 residues of rNav1.9a as bait. These experiments identified fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 1B (FHF1B), which belongs to a subset of the FGF family (24Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), as a binding partner of rNav1.9a. It is possible that this interaction may help in exporting FHF1B to the exterior face of the cell membrane, or it may modulate the properties of rNav1.9a directly or indirectly by recruiting other factors to the channel complex. The preparation and purification of an antiserum to rNav1.9 (NaN) has been previously described (25Fjell J. Hjelmstrom P. Hormuzdiar W. Milenkovic M. Aglieco F. Tyrrell L. Dib-Hajj S. Waxman S.G. Black J.A. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Anti-GFP and anti-Myc polyclonal antibodies were purchased from CLONTECH. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were used. Yeast expression vector pDBleu (Life Technologies) and pPC86 (Life Technologies) are fusion vectors for the linkage of proteins to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and to the VP16 transactivation domain, respectively. The segment encoding the C terminus (aa 1588–1765; GenBankTM accession numberAF059030) of rNav1.9a (NaN) was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of pDBleu (pDB-NaNC) to serve as bait in the screening assay. Fragments encoding sub-regions of the C terminus of rNav1.9a were also amplified and subcloned into the SalI/NotI sites of pDBleu: CR1+CR2 (aa 1588–1727; pDB-NaNCR1CR2), CR1 (aa 1588–1658; pDB-NaNCR1), CR2 (aa 1658–1727; pDB-NaNCR2), and UR (aa 1727–1765; pDB-NaNUR). Fragments encoding other cytoplasmic components of this channel were also cloned into the pDBleu vector: N terminus (aa 1–124; pDB-NaNN), L1 (aa 398–564; pDB-NaNL1), L2 (aa 802–1029; pDB-NaNL2), and L3 (aa 1288–1340; pDB-NaNL3). Similarly, cDNA fragments encoding the C termini of rNav1.8 (SNS) (aa 1725–1957; GenBankTM accession number X92184) and hNav1.7 (hNaNE) (aa 1753–1977; GenBankTM accession number X82835) sodium channel were cloned in-frame into theSalI/NotI sites of pDBleu vector to produce plasmids pDB-SNSC and pDB-hNEC, respectively. The full coding sequence of rat FHF1B was cloned in-frame into theSalI/NotI sites of pPC86 vector to generate plasmid pPC86-rFHF1B. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X (Life Technologies) was used to produce recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The respective C-terminal fragments of rNav1.9 described above were subcloned in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X to produce the plasmids pGEX-NaNC, pGEX-NaNCR1CR2, pGEX-NaNCR1, pGEX-NaNCR2, and pGEX-NaNUR. Mammalian two-hybrid expression vectors pBIND and pACT (Promega) are fusion vectors for the linkage of proteins to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and to the VP16 transactivation domain, respectively. The complete coding sequence of rat FHF-1B cDNA was inserted in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of pBIND fusion vector to produce plasmid pBIND-FHF1B. A cDNA fragment encoding the C terminus of rNav1.9a was inserted in-frame into theSalI/NotI sites of pACT fusion vector to produce plasmid pACT-NaNC. Plasmids for expression of tagged proteins in HEK293 cells were also constructed in the vectors pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (+) (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). A cDNA fragment encoding the C terminus of rNav1.9a (described above) was inserted in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)A to produce plasmid pcDNA3.1/Myc-His/NaNC. The complete coding sequence of FHF1B was subcloned in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) to produce plasmid pFHF1B-GFP. This construct produces FHF1B-GFP fusion protein when introduced into mammalian cells. All constructs were verified by sequencing their inserts. Sequencing was carried out at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Sequence analysis was done using Lasergene (DNASTAR), GCG (GCG), and BLAST (National Library of Medicine) software. Total cellular RNA was isolated from tissues of adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by the single-step guanidinium isothiocyanate-acid phenol procedure (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 4.2.4-4.2.6Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA as previously described (27Dib-Hajj S.D. Hinson A.W. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out in two stages (27Dib-Hajj S.D. Hinson A.W. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for a total of 27 cycles by using a PTC 200 programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research). FHF1B and GAPDH primers were used in a multiplex PCR reaction to determine the tissue distribution of FHF1B in adult rat tissues. FHF1B forward (5′-CACTCTAAAGGGACCGAAATGGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GAAGAGTTCTCAGCCAGGCTATG-3′) primers amplify nucleotides 39–620 (GenBankTM accession number AF348446), whereas GAPDH forward (5′-TCACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTG-3′) and reverse (3′-CCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCATATTC-3′) primer amplify nucleotides 328–994 (GenBankTM accession number M17701). FHF1B and GAPDH primers were used at final concentrations of 2 and 0.2 μm, respectively, to reduce the inhibition of FHF1B amplification by excess GAPDH templates. Control PCR with water or RNA template produced no amplification products (data not shown). Plasmid pDBNaNC (see above) was used as bait to screen rat brain pPC86 cDNA library (Life Technologies) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer with few modifications. Briefly, bait plasmid was first introduced into yeast MAV203 strain that contains three reporter genes, HIS+, URA+, and Lac Z (Life Technologies), and transformants were selected on defined medium lacking leucine. The rat brain cDNA library in pPC86 was then transformed into the resultant Leu+ yeast strain and plated on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and uracil but containing 25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-trizone (SD leu−/trp−/his−/ura−/3AT+). After incubation for 7 days at 30 °C, colonies were screened for β-galactosidase by a filter lift assay (28Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Individual pPC86 recombinant plasmids were further verified for interaction with bait by repeating the Y2H assay. Three independent colonies were analyzed for the interaction in yeast between two proteins, one of which was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the other to the VP16 transactivation domain. The procedures of Vojteket al. (29Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and Hollenberg et al. (28Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

For expressing GST fusion proteins, the appropriate plasmids (pGEX-NaNN (N terminus, aa 1–124); pGEX-NaNL1 (L1, aa 398–564); pGEX-NaNL2 (L2, aa 802–1029); pGEX-NaNC (C terminus, aa 1588–1765), pGEX-NaNCR1CR2, pGEX-NaNCR1, pGEX-NaNCR2, and pGEX-NaNUR (see above for coordinates)) were transformed into E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies). The fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads as previously described (30Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To examine the binding of FHF1B and its derivatives to the C terminus of rNav1.9 in vitro, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) preincubated with purified GST (0.5 μg), serving as control, or GST-NaNC (0.5 μg) were incubated with extract (500 μg of protein) of HEK293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding either full-length FHF1B-GFP or its derivatives (i.e. FHF1B-(5–181)-GFP, FHF1B-(42–181)-GFP, FHF1B-(77–181)-GFP, and FHF1B-(143–181)-GFP), as indicated, in 150 μl of buffer AM (10 mm Tris, pH. 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2) (31Voit R. Schafer K. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4230-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 mm KCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (30Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were denatured in sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and GFP fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies (CLONTECH). Similarly, GST fusion proteins of C terminus derivatives (0.5 μg) were analyzed in this binding assay to further delineate the sequence in the C terminus of rNav1.9 that is responsible for the interaction with FHF1B. Far Western (overlay blot) assay was carried out according to Lee et al. (32Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with minor modification. After a 1-h incubation with anti-GFP antibodies, extracts of HEK293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding either GFP or FHF1B-GFP fusion protein were incubated with protein A-agarose at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times in cell lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA), the purified GFP (control), and FHF1B-GFP were loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to electrophoresis. The proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 85 mA for 2 h. The proteins on the blot were denatured and renatured by sequential washings in 0.1 m CZ solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 01.mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) plus 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 6 m guanidine-HCl for 30 min, one time, then three times in 0.1 m CZ solution plus 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, each for 2 h. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated with 50 μg of purified GST-NaNC protein, followed by incubation with anti-NaN antibodies (0.2 μg/ml) for 1 h. The signal was detected using the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Components of the mammalian two-hybrid assay (Promega) were used to study the interaction of FHF1B and the C terminus of rNav1.9 in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 unit/ml antibiotics. When cultures reached about 50% confluence, the cells were transfected with 1 μg each of the indicated plasmids using Lipofectin (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmid pUC19 was used as a carrier to bring the total amount of DNA in the transfection solution to 3 μg. The cultures were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed, and firefly luciferase activity was determined according to manufacturer's recommendations. HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum. After reaching 50% confluence, the cultures were co-transfected with the mammalian expression plasmids pFHF1B-GFP and pcDNA3.1Myc-His/NaNC. The cultures were harvested 48 h later, and cell extracts were prepared according to Liu et al. (33Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z., Yu, S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation with either anti-Myc (25 μg/ml) (CLONTECH) or anti-NaN (20 μg/ml) antibodies, aliquots (200 μl) from this mixture were incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies) at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with immunoprecipitation buffer (34Wang H. Liu C. Lu Y. Chatterjee G. Ma X.Y. Eisenman R.N. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27377-27385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bound proteins were released by boiling in 20 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer for 3 min (30Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The released proteins were examined by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies (CLONTECH), and the signal was detected using the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channel rNav1.9a (NaN) is expressed preferentially in peripheral sensory neurons and is down-regulated after axotomy (14Dib-Hajj S.D. Tyrrell L. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8963-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). This channel is also expressed at low levels in central nervous system tissues (14Dib-Hajj S.D. Tyrrell L. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8963-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 35Jeong S.Y. Goto J. Hashida H. Suzuki T. Ogata K. Masuda N. Hirai M. Isahara K. Uchiyama Y. Kanazawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A screen based on the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was performed to identify proteins that interact with rNav1.9a. For this purpose, we linked the five intracellular regions of rNav1.9a, namely, the N terminus, loop 1, loop 2, loop 3, and the C terminus to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) in the plasmid pDBleu. We used the respective constructs as baits to screen a library of rat brain cDNA expressed as fusion proteins to the VP16 acidic activation domain (VP16AD) in the vector pPC86. A Y2H rat brain cDNA library (Life Technologies) was screened with the construct encoding the cytosolic C terminus of rNav1.9a (aa 1588–1765). We screened about 5 million clones and identified 23 clones that activated the three reporter genes. Further tests involved the re-transformation of yeast with the purified target plasmids and bait. Only 2 of the original 23 yeast clones expressed full-length proteins that interact with the C-terminal bait (not shown). The plasmids in these clones contained 2.96-kilobase pair identical inserts. The sequence of the two inserts matched that of the chicken fibroblast growth factor homologous factor gFHF1B (36Munoz-Sanjuan I. Simandl B.K. Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Development. 1999; 126: 409-421PubMed Google Scholar) and represents the rat homologue of this factor (Fig. 1). This factor belongs to the FGF family of growth factors (24Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). An open reading frame of 546 base pairs encodes a polypeptide of 181 amino acids with a predicted mass of 20 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The rat factor, rFHF1B, is highly conserved compared with the chicken counterpart with 87% identity at the nucleotide level (not shown) and 97% identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 1 B). FHF1B lacks a canonical signal peptide, like the other members of this subfamily (24Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Unlike FHF1A, which possesses a nuclear targeting signal as a result of alternative splicing, rFHF1B lacks such a signal (Fig. 1 B). Multiplex PCR of FHF1B and GAPDH was used to investigate tissue distribution of FHF1B in adult rat tissue. FHF1B is readily detectable in central and peripheral nervous tissues including cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, DRG, and trigeminal ganglia (Fig.2). The rFHF1B fragment that is amplified from DRG tissues using these rFHF1B-specific primers shows identical sequence to that obtained from the rat brain cDNA library. This factor is expressed, however, at lower levels in other neural tissues such as superior cervical ganglia and retina and in the cardiac and skeletal muscles, whereas it is undetectable under these amplification conditions in liver, and kidney (Fig. 2). The tissue distribution of rFHF1B shows an overlap with the expression of rNav1.9a in DRG and trigeminal ganglia (14Dib-Hajj S.D. Tyrrell L. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8963-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The Y2H assay was repeated to verify the interaction between rFHF1B and the C terminus of rNav1.9a. For this purpose, the plasmid encoding the C terminus of rNav1.9a linked to the Gal4DBD and the plasmid encoding rFHF1B fused to the VP16AD were used to co-transform the yeast strain MAV203. Plasmid pairs encoding c-Jun/c-Fos and Rb/lamin were used as positive and negative protein-protein interaction controls, respectively (Fig.3 A). The interaction between the C terminus polypeptide of rNav1.9a and rFHF1B was verified by β galactosidase assay and growth phenotype on selective media (Fig. 3 A). Like the c-Jun/c-Fos pair, which is known to interact, our assays indicate that rFHF1B interacts with the C terminus of rNav1.9a in yeast, based on the activation of the LacZ reporter gene (Fig. 3 A, left panel), growth on the plates lacking histidine and uracil but containing 3-amino-1,2,4-trizole (Fig. 3 A, middle panel), and inhibition of growth on plates containing 0.2% 5-fluoroorotic acid (Fig. 3 A, right panel). The other cytoplasmic polypeptides of rNav1.9a (Fig.3 B) were tested for their ability to interact with rFHF1B. Filter-based β-galactosidase assays were used to determine if the co-expression of the various rNav1.9a/Gal4DBD and rFHF1B/VP16AD fusion proteins activated the reporter LacZ gene. As shown in Fig. 3 C, rFHF1B selectively interacts with the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a, among the five intracellular polypeptides tested in this assay. To test whether rFHF1B binds to the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a in vitro, we expressed rFHF1B-GFP fusion protein in HEK293 cells and expressed the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a as a GST fusion protein (GST-NaNC). Affinity-purified GST and GST-NaNC immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with cell lysates expressing either GFP or FHF1B-GFP. Purified GST or GST-NaNC did not pull down GFP protein in this assay (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–3). Purified GST did not pull down rFHF1B-GFP fusion protein (Fig.4 A, lane 5), whereas GST-NaNC efficiently pulled down the rFHF1B-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 4 A, lane 6). We used an overlay binding assay to show that rFHF1B binds directly to the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a. GFP or rFHF1B-GFP proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with the corresponding expression plasmid. These immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, electrotransferred and immobilized onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with affinity-purified GST or GST-NaNC. Binding was then detected using anti-NaN antibodies. Fig. 4 B shows that the purified GST-NaNC fusion protein binds to the purified rFHF1B-GFP (lane 2) but not to GFP alone (lane 1); GST did not bind to either rFHF1B-GFP or GFP (not shown). To test whether rFHF1B binds to the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a in vivo, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay in NIH3T3 cells containing a reporter plasmid in which the expression of the firefly luciferase gene was driven by five Gal4-specific enhancer elements (Fig.5 A). By analogy to the Y2H system, the interaction between the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a and rFHF1B brings together the Gal4DBD and the VP16AD of the fusion proteins and activates the reporter gene in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5 A). Fig. 5 B shows that these two proteins interact in mammalian cells as well as in yeast. Therefore, any post-translational modifications that may occur in mammalian cells, but that are absent in yeast, do not interfere with the interaction of rFHF1B and the C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a. The result of the mammalian two-hybrid assay was confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5 C). In this assay, the extracts of cells expressing both rFHF1B-GFP fusion protein (lane 1) and Myc-tagged C-terminal polypeptide of rNav1.9a were first incubated with either anti-Myc or anti-NaN antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were counter-tested with anti-GFP antibodies. A clear rFHF1B-specific band was present in the immunoprecipitated complexes brought down by either anti-Myc (lane 2) or anti-NaN (lane 3) antibodies, demonstrating that rFHF1B binds to the C terminus polypeptide of rNav1.9a in vivo. A series of N-terminal deletions of rFHF1B were linked to GFP (Fig. 6 A). Pull-down assays involving the immobilized GST (Fig. 6 B,lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and14) and GST-NaNC (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3,6"
https://openalex.org/W2148205722,"The function of protein kinase C family members depends on two tightly coupled phosphorylation mechanisms: phosphorylation of the activation loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, PDK-1, followed by autophosphorylation at two positions in the COOH terminus, the turn motif, and the hydrophobic motif. Here we address the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of protein kinase C βII by PDK-1. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that PDK-1 associates preferentially with its substrate, unphosphorylated protein kinase C, by a direct mechanism. The exposed COOH terminus of protein kinase C provides the primary interaction site for PDK-1, with co-expression of constructs of the carboxyl terminus effectively disrupting the interaction in vivo. Disruption of this interaction promotes the autophosphorylation of protein kinase C, suggesting that the binding of PDK-1 to the carboxyl terminus protects it from autophosphorylation. Studies with constructs of the COOH terminus reveal that the intrinsic affinity of PDK-1 for phosphorylated COOH terminus is over an order of magnitude greater than that for unphosphorylated COOH terminus, contrasting with the finding that PDK-1 does not bind phosphorylated protein kinase C effectively. However, effective binding of the phosphorylated species can be induced by the activated conformation of protein kinase C. This suggests that the carboxyl terminus becomes masked following autophosphorylation, a process that can be reversed by the conformational changes accompanying activation. Our data suggest a model in which PDK-1 provides two points of regulation of protein kinase C: 1) phosphorylation of the activation loop, which is regulated by the intrinsic activity of PDK-1, and 2) phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus, which is regulated by the release of PDK-1 to allow autophosphorylation.

Newton A. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Such protein kinases contain a segment near the entrance to the active site that must be phosphorylated in order to correctly align residues for catalysis. This segment, the activation loop, typically blocks the active site in the inactive conformation and moves out following phosphorylation (2Johnson L.N. O'Reilly M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although some kinases (e.g. protein kinase A) are able to self-activate by autophosphorylating at the activation loop (3Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a large number of kinases depend on an upstream activation loop kinase for phosphorylation. PDK-1 was originally discovered as the activation loop kinase for Akt/protein kinase B (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following on the heels of this discovery was the finding that PDK-1 is also the upstream kinase for p70 S6 kinase (5Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) isoforms of protein kinase C. The list of PDK-1 substrates continues to grow, placing PDK-1 in the center of a multitude of signaling pathways, from protein synthesis to cell growth and survival (10Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 11Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PDK-1 is the first of three ordered phosphorylations in the maturation of protein kinase C (9Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These phosphorylations are required to stabilize the catalytically competent conformation of the enzyme and to localize the mature enzyme to the cytosol (12Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is the phosphorylated species of protein kinase C that transduces the myriad of signals resulting in generation of diacylglycerol (16Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 17Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Mature (i.e. phosphorylated) species of conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel isozymes (δ, ε, θ, and η) typically localize to the cytosol but translocate to the membrane upon generation of diacylglycerol. The membrane interaction is mediated by two membrane-targeting modules, the C1 domain which binds diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine, and the C2 domain which, in conventional isozymes, binds anionic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Engagement of these domains on the membrane provides the energy to release an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence from the substrate-binding cavity, which results in activation of the enzyme. Extensive biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological studies over the past two decades have led to a strong understanding of how mature protein kinase C is regulated allosterically by lipid second messengers. However, how the maturation of protein kinase C is regulated remains to be resolved. In addition to the activation loop, mature protein kinase C is phosphorylated at two conserved positions in the carboxyl terminus (19Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar): the turn motif (Thr641 in protein kinase C βII) so named because it corresponds to a phosphorylation site in protein kinase A localized at the apex of a turn, and the hydrophobic motif (Ser660 in protein kinase C βII) which comprises a Ser flanked by bulky hydrophobic residues. The phosphorylation at the activation loop that is catalyzed by PDK-1 triggers the intramolecular autophosphorylation of these two positions (20Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because the first step mediated by PDK-1 is the rate-limiting step, understanding how it is regulated is key to understanding the cellular controls of protein kinase C function. A number of studies suggest that PDK-1 interacts with significant affinity with its kinase substrates. For example, protein kinase C isozymes and p70 S6 kinases are present in immune complexes of PDK-1 (7Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how PDK-1 recognizes its substrates may provide a first step in understanding how this master kinase regulates the function of its substrate kinases. This study addresses how PDK-1 recognizes and regulates protein kinase C βII in vivo. By examining the ability of PDK-1 to complex with various constructs of protein kinase C and its isolated domains in vivo, we show that PDK-1 interacts primarily with determinants residing in the COOH-terminal hydrophobic phosphorylation motif of protein kinase C. The binding of PDK-1 inhibits the intramolecular autophosphorylation required for the maturation of protein kinase C, with release of PDK-1 exposing the COOH terminus for autophosphorylation. Thus, PDK-1 regulates both phosphorylation switches of protein kinase C: the activation loop by direct phosphorylation and the COOH-terminal sites by release from protein kinase C.

The large T-antigen transformed human embryonic kidney cells (tsA201) were the generous gift of Dr. Marlene Hosey (Northwestern University). The cDNA of rat PKC βII was a gift of Dr. Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. (University of California, Berkeley). A polyclonal antibody against the COOH terminus of PKC βII was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A phospho-specific antibody (P500) that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated activation loop of protein kinase C isozymes was generated and characterized as described previously (9Dutil E.M.

The C1 domain (residues 1–156), the C2 domain (residues 157–296), the catalytic domain (termed CD, resides 296–673), and the COOH terminus (termed CT, residues 628–673) of protein kinase C βII were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in mammalian cells following PCR amplification of the relevant sequences using pcDNA3PKCβII as the template. Specifically, the primers used for the PCR amplification introduced a BamHI site and aNotI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the pEBG vector digested withBamHI and NotI. For expression of the PKC βII COOH terminus with mutations S660A, S660E, T641E/S660E (E2), or FA2, the same PCR amplification procedures were performed except that the templates containing the corresponding mutations were used.

TsA201 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfection of tsA201 cells was carried out using Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen). The specific transfection procedures were performed according to the protocol suggested by Qiagen. Combinations of the different expression plasmids were used as stated, and 1 μg of each DNA construct was generally included in the transfection. To examine the interaction between PDK-1 and different domains of protein kinase C βII in vivo, tsA201 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged PDK-1 and the wild-type or the mutant GST-CTs. Approximately 40 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 300 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 300 nm okadaic acid). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 5 min, 22 °C and the resulting supernatant is referred to as the detergent-solubilized cell lysate. Ten percent of the total cell lysate was kept in SDS sample buffer for further analysis, and the remaining cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for overnight. After washing twice in buffer A and twice in buffer B (buffer A plus 300 mm NaCl), the glutathione-Sepharose bound proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. TsA201 cells were transiently transfected with different combinations of protein kinase C βII and Myc-PDK-1. Approximately 40 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in buffer A. Ten percent of the total detergent-solubilized cell lysates was quenched in SDS sample buffer for further analysis, and the remaining detergent-solubilized cell lysate was incubated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. To examine the direct interaction between PDK-1 and protein kinase C βII, Sf21 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding 6His-tagged PDK-1 or protein kinase C βII. The 6His-tagged PDK-1 and protein kinase C βII were purified as described previously (24Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of protein kinase C was generated by incubation of pure protein kinase C βII (1.5 μg ml−1) with trypsin (1.2 units ml−1) for 10 min at 30 °C, in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, as previously described (25Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were combined in buffer A and incubated with an anti-PDK-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of protamine sulfate (50 μg ml−1) at 4 °C for overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in buffer A and twice in buffer B. The proteins in the immunoprecipitates were separated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed using immunoblotting. We have previously reported that PDK-1 and protein kinase C βII associate in vivo, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK cells co-transfected with the cDNA for each kinase (9Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To further examine the mechanism of this interaction and how it is regulated, we identified the determinants of protein kinase C that mediate the interactions and addressed how the interaction is affected by the phosphorylation state and activation state of protein kinase C. Fig. 1 shows the constructs of PDK-1 and protein kinase C used in this study. Myc-tagged PDK-1 and wild-type protein kinase C βII were co-expressed in tsA201 cells and the detergent-soluble supernatant (containing ∼90% of the expressed constructs) was subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-Myc antibody. Fig.2, lane 1, shows that a significant fraction of the protein kinase C co-immunoprecipiated with PDK-1, consistent with our previous report (9Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Two species of protein kinase C were apparent in the immunoprecipitates (panel A): a slower migrating band (indicated by double asterisk) which represents fully phosphorylated protein kinase C (see Ref. 19Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and was labeled by the phosphoactivation loop antibody (P500, not shown), and a faster migrating species (labeled with a dash) which represents unphosphorylated protein kinase C and was not labeled by the P500 antibody (not shown). The dephosphorylated species in the immune complex was significantly enriched relative to the amount in the total cell lysate: densitometric analysis of six independent experiments revealed a 2.0 ± 0.7-fold enrichment of the dephosphorylated species relative to the phosphorylated species in the immune complexes compared with the ratio of these species in the total lysate. Thus, PDK-1 selectively bound unphosphorylated protein kinase C. To probe whether the interaction of protein kinase C with PDK-1 was direct or mediated by a scaffold protein, we examined the interaction of pure PDK-1 with pure protein kinase C. Both proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified to apparent homogeneity. Fig. 2, lane 2, shows that protein kinase C βII was present in immune complexes with PDK-1 (panel A). As observed using cell lysates, the immune complex was enriched in the unphosphorylated species (dash) of protein kinase C: this species was barely apparent in the starting material (panel C) but readily apparent in the immune complex (panel A). The efficiency of immunoprecipitation of protein kinase C by PDK-1 in cell lysates or in vivo was comparable, suggesting that direct interaction of the two proteins was the primary mechanism for the interaction observed in vivo. The results described above indicate that PDK-1 preferentially associates with its substrate, unphosphorylated protein kinase C βII, compared with the mature, fully phosphorylated protein kinase C βII. This latter species is phosphorylated at three positions: Thr500on the activation loop, and Thr641 and Ser660on the carboxyl terminus. To test whether the phosphorylation at these positions modulates association of protein kinase C with PDK-1, we examined the ability of constructs mutated at each position for the ability to form an immune complex with PDK-1. The detergent-soluble cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody to precipitate PDK-1 and the immunoprecipitates probed for associated protein kinase C. Fig. 3 Cshows that the amount of PDK-1 was similar among all the immunoprecipitates. Fig. 3 B shows a Western blot of the wild-type and phosphorylation site mutants of protein kinase C βII expressed in tsA201 cells. Wild-type protein kinase C (lane 1) migrated as a doublet, similar to the results in Fig. 2. In contrast, both the T500A2 and T6413 mutants co-migrated with unphosphorylated protein kinase C (Fig. 3 B, position indicated by dash). We have previously shown that mutation of Thr500 to Ala or Thr641 to Ala abolishes kinase activity and thus results in expression of quantitatively dephosphorylated protein kinase C (15Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 4The T641A mutant is a substrate for PDK-1, however, it is highly phosphatase sensitive and not phosphorylatedin vivo under our cell culture conditions (15Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser660 to Ala resulted in the appearance of a major intermediate migrating band (lane 4, position marked withasterisk) and a minor slower migrating band (lane 4, position indicated by dash). This is consistent with previous studies showing that mutation of Ser660 to Ala has only modest effects on the activity of protein kinase C so that the majority of the S660A that partitions in the detergent-soluble fraction is phosphorylated at Thr500 and Thr641: this phosphorylated species migrates at an intermediate mobility. Replacement of Ser660 with Glu results in unimpaired phosphorylation of protein kinase C so that the S660E mutant is a good mimic of wild-type enzyme and co-migrates with wild-type enzyme (Fig.3 B, lane 5). Fig. 3 A shows that the T500A and T641A constructs were effectively co-immunoprecipitated with PDK-1 (lanes 2 and3), but the T500A mutant has slightly reduced efficiency compared with wild-type enzyme. Quantitation of several independent experiments revealed that 0.5 ± 0.1 (n = 4) and 0.8 ± 0.1 (n = 3) times as much T500A and T641A, respectively, were present in immune complexes compared with wild-type unphosphorylated protein kinase C (lower band marked bydash). The slightly decreased recognition of protein with Ala at position 500 suggests that the hydroxyl at the phosphoacceptor position may influence the recognition of protein kinase C by PDK-1. To test whether negative charge at position 660 regulated the interaction of mature protein kinase C with PDK-1, we examined the ability of PDK-1 to complex with the S660A and S660E mutants in vivo. Fig. 3 reveals the presence of intermediate migrating species (marked by one asterisk), the S660A mutant, in the immune complexes with PDK-1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). This species represents protein kinase C phosphorylated at the activation loop and Thr641. Quantitative analysis of three independent experiments revealed the fraction of S660A co-immunoprecipitated from the lysate with PDK-1 was 0.4 ± 0.2-fold lower than the fraction of wild-type protein kinase C that was co-immunoprecipitated. These data suggest that replacement of Ser660 with Ala results in a 2.5-fold reduction in the affinity of mature protein kinase C for PDK-1. PDK-1 was also able to effectively co-immunoprecipitate the S660E mutant (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). As described previously, the S660E mutant expressed primarily as the slowest migrating species co-migrating with the fully phosphorylated wild-type protein kinase C βII (Fig. 3 B, lane 5, double asterisk). The fraction of S660E that co-immunoprecipitated with PDK-1 was similar to the fraction of fully phosphorylated protein kinase C βII that complexed with PDK-1 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1 and 5; analysis of three independent experiments revealed that the ratio of S660E to wild-type protein kinase C in immune complexes was 1.0 ± 0.3). Thus, mature protein kinase C with a Glu or phosphoserine at position 660 interacted similarly with PDK-1, whereas mature protein kinase C with a Ala at position 660 interacted less strongly with PDK-1 than protein with phospho-Ser at that position. In vivo co-precipitation assays reveal that PDK-1 preferentially recognizes the unphosphorylated conformation of protein kinase C. To elucidate the contribution of individual domains in this recognition, we tested the ability of GST fusion proteins encoding the C1, C2, and catalytic domains of protein kinase C βII to associate with PDK-1 or to disrupt the interaction of PDK-1 with full-length protein kinase C βII in vivo. In addition, we focused on a series of constructs of the carboxyl-terminal 46 residues to explore the role of the hydrophobic phosphorylation motif in the PDK-1/protein kinase C interaction. These constructs included GST-CT, GST-CT/S660A, GST-CT/S660E, GST-CT/E2, and GST-CT/FA2. We also examined the interaction with PIF, a COOH-terminal construct of PRK-2 previously shown to bind with high affinity to PDK-1 (23Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). TsA201 cells were transiently co-transfected with PDK-1 and the GST fusion protein constructs and the interaction with PDK-1 was assessed by GST pull-down experiments performed using the detergent-solubilized fraction of cells. The total protein expression level of PDK-1 was comparable in all the transfections (Fig.4 D). Fig. 4 B reveals that all constructs of the COOH terminus, including PIF, were expressed in tsA201 cells and effectively precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose as judged by staining with anti-GST antibodies. Of these, the GST fusions of the wild-type COOH terminus and of PIF (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 9) were the most effective at co-precipitating PDK-1. To obtain relatively balanced signals on the immunoblot, PDK-1 detected in the GST-PIF lane represented only 30% of the total protein in the glutathione-Sepharose precipitates. Densitometric analysis of data from three independent experiments revealed that PDK-1 bound PIF 5–10 times better than the COOH terminus of protein kinase C βII. In contrast to the wild-type COOH-terminal constructs, neither the S660A, S660E, nor T641E/S660E constructs of the COOH terminus showed detectable interaction with PDK-1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3, 4, and 10). A construct in which the two Phe flanking Ser660 were mutated to Ala, GST-F659A/F661A, did not complex with PDK-1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). A construct of the catalytic domain comprising the kinase core and the COOH terminus (residues 296–673) was poorly expressed in the tsA201 cells yet was co-complexed with PDK-1 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 8). The GST fusion constructs of the isolated C1 and C2 domains expressed well in tsA201 cells and GST pull-down experiments revealed trace binding of PDK-1 to the C1 domain but not to the C2 domain (lanes 6 and 7). These data suggest that the kinase domain, and in particular the COOH terminus, provide the primary determinants in the interaction of protein kinase C with PDK-1, with some participation of the C1 domain. Fig. 4 B reveals that the COOH-terminal fusion prote"

To probe the mechanism for in vivo translesion DNA synthesis across this adduct, in vitro primer extension studies were conducted using newly identified human DNA polymerases (pol) η and κ, which have been shown to catalyze translesion DNA synthesis past several DNA lesions. Steady-state kinetic analyses and analysis of translesion products have revealed that the synthesis is >100-fold more efficient with pol η than with pol κ and that both error-free and error-prone syntheses are observed with these enzymes. The miscoding events include both base substitution and frameshift mutations. These results suggest that both polymerases, particularly pol η, may contribute to the translesion DNA synthesis events observed for 1,N 6-ethenodeoxyadenosine in human cells."

Latency-associated protein (LAP), the N-terminal remnant of the TGF-β precursor, is able to bind and neutralize TGF-β. Mature TGF-β exerts its activity by binding and complexing members of two subfamilies of receptors, the type I and II receptors. In addition to these signaling receptors, TGF-β can also interact with an accessory receptor termed the type III receptor. Using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore), we determined the mechanisms of interaction of four binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor ectodomains (EDs), and a type II receptor ED/Fc chimera) with three TGF-β isoforms, and we quantified their related kinetic parameters. Using global fitting based on a numerical integration data analysis method, we demonstrated that LAP and the type II receptor/Fc chimera interacted with the TGF-β isoforms with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, the type II ED interactions with TGF-β were best fit by a kinetic model assuming the presence of two independent binding sites on the ligand molecule. We also showed that the type III ED bound two TGF-β molecules. Further experiments revealed that LAP was able to block the interactions of TGF-β with the two EDs, but that the two EDs did not compete or cooperate with each other. Together, these results strongly support the existence of a cell-surface complex consisting of one type III receptor, two TGF-β molecules, and four type II receptors, prior to the recruitment of the type I receptor for signal transduction. Additionally, our results indicate that the apparent dissociation rate constants are more predictive of the neutralizing potency of these TGF-β-binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor EDs, and the type II receptor/Fc chimera) than the apparent equilibrium constants.

Mature TGF-β isoforms correspond to the carboxyl-terminal domain of a precursor protein termed prepro-TGF-β. Cleavage by a proconvertase yields both mature TGF-β and a prodomain called the latency-associated protein (LAP). Both TGF-β and LAP are disulfide-bonded homodimers and have been shown to remain noncovalently associated with each other after cleavage (5Gentry L.E. Nash B.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6851-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This complex is inactive (latent), as it is not recognized by the TGF-β signaling receptors. Mature TGF-β signals by binding and complexing two receptors, the type I and II receptors (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Once this heteromeric receptor·ligand complex is formed, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, and the signal is then translocated to the nucleus by members of the SMAD family (7Padgett R.W. Das P. Krishna S. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). In addition to the signaling receptors, TGF-β can also interact with a receptor known as the type III receptor that apparently does not signal. This receptor is thought to act as an enhancer of TGF-β activity by promoting its access to the signaling receptors (especially for the TGF-β2 isoform, which has a low affinity for the type II receptor) (9Moustakas A.

The isolated ectodomains (EDs) of the type II and III receptors are soluble and retain their ability to bind to TGF-β isoforms (15Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They exert, similarly to LAP, an antagonistic activity by binding to TGF-β and sequestering it away from cell-surface receptors (15Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Tsang M.L. Zhou L. Zheng B.L. Wenker J. Fransen G. Humphrey J. Smith J.M. O'Connor-McCourt M. Lucas R. Weatherbee J.A. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine the binding mechanisms of these three proteins, LAP and the type II and III EDs, in addition to a type II receptor ectodomain/Fc chimera with the three mammalian TGF-β isoforms. To quantify the kinetic parameters of these interactions, we used the BIAcore, a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor that allows real-time measurement of macromolecular interactions. We demonstrated the following. 1) LAP interacts with all the TGF-β isoforms according to a conformational change model and a 1:1 stoichiometry. 2) TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 interactions with the type II ED are best fit by a kinetic model assuming the presence of two independent binding sites on the ligand molecule for the type II ED. In contrast, the interactions of these TGF-β isoforms with a type II ED/Fc chimera are best depicted by a rearrangement model and a 1:1 stoichiometry. 3) The type III ED binds two TGF-β molecules. 4) LAP is able to block the interactions of TGF-β with the two ectodomains. 5) Both ectodomains do not compete or cooperate with each other when binding to TGF-β. Finally, the ability of LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, and the type III ED to antagonize binding of TGF-β to its cell-surface receptors was tested using mink lung epithelial cells stably transfected with a TGF-β-sensitive luciferase reporter gene. These results were correlated with the BIAcore data. The present analyses strongly support the existence of a complex consisting of one type III receptor, two TGF-β molecules, and four type II receptors within the signaling receptor complex. Additionally, results of our kinetic analysis indicate that the apparent dissociation rate constant may be the best predictor of the antagonistic potency of TGF-β-binding proteins. The BIAcore 1000, CM5 sensor chips,N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, and 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5) were purchased from BIAcore Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant TGF-β isoforms (human recombinant TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary, NSO, and Sf21 cells, respectively), recombinant β1-LAP (expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells), and the recombinant extracellular domains of the TGF-β type II and III receptors in addition to the TGF-β type II receptor/Fc chimera corresponding to the 159 amino acid residues of the type II ED fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (all expressed in NSO cells) were provided by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). TGF-β isoforms were coupled to CM5 sensor chip surfaces using the standard amine coupling procedure and a flow rate set at 5 µl/min. Sequential injections consisted of a 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride mixture (35 µl) followed by TGF-β solutions (0.8–1.6 µg/ml) in 10 mm acetic acid (pH 4.0) until the desired amount of coupled TGF-β was reached. A solution of 0.1 methanolamine HCl (35 µl, pH 8.5) was then used to block the remaining activated carboxyl groups. Control dextran surfaces were also generated by replacing the TGF-β solutions with running buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20). All the kinetic experiments were carried out at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 µl/min, except for the mass transport experiments, for which different injections of each analyte (human LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, and the type III ED) were performed at flow rates ranging from 5 to 30 µl/min. Running buffer was used for diluting all the species that were injected over the TGF-β isoform surfaces. Different concentrations of LAP (73 kDa), the type II ED (27 kDa), the type II ED/Fc chimera (120 kDa), and the type III ED (112.5 kDa) were injected over various TGF-β (25 kDa) surfaces as well as over a control surface for 300 s, following which the analyte solutions were replaced by buffer for 300 s. Regeneration of the sensor chip for subsequent injections was accomplished by two pulses of HCl (20 mm, 120 s), followed by an EXTRACLEAN procedure done according to the BIAcore manual. Sensorgrams were prepared and globally fit using nonlinear least-squares analysis and numerical integration of the differential rate equations using the SPRevolution ® software package. The data preparation was done mainly as described elsewhere (19O'Connor-McCourt M.D. De Crescenzo G. Lortie R. Lenferink A.E.G. Grothe S. Lundqvist A. Greijer E. Quantitative Analysis of Biospecific Interactions. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Chur, Switzerland1998: 175-190Google Scholar). Briefly, each sensorgram generated using a control surface was subtracted from the corresponding experimental sensorgrams, and the resulting curves were transformed to concentration units using the molecular mass of the injected species, the equivalence of 1000 resonance units (RU) per 1 ng/mm2, and a matrix thickness of 100 nm. Each data set (which consists of sensorgrams from injections of different analyte concentrations over the same surface) was then analyzed using several different kinetic models that are available in the SPRevolution ® software. In SPRevolution ®, the various kinetic models were transposed into differential equations by making a mass balance on all species present in the dextran matrix. These sets of nonlinear differential equations were solved numerically using an adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta method (20Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes, the Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1986Google Scholar). The resulting routine was used in a nonlinear regression program using Marquardt's algorithm (21Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) to estimate the values of the constants from experimental data. The schematic representation of the models used for the data analysis and their related sets of differential rate equations are listed in TableI. For each model, the kinetic parameters as well as the active quantity of ligand immobilized on the matrix were considered as global parameters for a given set of curves. Moreover, two local parameters were added for each curve to take into account the refractive index changes at the beginning of the wash-on and wash-off phases.Table ISchematic representation of the kinetic models and the related differential equationsSimple one-to-one interaction L + A ↔ LAd[L]dt=−ka[L][A]+kd[LA];d[LA]dt=ka[L][A]−kd[LA]Two independent sites on ligand L1 + A ↔ L1Ad[L1]dt=−ka1[L1][A]+kd1[L1A];d[L2]dt=−ka2[L2][A]+kd2[L2A];d[L1A]dt=ka1[L1][A]−kd1[L1A];d[L2A]dt=ka2[L2][A]−kd2[L2A]L2 + A ↔ L2AL1A + A ↔ ALAL2A + A ↔ ALARearrangement of complex L + A ↔ LA ↔ LA*d[L]dt=−ka1[L][A]+kd1[LA];d[LA*]dt=ka2[LA]−kd2[LA*];d[LA]dt=ka1[L][A]−kd1[LA]+kd2[LA*]−ka2[LA]Two sites on analyte (avidity) L + A ↔ LAd[L]dt=−ka1[L][A]+kd2[LA]+kd2[LAL]−ka2[LA][L];d[LA]dt=ka1[L][A]−kd1[LA]+kd2[LAL]−ka2[LA][L];d[LAL]dt=ka2[LA][L]−kd2[LAL]and then LA + L ↔ LALL and A correspond to the ligand and the analyte, respectively.

The first statistical value is the S.D. of the residuals. The second statistical value is the “+ or − sign” statistic (Z 1) (22Bradley J.V. Distribution-Free Statistical Tests. Prentice Hall Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ1968: 251-282Google Scholar). Each residual is replaced by its sign value (+ or −), and the following statistic is then calculated on the newly created data set, Z 1 = (n× (R 1 − 1) − 2 × n 1 × n 2)/(2 ×n 1 × n 2(2 ×n 1 × n 2 −n)/(n − 1))1/2, whereR 1 is the number of positive runs,n 1 is the + number, andn 2 is the − number. The third statistical value is the “run up and down” statistic (Z 2) (22Bradley J.V. Distribution-Free Statistical Tests. Prentice Hall Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ1968: 251-282Google Scholar). Using the residual setx(i), a new set of data, y, is created with y(i)= x(i) −x(i + 1). As for the above test, eachy value is then replaced by its sign value (+ or −). If we call R 2 the number of positivey(i) of the runs, then the statisticZ 2 equals (R 2 − ((2 × n − 1)/3))/((16 × n−29)/90)1/2. Assuming that the residuals are independent, the Z 1 and Z 2 statistics follow a normal law with a mean equal to 0 and a variance equal to 1. The effect of pre-binding of LAP was assayed as follows. 300-s injections of LAP solutions (ranging in concentration from 0 to 200 nm in the case of TGF-β1 or from 0 to 400 nm for TGF-β2 and TGF-β3) were performed over TGF-β isoform surfaces (155, 250, and 250 RU of coupled TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, respectively) and a control surface. All injections were followed by a short wash-off phase (100 s) and a 300-s injection of the type II or III ED at a fixed concentration of 400 or 600 nm, respectively. The quantity of each ectodomain bound after 300 s was expressed as a percentage of binding after 300 s in the absence of LAP. This was plotted against the amount of LAP pre-bound to the surface, which was expressed as the percentage of maximum LAP binding and was determined by a numerical integration approach (using a rearrangement model). The effect of pre-binding of the type II and III EDs was assayed as follows. Injections of the type III ED (0–800 nm, 300 s) were followed by 300-s co-injections of a mixture of the type III ED (at the same concentration as for the first injection) and the type II ED at 500 nm. The reverse experiment was also carried out. The results were expressed as percent binding of the ectodomain that was injected second, and this was plotted against the concentration of the ectodomain injected first. Mink lung epithelial cells stably transfected with thePAI-1 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene were a generous gift of Dr. D. Rifkin (23Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates (2 × 104 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and were allowed to attach for at least 3 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then washed with PBS, and the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. TGF-β isoforms (10 pm) and LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, or the type III ED at various concentrations were then added. After an overnight incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promegaluciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured with a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer. The activity was expressed as the percentage of the activity of each TGF-β isoform in the absence of LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, or the type III ED. The first goal of our study was to determine the kinetic mechanisms and kinetic constants related to the interactions of three mammalian TGF-β isoforms with four different proteins: TGF-β1 LAP and type II and III EDs, in addition to an artificially dimerized type II ED (the type II ED/Fc chimera). In a typical BIAcore experiment, one of the binding partners is immobilized on the sensor chip surface (called the ligand in BIAcore terminology). A solution containing the other binding partner is injected over the sensor chip surface (called the analyte in BIAcore terminology). The mass accumulation of the analyte on the surface as it binds to the ligand is recorded in arbitrary resonance units, which vary with the refractive index of the interfacing medium. As the change in the refractive index is a linear function of the surface concentration of the macromolecules, the RU signal is proportional to the mass accumulation of the analyte. This constitutes the wash-on phase of the experiment. After a certain period of time, the analyte solution is replaced by buffer, and the dissociation of surface complexes is monitored (the wash-off phase). Since the wash-on and wash-off phases of the curve (sensorgram) are recorded in real time, it is possible to derive kinetic parameters from these sensorgrams. In preliminary experiments, injection of TGF-β1 over a control dextran surface (no ligand immobilized) resulted in a significant increase in the surface plasmon resonance signal with time, indicating that TGF-β1 binds nonspecifically to the dextran surface. In contrast, no interaction was detectable when LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, and the type III ED were injected over the control surface (data not shown). Therefore, we immobilized the TGF-β isoforms on the sensor chip and injected LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, or the type III ED over the surface. In preliminary experiments using TGF-β-coupled surfaces with LAP, type II ED, type II ED/Fc chimera, or type III ED flowing, the binding data were fit using nonlinear least-squares analysis and numerical integration of the differential rate equations corresponding to a simple kinetic model. This model did not yield a good fit as judged by the non-random distribution in the residuals (the difference between calculated and experimental data) (data not shown). This deviation from a simple one-to-one interaction model may result from the existence of a more complex biological interaction. Alternatively, it may be due to the presence of artifacts such as mass transport and rebinding effects or steric hindrance/crowding problems (24O'Shannessy D.J. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that can occur when the BIAcore experimental conditions are not optimized. To minimize these artifacts and to perform kinetic studies, we generated different surfaces where low quantities of TGF-β isoforms were coupled (from 50 to 700 RU). This approach reduces so-called crowding problems by minimizing the masking of potential ligand-binding sites on the surface by accumulated ligand·analyte complexes. Additionally, it reduces mass transport and rebinding artifacts that occur if the transportation rate of the analyte through the unstirred layer over the surface is slow compared with the kinetics of binding. Based on the results from these preliminary experiments, we coupled the minimum amount of each TGF-β isoform required to obtain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio when injecting LAP, the type II ED, the type II ED/Fc chimera, or the type III ED. Due to the different apparent kinetics and affinities of these binding proteins for TGF-β, it was necessary to use surfaces with different amounts of coupled TGF-β for each interaction. For each TGF-β isoform surface, the absence of mass transport limitation and/or rebinding artifacts was tested by injecting the lowest concentration of the analyte used in the kinetic study at different flow rates ranging from 5 to 30 µl/min. Since the sensorgrams were superimposable when varying the flow (data not shown), it can be concluded that the diffusion of the analyte from the bulk flow to the matrix is not kinetically limiting under these flow and surface conditions. We next injected LAP, type II ED, type II ED/Fc chimera, and type III ED solutions ranging in concentration from 12.5 to 200, 32 to 355, 18 to 500, and 50 to 800 nm, respectively, over the TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 surfaces that were optimized for each binding partner. The sensorgrams corresponding to the experiments using TGF-β3 surfaces are shown in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4. Similar sensorgrams were observed for the TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 surfaces (data not shown). Each set of sensorgrams was analyzed by curve fitting using the SPRevolution ® software package (19O'Connor-McCourt M.D. De Crescenzo G. Lortie R. Lenferink A.E.G. Grothe S. Lundqvist A. Greijer E.

Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This method of data analysis has been shown to be critical for distinguishing between different binding models and determining kinetic constants that are consistent with all the time points in all the sensorgrams in one set (26Fisher R.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In all cases, we observed a poor fit when using a simple one-to-one model to depict the interactions (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, panels C; and data not shown). Since artifacts such as mass transport limitation and rebinding and crowding problems were already eliminated or minimized, we tested if such deviations from fitting a simple model could be due to more complex interaction mechanisms.Figure 2Global analysis of the type II ED interaction with the TGF-β3 isoform.

This result lent further support to the in vivo data, which suggested that citrate synthase was the source of a toxic metabolite. short chain fatty acid ampicillin hexahistidine tag nutrient broth polymerase chain reaction Tn10DEL16DEL17 tetracycline MudI1734 kilobase(s). Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)1 are common by-products of bacterial fermentations and are produced in abundance in the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals (1Macfarlane G.T. Macfarlane S. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1997; 222: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although SCFAs are a good source of carbon and energy for procaryotes, they also are a hazard because they inhibit cell growth (2Cherrington C.A. Hinton M. Mead G.C. Chopra I. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 32: 88-107Google Scholar). The growth inhibitory properties of SCFAs have made them useful as preservatives in the food industry (2Cherrington C.A. Hinton M. Mead G.C. Chopra I. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 32: 88-107Google Scholar, 3Kabara J.J. Eklund T. Russell N.J. Gould G.W. Food Preservatives. Glasgow Blachie, New York1991: 45-71Google Scholar). Propionate (a three-carbon SCFA) is one of the most abundant fermentation by-products, and it is extensively used in the food industry to protect baked goods against microbial contamination (4Lück E. Jager M. Antimicrobial Food Additives: Characteristics, Uses, and Effects. 2nd Ed. Springer, New York1997: 145-151Crossref Google Scholar). Enteric bacteria such as Salmonella spp. are exposed to high concentrations of propionate in their environments. In the gastrointestinal tract of humans, fermentative bacteria such asBacteriodes and Veillonella can produce propionate levels as high as 23.1 mmol/kg (1Macfarlane G.T. Macfarlane S. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1997; 222: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cummings J.H. Pomare E.W. Branch W.J. Naylor C.P. Macfarlane G.T.

In the cecum of chickens and mice, propionate can reach levels of 9.7 and 4.4 mmol/kg, respectively (8Barnes E.M. Impey C.S. Stevens B.J. J. Hyg. 1979; 82: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Byrne B.M. Dankert J. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 559-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Salmonella spp. may also encounter propionate in many food products such as baked goods and cheese where concentrations range from 10 to 50 mm (3Kabara J.J. Eklund T. Russell N.J. Gould G.W. Food Preservatives. Glasgow Blachie, New York1991: 45-71Google Scholar, 4Lück E. Jager M. Antimicrobial Food Additives: Characteristics, Uses, and Effects. 2nd Ed. Springer, New York1997: 145-151Crossref Google Scholar). Studies on propionate and other SCFAs have shown they are major determinants in the ability of Salmonella spp. to cause disease. SCFAs produced by fermentative bacteria in mice and chickens can greatly increase resistance to Salmonella infections (8Barnes E.M. Impey C.S. Stevens B.J. J. Hyg. 1979; 82: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,10Bohnhoff M. Miller C.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1962; 111: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Meynell G.G. Subbaiah T.V.

These properties have prompted researchers to test the ability of propionate to inhibit Salmonella growth in animal feeds. The addition of propionic acid to chicken feeds at levels of 60–100 mm greatly reduced the population of Salmonellaspp. and limited the ability of Salmonella to colonize the chicken cecum (6Hume M.E. Corrier D.E. Ambrus S. Hinton Jr., A. DeLoach J.R. Avian Dis. 1993; 37: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Matlho G. Himathongkham S. Riemann H. Kass P.

Poult. Sci. 1997; 38: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the mechanisms through which propionate exerts antimicrobial activity is limited. This compound appears to affect the function of multiple targets within the cell. For example, SCFAs are known to dissipate the proton-motive force of cell membranes by entering the cell as undissociated molecules and then dissociating in the cytoplasm (3Kabara J.J. Eklund T. Russell N.J. Gould G.W. Food Preservatives. Glasgow Blachie, New York1991: 45-71Google Scholar, 16Salmond C.V. Kroll R.G. Booth I.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2845-2850PubMed Google Scholar, 17Blankenhorn D. Phillips J. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other lines of evidence suggest that the intracellular accumulation of the SCFA anions blocks metabolic pathways, arresting cell growth (18Russell J.B. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1992; 73: 363-370Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Reports in the literature suggest that propionyl-coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) is an important contributor to the observed toxicity of propionate. In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, propionyl-CoA was found to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (19Maruyama K. Kitamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in Escherichia coli, propionyl-CoA is a competitive inhibitor of citrate synthase (20Man W.-J. Li Y. Connor C.D. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Support for the idea that propionyl-CoA is a problem for the cell was also obtained inAspergillus niger, where experiments blocking propionyl-CoA formation relieved propionate sensitivity (21Sealy-Lewis H.M. Fairhurst V. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, recent experiments suggest that the inhibitory effects of propionate inA. niger may be caused by 2-methylcitrate accumulation (22Brock M. Fischer R. Linder D. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ability of microorganisms to metabolize SCFAs may be the primary line of defense against the negative effects of these compounds on cell growth (2Cherrington C.A. Hinton M. Mead G.C. Chopra I. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 32: 88-107Google Scholar, 4Lück E. Jager M. Antimicrobial Food Additives: Characteristics, Uses, and Effects. 2nd Ed. Springer, New York1997: 145-151Crossref Google Scholar). Enteric bacteria such as Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium LT2 and E. coli catabolize propionate via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle (23Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5615-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Textor S. Wendisch V.F. De Graaf A.A. Müller U. Linder M.I. Linder D. Buckel W. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, when this pathway was blocked in Salmonella, sensitivity to propionate increased dramatically (25Hammelman T.A. O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R. Tsang A.W. Rank D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 233-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that intermediates of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle may have a more profound negative effect on cell growth than propionate itself. This idea would be consistent with reports in the literature whered-threo-α-methylisocitrate was found to inhibit bovine heart NADP isocitrate dehydrogenase (26Beach R.L. Aogaichi T. Plaut G.W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2702-2709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and synthetic 2-methylcitrate was found to inhibit aconitase and citrate synthase activities (27Cheema-Dhadli S. Leznoff C.C. Halperin M.L. Pediatr. Res. 1975; 9: 905-908PubMed Google Scholar). This paper reports the isolation and characterization of a derivative of a prpC mutant (lacks methylcitrate synthase activity) ofS. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 with increased resistance to propionate. The data indicate that by lowering the level of citrate synthase in the prpC mutant, the negative effect of propionate was drastically relieved. The data strongly suggest that 2-methylcitrate is a toxic catabolite or the precursor of an as yet unidentified toxic compound. Nutrient broth (NB) at 0.8% (w/v) containing 85 mmNaCl (28Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 78-79Google Scholar) was routinely used as rich medium. E. colicultures were maintained in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. No-carbon E medium supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4 and 0.5 mm methionine was used as a minimal medium (28Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R.

Cultures were incubated in 18 × 150-mm tubes at 37 °C with shaking, and cell growth was monitored at 650 nm with a Spectronic 20D spectrophotometer furnished with a red filter (Milton Roy Co., Rochester, NY). Transductions involving phage P22 HT105 int-201 (30Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 100: 378-381Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar,31Schmieger H. Bakhaus H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were performed as described (28Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 78-79Google Scholar). Transductants were freed of phage as described (32Chan R.K. Botstein D. Watanabe T. Ogata Y. Virology. 1972; 50: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) unless otherwise stated and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. All DNA manipulations were performed in E. coli DH5α/F′. Plasmids were transformed intoE. coli or S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 by CaCl2 heat shock as described (33Seidman C.G. Struhl K. Sheen J. Jessen T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 1.8.-1.8.10Google Scholar). Plasmids transferred into Salmonella were first transformed into recombination-deficient or S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 strain JR501 (34Tsai S.P. Hartin R.J. Ryu J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2561-2567PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids from strain JR501 were transformed into other Salmonella strains as described (35Ryu J.-I. Hartin R.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 43-45PubMed Google Scholar). Ten tubes containing 2 ml of NB broth each were inoculated with isolated colonies of strain JE2170 (prpC114::MudJ) and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Cells in a 1-ml sample from each culture were pelleted in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes for 2 min at 15,000 × g in a MarathonTM 16KM microcentrifuge (Fisher). The spent medium supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 100 μl of sterile saline and plated on minimal medium supplemented with succinate, propionate, and kanamycin. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, revertants were observed. These colonies were picked and streaked for isolation on the same medium. One revertant in particular grew better than the others and was selected for further characterization. A phage P22 lysate was prepared on this strain and used to transduce strain JE2170 to growth on succinate in the presence of propionate. The reconstructed strain was freed of phage and saved as strain JE3777. As shown below, the mutation responsible for the observed resistance to propionate toxicity in this strain changes the start codon of the gltA gene from ATG (Met) to GTG (Met). Because the mutation did not change the amino acid sequence of the GltA protein, the mutant allele is hereafter referred to asgltA GTG. Unlike its parent strain, strain JE3777 (prpC114::MudJ gltA GTG) failed to utilize acetate as carbon and energy source. This growth phenotype was used to isolate a Tn10DEL16DEL17 element (hereafter referred to as Tn10d(Tc)) neargltA GTG. Briefly, phage P22 was grown on a pool of strains (approximately 100,000) each assumed to contain one transposition-defective Tn10d(Tc) element (36Way J.C. Davis M.A. Morisato D. Roberts D.E. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and a P22 lysate was prepared. This lysate was used to transduce strain JE3777 to tetracycline resistance. Tetracycline-resistant (Tcr) transductants that regained the ability to grow on acetate were freed of phage and analyzed further. A Tn10d(Tc) element close togltA GTG (>90% cotransducible by P22) was isolated, moved back into strain JE3777, and saved as strain JE3845 (prpC114::MudJ gltA GTG zbg-6391::Tn10d(Tc)). Arbitrary primer PCR was used to identify a DNA sequence flanking the linked insertion (37O'Toole G.A. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 38Parker J.D. Rabinovitch P.S. Burmer G.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3055-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of strain JE3845 was prepared using the MasterPureTM genomic DNA isolation kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Two 50-μl reactions were prepared for the first round of PCR using 1 μg of DNA template, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP (Promega), and Vent® Exo− DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a GeneAmp® PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primers used were as follows: Tn10-L, 5′-TCCATTGCTGTTGACAAA-3′; Tn10-R, 5′-ACCTTTGGTCACCAACGCTT-3′; and ARB1, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACNNNNNNNNNNGATAT-3′. The first PCR round used the following conditions: 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 30 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. In the second round of PCR, amplified DNA from the first round reactions was used to enrich for DNA flanking the Tn10d(Tc) element. Two 50-μl reactions were prepared as described above substituting 1 μl of DNA obtained during PCR round 1 for chromosomal DNA template. Primers used were as follows: Tn10-I, 5′-GACAAGATGTGTATCCAC-3′; and ARB2, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′. The second round of PCR used the following conditions: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR amplification was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (39Voytas D. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Greene Publishing Associates & Wiley Interscience, New York2000: 2.5A.1-2.5A.9Google Scholar) using 2% gels. Amplified DNA was purified using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). PCR sequencing reactions were prepared using the ABI PRISM® dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were purified in AutoSeq® G-50 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried in a SpeedVac® concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY), and sequenced at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. A primer for the 3′ end of the gltA gene (5′-CGGAAGGTCTAGATAGAGAAAAATA-3′) was designed from the sequence obtained using the Tn10-L side of thezbg-6391::Tn10d(Tc) element in JE3845 (see above). A primer for the 5′ end of gltA(5′-GATCCAGATCTAGAGGTCTTTGTTT-3′) was designed based on the reported sequence (40Enos-Berlage J.L. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3989-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gltA gene was sequenced in its entirety by PCR amplifying the gene from strain TR6583 (gltA +) and directly sequencing the entire PCR fragment by primer walking. DNA template for the PCR reactions was prepared by mixing 10 μl of NB overnight cultures of strain TR6583 with 90 μl of water, heating the cell suspensions to 100 °C for 5 min, and centrifuging them for 1 min at 15,000 × g in a Marathon 16KM microcentrifuge (Fisher). PCR reactions were prepared using one-tenth the volume of boiled template, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were performed using the following conditions: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 90 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. The PCR reactions were verified and purified, and the DNA was sequenced as described above. Sequences of all of the primers used for primer walking can be provided upon request. Each side of the gltA gene was sequenced at least two times. The DNA sequence was compiled and submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF056043). The gltA GTG mutation in JE3777 was identified by sequencing the entire gltA gene. The prpE gene was PCR-amplified as described above using an NdeI primer for the 5′ end (5′-CAGGAGAGCCATATGTCTTTTAGC-3′) and a 3′ end primer (5′-TTCTTCGATCGCCTGGC-3′). The PCR fragment was purified as described above, digested with NdeI, and cloned into pTYB2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) cut with the same enzyme. The resulting plasmid was named pPRP68 (9.4 kb, Apr). PrpE protein purified using this plasmid has an additional C-terminal glycine residue. The gltA gene was PCR-amplified as described above (using same primers) and cloned to make plasmid pGLTA1 (4.3 kb, Apr). The PCR fragment was cloned by A-tailing the DNA and ligating into pGEM®-T cloning vector using the pGEM®-T vector system kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pGLTA1 was digested with enzymesKpnI and XbaI (sites in primers) to remove thegltA gene as a 1.3-kb fragment. This piece was cloned into plasmid pBAD30 (41Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes to generate plasmid pGLTA2 (6.2 kb, Apr). The gltA gene was PCR-amplified as described above using a NdeI primer for the 5′ end (5′-GAGACCGCATATGGCTGATACA-3′) and a BamHI primer for the 3′ end (5′-CATCCGGATCCCAATTAACG-3′). The PCR fragment was purified using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested withNdeI and BamHI, and cloned into pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pGLTA3 (7 kb, Apr). The GltA protein encoded by plasmid pGLTA3 contained a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus (H6GltA). Plasmid pPRP68 (encodes PrpE) was transformed into E. coli ER2566, and the resulting strain, JE4813, was used to overexpress and purify PrpE protein. To overexpressprpE, 20 ml of an LB overnight culture of JE4813 was used to inoculate 1 liter of SOC broth (42Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar, 43Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar) containing ampicillin. The culture was grown at 20 °C with shaking to an absorbance of 0.3 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture was incubated for 18 h with shaking at 20 °C. Cells were pelleted in 250-ml bottles by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,500 ×g at 4 °C using a GSA rotor (DuPont). Cell pellets were stored at 4 °C no longer than 16 h before use. Cells overexpressing PrpE were resuspended in 100 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m KCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were centrifuged in 250-ml bottles as described above and resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer. Cells were broken by French press at 1.03 × 107 kPa using a chilled pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in 50-ml Oakridge tubes at 31,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C using a SS34 rotor (DuPont). PrpE protein was purified on chitin beads (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following purification, the enzyme was dialyzed at 4 °C against 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 0.25 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. The dialysis buffer was replaced after 2 h and again after 4 h (20% glycerol (v/v) added to the buffer). The PrpE protein was dialyzed overnight and stored at −80 °C in this buffer. The propionyl-CoA synthetase activity was monitored using a myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase coupling assay (44Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Beck W. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D.

Standard assays (0.8 ml of reaction mixture volume) contained 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 3.0 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 1.0 mm propionate, 0.25 mmNADH, 0.2 mm CoA, 0.4 mm ATP, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 15 units of myokinase, 13 units of pyuvate kinase, and 25 units of lactate dehydrogenase. For these assays, buffer and substrates were preincubated in quartz cuvettes at 37 °C in a Lambda 6 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a water-jacketed cuvette holder. After 5 min, assays were started by the addition of PrpE enzyme, and the reaction was monitored for 10 min at 340 nm. Specific activities were calculated from the extinction coefficient (12,440 m−1cm−1) of the oxidation of two molecules of NADH per AMP released. Specific activity was reported as micromoles of AMP generated per min per mg of protein. Five ml of NB overnight cultures of strains TR6583, JE2170, and JE3777 were subcultured into 500 ml of minimal medium supplemented with succinate and glutamate. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking for 24 h. Cells were pelleted in 250 ml of Nalgene® polypropylene copolymer bottles (Fisher) by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,500 × g at 4 °C using a GSA rotor in a RC-5B refrigerated centrifuge (DuPont). Cells were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm of the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cells were centrifuged in 250-ml bottles as described above and resuspended in 5 ml of the same buffer. Cell suspensions were kept on ice and broken by sonication (10 min, 50% duty, setting 3) with a model 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in 50-ml Nalgene® polypropylene copolymer Oakridge tubes (Fisher) at 31,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C with a SS34 rotor (DuPont). Supernatants were dialyzed at 4 °C in SnakeSkin® 10,000 molecular weight cut off dialysis membrane (Pierce) against 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The dialysis buffer was replaced after 2 and 4 h and then allowed to dialyze an additional 16 h. Dialyzed cell-free extracts were tested for citrate synthase activity as described below. Plasmid pGLTA3 (encodes H6GltA) was transformed into E. coli ER2566, and the resulting strain, JE4905, was used to overexpress and purify H6GltA protein. To overexpress gltA, 20 ml of an LB overnight culture of JE4905 was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB broth containing ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, and the culture was incubated for 4.5 h with shaking at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted in 250-ml bottles by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,500 × g at 4 °C using a GSA rotor (DuPont). Cell pellets were stored at 4 °C no longer than 16 h before use. Cells overexpressing H6GltA were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cells were centrifuged in 250-ml bottles as described above, and cells were resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer.

https://openalex.org/W1973404157,"Band shift assays using DNA probes that mimic closed and open complexes were used to explore the determinants of promoter recognition by sigma38 (rpoS) RNA polymerase. Duplex recognition was found to be much weaker than that observed in sigma70 promoter usage. However, binding to fork junction probes, which attempt to mimic melted DNA, was very strong. This binding occurs via the non-template strand with the identity of the two conserved junction nucleotides (-12T and -11A) being of paramount importance. A modified promoter consensus sequence identified these two nucleotides as among only four (underlined) that are highly conserved, and all four were in the -10 region (CTAcacT from -13 to -7). The remaining two nucleotides were shown to have different roles, -13C in preventing recognition by the heterologous sigma70 polymerase and -7T in directing enzyme isomerization. These -10 region nucleotides appear to have their primary function prior to full melting because probes that had a melted start site were relatively insensitive to substitution at these positions. These results suggest the sigma38 mechanism differs from the sigma70 mechanism, and this difference likely contributes to selective use of sigma38 under conditions that exist during stationery phase."

LKLF is essential during pulmonary development and single-positive T-cell development and is indispensable during mouse embryogenesis. In this study, we performed a series of experiments to define the activation domain of LKLF as a means to further advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by this transcription factor. Using deletion analysis, it is shown that LKLF contains a transcriptional activation domain as well as a strong autoinhibitory subdomain. The inhibitory subdomain is able to independently suppress transcriptional activation of other strong activators such as viral protein 16, VP16. This occurs either when the inhibitory domain is fused directly to VP16 or when the inhibitory domain is independently bound to DNA by GAL4 DNA-binding domain independent of the VP16 activator. Overexpression of the LKLF autoinhibitory domain alone potentiates transactivation by wild type LKLF, suggesting that the inhibitory domain binds a cofactor that prevents LKLF from transactivating. A yeast-two hybrid screen identified WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds specifically to the LKLF inhibitory domain but not to other transcription factors. In mammalian cells, WWP1 functions as a cofactor by binding LKLF and suppressing transactivation.

LKLF is expressed predominantly in fetal and adult lungs, with limited expression in other organs (1Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Wani M.A. Conkright M.D. Jeffries S. Hughes M.J. Lingrel J.B. Genomics. 1999; 60: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analysis of chimeric mice derived from LKLF−/− embryonic stem cells demonstrated that LKLF is essential for late stages of normal lung development (3Wani M.A. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21180-21185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to pulmonary development, the programming of the quiescent state of single-positive (CD4+ or CD8+) T cells and the late-stage survival of these cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs and blood are also dependent on LKLF (4Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar,5Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 788-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early in T-cell development, single-positive thymocytes are produced and survive in the thymus without LKLF. However, the mature circulating cells undergo apoptosis in LKLF−/− mice, resulting in severely reduced numbers of peripheral T cells (4Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 5Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 788-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of LKLF through gene targeting in embryonic stem cells results in embryonic lethality (6Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). LKLF homozygous null mice die in utero between 12.5 and 14.5 days of gestation due to severe hemorrhage. Defects in the blood vessel morphology, an abnormally thin tunica media, endothelial cell necrosis, and decreased deposition of the extracellular matrix surrounding the vessels collectively contribute to hemorrhage in LKLF−/− embryos (6Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Analogous to its role in other organs, LKLF does not appear to be an important regulator of the initiation or early stages of blood vessel morphogenesis; rather, it is active in the late stages of development including the cell-mediated assembly and stabilization of the blood vessel wall (6Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Whereas the mechanism by which LKLF regulates blood vessel integrity is unknown, it has been suggested that LKLF may regulate a signaling pathway responsible for endothelial cell differentiation or survival required for the formation of the mature blood vessel wall (6Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). LKLF was initially described as a lung-specific transcription factor (1Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that LKLF plays a pivotal role in blood vessel formation and T-cell activation in addition to pulmonary development. A unifying theme in these apparently diverse roles is that LKLF is essential for late stages of development but is not required for the initial steps. Despite the large amount of information about the biological role of LKLF, no specific target gene(s) or mechanisms of LKLF regulation have yet been identified. Determination of the molecular mechanisms that underlie LKLF function as a regulator of transcriptional pathways is paramount in providing additional insight into its roles in pulmonary function, maintenance of single-positive T cells, and embryogenesis. One approach to deciphering the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional activation by this factor is to study its functional domains. Transcription factors are commonly composed of two distinct separable domains, an activation domain and a DNA-binding domain. Recent studies of two Krüppel-like factors, the erythroid (EKLF/KLF1) and gut-enriched (GKLF/EZF/KLF4) Krüppel-like factors, demonstrate that for transcriptional activation, only a small subdomain of the activation domain is required (8Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9de Geiman T.-T.H. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W.

This is in contrast to intestinal-enriched Krüppel-like factor, which requires the entire activation domain (11Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). LKLF, EKLF, and GKLF comprise a subfamily in the KLF family. All these transcription factors contain an inhibitory subdomain located adjacent to the zinc fingers (8Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9de Geiman T.-T.H. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yet S.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Deletion of the inhibitory subdomains in EKLF and GKLF allows these factors to function as more potent activators of transcription. Despite the similarity in size, function, and physical location of these inhibitory subdomains, no obvious conservation in the amino acid sequence has been detected. Thus, activation domains are beginning to emerge as complex multifunctional domains with discrete subdomains that are likely involved in the regulation of transcription factors. By studying the biochemical attributes and configurations of the activation domains present in transcriptional activators we can better understand the mechanisms governing gene regulation and, ultimately, the role of tissue-specific transcriptional activators. Our current studies demonstrate that LKLF contains a modular activation domain that can be separated into inhibitory and transactivating subdomains. The inhibitory domain of LKLF binds specifically to an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is able to attenuate transactivation by LKLF. The interactions between these two proteins likely represent one method by which this transcription factor is regulated. Full-length LKLF cDNA fragment was subcloned into expression vector pM (12Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that contained the coding region of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) to create a fusion protein between GAL4 DBD and LKLF. Six GAL4-LKLF mutants (GAL4-LKLF 1–267, GAL4-LKLF 1–257, GAL4-LKLF 1–141, GAL4-LKLF 1–110, GAL4-LKLF 1–88, and GAL4-LKLF 1–57) were then created by serial deletions utilizing the restriction enzyme site (BssHI, NotI,RsrII, XbaIII, SacII, andBstXI, respectively) in the coding region of LKLF and a restriction site in the polylinker. After deletion of the 3′ end of LKLF cDNA, the staggered ends generated from the restriction digests were blunted with T4 polymerase before ligation. Stop codons in the vector prevented any read through. Three additional LKLF internal deletion mutants (GAL4-LKLF Δ110–257, GAL4-LKLF Δ88–267, and GAL4-LKLF Δ57–215) were constructed in pGEM3 (Promega, Madison, WI) and then subcloned into pM vector. The internal deletion mutants were created utilizing either internal restriction sites or PCR to amplify the zinc fingers, adding a silent mutation to create a unique restriction site. GAL4-LKLF Δ57–215 was created utilizing two internal NarI sites, and GAL4-LKLF Δ110–257 was created utilizing two XbaIII restriction sites. PCR was used to create GAL4-LKLF Δ88–267 by amplifying the zinc finger domain to introduce a second SacII restriction site by silent mutation at the 5′ end (5′-TCC-CGC-GGC-CAA-ACA-TAC-TTG-CAG-C-3′ and 5′-CTC-AAG-CTT-GCA-GTG-TGT-TTG-CAA-GGG-3′). This allowed a deletion from the SacII site at amino acid 88 to the beginning of the zinc finger. Six additional LKLF-GAL4 DNA-binding domain expression constructs were created to produce fusion proteins that contained the GAL4 DBD on the carboxyl terminus rather than the amino terminus of the LKLF activation domain (LKLF 1–57-GAL4, LKLF 1–88-GAL4, LKLF 1–110-GAL4, LKLF 1–141-GAL4, LKLF 1–257-GAL4, and LKLF 1–267-GAL4). Each of these constructs was created utilizing an internal restriction site (listed above) joined to PCR amplification of the GAL4 DBD (5′-NNC-TCT-CCA-TGG-GAT-TGG-ACA-TGA-AGC-TAC-TGT-CTT-CT-3′, 5′-NNA-TCC-CCG-CGG-ACA-TGA-AGC-TAC-TGT-CTT-CT-3′, 5′-NNC-ACG-GCC-GCA-TGA-AGC-TAC-TGT-CTT-CT-3′, 5′-NNC-ACG-GAC-CGA-TGA-AGC-TAC-TGT-CTT-CT-3′, 5′-NNA-AAC-GCG-GCC-GCA-TGA-AGC-TAC-TGT-CTT-CT-3′, 5′-NNA-AGC-GCG-CCA-TGA-AGC-TAC-TGT-CTT-CT-3′, and 5′-NNN-AAG-CTT- TTA-CGA-TAC-AGT-CAA-CTG-TC-3′). LKLF inhibitory domain fused to the GAL4 DBD (GAL4-LKLF111–267) and deletion mutations of the inhibitory domain (GAL4-LKLF111–200, GAL4-LKLF111–150, GAL4-LKLF150–200, GAL4-LKLF150–267, and GAL4-LKLF200–267) were created by PCR amplification (5′-NNN-GGA-TCC-TTC-CTC-CTT-GCG-CCT-3′, 5′-NNN-GGA- TCC-GCC-CCA-GGA-GCG-ACA-3′, 5′-NNN-GGA-TCC-GGC-GCC- CTC-GAG-CTT-3′, 5′-NNN-AAG-CTT-GCT-GGG-GCC-GGG-ACC-3′, 5′-NNN-AAG-CTT-GGC-GGC-GCG-CTT-GCG-3′, 5′-NNN-AAG-CTT-GGC-GCC-CTC-GAG-CTT-3′, and 5′-NNN-GGA-TCC-AGC-TTC-GGC-GGT-3′). Lex A-VP16-LKLF 111–267 was created by the addition of ApaI restriction sites to each cDNA coding for LKLF amino acids 111–267 by PCR amplification (5′-NNN-TGG-GCC-CCC-CTC-CTT-GCG-CCT-CCC-3′ and 5′-GGG-GGC-CCA-GGC-GGC-GCG-CTT-CCG-GGG-3′). This region was cloned into the ApaI of site Lex A-VP16 expression vector and was confirmed by sequence analysis. Full-length WWP1 and E6AP were kindly provided by Drs. Emery Bresnick and Allen Weissman, respectively. An expression plasmid for carboxyl-terminal hemagglutin (HA) LKLF was generated by PCR. Monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS) or mouse lung adenoma (LA4) cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105cells/35-mm tissue culture dish. The following day, cells were transfected by Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 0.25 µg of reporter HS2β-CAT (1Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), pG5-CAT (12Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), or 5CACCC-LUC plasmid; 0.25 µg of pSV2LUC or CMV-βGal control plasmid; and 1.0 µg of test vector (GAL4-LKLF, LKLF-GAL4 deletion mutant, Lex A-VP16, GAL4-VP16, Lex A-VP16-LKLF111–267, and LKLF-HA of WWP1-FLAG as described in each figure). Vector DNA was added as needed to keep the total DNA constant. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The luciferase and CAT activity was determined by disrupting the cells by three cycles of freeze-thaw lysis in 0.25m Tris (pH 7.5) to make crude protein extract. An aliquot of protein extract was used for analysis of luciferase activity (Promega). The remaining extract was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. Extract amounts were normalized for transfection efficiencies, and CAT assays were performed at 37 °C for 1 h. The thin-layer chromatography plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for quantitation. Normalized values for the CAT activity are based on the percentage conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol substrate to the acetylated forms and corrected for transfection efficiency with luciferase activity. LKLF-GAL4 fusion protein and deletion mutants were transfected into COS cells for 48 h as described above. Cells were lysed with Laemmli buffer (0.0625m Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 0.150m dithiothreitol, and 0.005% bromophenol blue), and each sample was separated by electrophoresis on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane. After blocking, 0.1 µg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GAL4 DBD protein or Lex A DBD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the membrane. The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Protein-antibody interaction was visualized by chemiluminescence detection using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The inhibitory domains of LKLF (aa 111–267) and EKLF (aa 197–292) were cloned by PCR in frame to the GAL4 DBD in pAS-1-CYH2. Likewise, full-length LKLF and EKLF were also subcloned into the pAS-1-CYH2 yeast vector. The GAL4 DBD-GATA 5 (aa 133–265) and GAL4 DBD-GATA 6 (aa 208–351) constructs were gifts from Jeff Molkentin. The library consisted of rat lung cDNA fused to the activation domain of GAL4 in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted with the inhibitory domain (aa 111–267) of LKLF fused to Gal4 DBD following the manufacturer's protocols (CLONTECH) except where noted. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (14James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-MEL1) was used in all the two-hybrid assays. Approximately 1.5 × 106transformants were screened. The yeast were grown on synthetic dropout, a minimal medium, with appropriate amino acid omissions not only for plasmid selection but also for selection of protein-protein interactions. Tryptophan and leucine were selective markers for the co-transformed pAS-1-CYH2 and pGAD10 plasmids. Histidine and adenine select for protein-protein interactions between the LKLF inhibitory domain and the GAL4 activation domain fusion protein. The pGAD10 plasmid was recovered from the triple positive (His+, Ade+, and Mel1+) clones by growing in leucine-deficient liquid synthetic dropout media for 48 h. Yeast were collected from 1 ml of liquid culture by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the cell pellet was resuspended in the residual media in the microcentrifuge tube by vortexing. Next, 50 units of lyticase was added to the yeast, and the cells were digested for 2 h at 37 °C. The remaining plasmid isolation was conducted following the standard Qiagen miniprep protocol for Escherichia coli. Isolation of the yeast plasmid DNA contains a mixture of pAS-1-CYH2 and pGAD10 vectors, and the use of HB101 E. coli, a Leu-2-deficient strain, allows the selection of the pAS-1-CYH2 vector from the pGAD10 vector. Isolated plasmids were transformed into HB101 E. coli and grown on M9 leucine-deficient selection medium with ampicillin. Isolated pGAD10 vector was then subjected to double-stranded nucleotide sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). To eliminate the possibility that the interaction between WWP1 was fortuitous, an interaction between WWP1 and other transcription factors was examined. GAL4-WWP1 was co-transformed with pAS-1-CYH alone or with pAS-1-CYH containing cDNA for the inhibitory domain of EKLF, full-length EKLF, GATA 5, or GATA 6. In addition, WWP1 was also transformed by itself. LKLF tagged with the HA epitope and WWP1 tagged with the FLAG epitope were transiently transfected into COS cells as described above. After co-transfection with WWP1 and LKLF, the cells were lysed with a hypotonic buffer containing Nonidet P-40. The cell lysates were split and incubated with either a polyclonal antibody against the HA antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune serum. The protein-antibody complex was then precipitated by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After washing the absorbed beads in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, the precipitants were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Finally, Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (M2) against the FLAG antigen (Sigma) fused to WWP1 was used to evaluate the association of the two proteins during the precipitation. Previous studies have indicated that some members of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors consist of multiple domains that function in transcriptional activation, inhibition of activation, protein-protein interaction, DNA binding, and transcriptional repression (8Chen X.

To identify the functional domains of LKLF, a series of plasmids containing various portions of LKLF cDNA joined to the DBD of yeast transcription factor GAL4 were constructed (Fig. 1, A andD). Because GAL4 fusion proteins are of yeast origin, they have the advantage of little or no background interference in mammalian cells. In addition, GAL4 DBD directs proteins to the nucleus, alleviating the concern that deletion mutants might disrupt the natural nuclear localization signal of a protein. Both serial deletions and internal deletions were created and assayed for the ability to transactivate pG5-CAT, a reporter construct containing five GAL4-binding sites in front of the E1b minimal promoter (Fig. 1,A and D). Full-length LKLF (aa1–354) fused to the GAL4 DBD transactivated the reporter gene only modestly. However, because additional portions of the carboxyl terminus of LKLF were deleted, transcriptional activation increased. Removal of amino acids 111–354 resulted in a 25-fold increase in transcriptional activation (Fig. 1 B). Further deletions of the activation domain resulted in a slight attenuation in transactivation. Equivalent results are observed when these experiments are conducted in a mouse lung adenoma cell line (LA4) expressing endogenous LKLF (data not shown). Western blot analysis of cell lysates was performed to demonstrate that the full-length protein and each mutant protein were made in the cell, ruling out the possibility that the inability of LKLF or LKLF deletion mutants to transactivate was the result of the protein not being synthesized. (Fig. 1 C). Amino acids 1–110 are able to function as a potent activator of transcription and transactivate significantly better than full-length LKLF, suggesting that an inhibitory domain is present outside this region of the protein. To determine whether the inhibitory domain is contained within the Cys2-His2 zinc fingers, internal deletion constructs were engineered that maintained this protein feature (Fig. 1 D). The activity of the activating subdomain (aa 1–110) to enhance reporter gene expression is unaffected by the presence of the zinc fingers. This demonstrates that the zinc fingers do not contain the inhibitory subdomain (Fig. 1 E) and further localizes this regulatory region to amino acids 111–267. A Western blot analysis once again demonstrated the presence of full-length LKLF and each mutant protein in the cells (Fig.1 F). Whereas the natural DNA-binding domain of LKLF is located on the carboxyl terminus of the activation domain, the GAL4 DNA binding domain was attached to the amino-terminal portion. To rule out any positional effects from this configuration, additional LKLF deletion constructs were engineered to contain the GAL4 DBD on the carboxyl terminus of the activation domain. These deletion constructs were assayed for the ability to activate transcription from a reporter gene. In agreement with the above-mentioned results, removal of amino acids 111–267 increased transcriptional activation, although the total fold activation is slightly lower. Collectively, these data demonstrate that LKLF contains a potent transactivation domain in the first 110 amino acids. In addition, LKLF contains a region between amino acids 111–267 that is responsible for suppressing transactivation and represents a regulatory region in the protein. Deletion of amino acids 111–267 from LKLF allows this factor to function as a stronger activator of transcription, suggesting that this region functions as a regulator of transcriptional activation. To reinforce the deletion analysis and provide a positive assay for this function, we show that this LKLF inhibitory domain can also directly suppress other transactivators. LKLF inhibitory domain was fused to the heterologous protein Lex A-VP16 (Lex A-VP16-LKLF 111–267) and compared with unmodified Lex A-VP16 for the ability to transactivate a reporter gene. The LKLF inhibitory domain almost completely suppressed transactivation by VP16 (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis confirmed that both Lex A-VP16 and Lex A-VP16-LKLF 111–267 proteins were being made in the cell (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the LKLF inhibitory domain is not only capable of inhibiting transactivation by a strong transcriptional activator such as VP16 but is a modular protein region that can function independent of other regions of LKLF. The ability of the inhibitory domain to suppress transactivation may occur through an intramolecular or intermolecular mechanism. To examine the possibility that the LKLF inhibitory domain functions through an intermolecular mechanism, several chimeric proteins were generated that consist of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to various regions of LKLF. The ability of these GAL4 fusion proteins to modulate transcriptional activation by the heterologous protein Lex A-VP16 when both factors are simultaneously bound to the promoter region was examined. In all, three GAL4-LKLF heterologous proteins were generated with either the inhibitory domain (GAL4-LKLF 111–267), the activation domain (GAL4-LKLF 1–110), or both domains (GAL4-LKLF 1–267) fused to the GAL4 DBD. Each of the three GAL4-LKLF chimeric proteins or the control GAL4 DBD alone was examined for the ability to modulate transactivation of Lex A-VP16. For these studies we utilized an artificial CAT reporter system in which five GAL4-binding sites are present adjacent to eight Lex A-binding sites (L8G5-CAT) (Fig.3 A) (13Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In this system, Lex A-VP16 and a GAL4 DBD fusion protein are able to bind and occupy their respective response elements simultaneously. As expected, GAL4 DBD bound to the promoter in the absence of Lex A-VP16 but was unable to transactivate the CAT reporter gene, demonstrating that GAL4 DBD by itself does not have any transactivating capabilities (Fig.3 B). The addition of Lex A-VP16 even in the presence of GAL4 DBD resulted in strong transactivation (Fig. 3 B). When GAL4 DBD was replaced with GAL4 DBD fused to LKLF inhibitory domain, transactivation by Lex A-VP16 was attenuated 6-fold (Fig.3 B). This demonstrates that the LKLF inhibitory domain is able to regulate transactivation by an intermolecular mechanism. Furthermore, the inhibition of the Lex A-VP16 transactivation by the inhibitory domains cannot be attributed to steric hindrance or to a physical block of transactivation. This is demonstrated with the analysis of Lex A-VP16 activation in the presence of GAL4 DBD fused to the LKLF activation domain (GAL4-LKLF 1–110). In this situation, transactivation was potentiated rather than suppressed (Fig.3 B). A similar result is observed when both domains are fused to GAL4 DBD, although, as one might expect, the potentiation was not as high as that of activator alone (Fig. 3 B). Each of the GAL4 DBD fusion proteins and GAL4 DBD fused to VP16 was also tested for the ability to transactivate in the absence of Lex A-VP16. Essentially, this recapitulates the data from the earlier experiment but also demonstrates that the inhibitory domain had no transactivation potential associated with it (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the LKLF activation domain and VP16 are able to transactivate the reporter gene with comparable efficiency (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the three GAL4-LKLF fusion constructs were tested for the ability to inhibit Lex A-VP16 when the GAL4 binding sites are absent from the promoter (L8-CAT) (Fig. 3 C). In this situation, Lex A-VP 16 was able to occupy the promoter; however, because the GAL4-binding sites are absent, the GAL4 DBD fusion protein was unable to bind the promoter. Neither GAL4"

From a cosmid clone (cos16F4) containing part of the elloramycin biosynthesis gene cluster, three genes (elmMI, elmMII, andelmMIII) have been cloned. Sequence analysis and data base comparison showed that their deduced products resembledS-adenosylmethionine-dependentO-methyltransferases. The genes were individually expressed in Streptomyces albus and also coexpressed with genes involved in the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose, the 6-deoxysugar attached to the elloramycin aglycon. The resulting recombinant strains were used to biotransform three different elloramycin-type compounds: l-rhamnosyl-tetracenomycin C,l-olivosyl-tetracenomycin C, andl-oleandrosyl-tetracenomycin, which differ in their 2′-, 3′-, and 4′-substituents of the sugar moieties.

Particularly, the streptomycetes are responsible for the biosynthesis of most of the bioactive compounds clinically useful or with application in veterinary and animal husbandry. Many of them are glycosylated compounds and, in this case, the biological activity is usually correlated with the presence of the sugars, being in some cases essential for activity. Most of these sugars belong to the large family of 6-deoxyhexoses (6DOHs),1which form part of a great number of natural products, and at least 70 different 6DOHs have been identified in various metabolites (1Piepersberg W. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1994; 14: 251-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Liu H. Thorson S.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 223-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 3Trefzer A. Salas J.A. Bechthold A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 283-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In recent years, a number of genes encoding deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes from antibiotic-producing microorganisms have been characterized. The first and common step in most 6DOH biosynthesis is the activation of d-glucose 1-phosphate into TDPd-glucose in a reaction catalyzed by a glucose-1-phosphate:TTP thymidylyl transferase. Then a key dehydration step takes place, by the action of a TDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, generating TDP-d-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, a key intermediate of the 6DOH biosynthesis. In this step, the 6-position of the sugar gets deoxygenated, and the typical 5-methyl group (=C-6) is generated that will remain in the structure of all 6DOHs. These two “initial” enzymes are quite well conserved in many pathways, thus facilitating the use of the corresponding genes as probes for the isolation of homologous genes from other pathways (4Decker H. Gaisser S. Pelzer S. Schneider P. Westrich L. Wohlleben W. Bechthold A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further steps in the biosynthesis will diversify the sugars into l- ord-6DOHs (upon the action of a 5- or a 3,5-epimerase), and other modifications can occur, affecting the substituents and/or the stereochemistry at carbon 2, 3, or 4. Typical are further deoxygenation steps, C- or O-methylations and transaminations, thus generating the large family of 6DOH. Several genes have been characterized whose deduced products have been proposed to be sugar O-methyltransferases. Most of them participate in the modification of the sugar components of macrolide antibiotics. During the last two steps of the biosynthesis of tylosin, the intermediate demethylmacrocin is converted into macrocin and then to tylosin through two O-methylation steps catalyzed by the TylE and TylF O-methyltransferases, respectively (5Bate N. Cundliffe E. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Fouces R. Mellado E. Diez B. Barredo J.L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These two reactions occur once all the sugars in tylosin have been attached to the aglycon. They modify 6-deoxy-d-allose, the sugar that has been transferred by a glycosyltransferase, intod-mycinose, the final sugar in tylosin. From the gene cluster of the structurally closely related macrolide antibiotic mycinamycin produced by Micromonospora griseorubida, another gene, mycF, was isolated and proposed to encode a macrocinO-methyltransferase (7Inouye M. Suzuki H. Takada Y. Muto N. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). AnotherO-methyltransferase gene, oleY, was reported inStreptomyces antibioticus, the oleandomycin producer (8Olano C. Rodriguez A.M. Michel J.M. Méndez C. Raynal M.C. Salas J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its product OleY is involved in the conversion of l-olivose into l-oleandrose (9Aguirrezabalaga I. Olano C. Allende N. Rodriguez L. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1266-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, eryG encodes anO-methyltransferase that catalyzes the last step in the erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the 3-O-methylation of l-mycarose intol-cladinose, thus also acting on a completely glycosylated intermediate (10Paulus T.J. Tuan J.S. Luebke V.E. Maine G.T. DeWitt J.P. Katz L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2541-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of tylosin, only a single methylation event modifying a deoxysugar moiety occurs in all of the biosyntheses of these macrolides. However, there are some glycosylated bioactive compounds harboring three methoxy groups in a single 6DOH at carbons 2, 3, and 4. Such is the case of the anthracycline-like drug elloramycin, which is produced by Streptomyces olivaceusTü2353 (11Drautz H. Reuschenbach P. Zähner H. Rohr J. Zeeck A. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), along with various minor congeners (12Fiedler H.P. Rohr J. Zeeck A. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Elloramycin A (Fig. 1 A) has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and also exhibits antitumor activity (13Rohr J. Zeeck A. J. Antibiot. 1990; 43: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is a glycosylated tetracyclic aromatic polyketide, and its aglycon elloramycinone is a structural isomer of tetracenomycin C, with the difference in the methylation pattern. Elloramycin has its C-12a-O methylated (OH in tetracenomycin C), while tetracenomycin C contains an 8-OCH3 group (OH in elloramycinone). However, the most striking difference between elloramycin and tetracenomycin C is that elloramycin contains a permethylated l-rhamnose residue attached at the C-8 hydroxy group. Most of the elloramycin congeners, such as elloramycins B to D, differ in the methylation pattern, mostly within the l-rhamnose moiety (Fig.1 A) (we will henceforth refer to elloramycin A simply as elloramycin). In our studies on deoxysugar biosynthesis and glycosyltransfer in antibiotic biosyntheses, we were interested in identifying and characterizing methyltransferase genes responsible for thel-rhamnose permethylation. We report here the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the elmMI, elmMII, and elmMIII genes from the elloramycin producer S. olivaceus Tü2353 and experimental evidence for the preferred substrate each of the corresponding enzymes is acting on. Streptomyces olivaceus Tü2353, elloramycin producer, was used as a source of chromosomal DNA. Streptomyces albus G (14Chater K.F. Wilde L.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 116: 323-334PubMed Google Scholar) was used as transformation host. Growth was carried out on trypticase soya broth (TSB; Oxoid) or R5A medium (15Fernández E. Weißbach U.

For sporulation, they were grown for 7 days at 30 °C on agar plates containing A medium (15Fernández E. Weißbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J.

Generation of protoplasts and protoplast transformation were carried out using standard procedures (16Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P.

Both DNA strands were sequenced with primers supplied in the kits or with internal oligoprimers (17-mer) using an ALF-express automatic DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Computer-aided data base searching and sequence analyses were carried out using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group programs package (20Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and the BLAST program (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Restriction sites for SpeI (at the forward primer) andXbaI (at the reverse primer) were introduced to facilitate subcloning. PCR conditions were as follows. 100 ng of template DNA was mixed with 30 pmol of each primer and 2 units of Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing a 2 mm concentration of each dNTP and 10% Me2SO (Merck). The polymerization reaction was performed in a thermocycler (MinyCycler, MJ Research) under the following conditions: an initial denaturation of 3 min at 98 °C; 30 cycles of 30 s at 98 °C, 60 s at 67 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C; and after the 30 cycles an extra extension step of 5 min at 72 °C followed by cooling at 4 °C at the end of this program. The PCR products were digested with SpeI and XbaI and subcloned into the same sites of pBSK. For cloning of elmMI, the corresponding fragment was rescued as aSpeI–XbaI fragment from the pBSK construct and subcloned into the XbaI site of pIAGO in the correct orientation and immediately downstream of the erythromycin resistance promoter (ermE*p), generating pEPM1. For cloning ofelmMII and elmMIII, the fragments were rescued asBamHI–XbaI fragments from the corresponding pBSK constructs and subcloned into the same sites of pIAGO, generating pEPM2 and pEPM3, respectively.Table IIOligoprimers used for PCR amplification of elmMI, elmMII, and elmMIIIGenePrimerOligoprimerelmMIForward5′-ATCGACTAGTTCCCGCCGCGCGACCGGCTGGTCCTGGG-3′Reverse5′-ATCGTCTAGACTCGTCTCCTCGCGCCCGCAGCGCCCACAGC-3′elmMIIForward5′-ATCGACTAGTCCTCCCGACCACTCAAGGAGACGCATGACCAC-3′Reverse5′-ATATTCTAGATGTCCGCGCCCACCTCCGGCATG-3′elmMIIIForward5′-ATCGACTAGTTACGAGGAGTGGACCGCGCCGGAC-3′Reverse5′-ATCGTCTAGAGTGCGGCTCCCGTGATCAGGGCC-3′Underlined DNA sequence represents sites for SpeI (ACTAGT) and XbaI (TCTAGA) that were introduced at the oligoprimers to facilitate subcloning.

The three methyltransferase genes were also coexpressed with genes directing the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose coded by pRHAM (22Rodriguez L. Oelkers C. Aguirrezabalaga I. Braña A.F. Rohr J. Méndez C. Salas A. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 271-276PubMed Google Scholar). The three PCR fragments mentioned above were rescued from pBSKM1, pBSKM2, and pBSKM3 as SpeI–XbaI fragments and subcloned into the XbaI site of pRHAM, located immediately downstream of the rhamnose biosynthetic genes. Several glycosylated compounds were prepared to be used as substrates for biotransformation and for enzyme assays. These werel-rhamnosyl-tetracenomycin C (RHA-TCMC),l-olivosyl-tetracenomycin C (OLV-TCMC),l-oleandrosyl-tetracenomycin C (OLE-TCMC), and 2-methoxy-l-rhamnosyl-tetracenomycin C (MeRHA-TCMC). RHA-TCMC and MeRHA-TCMC were produced in a two-step process. In a first step, a common intermediate, 8-demethyl-tetracenomycin C (8DMTC), was produced by growing a strain of Streptomyces argillaceusATCC 12956 (mithramycin producer) containing cos16F4 (23Blanco G.

This compound was then used as substrate for biotransformation experiments, using as hosts two different S. albus recombinant strains. (i) For the production of RHA-TCMC, a S. albus recombinant strain harboring pRHAM-GT (see Table I) able to direct the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose and harboring the elloramycin glycosyltransferase gene elmGT was used (23Blanco G.

In both cases, spores of the respective clones were inoculated in TSB medium supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml thiostrepton and incubated at 30 °C and 250 rpm. After 24 h, the cultures were used to inoculate (at 2.5%, v/v) three 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 400 ml of R5A medium (14Chater K.F. Wilde L.C. J. Gen.

After further incubation for 24 h in the same conditions, the cultures were supplemented with 100 μg/ml 8DMTC, and incubation continued for an additional 24-h period. HPLC analysis of culture supernatants showed the disappearance of most of the precursor and the formation of new tetracenomycin derivatives. The cultures were then centrifuged, filtered, extracted, and chromatographed as previously described (15Fernández E. Weißbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J.

The mobile phase used for elution in isocratic conditions was a mixture of methanol and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (50:50) for RHA-TCMC or a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (27:73) for MeRHA-TCMC. The peaks corresponding to the desired compounds were collected, diluted 4-fold with water, applied to a reverse phase extraction cartridge, washed with water to eliminate trifluoroacetic acid, and finally eluted with methanol and dried in vacuo. OLV-TCMC and OLE-TCMC were obtained by growing the S. albusrecombinant strain AL16-OLV that contains cos16F4 and pOLV and purified as described (22Rodriguez L. Oelkers C. Aguirrezabalaga I.

All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 400 NMR instrument operating at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 teslas. The positive fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra and the high resolutions spectra were obtained using a VG70SQ double focusing magnetic sector MS instrument. Nitrobenzene amide was used as the matrix. The structures of the previously unknown new elloramycin derivatives, RHA-TCMC and MeRHA-TCMC, were unambiguously identified using one- and two-dimensional NMR and FAB mass spectroscopy. All proton and carbon NMR signal assignments were initially based on comparison with other known elloramycin/tetracenomycin derivatives (11Drautz H. Reuschenbach P. Zähner H. Rohr J. Zeeck A. J.

RHA-TCMC could be identified from its 1H NMR spectrum showing seven hydroxy groups. The α-linkage of thel-rhamnose moiety follows from the small coupling constant observed for the anomeric proton 1′-H (J 1′-H/2′-H = 1.5 Hz). The attachment of the sugar moiety at the expected 8-position was proven from the nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy spectrum, in which a clear correlation between 1′-H of the sugar building block and 7-H of the aglycon moiety could be observed. The relative stereochemistry in the rigid six-membered l-rhamnose moiety could be unambiguously verified from the H,H coupling constants considering the Karplus rules. All pf the carbon and proton signals of the aglycon moiety match those of previously characterized elloramycin derivatives.

Positive FAB MS (nitrobenzene amide): m/z 619 (100%, M − H+). For small scale biotransformation experiments, spores of the appropriate S. albus recombinant strains were used to inoculate 5 ml of TSB liquid medium containing 2.5 μg/ml thiostrepton for 24 h at 30 °C and 250 rpm. Then 100 μl of this preinoculum were used to inoculate 5 ml of R5A liquid medium. After 24 h of incubation, OLV-TCMC, OLE-TCMC, RHA-TCMC, or MeRHA-TCMC was added at a 100 μg/ml final concentration, and the cultures were further incubated for 24–48 h. Samples (900 μl) were removed and mixed with 300 μl of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation to separate the aqueous and organic phases, the organic phase was removed and evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was resuspended in a small volume of methanol for further analysis. For TLC analysis, 1–2-μl samples were applied onto precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates and developed by chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (90:10, v/v) as a solvent. Detection was carried out by UV light absorption. HPLC analysis was performed in a reversed phase column (Symmetry C18, 4.6 × 250 mm; Waters) as previously described (24Fernández Lozano M.J. Remsing L.L.,. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Fernández E. Sánchez C. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3065-3074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Detection and spectral characterization of peaks were made with a photodiode array detector and Millennium software (Waters), extracting bidimensional chromatograms at 280 nm. In some cases, HPLC analysis was performed on supernatants obtained by centrifugation of culture samples without previous extraction. For the in vitro enzyme assays of the methyltransferases, a preinoculum was prepared (see “Biotransformation”) of the appropriate S. albus recombinant strains (containing pEPM1, pEPM2, and pEPM3). Then 1 ml of this preinoculum was used to inoculate 50 ml of TSB liquid medium, and, after 24 h of incubation, the mycelia was harvested by centrifugation and washed in distilled water and again in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer containing 1 mmdithiothreitol. The mycelia was finally suspended in 5 ml of the same buffer and disrupted by sonication (five pulses of 15 s each with intermittent cooling in an MSE ultrasonic disintegrator at 150 watts and 20 kHz). After the removal of unbroken cells and cellular debris by centrifugation, the soluble fraction was used for methylation assays. Methylation reactions consisted of the following components (300-μl final volume): 6 μl ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (0.1 mCi/ml; specific activity 68 Ci/mmol), 6 μl of 5 mg/ml stock solution of the different glycosylated tetracenomycin derivatives, and a variable volume of extract and buffer (to a total of 300 μl) depending on the protein concentration of the extracts. During incubation at 30 °C, samples (50 μl) were removed at different time intervals and extracted with 50 μl of ethyl acetate. After phase separation, the organic phase was recovered, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was suspended in 100 μl of methanol. After the addition of scintillation mixture, the radioactivity in the samples was determined. Radioactivity in the organic phase corresponded to methylated tetracenomycin derivatives as verified by HPLC analysis (see “Results”). From a cosmid library of chromosomal DNA from S. olivaceus Tü2353, elloramycin producer, several overlapping cosmid clones were isolated that contained part of the elloramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (25Decker H. Rohr J. Motamedi H. Zähner H. Hutchinson C.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One of these clones, cos16F4, was found to hybridize with probes containing different genes of the structurally related anthracycline tetracenomycin C (Fig. 1 B), thus probably containing all or part of the genes necessary for the biosynthe"

The first meiotic division, meiosis I, is unique in that homologous chromosomes synapse and then segregate to opposite poles. Crossing over, but not gene conversion, provides a physical connection between homologous chromosomes and ensures their proper segregation at meiosis I (for review, see Refs. 1Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar and 2Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8167-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The distribution of crossovers along a chromosome is regulated. When multiple crossovers occur on a chromosome, they are further apart than predicted from the frequency of individual crossovers, a phenomenon called crossover interference. This regulation takes place so that every pair of homologous chromosomes sustains at least one crossover, and it underscores the importance of crossing over for faithful segregation of chromosomes. An extensive body of evidence has accumulated indicating that crossing over is under the control of a specific set of proteins that are required for crossing over but not gene conversion (3Sym M.

It should be noted that both of the two 3′-single-strand ends originating from a single DSB must invade the same chromatid to form a double-Holliday junction. It is possible that the two different outcomes of recombination, crossing over and gene conversion, result from alternate resolutions of double-Holliday junctions. However, it is also possible that crossing over and gene conversion events are differentiated from each other before or during the formation of the joint molecules. The observation that mutations in the genes that are specifically required for crossing over show a defect in the transition from DSBs to the joint molecules supports this latter view (8Nakagawa T. Ogawa H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5714-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Storlazzi A. Xu L. Schwacha A. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The MER3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is expressed only in meiosis (8Nakagawa T. Ogawa H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5714-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Ogawa H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the absence of MER3, the frequency of crossing over is reduced, and the distribution of crossovers along a chromosome is randomized because of an apparent defect in crossover interference. The predicted sequence of the MER3 protein contains the seven motifs characteristic of the DExH-box type of DNA/RNA helicases (23Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Consistent with the presence of the helicase motifs, an initial study has demonstrated that the purified MER3 protein can displace 50-nt DNA fragments annealed to single-stranded circular DNA. 2T. Nakagawa and R. D. Kolodner, submitted for publication. The MER3 protein binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA, with a slight preference for single-stranded DNA. The mer3G166D mutation, which causes an amino acid substitution changing an invariable glycine to an aspartic acid in a putative nucleotide-binding domain of MER3, decreases crossing over and impairs crossover interference. The spore viability of the mer3GD mutant is also decreased, which is likely to be due to a high incidence of non-disjunction of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. The mutant MER3GD protein is defective for DNA helicase activity but has DNA binding activity that is indistinguishable from that seen for wild-type MER3. These genetic and biochemical data suggest that the DNA helicase activity of MER3 is required for meiotic crossing over and, in turn, for faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes. To better understand the role of the MER3 protein in meiotic recombination, we have extensively characterized the ATPase and DNA helicase activity of MER3. The MER3 protein was found to have an ATPase activity that was stimulated by either poly(dA) or M13mp18 replicative form I (M13 RF) DNA. The MER3 protein could displace 50-, 100-, and 631-nt single strands from M13mp18 single-stranded DNA, although high concentrations of MER3 were required to displace the longer fragments. The displacement of 631-nt-long fragments was stimulated by either the single-stranded DNA-binding protein of S. cerevisiae, RPA (33Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), or that of E. coli, SSB (34McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These single-stranded DNA-binding proteins appear to stimulate the activity of MER3 by preventing the re-annealing of the DNA region once it is unwound by the MER3 helicase. The polarity of the MER3 helicase was determined to be 3′ to 5′ with regard to the single-stranded region present in the DNA substrates. Possible roles for a processive 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase like MER3 in crossover control are discussed. The MER3 and MER3G166D proteins tagged with a FLAG epitope at their C termini were over-expressed under the control of GAL10 promoter in yeast cells and were purified by binding to FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) followed by sequential chromatography on MonoQ HR5/5, HiTrap heparin, and MonoS HR5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns as previously described.2 The final protein preparations were more than 98% pure MER3. The yeastRPA1 gene (yRPA1) was amplified using primers 10786 (5′-CGACCGCTCGAGACACCATGAGCAGTGTTCAACTTTCG-3′), 10787 (5′-GCTCCCAAGCTTAAGAGATGCTGAACCGCCC-3′), and pRPA1 (35Heyer W.D. Rao M.R.

The resulting PCR product of 2.0 kb was used to replace theXhoI to HindIII region of pRDK249 (2 µ,GAL10, amp r , URA3) (36Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

A 2.0-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment from the pRDK249 derivative, which contained the GAL10 promoter andyRPA2, was introduced between the BamHI andHindIII sites of pRS425 (2 µ,amp r , LEU2) creating plasmid pRDK274.yRPA3 was amplified using primers 10788 (5′-CGACCGCTGCAGCTCGAGACACCATGGCCAGCGAAACACCAAG-3′), 10789 (5′-GGCCTTGGGCCCGCGGAAGGCGTTAAGGCAGC-3′), and a YEP213 yeast library-derived clone that contained the yRPA3 gene as template. The PCR product of 560 bp was cloned between thePstI and ApaI sites of pRS424 (2 µ,amp r , TRP1). A 750-bpBamHI-XhoI fragment from pRDK249, which contained the GAL10 promoter, was introduced upstream of theyRPA3 gene generating plasmid pRDK275. Correct clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The yRPA overexpressor strain (RDKY2275) was created by transforming plasmids pRDK273, pRDK274, and pRDK275 into yeast strain RDKY1293 (MATα, ura3–52, trp1, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prb1Δ1.6R, can1, GAL). The overproducer strain was grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking in 2 liters of Leu−Ura− Trp− minimal drop-out medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) raffinose. The expression fromGAL10 promoter was induced by the addition of a final concentration of 2% (w/v) galactose at anA 600 of 2.0 and incubation was continued until late log phase. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold water followed by two washes with buffer A [25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 2 µmleupeptin, 1 µm aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The wet cell pellet (22 g) was squirted into liquid nitrogen through a 60-ml syringe, and the frozen cell “noodles” were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen in a motorized mortar grinder (Retsch). Purification was carried out at 4 °C based on a previously described procedure (33Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The yeast powder was resuspended with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. The crude cell lysate was centrifuged in a Sorvall SA600 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 60 min, and the cleared lysate (100 ml, 660 mg) was adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and loaded onto an Affi-gel blue (Bio-Rad) column (1.8 cm2 × 7 cm). The column was washed with 120 ml of buffer A containing 0.8 m NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 120 ml of buffer A containing 2.5 mNaCl and 40% (w/v) ethylene glycol. Peak fractions were pooled (40 ml, 95.8 mg), diluted to a conductivity equal to buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl, and loaded onto a single-stranded DNA cellulose column (3.1 cm2 × 8 cm). The column was then washed with 125 ml of buffer A containing 0.75 m NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 125 ml of buffer A containing 1.5 m NaCl and 50% ethylene glycol. Peak fractions were pooled (8 ml, 1.8 mg), dialyzed against 2 changes of 500 ml of buffer A containing 0.1m NaCl, and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (0.8 cm2 × 1.5 cm), and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Peak fractions of RPA eluting at 200 mm NaCl were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Purity was similar to that observed previously (33Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The yield was 0.6 mg/liter of cell culture. M13mp18 single-stranded circular and M13mp18 RF I were from New England Biolabs and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. Poly(dA) and ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.[γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were from CyberSyn, Inc. (Aston, PA). E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) was from the United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). Reactions containing 20 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05 Ci/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 1.5 µg/ml DNA, and 1 mm ATP (unless otherwise indicated) were pre-incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 nm MER3 protein. For time course reactions, aliquots (5 µl) were withdrawn at the indicated time points and mixed with 2 µl of 0.2 m EDTA. 1 µl of each reaction was spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Sigma). The plates were developed in 1m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl and dried, and the amounts of 32Pi and [γ-32P]ATP in the reaction mixture were determined using a PhosphorImager (445 SI, Molecular Dynamics). DNA helicase substrates were prepared essentially as described before (37Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An 0.6-kbClaI-BamHI fragment from M13mp18 RF I was introduced between the ClaI and BamHI sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) to create pRDK4182. pRDK4182 was digested with ClaI, treated with calf alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs), purified using a PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and digested with BamHI, and then the resulting 0.6-kb ClaI-BamHI fragment was separated by electrophoresis through an 0.7% agarose gel and purified from the gel slice using a Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The 0.6-kb Cla-BamHI fragment and the M13–100 oligonucleotide (100-nt), which is complementary to nucleotide coordinates 6230–6329 of M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA, were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). In separate reactions, each labeled DNA was mixed with an equal molar amount of M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA in an annealing buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl), heated to 95 °C for 10 min, and then slowly cooled to 25 °C in a PCR machine at a rate of temperature decrease of −1 °C/2 min. Each annealed DNA product was purified by electrophoresis through an 0.7% agarose gel as described above and then by chromatography through an 0.12 cm2 × 25 cm Bio-Gel A 5-m (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated and run in annealing buffer containing 100 mmNaCl. The DNA substrate containing the M13–50 oligonucleotide (50-nt) annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA at nucleotides 6230–6279 were prepared as described previously.2 The concentration of the purified DNA was determined using a spectrophotometer (DU 640B, Beckman). To determine the polarity of translocation by the MER3 helicase, two kinds of DNA substrates were constructed using essentially the same methods as described above. To prepare the DNA substrate shown in Fig.6A, oligonucleotides T75 (5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACA-3′, 30-nt) and T82 (5′-CCCATAAACAAACTTCGTTAACTGAACTTGCCTGTACGATTCGTC-3′, 45-nt) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to T81 (5′-GACGAATCGTACAGGCAAGTTCAGTTAACGAAGTTTGTTTATGGGTACTCTCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTC, 100-nt). The annealed DNA was separated by 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (60:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in TBE (90 mm Tris·borate, 2 mm EDTA). The DNA was recovered by soaking the excised band in elution buffer (0.5m NaCl, 0.6 m sodium acetate, 1 mmEDTA) overnight at 4 °C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The recovered DNA pellet was dissolved in suspension buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl). The concentration of purified DNA was determined using a DNA DipStick™ (Invitrogen). To prepare the DNA substrate shown in Fig. 6 D, the M13–100 oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA in extension buffer (40 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The 3′-end of M13–100 was then labeled with [α-32P]dGTP using Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). After removal of unincorporated nucleotides and digestion with HincII, the DNA substrate was purified using Bio-Gel A 5-m (Bio-Rad) as described above. The indicated amount of protein and DNA substrate (indicated concentrations are in moles of nucleotides) were incubated in 20-µl volumes containing DNA helicase buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP) unless otherwise indicated. All reactions were pre-incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, started by the addition of MER3 protein, and then incubation was continued for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 µl of stop buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS) and 0.5 µl of 25 mg/ml proteinase K followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels run in TBE. The gels were dried, and the radiolabeled DNA was visualized using a PhosphorImager. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the MER3 protein has ATPase activity and displace oligonucleotide fragments annealed to M13 single-stranded circular DNA in an ATP-dependent manner.2 To better characterize the MER3 ATPase activity, MER3 protein was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and the formation of 32Pi was measured using thin layer chromatography. MER3 hydrolyzed ATP, and the addition of increasing concentrations of poly(dA) or M13 RF DNA increased the amount of ATP hydrolyzed by up to 5–6-fold (Fig.1, A and B), showing that the MER3 ATPase activity is stimulated by either single- or double-stranded DNA. Stimulation of the ATPase activity by the addition of M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA was also observed, indicating that single-stranded ends are not required to stimulate the MER3 ATPase activity (data not shown). In addition, M13 RF DNA linearized by digestion with HindIII stimulated the MER3 ATPase activity as well as undigested M13 RF DNA (at a DNA concentration of 1.5 µg/ml; data not shown), excluding the possibility that single-stranded regions that might appear in super-coiled DNA stimulate the ATPase activity. The ATPase activity reached maximal levels at poly(dA) and M13 RF DNA concentrations of 0.3 and 0.6 µg/ml, respectively, which is equivalent to 180 nt of poly(dA) or 180 bp of M13 RF DNA per MER3 molecule. To determine the turnover rate of the MER3 ATPase, the initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis was determined at different concentrations of ATP in the presence of an excess amount of DNA (10 µg/ml) (Fig. 1, Cand D). Shown in Table Iare the K m, V max, andk cat values obtained from analyses of the data presented in Fig. 1, C and D. The turnover rate,k cat was found to be about 500 ATP/min in the presence of either poly(dA) or M13 RF DNA, although theK m value was slightly lower in the presence of poly(dA) as compared with M13 RF DNA. The MER3 ATPase activity required a divalent cation. Maximal activity could be observed in the presence of either Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, whereas Zn2+ did not support the ATPase activity (Fig.2, A and B).Table IATPase activity of the MER3 proteinDNAK mV maxk catµmpmol · min−1min−1Poly(dA)470111550M13mp18 RF580106530 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Requirement of divalent cations for the MER3 ATPase activity.

To analyze the effect of this amino acid substitution on ATPase activity, the time course of ATP hydrolysis by MER3GD was determined (Fig.3). In the presence of either poly(dA) or M13 RF, the mer3G166D amino acid substitution significantly decreased the MER3 ATPase activity. Interestingly, the residual ATPase activity of MER3GD was different in the presence of different DNA cofactors. In the case of poly(dA), the rate of ATP hydrolysis carried out by MER3GD was about 17% of that of wild-type MER3 (Fig.3 A), whereas no detectable amounts of ATP were hydrolyzed by MER3GD in the presence of M13 RF DNA (Fig. 3 B). In summary, mutant MER3GD retains an ability to bind DNA but has defects in ATP hydrolysis and DNA helicase reaction. Thus, it is likely that the glycine in a putative nucleotide-binding domain is important for ATP hydrolysis, which is coupled to the DNA unwinding activity of MER3. In previous studies, it was observed that the MER3 helicase could displace a 50-nt oligonucleotide annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA.2 To determine whether MER3 can unwind longer DNA duplexes, similar DNA substrates were constructed containing 100- or 631-nt fragments annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA. DNA helicase assays were performed with each DNA substrate in the presence of increasing amounts of MER3 (Fig. 4, A andB). The MER3 helicase displaced both the 100- and 631-nt fragments, although higher amounts of MER3 were required to displace the 631-nt fragment compared with the 100-nt fragment. The activity of MER3 helicase as a function of protein concentration was quantified using substrates containing 50-, 100-, or 631-nt fragments annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA (Fig. 4 C). This analysis showed that the amount of MER3 required to displace each annealed fragment increased as a function of the size of the annealed fragment. For example, 0.5, 2.5, and 10 nm MER3 was required to displace ∼30% of the fragments from the 50-, 100-, and 631-nt substrates, respectively. These results show that high concentrations of MER3 are required to unwind long DNA duplexes. One possible reason for the fact that increasing amounts of MER3 are required to unwind DNA duplexes of increasing length is that binding of MER3 to the displaced single strands is required to prevent re-annealing. If this is the case, the activity of MER3 would be expected to be stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. To test this possibility, the activity of the MER3 helicase was measured in the presence of either S. cerevisiae RPA complex or E. coli SSB, the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins that function in DNA replication, recombination, and repair in each organism (Fig. 5). In reactions containing the annealed 50-nt fragment (Fig. 5 A), there was no detectable stimulation of strand displacement by the addition of RPA (Fig. 5 A, lane 6) or SSB (Fig. 5 A,lane 4). Also, no stimulation of MER3 by these SSBs was observed at different concentrations of MER3 (0.1, 0.4, and 0.8 nm; data not shown). However, displacement of the 631-nt fragment was stimulated by either RPA (Fig. 5 B, lane 6) or SSB (Fig. 5 B, lane 4) at the concentration of RPA or SSB that did not affect the activity of MER3 on the 50-nt substrate (Fig. 5 A). The helicase activity of MER3 on the substrate containing the 631-nt fragment was examined at different concentrations of RPA (Fig.5 C). The most efficient stimulation of strand displacement occurred at 20 nm RPA. At this concentration of RPA, the amount of 631-nt fragment displaced was increased 25-fold compared with that seen in the absence of RPA. The order of the addition of RPA and MER3 was found not to affect the strand displacement (Fig. 5 C, closed triangles and circles). Importantly, at the RPA concentrations examined, RPA alone did not displace any of the 631-nt fragment (Fig. 5 C, open circles). Given a binding site size of 90–100 nt for RPA (33Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), under these reaction conditions of 1 µm (in nucleotides) DNA and 20 nm RPA, there is sufficient RPA present to bind all of the DNA present if it is single-stranded. These results suggest that RPA stimulates MER3 by binding to the unwound regions produced by MER3 and inhibiting their re-annealing. It is also possible that RPA prevents nonspecific binding of MER3 to the single-stranded regions of the substrates, although the lack of an effect of the order of addition makes this latter possibility seem unl"

V2 receptors heterologously expressed in yeast were unable to productively interact with the endogenous yeast G protein α subunit, Gpa1p, or a mutant Gpa1p subunit containing the C-terminal Gαq sequence (Gq5). In contrast, the V2 receptor efficiently coupled to a Gpa1p/Gαs hybrid subunit containing the C-terminal Gαs sequence (Gs5), indicating that the V2 receptor retained proper G protein coupling selectivity in yeast. To gain insight into the molecular basis underlying the selectivity of V2 receptor/G protein interactions, we used receptor saturation random mutagenesis to generate a yeast library expressing mutant V2 receptors containing mutations within the second intracellular loop. A subsequent yeast genetic screen of about 30,000 mutant receptors yielded four mutant receptors that, in contrast to the wild-type receptor, showed substantial coupling to Gq5. Functional analysis of these mutant receptors, followed by more detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies, indicated that single amino acid substitutions at position Met145 in the central portion of the second intracellular loop of the V2 receptor had pronounced effects on receptor/G protein coupling selectivity. We also observed that deletion of single amino acids N-terminal of Met145 led to misfolded receptor proteins, whereas single amino acid deletions C-terminal of Met145 had no effect on V2 receptor function. These findings highlight the usefulness of combining receptor random mutagenesis and yeast expression technology to study mechanisms governing receptor/G protein coupling selectivity and receptor folding.

The spectrum of cellular responses triggered by activation of a specific GPCR is largely determined by the type of G proteins recognized by the activated receptor (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis governing the selectivity of receptor/G protein interactions is of fundamental importance for understanding cellular signal transduction. A large body of evidence indicates that multiple receptor regions are involved in G protein coupling and determining the selectivity of G protein recognition (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

Many studies have shown that the second intracellular loop (i2 loop), the membrane-proximal portions of the third intracellular loop (i3 loop), and the N-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic tail all contain amino acids predicted to play a role in regulating the selectivity of receptor/G protein interactions (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

These regions/amino acids are likely to define a domain on the intracellular surface of the receptor protein that, following activation of the receptor by an agonist ligand, can productively interact with distinct G protein heterotrimers (5Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Traditional mutagenesis approaches, including the use of hybrid receptors and alanine scanning mutagenesis techniques, have led to important insights into the structural basis underlying the selectivity of receptor/G protein interactions. However, a major limitation of such classical mutagenesis strategies is that the number of mutant proteins that can be investigated in one study is usually relatively small primarily because of technical reasons and the time and costs needed to generate and analyze large numbers of mutant receptors. Interestingly, yeast has recently emerged as a highly useful host for the in vivo reconstitution of mammalian GPCRs, G proteins, and potentially other related signal transduction proteins (6Pausch M.H.

Based on the powerful genetic selection procedures that are possible in yeast, this approach would offer the great advantage that thousands of mutant receptors can be analyzed with relative ease without having to rely on specific structural hypotheses or preconceived notions of GPCR function. For the present work, we used the V2 vasopressin receptor, a peptide receptor that belongs to the subfamily of rhodopsin-like (class I) GPCRs, as a model system. Whereas the structural elements determining the coupling selectivity of biogenic amine receptors have been studied in great detail, much less is known about the molecular basis of peptide receptor/G protein coupling selectivity. In mammalian systems, the V2 vasopressin receptor is selectively coupled to Gs triggering the activation of adenylyl cyclase (17Birnbaumer M. Seibold A. Gilbert S. Ishido M. Barberis C. Antaramian A.

On the other hand, the structurally closely related V1a and V1b vasopressin receptors and the oxytocin receptor are preferentially linked to G proteins of the Gq/11 family, thus stimulating the breakdown of phosphoinositide lipids (19Burbach J.P.H.

The vasopressin/oxytocin peptide receptor family therefore represents an attractive model system to study the molecular mechanisms regulating peptide receptor/G protein coupling selectivity. Functional analysis of hybrid V1a/V2 vasopressin receptors has previously shown that the ability of the wild-type (wt) V2 receptor to selectively activate Gs requires specific structural elements in the i3 loop and the membrane-proximal portion of the cytoplasmic tail (21Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Erlenbach I. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26549-26558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, selective coupling of the V1a receptor to G proteins of the Gq/11 family was found to be critically dependent on the structural integrity of the i2 loop (21Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To facilitate structure-function relationship studies of the V2 vasopressin receptor, we initially expressed the human V2 receptor in specifically engineered yeast strains that required ligand-dependent receptor/G protein coupling for cell growth (6Pausch M.H.

Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The individual yeast strains in which the V2 receptor was expressed were genetically identical except for the nature of the expressed G protein α subunit (6Pausch M.H. Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M.

Yeast growth assays showed that the wt V2 receptor was able to interact efficiently only with a hybrid yeast Gpa1p/mammalian αs subunit containing the C-terminal αs sequence, indicating that the wt V2 receptor retained proper G protein coupling selectivity in yeast. To take advantage of the powerful genetic selection procedures that are possible in yeast, we used receptor random mutagenesis in an attempt to isolate mutant V2 receptors with novel G protein coupling properties. We anticipated that sequence analysis of such mutant receptors would be useful for better defining the molecular determinants dictating receptor/G protein coupling selectivity. In this initial study, we screened for mutant V2 receptors that would gain the ability to couple to a hybrid yeast Gpa1p/mammalian αq subunit containing the C-terminal αq sequence (Gq5), which is not recognized by the wt V2 receptor. Specifically, we subjected the i2 loop of the V2 vasopressin receptor to saturation random mutagenesis and generated a yeast library coexpressing individual mutant receptors and the Gq5 G protein. The i2 loop was chosen as the primary target because of our previous observation that this domain largely determines the ability of the V1a vasopressin receptor to selectively interact with Gq-type G proteins (21Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Screening of the mutant receptor library in colony growth assays yielded four mutant receptors that gained robust coupling to Gq5. Interestingly, all four mutant receptors contained modifications at position Met145 in the central portion of the i2 loop. More detailed functional studies, complemented by site-directed mutagenesis studies, indicated that the chemical character of the amino acid present at position 145 in the V2 receptor is a critical determinant of receptor/G protein coupling selectivity. We also noted that the amino acids present at the beginning of the i2 loop immediately adjacent to the third transmembrane helix are essential for proper folding of the V2 receptor. These results underscore the usefulness of yeast expression technology to study molecular aspects regulating mammalian GPCR function. This is the first study using receptor random mutagenesis, combined with a yeast genetic screen, to study the molecular basis of receptor/G protein coupling selectivity.

The p416GPD yeast expression vector was obtained through ATCC. A yeast expression plasmid coding for the human V2 vasopressin receptor was constructed using standard molecular biological techniques.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and cloned into the corresponding sites in the polylinker of the yeast expression plasmid p416GPD (26Mumberg D. Müller R.

Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The p416GPD vector contains the yeast GAPDH(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) promoter and theCYC1 terminator flanking the multiple cloning site (26Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). It is a single copy plasmid containing the CEN/ARSelement, the URA3 gene as selectable marker for maintenance in yeast, and the Amp gene for propagation inEscherichia coli (26Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). The final V2 receptor expression construct hV2-p416GPD contained 6 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence (CCCACC) following the EcoRI cloning site. The translation start codon was followed by a 27-bp sequence coding for the HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) (25Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the presence of the HA tag did not affect the ligand binding and G protein coupling properties of the V2 vasopressin receptor (21Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The hV2-p416GPD construct also contained 125 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence followed by the XhoI cloning site. Point mutations or deletions were introduced into the hV2-p416GPD construct by standard PCR mutagenesis techniques. The identity of all mutant constructs and the correctness of all PCR-derived coding sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant plasmids. Three different yeast strains, MPY578fc, MPY578q5, and MPY578s5, were used as hosts for the expression of wt and mutant V2 vasopressin receptors (see Fig. 1). All three strains were isogenic except for the GPA1gene coding for the yeast G protein α subunit Gpa1p. The MPY578fc strain, which contains the wt GPA1 gene (6Pausch M.H. Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Strnad J. dela Cruz F. Heinrich J. Ozenberger B.A. Hadcock J.R. Lynch K.R. Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 196-212Google Scholar), has the following genotype: MATaGPA1 far1::LYS2 fus1::FUS1-HIS3 sst2::SST2-G418r ste2::LEU2 fus2::FUS2-CAN1 ura3 lys2 ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 can1. MPY578q5 and MPY578s5 harbor genomically integrated mutant versions ofGPA1 coding for mutant Gpa1 proteins in which the last five amino acids of Gpa1p were replaced with the homologous mammalian Gαq and Gαs sequences, respectively (see Fig. 1). The construction of the MPY578q5 and MPY578s5 strains has been described previously (16Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these strains, deletion of the FAR1 gene allows yeast to grow despite G protein-mediated activation of the pheromone pathway that normally leads to cell cycle arrest (6Pausch M.H. Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Strnad J. dela Cruz F. Heinrich J. Ozenberger B.A. Hadcock J.R. Lynch K.R. Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 196-212Google Scholar). The presence of theFUS1-HIS3 reporter construct makes the production of His3 protein dependent on receptor-mediated activation of the yeast pheromone pathway. As a result, only receptors able to activate coexpressed G proteins will allow growth of auxotrophic (his3) yeast strains in medium lacking histidine. TheSST2 gene was disrupted to prevent attenuation of G protein signaling mediated by the GTPase-activating protein activity of Sst2p. The STE2 gene coding for the yeast α-factor (pheromone) receptor was deleted to prevent competition with heterologously expressed GPCRs for coexpressed G proteins. DNA-mediated yeast transformation was carried out by using a lithium acetate method (28Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: Practical Approaches. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 124-134Google Scholar). Receptor-expressing yeast strains were generated by transforming MPY578fc, MPY578q5, and MPY578s5 with p416GPD-based receptor expression constructs (see previous section). Transformants were selected on synthetic complete (SC) medium plates lacking uracil. Three individual transformants were chosen from each strain for further analysis. To construct mutagenized V2 receptors, we used an oligonucleotide-directed random mutagenesis approach. To introduce mutations into the V2 receptor region coding for the i2 loop (see Fig. 2), the following oligonucleotide coding for V2 receptor residues 134–164 was used (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., San Francisco, CA; underlines denote bases doped with 10% non-wild-type nucleotides): 5′-ACG CTG GAC CGC CAC CGT GCC ATC TGC CGT CCC ATG CTG GCG TAC CGC CAT GGA AGT GGG GCT CAC TGG AAC CGG CCG GTA CTA GTG GCT TGG-3′. The underlined mutagenized sequence codes for amino acids His138 to Val160 (see Fig. 2). This oligonucleotide was used as a primer for PCR amplification together with oligonucleotide ON2 (5′-GGC CCA GCA GTC AGT GAC CCC GCT GCC ACC TTC CAC GTT GCG CTG-3′, corresponding in sequence to amino acid codons 180–194) as antisense primer and hV2-p416GPD as a template. The resulting 183-bp PCR fragment was then used as a template for a second round of PCR using a sense primer that overlapped with the first 12 nucleotides of the mutagenic oligonucleotide (ON30: 5′-CAG ATG GTG GGC ATG TAT GCC TCC TCC TAC ATG ATC CTG GCC ATG ACG CTG GAC CGC-3′, corresponding in sequence to amino acid codons 119–137) and ON2 as the antisense primer. The resulting 228-bp PCR fragment contained 57 bp of wt sequence 5′ and 102 bp of wt sequence 3′ of the mutagenized sequence, respectively. A library of yeast clones expressing randomly mutagenized mutant V2 vasopressin receptors was created using a gap-repair protocol (29Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 30Staples R.R. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1993; 135: 981-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. J. Mol.

Wiley-Liss, New York1999: 141-166Google Scholar). Specifically, strain MPY578q5 was cotransformed with the 228-bp mutagenized PCR fragment and a “gapped” version of hV2-p416GPD (0.2 µg of purified DNA each). The hV2-p416GPD plasmid was gapped (linearized) by digestion with BstXI, which removed a 52-bp fragment corresponding in sequence to most of the i2 loop from the hV2-p416GPD construct. Following transformation into yeast, the ends of the mutagenized PCR fragment recombined with the homologous ends of the gapped receptor plasmid to regenerate circular receptor expression plasmids. Initially, the MPY578q5-based yeast expression library coding for mutant V2 vasopressin receptors was plated onto uracil-deficient SC medium to select for Ura+ (plasmid-containing) transformants (plating density, 200–300 clones/100-mm plate). After incubation of plates for 3 days at 30 °C, Ura+ colonies were transferred via replica plating onto plates containing SC medium lacking both uracil and histidine but containing 0.4 µm of the agonist AVP (an AVP stock solution was spread over the plates after the agar had cooled and hardened) and 10 mm AT, a competitive inhibitor of theHIS3 gene product that was added to prevent background growth due to low basal activity of the FUS1 promoter. For control purposes, the primary Ura+ transformants were also replica plated onto plates containing the identical selection medium but lacking AVP. Under these conditions, an MPY578q5-based yeast strain expressing the wt V2 vasopressin receptor was unable to grow either in the absence or presence of AVP (see Fig. 3). However, under the same conditions, an MPY578s5-based yeast strain expressing the wt V2 vasopressin receptor showed robust, agonist-dependent growth (see Fig. 3). A total of ∼30,000 yeast clones expressing mutant V2 receptors was screened. Plasmids were isolated from colonies that were able to grow in an AVP-dependent fashion on histidine-deficient medium, amplified in E. coli, and retransformed into MPY578q5 to confirm that the observed growth phenotype was indeed due to a plasmid-borne V2 receptor mutation. Receptor plasmids were then sequenced and, at least in some cases, recreated by PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. Yeast strains were cultured overnight in SC medium lacking uracil. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and diluted to a concentration of 105 cells/ml in 4 ml of SC medium (pH 6.9) lacking uracil and histidine. To reduce background growth, 10 mm AT was added to the media. Aliquots of yeast cell suspensions (180 µl) were dispensed into wells of sterile 96-well microtiter dishes containing 20 µl of serially diluted samples of AVP (final concentration, 10−13–10−4m). The plates were then incubated at 25 °C for 3 days under gentle agitation. Yeast growth was monitored during the logarithmic phase of cell growth by recording increases in absorbance at 630 nm using a microplate reader. Assays were conducted in triplicate using three independent transformants. AVP concentration-response curves were analyzed using the computer program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Yeast cells from a 1-liter overnight culture (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) were collected by centrifugation, and membrane homogenates were prepared by using a glass bead method essentially as described previously (16Erlenbach I.

Here we show that a significant fraction of human CD2 molecules is inducibly recruited into lipid rafts upon CD2 cross-linking by a specific pair of mitogenic anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (anti-T112 + anti-T113) or during cellular conjugate formation by CD58, the physiologic ligand expressed on antigen-presenting cells. Translocation to lipid microdomains is independent of the T cell receptor (TCR) and, unlike inducible TCR-raft association, requires no tyrosine phosphorylation. Structural integrity of rafts is necessary for CD2-stimulated elevation of intracellular free calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates. Whereas murine CD2 contains two membrane-proximal intracellular cysteines, partitioning CD2 into cholesterol-rich lipid rafts constitutively, human CD2 has no cytoplasmic cysteines. Mapping studies using CD2 point mutation, deletion, and chimeric molecules suggest that conformational change in the CD2 ectodomain participates in inducible raft association and excludes the membrane-proximal N-linked glycans, the transmembrane segment, and the CD2 cytoplasmic region (residues 8–117) as necessary for translocation. Translocation of CD2 into lipid rafts may reorganize the membrane into an activation-ready state prior to TCR engagement by a peptide associated with a major histocompatibility complex molecule, accounting for synergistic T cell stimulation by CD2 and the TCR.

To maintain such a high degree of sensitivity and fidelity of T cell recognition, a number of co-stimulatory and accessory T cell surface molecules are coordinately engaged in the immune recognition process. These include CD2, CD4, CD8, CD28, and LFA-1 (3Bierer B.E. Sleckman B.P. Ratnofsky S.E. Burakoff S.J. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, activation signals are induced, whereas signals inhibiting cell growth and effector function are suppressed.

The co-localization of these signaling molecules with lipid rafts is largely due to post-translational acylation modification of proteins (7Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), the most important being membrane-proximal cysteine residue palmitoylation (reviewed in Ref.20Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Another post-translational modification that can bring cell surface proteins to the lipid rafts is glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification (21Horejsi V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T.

Representatives of this class of cell surface molecule include Thy-1, CD48, CD58, Ly-6,and CD24. Although these structures lack both cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, their cross-linking by suitable ectodomain-specific antibodies results in signal transduction and cellular responses. The idea that lipid rafts can serve as a platform for lymphocyte signaling is supported by several recent reports demonstrating that multiple-chain immunoreceptors such as TCRs (17Xavier R.

A number of co-stimulatory molecules on the T cell surface can apparently up-regulate TCR signals by enhancing association of the TCR and lipid rafts. Representative molecules of the latter type include CD5 and CD9 (28Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Zhou X.Y. Toyo-Oka K. Tai X.G. Park C.S. Hamaoka T. Abe R. Miyake K. Fujiwara H. J.

Nature. 1989; 339: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The ligation of CD2 by CD58 not only promotes the adhesion of T cells to APCs, but provides a suitable intercellular membrane spacing (∼140 Å) for TCR-pMHC recognition (34Wang J.H. Smolyar A. Tan K.

Furthermore, the extremely fast on- and off-rates of the CD2-CD58 interaction (35Davis S.J. Ikemizu S. Wild M.K. van der Merwe P.A. Immunol.

Although the monomeric CD2-CD58 K d is weak (see references in Ref.34Wang J.H. Smolyar A. Tan K. Liu J.H. Kim M. Sun Z.Y. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L.

First, binding of CD2 and CD58 augments the interleukin-12 (IL-12) responsiveness of activated T cells (39Gollob J.A. Li J. Kawasaki H. Daley J.F. Groves C. Reinherz E.L. Ritz J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1886-1893PubMed Google Scholar). Second, CD2-CD58 interaction plays a role in the reversal of T cell anergy (40Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Griffin J.D. Gray G.S. Gribben J.G.

In this regard, CD2 has a 117-amino acid cytoplasmic tail that is relatively conserved among different species (47Clayton L.K. Sayre P.H. Novotny J. Reinherz E.L. Eur. J.

Unique pairs of CD2-specific monoclonal antibodies can transduce mitogenic signals to T cells and induce T cell proliferation and IL-2 production even in the absence of engagement of the TCR (33Moingeon P.

Here we present data showing that CD2 can inducibly associate with lipid rafts and that raft integrity is important for CD2 signaling function. We also demonstrate that CD2-raft association is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation events as well as the CD2 cytoplasmic tail and TCR linkage to lipid rafts. Such inducible raft association accounts for many aspects of CD2-based signal transduction and explains the synergistic activation of T cells by CD2 and TCR molecules. Anti-human CD2 mAbs anti-T111(3T4-8B5) and anti-T112 (1OLD24C1), anti-CD2R mAb anti-T113 (1mono2A6), and M32B heteroantisera were prepared and purified as described (41Li J. Smolyar A.

Anti-T112Fab fragments were prepared and purified from anti-T112 mAb using an ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ascites containing anti-human CD3ε mAb 2Ad2 (IgM) were produced in our laboratory. mAb 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine) was kindly provided by Dr. Tom Roberts (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Antisera against p59fyn were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospholipase Cγ1 mAb and antisera against LAT and Vav were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Cytochalasin D, colchicine, paclitaxel, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4d]pyrimidine) was from Calbiochem, and Nonidet P-40 was the product of U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). All other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from leukopaks of healthy blood donors by Ficoll gradient centrifugation using a nylon wool column. The purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human AB serum (Nabi, Boca Raton, FL), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 mmglutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) (complete medium) and used within 0–2 days as resting human T cells. Activated T cells were obtained by culturing the peripheral blood mononuclear cells as described above plus a 1:200 dilution of 2Ad2 ascites and 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. After 48 h of activation, 94% of the cells were anti-CD2 mAb-reactive as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (42Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were then diluted 1:5, maintained in culture, and used within 1–3 days. For Ca2+ flux, human T cells were activated for 48 h, washed once with complete medium, and cultured in the same medium supplemented with 100 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), and the cells were used within 3–6 days. The human Jurkat cell line J77 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mm glutamine in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOP) without or with CD58 (CHO58) or a K87A variant (CHO58K87A) were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine and additionally supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 155.16 mouse T cell hybridoma cells and human CD2-transfected derivatives were cultured in the same medium as the J77 cells, but additionally supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418. CD2 cross-linking was achieved by adding either a combination of purified anti-T112 and anti-T113 mAbs (10 μg/ml) or a 1:100 dilution of ascites. CD3 cross-linking was accomplished by addition of a 1:200 dilution of 2Ad2 ascites. Cell activation was performed at 37 °C for 10–15 min in the relevant complete medium. For pretreatment with various inhibitors, 1 × 107 J77 cells were incubated with 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO for 2 h, 5 μg/ml cytochalasin D for 2 h, 0.5 μm colchicine for 17 h, 0.5 μm paclitaxel for 17 h, or 20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (β-MCD) for 30 min at 37 °C in complete J77 medium. Cells were spun down at 1000 ×g and resuspended in medium with or without antibody stimulation. After 15 min at 37 °C, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysate buffer containing 1× TBS and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.35 trypsin inhibitor units/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following incubation on ice for 30 min, samples were spun down at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysate buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate, followed by brief sonication. Supernatants were recovered as the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate and quantified with a Micro BCA kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were loaded per lane for Western blot detection of CD2. Sucrose gradient centrifugation was used to fractionate membrane fractions according to the protocol of Zhang et al. (53Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, 1 × 108 J77 or activated human T cells or 2.5 × 108 resting human T cells were individually harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium, and stimulated by cross-linking as described above. Non-cross-linked samples were treated identically, but without addition of mAbs. After cross-linking, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 1× MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES and 150 mm NaCl (pH 6.5)) and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.35 trypsin inhibitor units/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysates were homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, Millville, NJ), gently mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold 80% (w/v) sucrose (Fisher) in 1× MES-buffered saline, and loaded in the bottom of a centrifuge tube (Beckman Instruments). The sample was then overlaid with 2 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose and 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose, both prepared in 1× MES-buffered saline. The sucrose gradient samples were spun at 39,000 rpm in a DuPont AH650 rotor at 4 °C for 20–21 h. DIGs were harvested by collecting 0.4-ml fractions, beginning at the top of the gradient. All cell lysates and gradient fractions were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) to deglycosylate human CD2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Final samples were mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in TBS/Tween (25 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) at 37 °C for 30 min. M32B anti-CD2 polyclonal antiserum was diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin and TBS/Tween and incubated with membranes at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently developed using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). ECL-developed blots were scanned with a Microtek ScanMaker 5 and processed with Photoshop software. The intensity of anti-T112 and anti-T113 mAb cross-linking in the presence of the control (Me2SO or no other addition) was arbitrarily set to 100% using ImageQuant Version 1.1 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For phosphotyrosine blotting, activated human T cells were left untreated or were pretreated with β-MCD or PP2, followed by cross-linking of CD2 or CD3. Whole cell lysates were generated in lysis buffer containing 1× TBS and 60 mm n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside supplemented with protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of lysate proteins were loaded on 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. The membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and TBS/Tween at 37 °C for 30 min and subsequently incubated with antibody 4G10 at 4 °C overnight. 4G10 signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b, followed by ECL. The membrane was then stripped with 1× stripping buffer (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and reblotted with antibodies against Fyn, LAT, Vav, and phospholipase Cγ1. Wild-type CD2 transfectants as well as mutant CD2 molecules (including the cytoplasmic deletion CD2Δ25; the single mutation variants K167W, K167A, K170A, W10F, E131A, E8A, N117Q, N126Q, and H140A; the double mutant N117Q/N126Q; and the triple mutant K61E/F63L/T67D) were generated as described (41Li J. Smolyar A. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TfR25 and TfRTM are two variants in which the CD2 transmembrane domain was swapped with that of the transferrin receptor (TfR). These mutants were produced using a one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Life Technologies, Inc.) to clone the cDNA encoding the transmembrane domain of the TfR, which was subsequently fused by additional polymerase chain reaction cloning with the extracellular domain of CD2 with (TfR25) or without (TfRTM) a cDNA sequence encoding 25 amino acids of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail. 2Polymerase chain reaction primer sequences are available upon request. Subsequently, the desired DNA sequence was verified, and the product was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The final expression vectors were linearized by SalI digestion and transfected into the 155.16 mouse T cell hybridoma cells by electroporation at 200 V and 1180 microfarads (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following neomycin selection (1.5 mg/ml), stable transfectant cell lines expressing CD2 mutants at levels comparable to wild-type CD2 were established by sorting four to five times on a MoFlo (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). 1 × 106 activated human T cells (see above) were loaded with 2 μg/ml (∼2 nm) Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in 1 ml of complete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Following three washes with RPMI 1640 medium, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and prewarmed for 5–10 min at 37 °C before analysis. Ca2+ flux was measured on a FACS Vantage (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Samples were run for 30 s to obtain a base line, and then a combination of anti-T112 and anti-T113 ascites (1:100 dilution of each) was added. The ratio 405/525 nm was recorded for 8 min. 2 μg of 4-bromoA23187 (calcium ionophore) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added subsequently to ensure the successful loading of Indo-1. For β-MCD treatment, different concentrations of β-MCD were added to the loading buffer concurrently with Indo-1. Previous studies from our laboratory have indicated that CD2 cross-linking by mitogenic pairs of mAbs (anti-T112 and anti-T113) results in loss of a fraction of CD2 molecules from the 1% Triton X-100 detergent-soluble component of T"
https://openalex.org/W1972598425,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that is recruited to activated growth factor receptors and has been shown to be involved in regulation of stimulated exocytosis and endocytosis. One of the downstream signaling molecules activated by PI 3-kinase is the protein kinase Akt. Previous studies have indicated that PI 3-kinase is necessary for basal Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) transport and for fibroblast growth factor-stimulated NHE3 activity in PS120 fibroblasts. However, it is not known whether activation of PI 3-kinase is sufficient to stimulate NHE3 activity or whether Akt is involved in this PI 3-kinase effect. We used an adenoviral infection system to test the possibility that activation of PI 3-kinase or Akt alone is sufficient to stimulate NHE3 activity. This hypothesis was investigated in PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing NHE3 after somatic gene transfer using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus containing constitutively active catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase or constitutively active Akt. The adenovirus construct used was engineered with an upstream ecdysone promoter to allow time-regulated expression. Adenoviral infection was nearly 100% at 48 h after infection. Forty-eight hours after infection (24 h after activation of the ecdysone promoter), PI 3-kinase and Akt amount and activity were increased. Increases in both PI 3-kinase activity and Akt activity stimulated NHE3 transport. In addition, a membrane-permeant synthetic 10-mer peptide that binds polyphosphoinositides and increases PI 3-kinase activity similarly enhanced NHE3 transport activity and also increased the percentage of NHE3 on the plasma membrane. The magnitudes of stimulation of NHE3 by constitutively active PI 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase peptide, and constitutively active Akt were similar to each other. These results demonstrate that activation of PI 3-kinase or Akt is sufficient to stimulate NHE3 transport activity in PS120/NHE3 cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that is recruited to activated growth factor receptors and has been shown to be involved in regulation of stimulated exocytosis and endocytosis. One of the downstream signaling molecules activated by PI 3-kinase is the protein kinase Akt. Previous studies have indicated that PI 3-kinase is necessary for basal Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) transport and for fibroblast growth factor-stimulated NHE3 activity in PS120 fibroblasts. However, it is not known whether activation of PI 3-kinase is sufficient to stimulate NHE3 activity or whether Akt is involved in this PI 3-kinase effect. We used an adenoviral infection system to test the possibility that activation of PI 3-kinase or Akt alone is sufficient to stimulate NHE3 activity. This hypothesis was investigated in PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing NHE3 after somatic gene transfer using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus containing constitutively active catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase or constitutively active Akt. The adenovirus construct used was engineered with an upstream ecdysone promoter to allow time-regulated expression. Adenoviral infection was nearly 100% at 48 h after infection. Forty-eight hours after infection (24 h after activation of the ecdysone promoter), PI 3-kinase and Akt amount and activity were increased. Increases in both PI 3-kinase activity and Akt activity stimulated NHE3 transport. In addition, a membrane-permeant synthetic 10-mer peptide that binds polyphosphoinositides and increases PI 3-kinase activity similarly enhanced NHE3 transport activity and also increased the percentage of NHE3 on the plasma membrane. The magnitudes of stimulation of NHE3 by constitutively active PI 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase peptide, and constitutively active Akt were similar to each other. These results demonstrate that activation of PI 3-kinase or Akt is sufficient to stimulate NHE3 transport activity in PS120/NHE3 cells.

This process explains basal ileal NaCl absorption and the increase in ileal sodium absorption that occurs after meals, and it is also the sodium absorptive process in ileal sodium absorbing cells that is inhibited in most diarrheal diseases. NHE3 is the component of neutral NaCl absorption that has been shown to be acutely stimulated and inhibited under these conditions. NHE3 activity is regulated by multiple growth factors and protein kinases, which mimic the changes associated with the digestive process (1Donowitz M. Tse M. Barrett K.E. Donowitz M. Gastrointestinal Transport Molecular Physiology: Current Topics in Membranes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 437-498Google Scholar). The mechanisms of inhibition and stimulation are only partially defined. For instance, EGF and clonidine stimulate ileal sodium absorbing cells by increasing the percentage of total NHE3 in the brush border (2Donowitz M. Montgomery J.L. Walker M.S. Cohen M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G647-G656PubMed Google Scholar). In PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing NHE3, FGF exposure increases NHE3 transport activity and the percentage of total NHE3 in the plasma membrane (3Janecki A.J. Janecki M. Akhter S. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8133-8142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Janecki A.J. Janecki M. Akhter S. Donowitz M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The percent increase in Na+/H+ exchange is quantitatively similar to the increase in percentage of NHE3 on the plasma membrane. In contrast, protein kinase C inhibition of NHE3 in Caco-2 cells is associated with a decrease in percentage of NHE3 on the plasma membrane, but in this case, the change in transport exceeds the change in percentage of surface NHE3, indicating change in turnover number in addition to change in NHE3 trafficking (5Janecki A.J.

Insights are just beginning to be achieved in identifying the signal transduction processes involved in short-term regulation of NHE3. For instance, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been shown to be necessary for 1) the basal level of plasma membrane NHE3 amount and NHE3 transport activity (3Janecki A.J. Janecki M.

Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8133-8142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase is a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that is recruited to activated growth factor receptors (8Krasilnikov M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 65: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar, 9Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Activation of PI 3-kinase results in increased intracellular levels of 3′-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids and induction of signaling responses, including the activation of the protein kinase Akt, which is also known as protein kinase B (11Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 12Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase plays a role in growth factor signaling cascades, leading to metabolic and mitogenic cellular responses. In addition, PI 3-kinase activity has been implicated in regulated exocytosis and endocytosis. For instance, its activation is sufficient to stimulate glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the absence of insulin (13Frevert E.U. Bjorbaek C. Venable C.L. Keller S.R. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25480-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The conclusions of the above previous studies of PI 3-kinase and NHE3 were largely based on pharmacological approaches; inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin and LY294002 were utilized, although they were supported by biochemical evidence of activation of PI 3-kinase by growth factors. No previous studies have attempted to determine whether Akt has any role in regulation of NHE3. This is largely due to lack of Akt inhibitors. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of PI 3-kinase or Akt alone is sufficient for the stimulation of NHE3 activity. This hypothesis was tested in PS120/NHE3 cells after somatic gene transfer using recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus containing constitutively active PI 3-kinase or Akt. These studies demonstrate that an inducible adenoviral expression system can induce significant increases in PI 3-kinase and Akt activity and amount in PS120 cells, and activated PI 3-kinase and Akt were sufficient to stimulate NHE3. In addition, activating PI 3-kinase with a peptide that stimulates PI 3-kinase activity similarly stimulated NHE3 (14Hubner S. Couvillon A.D. Kas J.A. Bankaitis V.A. Vegners R. Carpenter C.L.

For all experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips and studied after being serum-starved for 3 days after reaching confluence. Both the OK/E3V and PS120/E3V cell lines were selected for Na+/H+exchange activity (every other passage) by exposing cells to an acid load consisting of 50 mm NH4Cl/94 mm NaCl solution for 1 h, followed by an isotonic 2 mm Na+ solution as described (20Levine S.A.

The adenovirus shuttle vector used which contains an ecdysone-inducible promoter (pAdEcd), and pAdVgRXR encoding the ecdysone and RXR receptors were as described (Fig.1) (25Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p110* encodes for a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase in which the inter-SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit was ligated to the NH2terminus of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. The p110* protein was tagged at the COOH terminus with the Myc epitope (22Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In order to subclone the epitope-tagged p110*-Myc from a mammalian expression vector to pAdEcd, BamHI-digested p110*-Myc DNA was ligated into the multiple cloning site of pAdEcd. The plasmid containing the BamHI fragment in pAdEcd, the pAdEcd-BamHI plasmid, was digested with XbaI andNheI, and then the XbaI fragment from the p110*-Myc construct was subcloned into pAdEcd-BamHI. The Akt construct contains the HA epitope-tagged to its C terminus and is catalytically active due to its myristylation-related membrane location. The myr-Akt-HA plasmid was digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and the DNA fragment was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pAdEcd for construction of pAdEmyr-Akt-HA (Fig. 1). The expression cassette of eGFP from pEGFP was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pAdEcd, making vector pAdEGI (Fig. 1), which expressed enhanced green fluorescence protein and was used to assess adenovirus infection efficiency. The recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNA encoding either the C-terminal Myc epitope-tagged constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase (AdEp110*-Myc) or myristoylated Akt-HA (AdEmyr-Akt-HA) were generated by Cre lox recombination (25Johns D.C.

Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using CRE8 cells that stably express Cre recombinase. Construction of recombinant adenovirus AdEp110*-Myc and AdEmyr-Akt-HA was as described (25Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PS120/E3V cells were co-infected with AdVgRXR plus (i) AdEp110*-Myc, (ii) AdEmyr-Akt-HA, (iii) AdEGI, or (iv) empty virus (Ψ5) (Fig. 1) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and the appropriate amount of virus for 24 h. Then, expression was induced by addition of the ecdysone promoter ligand ponasterone A (3 µm) for 24 h before further assays were performed. The dose of ponasterone A was selected to activate the ecdysone receptor maximally on the basis of previously reported dose-response curves (28No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Images were taken after cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and examined using a confocal fluorescent microscope (Zeiss LSC410). The excitation/emission wavelengths were set at 488/510 nm and 351/364 nm for eGFP and Hoechst 33342, respectively. PS120/E3V cells were co-infected with AdEp110*-Myc or AdEmyr-Akt-HA plus AdVgRXR. Expression of AdEp110*-Myc and AdEmyr-Akt-HA was induced by the addition of ponasterone A (3 µm). Uninfected or infected cells were lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPPi, 10 mm 2-β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors (1:1000 dilution of Sigma mixture p8340). The cell lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min) to remove insoluble materials. For the Western blot analyses, whole cell lysates (30–40 µg of protein/lane) were denatured by boiling with Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 20% MeOH, and 0.05% SDS and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. AdEp110*-Myc was detected with murine Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and AdEmyr-Akt-HA was detected with murine HA-monoclonal antibody HA1. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection. PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described previously using TLC with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, which co-migrates with PI-3P (Sigma mixture p9638), as a standard (29Lee-Kwon W. Park D. Bernier M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Uninfected cells or adenovirus-infected PS120/NHE3V cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-p110 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Immune complexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein A-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and washed as described (29Lee-Kwon W. Park D. Bernier M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 30Lee-Kwon W. Park D. Baskar P.V. Kole S. Bernier M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15747-15757Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The washed immune complexes were incubated with l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) as substrate and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at room temperature. Reaction was stopped with 20 µl of 6 n HCl (final volume, 90 µl), extracted with 160 µl of chloroform:methanol (1:1), and centrifuged. The lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate (Merck) coated with 1% potassium oxalate. The TLC plates were developed in methanol:chloroform:water:ammonium hydroxide (60:47:11.3:2), dried, visualized by autoradiography with products identified as co-migrating with standard, and quantitated by scanning densitometry/Imagequant software. Cellular Na+/H+ exchange activity in PS120/E3V cells was determined fluorometrically using the intracellular pH-sensitive dye BCECF with cells grown to 60–70% confluency on glass coverslips, as described previously (19Levine S.A.

The effects of expressing p110* and Akt-myr in the absence or presence of ponasterone A on NHE3 were studied. The cells were loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl) 5–6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM), 5 µm) in Na+ medium (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 20 min at 22 °C and then washed with TMA+ medium (130 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to remove the extracellular dye; the coverslip was then mounted at an angle of 60o in a 100-µl fluorometer cuvette designed for perfusion and thermostated at 37 °C. The cells were pulsed with 40 mmNH4Cl in TMA+ medium for 3 min, followed by TMA+ medium, which resulted in the acidification of the cells. Na+ medium was then added, which induced alkalinization of cells. Na+/H+ exchange (H+ efflux) was calculated as described previously (19Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

Plasma membrane NHE3 was measured by surface biotinylation, as described (7Akhter S. Cavet M.E. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Confluent PS120/E3V cells were serum-starved for 5 h, and then 10 µm PI 3-kinase peptide was incubated for 15 min. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and once in borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm boric acid, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9.0). Plasma membrane surface was then exposed to 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in borate buffer for 40 min with horizontal shaking. After labeling, cells were washed with the quenching buffer (20 mm Tris and 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to scavenge the unreacted biotin. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of N+buffer (60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm Na3EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Cells were sonicated for 20 s and agitated on a rotating rocker for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatant representing the total fraction was incubated with avidin-agarose for 2 h. After avidin precipitation, the supernatant was retained as the intracellular fraction. The avidin-agarose beads were washed five times in N+ buffer to remove the all of the nonspecifically bound proteins. The avidin-agarose bead bound proteins, representing plasma membrane NHE3, were solubilized in equivalent volumes of loading buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 9% gels, and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody (P5D4 hybridoma supernatant) as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse as the secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The adenoviral infection efficiency in PS120/E3V cells was initially standardized to achieve nearly 100% infection 48 h after viral exposure and after activation of the ecdysone promoter with ponasterone A. The percentage of infection was evaluated with different mois of adenovirus expressing eGFP as a reporter protein. To estimate the percentage of infected cells, PS120/E3V cells were co-infected with various mois of ecdysone-driven receptors encoding eGFP (AdEGI) plus fixed ecdysone/retinoid X receptor virus (AdVgRXR). After 24 h, ponasterone A (3 µm) was added to the media; 24 h later (48 h after infection), cells were fixed, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. As shown in Fig.2, nuclear staining and cytosolic eGFP fluorescence were visible in PS120/E3V cells. Comparison was made between the number of cells with cytosolic eGFP fluorescence and the total number of PS120/E3V cells stained with Hoechst 33342 in the same field. Low basal levels of expression of eGFP occurred in the absence of ponasterone A at the different adenovirus mois indicating low level of “leakiness.” eGFP expression increased in a moi-dependent manner after addition of ponasterone A (3 µm) (Fig. 2), indicating that the infection percentages increased in a viral dose-dependent manner in the presence of ponasterone A. When the cells were co-infected with both AdEGI (moi = 4.0) plus AdVgRXR (moi = 0.8) for 48 h and incubated for the last 24 h in the presence of ponasterone A, ∼90% of cells were eGFP-positive. These conditions were used for further experiments. PI 3-kinase and Akt activity and amount and NHE3 activity were measured under these conditions in the absence or presence of ponasterone A. PS120/E3V cells were co-infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding p110*-Myc (AdEp110*-Myc) or myr-Akt-HA (AdEmyr-Akt-HA) plus receptor virus AdVgRXR and were studied in the absence and presence of ponasterone A. Western blot analysis of total lysates were used to identify the presence of fusion proteins of p110*-Myc and myr-Akt-HA, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the Myc or HA epitope tags. Fig.3 shows the results of an anti-Myc blot for p110* protein and an anti-HA blot for Akt protein. The level of expression of p110*-Myc and myr-Akt-HA were induced ∼ 3.6- and 4.0-fold in the presence of ponasterone A and were minimally above baseline in the absence of ponasterone A, indicating minimal but present leakiness of the ecdysone promoter. To assess the activities of p110* and myr-Akt, cells were infected with either p110* or myr-Akt encoding recombinant adenoviral construct in the absence and presence of ponasterone A. In the p110* studies, cells were lysed, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p110, and the immunoprecipitate was resolubilized and used to detect the total endogenous plus exogenous PI 3-kinase activity. For Akt activity, lysates were used, and the parameter to determine Akt activity was an antibody that detects phosphorylated Ser473, which is activated Akt (phospho-Akt) (16Franke T.F. Yang S.I.

Activity levels of PI 3-kinase (Fig.4, A and B) and phospho-Akt (Fig. 4, C and D) were induced in the presence of ponasterone A compared with the absence of ponasterone A. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, PI 3-kinase activity increased ∼2.3-fold with ponasterone A (increased to 223 ± 16% of control). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, Akt activity increased ∼3-fold with ponasterone A (increased to 310 ± 31% of control). To investigate whether activated PI 3-kinase is sufficient to stimulate Akt activity, the AdEp110*-Myc recombinant adenoviral construct was infected in PS120/NHE3V cells. The amount of phosphorylated Akt was detected by ani-phospho-Ser473 Akt. Fig. 5 A shows that endogenous Akt activity was stimulated by expression of p110* kinase activity without a change in amount of Akt expression (Fig. 5 B). Recently, we and others have reported that activation of PI 3-kinase is a necessary step in FGF s"

Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have identified a 72-bp1 bacterial gene silencer, AT4, located upstream of leuO. LeuO appeared to negate AT4-mediated gene silencing (4Chen C.-C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This provided a molecular basis for the speculated transcription regulatory role of LeuO. However, owing to the cryptic nature of the expression of leuO in rapidly growing bacterial cells under standard growth condition, the physiological impact of the leuO expression was unclear. We have recently found a conditional leuO expression when bacterial cells enter the stationary phase grown in rich media/LB (11Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such a conditional leuO expression was demonstrated to be guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp)-dependent. Since ppGpp is the stress signal in the bacterial stringent response pathway (reviewed in Ref. 12Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar), leuO may be one of those genes that are not essential during exponentially growth of laboratory cultures but important for cell survival in more stressful natural environments.In order to better understand the physiological impact ofleuO expression, we studied the LeuO function in the ppGpp-dependent bacterial stringent response. Bacterial stringent response is caused by a limited availability of amino acids or by exhaustion of the primary carbon source (reviewed in Ref. 12Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Hence, the stringent response can be induced by limiting the availability of a certain amino acid when such a strain that is auxotrophic for that amino acid is growing in a chemically defined medium. More interestingly, a stringent response can also be induced in an autotrophic strain due to the toxic effects of some amino acids. For example, an overdose of valine was known to cause isoleucine starvation in the Escherichia coli K-12 strain (13Alföldi L. Kerekes E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar), while supplementation with one-carbon amino acids, serine, methionine, and glycine (SMG) in a chemically defined minimal medium was known to deplete the endogenous branched-chain amino acids (14Uzan M. Danchin A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The SMG-caused toxic effect can be reversed by supplementing with branched-chain amino acids or the precursors of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis (15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observed toxic effects reflect the complex metabolite-mediated feedback controls in the bacterial biosynthetic pathways for amino acids (13Alföldi L. Kerekes E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar).The relA gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of ppGpp, which is crucial in triggering the bacterial stringent response. It was not surprising to find that SMG inhibited the growth of relA mutants (13Alföldi L. Kerekes E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar, 14Uzan M. Danchin A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under such a branched-chain amino acid-depleted condition, the growth of both therelA wild-type (stringent) strains and the relAmutant (relaxed) strains were dramatically interrupted. Upon the nutrient downshift, the stringent strains resumed normal growth within several hours, whereas the relaxed strains remained inhibited. Since the addition of branched-chain amino acids could efficiently reverse the inhibition (15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it suggested strongly that derepression of theilv (isoleucine-leucine-valine) operons are impaired in the relA mutants while the derepression can be induced in the relA + strains within 1–4 h as a stringent response (15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ilv operons encode acetohydroxy acid synthase isozymes that are responsible for the synthesis of precursors for the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine, leucine, and valine (reviewed in Ref. 16Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 442-457Google Scholar). The expression of leuO was shown to be regulated via a promoter relay mechanism (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is decisively controlled by the transcription activity of ilvIH, which is one of the three ilvoperons in bacteria. We therefore tested whether the specificilv derepression revealed the potential function of LeuO in response to starvation for branched-chain amino acids. If the expression of leuO is indeed induced upon the derepression of the ilv operon via the promoter relay, then LeuO function may be important for the bacterial stringent response. Clavo's group has demonstrated that increase in cellular ppGpp level is crucial for the expression of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), which is the positive regulator for the expression of ilvIH(17Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This result provides a reasonable explanation for why the biosynthesis of ppGpp is required for the expression of leuO(11Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether the level of leuOexpression correlated with the cellular ppGpp level.To address these questions, we took advantage of the E. coli relA1 strains that are “relaxed” but retain a residual “stringent response capability” owing to a low level ppGpp synthetic capacity (19Fiil N. Friesen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 729-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relA1 mutation is due to an insertion of an IS2 element between the codons 85 and 86 of therelA gene (20Metzger S. Schreiber G. Aizenman E. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21146-21152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Owing to promoter activity originating from the IS2 insert, the mutant gene retains a low level of ppGpp synthetic activity. The residual stringent response capability of therelA1 strain may be important for a “slow onset” derepression of ilv operons that allows detection of transient leuO induction upon the ilvtranscription activity. The ilv derepression is expected to be efficient in a relA + stringent strain, as are other stringent responses due to the “rapid onset” of cellular ppGpp in the relA + strain. These phenotypes are in contrast to that of a completely relaxed strain, such as arelA/spoT double mutant, which will not cause the derepression of ilv due to the absence of ppGpp and will not survive the starvation of branched-chain amino acids either (21Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONOur results can best be explained by the promoter relay mechanism (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) whereby ilvIH transcription activity (ilvderepression) triggers the activation of the intermediateleuO and subsequently enhances the transcriptional activity of the leuABCD operon. Upon the turn on of ilvIH, a 3–4-fold enhancement of the transcription activity ofleuABCD was documented (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased leuABCDtranscriptional activity may provide additional leucine biosynthesis for cells to overcome the temporary but severe branched-chain amino acid starvation during the exponential growth in the testing condition. This explanation is also consistent with the observed transient LeuO peak during the 2-h growth arrest, since leucine deprivation is required for the activation of ilvIH by Lrp (18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Haughn G.W. Squires C.H. DeFelice M. Lago C.T. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 186-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the cellular leucine level increased due to the 3–4-fold enhancement of leuABCD activity, ilvIH activity was repressed and so was the expression of leuO.The stress signal, ppGpp, may be required for activation ofilvIH via the increase of cellular Lrp level (17Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of leuO expression. However, this event does not apparently correlate with the cellular ppGpp level. As the 2-h growth arrest proceeds (Fig. 2, B and C) in the relA1 strain, the LeuO levels begin to decrease slowly. Thus, LeuO levels change inversely to the presumed slow rise in ppGpp levels in the relA1 strain. More importantly, constant low LeuO levels were detected (Fig. 2, B and C) in the relA + strain, where cellular ppGpp level is expected to be high under the experimental condition. Since such a background LeuO level during exponential growth was not observed whenrelA + strains were grown in rich broth/LB (11Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the low but constant LeuO level in the relA +strain was likely due to the rapid onset of the stringent response when bacteria were growing in the chemically defined medium. The well known leucine-mediated feedback control on the expression of ilvIH(18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Haughn G.W. Squires C.H. DeFelice M. Lago C.T. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 186-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may provide the explanation for the observation of the low but constant LeuO level in the relA + strain. The rapid onset of cellular ppGpp level in the relA +strains is expected to efficiently activate theilvIH-leuO-leuABCD regulatory cassette via increasing the cellular level of Lrp, the positive transcription regulator for the expression of ilvIH (17Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and result in the increase of cellular leucine level. Then the increased cellular leucine negatively regulates the regulatory cassette by repressing the transcriptional activity of ilvIH since leucine is known to weaken the binding of Lrp with its binding sites located upstream ofilvIH (18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Haughn G.W. Squires C.H. DeFelice M. Lago C.T. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 186-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium of these two counteracting regulatory activities is likely to be responsible for the low but constant LeuO expression in the relA + strains. At the equilibrium, the changes of cellular LeuO levels were too transient to be detected. If so, the failure of detecting LeuO level changes does not suggest the absence of the similar stress-responsive event in the relA + strains.This argument is reasonable since the enzyme activities required for the stringent response should be readily turned on (derepressed) in a stringent strain due to the rapid onset of cellular ppGpp accumulation, whereas the enzyme activities remain repressed in the relaxedrelA1 strain due to the slow onset of cellular ppGpp accumulation. This rationale also explains why the relaxedrelA1 strain was in a physiological impasse (the 2-h growth arrest) from which escape by derepression of the repressed genes (theilv operons and hence leuO) was necessary for the resumption of growth. Presumably due to the already derepressedleuO and ilv operons in the stringentrelA + strain, the RH147 surpassed the temporary branched-chain amino acid starvation without a clear delay (arrest) during the log phase growth (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, theilv operons (and hence the leuO gene) remain repressed in relA1 strain prior to the 2-h growth arrest (Fig. 4). The LeuO level was almost undetectable (Fig. 4 E,lane 1) and gradually increased (Fig.4 E, lane 2) and peaked during the 2-h growth lag (Fig. 4 E, lanes 3 and4).Apparently, ppGpp is required for triggering the event including theleuO expression. Subsequently, a ppGpp level-independent regulatory mechanism must determine the transient leuOexpression. The leucine-mediated feedback control mechanism discussed above is almost certain to be one of such ppGpp-independent regulatory mechanisms. In addition, a possible positive feedback mechanism effect directly on the expression of leuO has been suggested in our recent study (4Chen C.-C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It appears that leuO expression is regulated in a complex manner. Additional studies are required to fully understand the auto-regulation of leuO expression.Although our results report on a very specific condition for LeuO expression in a specific strain (relA1 strain), there is, however, a clear-cut leuO − phenotype (cell growth is interrupted at A 600 = 1.2 in the absence of the functional leuO gene). Although this particular experimental condition will provide an excellent opportunity for evaluating the more complete physiological functions of LeuO in therelA1 strain, we believe that LeuO is likely to be also important for normal bacterial physiology in all strains. This is a typical difficulty of identifying the functions of genes that are not essential for exponentially growing cells. Lack of phenotypes under standard laboratory testing conditions does not, however, mean the lack of function physiologically. In fact, due to cryptic phenotypes in laboratory conditions, the regulation and functions of many genes have been overlooked. We believe that LeuO is one of those underappreciated genes in bacteria.The present study suggested a role of LeuO in the cell physiology, which is essential for the growth (cell division) resumption after the 2-h growth arrest in relA1 strain (Figs. 4 C and5 B). What could be the physiological function of LeuO? Apparently, LeuO does not cause the growth inhibition (the 2-h growth arrest) since the leuO - relA1 strain, MF1, also stopped growing under the testing condition (Fig.4 A). Instead, a regulatory role in transcription has been documented for LeuO (4Chen C.-C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A direct and global transcription regulatory function for LeuO is currently being considered and studied in the laboratory. The conditional leuO expression identified in the study provides the initial step toward elucidating the physiological function of LeuO in the interesting but largely unknown bacterial stringent response (reviewed in Ref. 12Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). The overexpression or underexpression of leuOhas been shown to affect a number of bacterialhns − phenotypes (1Klauck E. Böhringer J. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Shi X. Bennett G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ueguchi C. Ohta T. Seto C. Suzuki T.

Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have identified a 72-bp1 bacterial gene silencer, AT4, located upstream of leuO. LeuO appeared to negate AT4-mediated gene silencing (4Chen C.-C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This provided a molecular basis for the speculated transcription regulatory role of LeuO. However, owing to the cryptic nature of the expression of leuO in rapidly growing bacterial cells under standard growth condition, the physiological impact of the leuO expression was unclear. We have recently found a conditional leuO expression when bacterial cells enter the stationary phase grown in rich media/LB (11Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such a conditional leuO expression was demonstrated to be guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp)-dependent. Since ppGpp is the stress signal in the bacterial stringent response pathway (reviewed in Ref. 12Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar), leuO may be one of those genes that are not essential during exponentially growth of laboratory cultures but important for cell survival in more stressful natural environments. In order to better understand the physiological impact ofleuO expression, we studied the LeuO function in the ppGpp-dependent bacterial stringent response. Bacterial stringent response is caused by a limited availability of amino acids or by exhaustion of the primary carbon source (reviewed in Ref. 12Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Hence, the stringent response can be induced by limiting the availability of a certain amino acid when such a strain that is auxotrophic for that amino acid is growing in a chemically defined medium. More interestingly, a stringent response can also be induced in an autotrophic strain due to the toxic effects of some amino acids. For example, an overdose of valine was known to cause isoleucine starvation in the Escherichia coli K-12 strain (13Alföldi L. Kerekes E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar), while supplementation with one-carbon amino acids, serine, methionine, and glycine (SMG) in a chemically defined minimal medium was known to deplete the endogenous branched-chain amino acids (14Uzan M. Danchin A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The SMG-caused toxic effect can be reversed by supplementing with branched-chain amino acids or the precursors of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis (15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observed toxic effects reflect the complex metabolite-mediated feedback controls in the bacterial biosynthetic pathways for amino acids (13Alföldi L. Kerekes E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar). The relA gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of ppGpp, which is crucial in triggering the bacterial stringent response. It was not surprising to find that SMG inhibited the growth of relA mutants (13Alföldi L. Kerekes E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar, 14Uzan M. Danchin A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under such a branched-chain amino acid-depleted condition, the growth of both therelA wild-type (stringent) strains and the relAmutant (relaxed) strains were dramatically interrupted. Upon the nutrient downshift, the stringent strains resumed normal growth within several hours, whereas the relaxed strains remained inhibited. Since the addition of branched-chain amino acids could efficiently reverse the inhibition (15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it suggested strongly that derepression of theilv (isoleucine-leucine-valine) operons are impaired in the relA mutants while the derepression can be induced in the relA + strains within 1–4 h as a stringent response (15Uzan M. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ilv operons encode acetohydroxy acid synthase isozymes that are responsible for the synthesis of precursors for the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine, leucine, and valine (reviewed in Ref. 16Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 442-457Google Scholar). The expression of leuO was shown to be regulated via a promoter relay mechanism (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is decisively controlled by the transcription activity of ilvIH, which is one of the three ilvoperons in bacteria. We therefore tested whether the specificilv derepression revealed the potential function of LeuO in response to starvation for branched-chain amino acids. If the expression of leuO is indeed induced upon the derepression of the ilv operon via the promoter relay, then LeuO function may be important for the bacterial stringent response. Clavo's group has demonstrated that increase in cellular ppGpp level is crucial for the expression of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), which is the positive regulator for the expression of ilvIH(17Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This result provides a reasonable explanation for why the biosynthesis of ppGpp is required for the expression of leuO(11Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether the level of leuOexpression correlated with the cellular ppGpp level. To address these questions, we took advantage of the E. coli relA1 strains that are “relaxed” but retain a residual “stringent response capability” owing to a low level ppGpp synthetic capacity (19Fiil N. Friesen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 729-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relA1 mutation is due to an insertion of an IS2 element between the codons 85 and 86 of therelA gene (20Metzger S. Schreiber G. Aizenman E. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21146-21152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Owing to promoter activity originating from the IS2 insert, the mutant gene retains a low level of ppGpp synthetic activity. The residual stringent response capability of therelA1 strain may be important for a “slow onset” derepression of ilv operons that allows detection of transient leuO induction upon the ilvtranscription activity. The ilv derepression is expected to be efficient in a relA + stringent strain, as are other stringent responses due to the “rapid onset” of cellular ppGpp in the relA + strain. These phenotypes are in contrast to that of a completely relaxed strain, such as arelA/spoT double mutant, which will not cause the derepression of ilv due to the absence of ppGpp and will not survive the starvation of branched-chain amino acids either (21Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONOur results can best be explained by the promoter relay mechanism (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) whereby ilvIH transcription activity (ilvderepression) triggers the activation of the intermediateleuO and subsequently enhances the transcriptional activity of the leuABCD operon. Upon the turn on of ilvIH, a 3–4-fold enhancement of the transcription activity ofleuABCD was documented (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased leuABCDtranscriptional activity may provide additional leucine biosynthesis for cells to overcome the temporary but severe branched-chain amino acid starvation during the exponential growth in the testing condition. This explanation is also consistent with the observed transient LeuO peak during the 2-h growth arrest, since leucine deprivation is required for the activation of ilvIH by Lrp (18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Haughn G.W. Squires C.H. DeFelice M. Lago C.T. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 186-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the cellular leucine level increased due to the 3–4-fold enhancement of leuABCD activity, ilvIH activity was repressed and so was the expression of leuO.The stress signal, ppGpp, may be required for activation ofilvIH via the increase of cellular Lrp level (17Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of leuO expression. However, this event does not apparently correlate with the cellular ppGpp level. As the 2-h growth arrest proceeds (Fig. 2, B and C) in the relA1 strain, the LeuO levels begin to decrease slowly. Thus, LeuO levels change inversely to the presumed slow rise in ppGpp levels in the relA1 strain. More importantly, constant low LeuO levels were detected (Fig. 2, B and C) in the relA + strain, where cellular ppGpp level is expected to be high under the experimental condition. Since such a background LeuO level during exponential growth was not observed whenrelA + strains were grown in rich broth/LB (11Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the low but constant LeuO level in the relA +strain was likely due to the rapid onset of the stringent response when bacteria were growing in the chemically defined medium. The well known leucine-mediated feedback control on the expression of ilvIH(18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Haughn G.W. Squires C.H. DeFelice M. Lago C.T. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 186-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may provide the explanation for the observation of the low but constant LeuO level in the relA + strain. The rapid onset of cellular ppGpp level in the relA +strains is expected to efficiently activate theilvIH-leuO-leuABCD regulatory cassette via increasing the cellular level of Lrp, the positive transcription regulator for the expression of ilvIH (17Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and result in the increase of cellular leucine level. Then the increased cellular leucine negatively regulates the regulatory cassette by repressing the transcriptional activity of ilvIH since leucine is known to weaken the binding of Lrp with its binding sites located upstream ofilvIH (18Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Haughn G.W. Squires C.H. DeFelice M. Lago C.T. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 186-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium of these two counteracting regulatory activities is likely to be responsible for the low but constant LeuO expression in the relA + strains. At the equilibrium, the changes of cellular LeuO levels were too transient to be detected. If so, the failure of detecting LeuO level changes does not suggest the absence of the similar stress-responsive event in the relA + strains.This argument is reasonable since the enzyme activities required for the stringent response should be readily turned on (derepressed) in a stringent strain due to the rapid onset of cellular ppGpp accumulation, whereas the enzyme activities remain repressed in the relaxedrelA1 strain due to the slow onset of cellular ppGpp accumulation. This rationale also explains why the relaxedrelA1 strain was in a physiological impasse (the 2-h growth arrest) from which escape by derepression of the repressed genes (theilv operons and hence leuO) was necessary for the resumption of growth. Presumably due to the already derepressedleuO and ilv operons in the stringentrelA + strain, the RH147 surpassed the temporary branched-chain amino acid starvation without a clear delay (arrest) during the log phase growth (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, theilv operons (and hence the leuO gene) remain repressed in relA1 strain prior to the 2-h growth arrest (Fig. 4). The LeuO level was almost undetectable (Fig. 4 E,lane 1) and gradually increased (Fig.4 E, lane 2) and peaked during the 2-h growth lag (Fig. 4 E, lanes 3 and4).Apparently, ppGpp is required for triggering the event including theleuO expression. Subsequently, a ppGpp level-independent regulatory mechanism must determine the transient leuOexpression. The leucine-mediated feedback control mechanism discussed above is almost certain to be one of such ppGpp-independent regulatory mechanisms. In addition, a possible positive feedback mechanism effect directly on the expression of leuO has been suggested in our recent study (4Chen C.-C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It appears that leuO expression is regulated in a complex manner. Additional studies are required to fully understand the auto-regulation of leuO expression.Although our results report on a very specific condition for LeuO expression in a specific strain (relA1 strain), there is, however, a clear-cut leuO − phenotype (cell growth is interrupted at A 600 = 1.2 in the absence of the functional leuO gene). Although this particular experimental condition will provide an excellent opportunity for evaluating the more complete physiological functions of LeuO in therelA1 strain, we believe that LeuO is likely to be also important for normal bacterial physiology in all strains. This is a typical difficulty of identifying the functions of genes that are not essential for exponentially growing cells. Lack of phenotypes under standard laboratory testing conditions does not, however, mean the lack of function physiologically. In fact, due to cryptic phenotypes in laboratory conditions, the regulation and functions of many genes have been overlooked. We believe that LeuO is one of those underappreciated genes in bacteria.The present study suggested a role of LeuO in the cell physiology, which is essential for the growth (cell division) resumption after the 2-h growth arrest in relA1 strain (Figs. 4 C and5 B). What could be the physiological function of LeuO? Apparently, LeuO does not cause the growth inhibition (the 2-h growth arrest) since the leuO - relA1 strain, MF1, also stopped growing under the testing condition (Fig.4 A). Instead, a regulatory role in transcription has been documented for LeuO (4Chen C.-C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A direct and global transcription regulatory function for LeuO is currently being considered and studied in the laboratory. The conditional leuO expression identified in the study provides the initial step toward elucidating the physiological function of LeuO in the interesting but largely unknown bacterial stringent response (reviewed in Ref. 12Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Our results can best be explained by the promoter relay mechanism (5Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fang M.

From mechanistic and therapeutic points of view, it is relevant to determine the extent to which PrPSc formation and aggregation are reversible. PrPSc solubilized with 5m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was unfolded to a predominantly random coil conformation. Upon dilution of GdnHCl, PrP refolded into a conformation that was high in α-helix as measured by CD spectroscopy, similar to the normal cellular isoform of PrP (PrPC). This provided evidence that PrPSc can be induced to revert to a PrPC-like conformation with a strong denaturant. To examine the reversibility of PrPScformation and aggregation under more physiological conditions, PrPSc aggregates were washed and resuspended in buffers lacking GdnHCl and monitored over time for the appearance of soluble PrP. No dissociation of PrP from the PrPSc aggregates was detected in aqueous buffers at pH 6 and 7.5. The effective solubility of PrP was <0.7 nm. Treatment of PrPSc with proteinase K (PK) before the analysis did not enhance the dissociation of PrP from the PrPSc aggregates. Treatment with 2.5m GdnHCl, which partially and reversibly unfolds PrPSc, caused only limited dissociation of PrP from the aggregates. The PrP that dissociated from the aggregates over time was entirely PK-sensitive, like PrPC, whereas all of the aggregated PrP was partially PK-resistant. PrP also dissociated from aggregates of protease-resistant PrP generated in a cell-free conversion reaction, but only if treated with GdnHCl.

According to the protein-only hypothesis, PrPSc acts as an infectious protein by inducing its own formation from PrPC (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4121) Google Scholar, 24Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis came from the demonstration that PrPSc could cause PrPC to convert to a PrPSc-like protease-resistant and aggregated form in the absence of intact living cells (25Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). However, the generation of new infectivity has not been demonstrated in these cell-free conversion reactions (26Hill A.F. Antoniou M. Collinge J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or in any other in vitro protein-only system. TSEs are similar in some respects to amyloid diseases, which are characterized by the deposition of insoluble ordered protein aggregates called amyloid fibrils and plaques. Fibrils composed of PrP are often found in the brains of animals infected with TSEs (2Diringer H. Gelderblom H. Hilmert H. Ozel M. Edelbluth C. Kimberlin R.H.

In addition, the staining of PrPSc with the dye Congo red and subsequent exposure to polarized light result in birefringence, an amyloid hallmark (28Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A.

This mechanism has also been proposed for PrPSc formation (32Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 35Gadjusek D.C. J.

According to this mechanistic model, a slow lag phase during which protein monomers assemble into stable oligomeric nuclei precedes the relatively rapid elongation of the nuclei into fibrillar polymers. Nucleated polymerization of at least some proteins is reversible, as demonstrated by the disassembly of actin microfilaments (39Cooper J.A. Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 40Korn E.D. Physiol. Rev. 1982; 62: 672-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and the decrease in length of Aβ-amyloid protofibrils upon dilution (41Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, the insolubility of mature amyloid fibrils and PrPSc suggests that the protein aggregation that occurs during their formation is irreversible or only slowly reversible. Thus, the accumulation of PrPSc in TSE-infected animals may be due to an inherent irreversibility of PrP aggregation during some stage of PrPC-to-PrPSc conversion. Alternatively, aggregation may be reversible, but preparations of PrPScmay be at chemical equilibrium between soluble and aggregated PrP. The issue of reversibility of PrPSc formation and polymerization may be of significance in assessing ways of stopping and reversing PrPSc accumulation for therapeutic purposesin vivo. To gain insight into parameters controlling PrPScaccumulation in TSE-infected animals, experiments were performed to determine if the polymerization/aggregation of PrP that occurs during PrPSc formation is a reversible process. In this study, the dissociation of PrP from PrPSc aggregates was monitored over time under a variety of conditions. Overall, the results suggest that PrP aggregation is not detectably reversible, but partial unfolding can induce a modest level of PrP dissociation. PrPSc was purified from the brains of hamsters infected with the 263K strain of scrapie using a modification of the method employed by Bolton et al.(60Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Marmostein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as previously described (15Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Hamster GPI(−) PrPC lacks the GPI anchor due to the introduction of a stop codon in codon 231 of the gene expressing hamster PrP. PrP was isolated from mouse ψ2 and PA317 fibroblast cells overexpressing hamster GPI(−) PrP after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine essentially as described previously (42Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in this study, 4 µl of antibody 3F4 and 64 µl of a 35–40% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for the immunoprecipitation; a single elution of the beads in 60 µl of 0.1 m acetic acid was performed; and the eluant was not vacuum-dried. Unlabeled hamster GPI(−) PrP secreted into the tissue culture media and purified as described previously (43Wong C. Xiong L.-w. Horiuchi M. Raymond L.D. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was used for spectroscopy studies. 1 mg/ml PrPC was analyzed in 1 m NaCl and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. 10 mg/ml PrPSc was incubated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mmNaCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5% sulfobetaine with or without 5 mguanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) for 2 h at 20 °C. 5 µl of each sample was dropped onto a Golden Gate Single Reflection Diamond attenuated total reflectance unit (Graseby Specac, Inc.) purged with a Whatman FTIR purge system, and the sample was covered with a volatiles cover. Data collection was performed with a System 2000 FTIR instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Test conditions were as follows: temperature, 20 °C; resolution, 1.00 cm−1; optical path difference velocity, 5 cm/s; number of scans, 500; scan range, 1800 to 1400 cm−1; and interval, 0.5 cm−1. Data types were single for background and ratio for sample. The detector used was nb1MCT cooled by liquid nitrogen. Spectra were obtained by subtracting that of the corresponding buffer or buffer with additives and water vapor, adjusting the base line, and normalizing for comparable absorbance of different concentrations of PrP. The software used for spectrum analysis was Spectrum Version 2.00 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hamster GPI(−) PrPC (100 µg/ml) was analyzed in 10 mm sodium phosphate and 300 mm potassium fluoride, pH 6.5. PrPSc (3 mg/ml) was incubated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% sulfobetaine, and 2.5m GdnHCl for 1 h at 20 °C. PrPSc was pelleted and washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate and 300 mm potassium fluoride, pH 6.5. The resuspended pellet was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C in the wash buffer plus 6m GdnHCl and then gradually diluted with the wash buffer alone to 0.1 m GdnHCl and incubated for another 2 h at 20 °C. The sample was pelleted, and the supernatant was subjected to CD spectroscopy as described previously (43Wong C. Xiong L.-w. Horiuchi M. Raymond L.D. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). 3 µg of PrPSc was either treated with 60 ng of proteinase K (PK) or mock PK-treated in 50 µl of Tris/NaCl buffer (25Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were then adjusted to 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1.71 m NaCl, and 1% Sarkosyl in a total volume of 500 µl. (All buffers used after the PK digestion step contained 2 mm Pefabloc.) The presence of a high concentration of salt was to aid in removing bound PK from the PrPSc aggregates. Aggregates were separated from soluble PrP and PK and subjected to dissociation analysis as described below, except that 9 µg of bovine serum albumin was added to the suspensions just before dissociation analysis as a final control for PK contamination. Guanidine-free cell-free conversion reactions were performed as described previously (44Horiuchi M. Chabry J. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), except that reactions were scaled up by 5-fold. To measure the total amount of radiolabeled PrP in the reactions, a 2-µl aliquot was directly methanol-precipitated, and another 2-µl aliquot was counted by liquid scintillation. The amount of converted radiolabeled PrP was determined by treatment of a 10-µl aliquot with 10 µg/ml PK at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 4 µl of 0.1m Pefabloc and methanol precipitation. Methanol-precipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) analysis. The remaining portions of the conversion reactions were used for dissociation analysis after removal of soluble PrP as described below. The indicated amounts of PK-treated or untreated PrPSc were incubated under various conditions for 2.5 h or overnight at 37 °C. The suspensions were layered over 1 or 2 volumes of the same buffer used for the incubation supplemented with 1 m sucrose in polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes. The sucrose concentration was reduced for samples containing GdnHCl such that the sucrose/GdnHCl layers approximated the density of 1 m sucrose without GdnHCl. The tubes were centrifuged at 52,000–55,000 rpm for 30–36 min at 25 °C at the slowest acceleration/deceleration setting in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. All of the sample zone and 90–95% of the sucrose layer were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in the original volume or half of the original volume. Aliquots of this resuspended pellet were used for dissociation analysis as described below for the experiment shown in Fig. 2. For all other experiments, the resuspended PrPSc mixtures were pipetted over a second layer of sucrose identical to the first, and the centrifugation was repeated. All but the bottom 50–100 µl was discarded; 1 ml of buffer was added; and the samples were mixed briefly. The tubes were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 30 min at the fastest acceleration/deceleration setting. All but the bottom 50 µl of the wash was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in a total volume of 250–364 µl. Aliquots of these final PrPSc suspensions were used for dissociation analysis as described below. The centrifugation conditions used for the dissociation analyses described throughout this study are predicted to result in ≥90% of particles withs 20,w ≥ 17S being cleared from the sample zone (top fraction). Soluble PrP refers to protein that remained in the sample zone, the vast majority of which would have an S value of <17. The resuspended PrPSc aggregate mixtures were incubated (in the same buffer used for the soluble PrP/aggregate separation and subsequent washings) at 37 °C for 3 days, unless otherwise noted. At the beginning and end of the incubation period, 50-µl aliquots were removed and layered over 100 µl of the same sucrose solution used during the initial separation of soluble PrP from aggregate in polycarbonate centrifuge tubes. The step gradients were spun at 52,000 rpm for 16 min (reactions without GdnHCl) or 30 min (reactions with GdnHCl) in a Beckman TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor at the slowest acceleration/deceleration setting. Two 50-µl fractions (top and middle) and one 35–50-µl fraction (bottom) were removed. The remaining liquid was brought up to a volume of ∼50 µl with the same buffer used for the incubation, and the pellets were resuspended. (For the experiment shown in Fig. 2, 25-µl aliquots were layered over 50 µl of sucrose solution, and the volume of the fractions was 25 µl.) All fractions were either counted using liquid scintillation (for radiolabeled PrP) or methanol-precipitated and stored at −20 °C until Western blotting could be performed. In the experiment in which the PK sensitivity of the soluble and aggregate forms of PrP was assessed, the PrPSc aggregate mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Two 25-µl aliquots were removed from the PrPSc mixtures at days 0 and 3 of the incubation period. The reactions were brought up to a volume of 77.5 µl in Tris/NaCl buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to give the region of the protein containing the 3F4 epitope a chance to renature and reacquire protease resistance (45Kocisko D.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13434-13442Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 2.5 µl of PK (1 mg/ml) was added to one of each pair of duplicate samples, and the same volume of PK storage buffer was added to the other (mock PK digest). Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then 8 µl of 0.1 m Pefabloc was added. The reactions were layered over 0.3 m sucrose and 2.5 m GdnHCl, and the centrifugation and fractionation steps were performed as described above, except that the top fractions collected from the gradients were 90 µl, and the middle fractions were 48 µl. Proteins in methanol were pelleted by microcentrifugation and resuspended in urea sample buffer. Proteins were electrophoresed on Tris/glycine-buffered 16% or NuPAGE BisTris-buffered 10% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) using a semidry electroblotting apparatus (Biometra, Inc.). Antigens were detected with either a 1:10,000 dilution of the anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 or a 1:1000 dilution of an anti-bovine serum albumin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, B2901). Primary antibodies were detected with a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) and Attophos substrate (Promega) and visualized with a Storm fluorescence imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). To determine whether or not PrPSc can be forced to revert to a PrPC-like state, PrPSc was incubated at ∼40 µg/ml (1.3 µm) in 6 m GdnHCl at 37 °C overnight. The sample was diluted 10-fold and immediately subjected to centrifugation through a sucrose solution and fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 81% of the guanidine-treated PrP was found in the top (soluble) fraction, whereas 12% was pelleted (data not shown). These results demonstrate that >80% of the PrPSc was solubilized and that solubilized PrP fractionated to the top of the gradients under the centrifugation conditions used in this study. To verify that the guanidine-solubilized PrP was unfolded, PrPSc disaggregated in 5 m GdnHCl was analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. The spectrum was clearly different from the spectra of untreated PrPSc (high β-sheet) and PrPC (predominantly α-helix) (Fig.1A), and its absorbance maximum of 1646 cm−1 is consistent with a predominantly random coil structure (46Torii H. Tasumi M. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Infrared Spectroscopy of Biomolecules. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 1-18Google Scholar, 47Seshadri S. Khurana R. Fink A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This provides evidence that PrPSc was largely unfolded by GdnHCl. To examine the ability of solubilized and unfolded PrP to refold into a PrPC-like conformation, PrPSc was first washed with 2.5 m GdnHCl to remove protease-sensitive PrP from the aggregates (9Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Kocisko D.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4107-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kocisko D.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13434-13442Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 48Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The washed aggregates were then disaggregated in 6 m GdnHCl, and the mixture was gradually diluted to give a final GdnHCl concentration of 0.1 m. Any remaining aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The solubilized PrP generated a CD spectrum similar to that of PrPC (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that a majority of the molecules in PrPSc could be induced to refold into a PrPC-like conformation after treatment with a strong denaturant. For the purposes of this work, we define reversibility of PrP aggregation as an increase in soluble PrP over time in a suspension of PrPSc aggregates after the initial removal of soluble protein. To determine if any PrP dissociates from PrPSc aggregates under conditions that approximate those present at the cell surface or in early endosomes in vivo, suspensions of hamster PrPSc in buffers at pH 7.5 or 6.0, respectively, were washed by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose solution to separate any preexisting soluble PrP from the PrPSc aggregates. Pellets were washed and resuspended in the same buffer, and a portion of the mixture was immediately subjected to dissociation analysis. The remainder of the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 or 4 days and then assayed for the presence of soluble PrP. Under these conditions, no detectable soluble PrP was observed at either the beginning or end of the incubations (Figs.2 and 3,T lanes). Based on PrPSc standards included on the blots, the concentration of soluble PrP in the aggregate suspensions was <0.7 nm. These results indicate that the aggregation of PrP was not detectably reversible at two pH levels that may be encountered by PrPSc in vivo. To verify that small amounts of soluble PrP in a sample could be recovered after centrifugation, a portion of the above-mentioned 6m GdnHCl-treated PrPSc sample was diluted in citrate-buffered KCl with Sarkosyl, pH 6.0 (CBKS; 0.625% Sarkosyl, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm citric acid, pH 6.0), to total PrP and GdnHCl concentrations of 100 ng/ml (3.3 nm) and <0.01m, respectively. The sample was then subjected to centrifugation and fractionation. The soluble fraction contained ∼4 ng (80%) of PrP (data not shown). Thus, considering that ∼80% of the starting mixture consisted of soluble PrP, little, if any, soluble PrP was lost. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that small amounts of solubilized PrP (<1 ng) were not recovered. The smallest standard used on the Western blots in this study also contained 1 ng of PrP. For these reasons, we used 0.7 nm PrP (1 ng in a 50-µl volume) as the stated upper limit on the concentration of soluble PrP in a sample when no PrP was detected. Treatment of hamster 263K-associated PrPSc with PK completely degrades roughly half of the total PrP molecules (48Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The remaining PrP molecules are N-terminally truncated by ∼67 amino acids (13Hope J. Morton L.J.D. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 49Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B.H. Aebersold R. Barry R.A.

These effects of PK may affect aggregate ultrastructure (50McKinley M.P. Meyer R.K. Kenaga L. Rahbar F. Cotter R. Servan A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stability. To determine if PK treatment affects the ability of PrP to dissociate from PrPSc aggregates, PK-treated PrPSc was subjected to dissociation analysis in parallel with untreated PrPSc. Because any PK present in the suspension during the dissociation analysis could degrade any protease-sensitive PrP that may dissociate from the aggregate, multiple measures were taken to control for PK carryover as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As in the experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3, no detectable PrP was present in the soluble fractions from the untreated PrPScsamples at both the 0- and 3-day time points (Fig.4, − PK). Based on the PrPSc standards on this blot, the concentration o"

Several components of the mediator complex within the holoenzyme also have been shown to affect activation of different subsets of genes. Only recently has it been suggested that besides the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, smaller subunits like Rpb3 and Rpb5 may have regulatory roles in expression of specific sets of genes. We report here, the role of Rpb4, a non-essential subunit of core RNA polymerase II, in activation of a subset of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have shown below that whereas constitutive transcription is largely unaffected, activation from various promoters tested is severely compromised in the absence ofRPB4. This activation defect can be rescued by the overexpression of cognate activators. We have localized the region of Rpb4 involved in activation to the C-terminal 24 amino acids. We have also shown here that transcriptional activation by artificial recruitment of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the promoter is also defective in the absence of RPB4. Surprisingly, the overexpression of RPB7 (the interacting partner of Rpb4) does not rescue the activation defect of all the promoters tested, although it rescues the activation defect of the heat shock element-containing promoter and the temperature sensitivity associated with RPB4 deletion.

TATA-binding protein heat shock element kilobase open-reading frame Transcriptional regulation at the initiation step is one of the most important steps in the regulation of gene expression. Inducible (or repressible) genes, whose expression is varied in response to extra- or intracellular stimuli, often have complex promoters with upstream regulatory sites that help them respond to various stimuli (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the constitutively expressed genes have relatively simple promoters with invariant levels of gene expression. It has been proposed relatively recently that the transcriptional activator responsive form of RNA polymerase II, the holoenzyme, includes the core polymerase II subunits, the general transcription factors, and a complex variously called the mediator, upstream stimulatory activity, or coactivators (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The mediator-coactivator complex is an important although not essential component of the holoenzyme (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In fact, a number of different holoenzymes have been proposed to coexist; each one of which is able to respond only to a subset of activators/regulators (4Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is increasingly becoming apparent that the subunits of the core polymerase may also play an active role in gene regulation by determining the interactions with either the mediators/coactivators or transcriptional activators (5Miyao T.

The core RNA polymerase II of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of twelve subunits, ten of which are essential for survival and five are shared between the three RNA polymerases (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rpb4, one of the non-essential subunits, is unique to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II in that it does not have a counterpart in the other two eukaryotic RNA polymerases (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It forms a subcomplex with one of the essential subunits, Rpb7, within the core RNA polymerase II. Biochemical analyses have revealed that the lack of the Rpb4 subunit also leads to the lack of the Rpb7 subunit in the immunoprecipitated polymerase (10Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol.

The polymerase lacking Rpb4 and Rpb7 is inefficient in carrying outGAL1 promoter-directed transcription in vitro(10Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many groups including our own have shown recently that overexpression of RPB7 allows rescue of some of the phenotypes associated with the deletion of RPB4 (12Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We show here that RPB4 affects transcriptional activation of a subset of genes. This effect on activated transcription is much more pronounced than its effect on constitutive transcription. We also show here that this defect in activated transcription can be overcome by overexpression of transcriptional activators but not by increased recruitment of the TATA-binding protein (TBP)1 to the promoter. Rpb7, the interacting partner of Rpb4, when overexpressed, partially rescues temperature sensitivity and some heat shock element-driven transcription but not all activated promoters.

The 3.9-kb EcoRI fragment from pPS76 containing the actin-β-galactosidase fusion was cloned downstream of the PCUP1, PGPD1, and PTEF2 at the EcoRI site of pPS79, pPS190, and pPS189 to generate pNS98, pNS132, and pNS166 respectively (22Russnak R. Nehrke K.W. Platt T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). To generate the PADH1-β-galactosidase fusion in pNS99, the 3.9-kb EcoRI fragment from pPS76 was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment of DNA Polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the blunt-ended, HindIII-digested pPS31. pPS31 is identical to pGAD424 (CLONTECH). pPS121, bearing a PGAL10-β-galactosidase fusion and pPS79 were gifts from Dr. U. Vijayaraghavan. pPS231 was a kind gift from P. J. Bhatt. The 0.5-kb RPB7 open reading frame (ORF) was cloned under the PTEF2 in pPS189 as a BamHI-XhoI fragment and further the PTEF2-RPB7 fragment was subcloned into the SacI-KpnI sites of pPS5 (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) to generate pNS185. The HindIII site in the multiple cloning site of the plasmid pPS2 (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) was destroyed by end-filling it with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and religation. Into this vector, pBP211, the RPB4 gene was cloned as a 1.2-kb BamHI-SalI fragment to generate pBP192. The rpb4–2 allele (pBP212) was generated by religating HindIII-digested pBP192 after blunt-ending with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. This generates an in-frame STOP codon leading to a deletion of the C-terminal 24 amino acids of Rpb4. The 0.9-kb INO2 ORF was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the following primers: Forward Primer (5′-CCCGGATCCTGCAACAAGCA-3′); Reverse primer (5′-CCCGTCGACTCAGGAATCATCC-3′) and cloned as a fusion to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) under the PADH1 in pPS31. The 0.7-kb SPT15 ORF encoding TBP was PCR-amplified using the primers: 5′-CCGAATTCATGGCCGATGAGGAACG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCCTTCCCCATCACA-3′ and cloned as an in-frame fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain (DBD) in pPS139 (25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The PADH1-LexA-DBD-TBP-TADH1 was transferred from this plasmid as a SphI fragment into theSphI-digested pPS30 (identical to pGBT9,CLONTECH) to obtain the LexA·TBP fusion in an appropriate vector (pBP215). All strains analyzed for temperature sensitivity were first streaked onto plates containing synthetic complete (SC) medium + 2% glucose + 2% agar. Cells were restreaked at equal densities onto plates containing SC medium + 2% glucose + 2% agar. The plates were incubated at 25 °C, 34 °C, or 37 °C for 3 days before they were photographed. The promoter activities of different constitutive and activated promoters in rpb4Δand RPB4 strains were analyzed after growing the appropriate strains under the following growth conditions. GAL1 andGAL10: strains were grown in SC medium + 2% glucose until mid-log phase and then subcultured into SC medium + 2% galactose for 3–5 h (inducing condition). INO1: strains were grown in SC medium + 2% glucose until mid-log phase before they were assayed (derepressing condition). PHO5: strains were grown in SC medium + 2% glucose until mid-log phase and subcultured into SC medium without phosphate (derepressing condition) or with 7.5 mmammonium phosphate. HSE: strains were grown in SC medium + 2% glucose until mid-log phase and one-half volume of culture was given a heat shock at 37 °C for 1 h (inducing condition).CUP1: strains were grown in SC medium +2% glucose until mid-log phase and subcultured to SC medium with (inducing condition) or without 100 µm CuSO4. The assay for the activity of constitutive promoters tested, PADH1, PGPD1, and PTEF2, was performed by growing the strains in SC medium +2% glucose until mid-log phase. Cells from both rpb4Δ and RPB4strains were pelleted and β-galactosidase assays were performed by using the glass bead method as described previously (26Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For analysis of theCUP1 and GAL1 endogenous transcript levels, the strains were grown as described above. Total RNA was isolated as previously described (27Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). RNA samples were quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm, and equal amounts of RNA fromrpb4Δ and RPB4 strains grown under non-inducing and inducing conditions were run on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNAs were blotted on nitrocellulose membrane according to standard protocols (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, 1987–1994Google Scholar). The 1.7-kb BamHI-SalI fragment from pPS232 (28Kabir M.A. Khanday F.A Mehta D.V. Bhat P.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), containing the entire GAL1 ORF and the 0.9-kb BamHI-SalI fragment from pPS80 (29Lesser C.F. Guthrie C. Genetics. 1993; 133: 851-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the entire CUP1 ORF were used for generating probes for analyzing endogenous levels of GAL1 andCUP1 genes, respectively. A 0.5-kb region of 18 S rRNA was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pNS245 and used for generating radiolabeled probes. [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Science Products, BLU512H)-labeled DNA probes were generated using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN1604). The protocol suggested by the manufacturer was strictly followed. Routine hybridization and posthybridization procedures were followed. The blots were subjected to phosphor imaging analysis using a Fuji Phosphor Imager. Activation of transcription from yeast promoters involves complex interactions between the upstream activating sequence (UAS)-bound transcriptional activator, the mediator/coactivator complexes, and the core RNA polymerase II, which leads to increased recruitment of the transcription-competent complex to the nearby promoter (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested that the smaller subunits of core RNA polymerase II, Rpb3 and Rpb5, may act as contact points for transcriptional activators (5Miyao T. Woychik N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15281-15286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Tan Q. Linask K.L. Ebright R.H. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar). We have analyzed the role of another small subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rpb4, in activated transcription. Earlier reports suggest a role for Rpb4 in transcription initiation based on the inability of the RNA polymerase II purified fromrpb4Δ cells to initiate transcription from a UASGAL1-CYC1 promoter in vitro (10Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used several well studied yeast promoters fused to the β-galactosidase reporter gene and tested their activities in the absence and presence of RPB4. The β-galactosidase activities were measured from cells grown in synthetic medium for the three constitutive promoters. For the six regulated promoters, the β-galactosidase activities were measured from cells grown under inducing and non-inducing conditions. We observed that the activities of the promoters of the constitutive genes ADH1,TEF2, and GPD1 (from plasmids pNS99, pNS166, and pNS132 respectively) were reduced by 1.3–3-fold in rpb4Δas compared with wild type (Fig.1 a). This suggests that the constitutive promoters tested are not significantly affected by the absence of RPB4. Of the six regulated promoters tested, five promoters of the genesGAL1, GAL10, INO1, PHO5, and a promoter containing HSE (from plasmids pPS231, pPS121, pPS24, pPS122, and pPS111) showed highly inefficient regulated expression in the absence of RPB4(Fig. 1 b). The ratio of the β-galactosidase activities in the wild-type strain to that in rpb4Δ has been calculated under inducing (I) and non-inducing (U) conditions and is represented on the top of each bar graph. It is obvious that the lack of RPB4 results in a drastic reduction in promoter activity under inducing conditions (from 14–320-fold depending on the promoter) but the activity under non-inducing conditions is affected to a much lesser extent in each case. This indicates that the reduced induction level is not just a reflection of reduced basal/uninduced levels of the promoter activity. On the other hand, the sixth inducible promoter tested, PCUP1 (from the plasmid, pNS98) showed a reduction in activity of only about 3-fold in a rpb4Δ strain as compared with a wild-type strain even under inducing conditions (Fig. 1 c). Using another approach to study the transcriptional activity from the induced promoters, we tested the endogenous expression levels of some of the genes in rpb4Δ and RPB4 strains. The steady-state mRNA levels of CUP1 are similar inrpb4Δ and RPB4 strains even under inducing conditions (Fig. 1 d). The RPB4 strain shows a drastic increase in the mRNA levels of the GAL1transcript under inducing conditions as compared with the mRNA levels in non-inducing conditions. However, the GAL1transcript is hardly visible in the rpb4Δ strain even under inducing conditions. This pattern of defective expression inrpb4Δ strain as compared with the RPB4 strain was also seen for the PHO5 and INO1-activated promoters (data not shown). In summary, the results from the β-galactosidase assays and the Northern analysis suggest that Rpb4 is involved in activated transcription. In the absence of Rpb4, transcription from constitutive promoters is less efficient, but the activated transcription from several promoters is severely compromised. These results also suggest that regulation of CUP1 transcription does not involve Rpb4 and is mechanistically different from other activated promoters (see “Discussion”). Previously we have shown that some of the stress phenotypes associated with the absence ofRPB4 are partially rescued by overexpression of its interacting partner, RPB7 (12Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Genet. 1999; 78: 149-156Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This suggests that Rpb4 stabilizes the interaction of Rpb7 with the rest of the polymerase. The results presented above suggest a role for Rpb4 in activated transcription. We analyzed the effect of high levels of RPB7on the induced promoter activities of GAL10 andINO1 and the HSE-containing promoter (derived from the SSA1 gene), in the absence ofRPB4. Because the TEF2 promoter is constitutively expressed at high levels and we have seen that it is not significantly affected by the absence of RPB4 (Fig. 1 a), we overexpressed RPB7 from the TEF2 promoter on a multicopy plasmid (pNS185) in the rpb4Δ strain SY10-1. We have confirmed that the transcript levels of RPB7 expressed from this construct are several-fold higher as compared with therpb4Δ parent strain and that this overexpressed level ofRPB7 could rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the parent strain at 37 °C (data not shown). At 37 °C, the activity of the HSE containing promoter was approximately 8-fold higher than the activity in rpb4Δ (Fig.2 a). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2 b, β-galactosidase activities from the PGAL10 and PINO1 promoter-reporter fusions inrpb4Δ+PTEF2 -RPB7 strain are very similar to their activities in the rpb4Δ strain. This suggests that overexpression of RPB7 in rpb4Δstrain can rescue the defect in activated transcription from the HSE-containing promoter but not from the GAL10 andINO1 promoters. It was earlier observed that the purified polymerase lacking both subunits, Rpb4 and Rpb7, was defective in promoter-specific transcription initiation in vitro, which could be rescued partially by the addition of a potent chimeric transcriptional activator (10Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we found that in vivo- (unlike the in vitroresult) activated transcription is significantly affected in the absence of RPB4, we decided to test if overexpressed cognate activators will have a rescuing effect on the specific-activated promoters. We overexpressed two specific transcriptional activators,GAL4 and INO2, from the ADH1 promoter (30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) and tested the effect on the activity of the GAL10 andINO1 promoters, respectively, in the absence ofRPB4. Both the activators when expressed at higher than normal levels partially rescued the activation defect ofrpb4Δ (Fig. 3). In the case of GAL4 overexpression, the uninduced levels inrpb4Δ are also significantly higher (see “Discussion,” Ref. 31Yocum R.R. Hanley S. West Jr., R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Under inducing conditions, the GAL10 promoter activity is even higher than under non-inducing conditions, indicating that the rescue of activated transcription in rpb4Δ is specific to overexpression of the activator. To test whether the effect of overexpression of transcriptional activator is specific to the cognate regulated promoter and not a nonspecific general effect on transcription, we also tested the promoter activities in the presence of an excess of the non-cognate transcriptional activators. As shown in Fig. 3, the activated promoters are affected by overexpression of only the cognate activator. This confirmed that the effect of the activators is specific and not an effect on transcription in general. The observation that activated transcription is inefficient in the absence of Rpb4, and overexpression of activators partially rescues the activation defect of rpb4Δ strains could be explained by direct or indirect contact between activators and Rpb4. Previously, the mammalian transcriptional activator, EWS-Fli, has been shown to interact directly with the human homolog of Rpb7 (8Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We used the directed two-hybrid assay to test whether there is a physical interaction between either Rpb4 or Rpb7 and the GAL4 andINO2 activators. Neither of the activators interacted with either of the subunits (data not shown). The comparison of the Rpb4 protein sequence (using the PRODOM data base) across species shows that the protein has a conserved C-terminal region whereas the N-terminal sequence appears unique to the S. cerevisiae protein (32Corpet F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27 (.) (updated in Corpet, F., Servant, F., Gouzy, J., and Kahn, D.(2000) Nucleic Acids Res. 28, 267–269)): 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The 150 amino acid long domain, 16118 (as numbered in the PRODOM data base) is shared by all the homologs in this alignment and has several invariant residues (Fig. 4 a) (32Corpet F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27 (.) (updated in Corpet, F., Servant, F., Gouzy, J., and Kahn, D.(2000) Nucleic Acids Res. 28, 267–269)): 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Using a convenient HindIII restriction site we decided to alter the invariant sequence PSL to PS (STOP). This manipulation deletes the remaining 24 amino acids from the C terminus of Rpb4, eight of which are very highly conserved (identical in four or more of the six homologs compared). We tested if this change in the sequence affects the role of RPB4. We observed that the mutantrpb4–2 is defective in rescue of temperature sensitivity of the rpb4Δ strain even at 34 °C (Fig. 4 b). The deletion mutant was as defective as the rpb4Δ strain in activation from the promoter of the GAL10 gene (Fig.4 c). We have tested transcript levels corresponding to theRPB4 gene both in RPB4 and the rpb4–2carrying strains and found them comparable (data not shown). We could not formally rule out the possibility that the loss of the C-terminal part of the protein affects protein stability because even wild-type expression levels of Rpb4 were below the limits of detection. Because the absence of RPB4 causes a severe defect in the activation of several activated genes, which can be partially rescued by the overexpression of activators, we wanted to further analyze the nature of the defect. It has been shown earlier that several components of the holoenzyme when tethered to a strong DNA binding domain can circumvent the requirement for activators (33Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Klages N. Strubin M. Nature. 1995; 374: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Many transcriptional activators act by stabilizing the interaction of TBP with the promoter (35Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Other workers have shown that the requirement for transcriptional activators can be circumvented by artificially tethering TBP using a LexA·TBP fusion protein (33Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The LexA protein binds strongly to the LexAop element positioned upstream of the TATA box, thus stabilizing TBP-promoter interaction. If Rpb4 plays a role in the interaction of transcriptional activators with the transcription machinery, we proposed that artificial recruitment by tethering of TBP might circumvent the need for Rpb4. We used a reporter plasmid carrying eight copies of the LexAop upstream of a TATA box, which drives expression of β-galactosidase gene downstream. We introduced the LexA·TBP fusion and the β-galactosidase reporter under the LexAop control into rpb4Δ and RPB4strains. The LexA·TBP fusion failed to activate the expression of the reporter plasmid in a rpb4Δ strain. However, the presence of the RPB4 gene allowed activation through the LexA·TBP fusion (Fig. 5). We also tested the activation potential of the LexA·TBP fusion in the presence of the C-terminal-deleted RPB4, the rpb4–2 mutant and found the mutant to be defective similar to the deletion strain (data not shown). Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous increase in our understanding about mechanisms of activation of transcription in eukaryotes, with major contributions coming from the yeast system. It has been reported that the transcription machinery exists in the form of a holoenzyme comprising RNA polymerase II, the general transcription factors, and the mediator/coactivator complex. An important concept that has emerged is that the holoenzyme is the form of polymerase competent to respond to activators (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The composition of the holoenzyme differs substantially depending on the purification method employed and today it is accepted that these differences may actually reflect in vivo differences (4Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In most cases, the differences have been found to be in the ancillary factors and components of the mediator/coactivator complexes. Until recently, the core RNA polymerase II was considered an integral part of all holoenzymes. Since then it has been reported that subunits Rpb3 and Rpb5 of the yeast core polymerase actually affect the activation of subsets of genes showing that core subunits of the RNA polymerase II can have regulatory roles. Core RNA polymerase II subunits may determine the composition of the holoenzyme, probably through the interactions with other components, in turn affecting the activation of a subset of genes. As reported here, Rpb4 falls into the category of those core subunits, which affect activation of a subset of genes. Choder et al.(15Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have shown that rpb4Δ is defective in stress response based on its inability to survive under extreme temperatures and in stationary phase. Brendel and Karlin (37Brendel V. Karlin S. Comput. Chem. 1994; 18: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) have proposed that Rpb4 may have activator-like features based on sequence analysis. Edwardset al. (10Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing PGAL1 as a test promoter had reported almost a decade ago that in vitro, the Rpb4-Rpb7 subcomplex affects promoter-dependent initiation whereas Rosenheck and Choder (38Rosenheck S. Choder M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Rpb4 somehow allows RNA polymerase II to transcribe at extreme temperatures in vitro. While this manuscript was in preparation, Tan et al. (39Tan Q. Li X. Sadhale P.P Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that Rpb4 is required for basal transcription inin vitro assays whereas in vivo studies show that basal and activated transcription are both defective. Our in vivo results show that the constitutive promoters are not significantly affected in the absence of RPB4 (Fig.1 a). We have clearly shown using both promoter β-galactosidase fusions and Northern analyses of steady-state levels of endogenous transcripts that the absence of RPB4 affects many if not all of the activated transcription units tested (Fig.1 b). The only activated promoter tested that is not defective in the absence of RPB4 is PCUP1 (Fig.1, c and d). This promoter is also known to be one of the few yeast promoters that does not require the holoenzyme for activation suggesting that the CUP1 gene is activated by alternative mechanisms (40Lee D. Lis J.T. Nature. 1998; 393: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 41McNeil J.B. Agah H. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2510-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not entirely surprising that Rpb4 is dispensable for activation of CUP1. The activation defect is also shown by a nonsense mutant lacking a small, highly conserved 24-amino acid stretch at the C terminus of the protein. Several investigators have reported that Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits form a subcomplex. The close proximity of these two proteins within the core polymerase has been demonstrated using electron microscopic analysis of crystals of RNA polymerase II (42Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our own studies earlier showed that overexpression of its interacting partner, RPB7, compensates for the lack of RPB4 in the temperature sensitivity assay suggesting that one of the functions of Rpb4 is to stabilize the interaction of Rpb7 with the rest of the polymerase (12Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Genet. 1999; 78: 149-156Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rpb7 has also been identified by Tan et al. (39Tan Q. Li X. Sadhale P.P Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a multicopy suppressor of temperature sensitivity of rpb4Δ. It also partially restored the steady-state levels of transcripts from various non-heat shock genes whose expression was affected inrpb4Δ. However, in our studies using promoter-reporter fusions, we do not find a similar rescue. This difference implies that Rpb7 overexpression increases the steady-state levels of transcripts, probably through a post-transcriptional effect. Sro9p another suppressor reported by Tan et al. (39Tan Q. Li X. Sadhale P.P Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has also been shown to rescue rpb4Δ by increasing mRNA stability. That the overexpression of RPB7 rescues the HSE activity is in accordance with the above result, and similar observations reported by others (Fig. 2) (12Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Genet. 1999; 78: 149-156Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Sheffer A. Varon M. Choder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the two subunits may have different roles in expression of stress and non-stress-related genes. To investigate further the role of RPB4 in activation of transcription, we decided to test if the defect in activation is because of defective interaction, either direct or indirect, with some of the activators. In either case, then excess of transcriptional activator may be able to rescue the defect. It was indeed seen that overexpression of the cognate activators partially rescued activation from the corresponding promoters. Overexpression of Gal4 results in relatively high levels of transcription under non-induced conditions. This is most likely because of the fact that the constitutively expressed Gal4 is present in excess over the negative regulator Gal80 thereby releasing active Gal4 even under non-inducing conditions (31Yocum R.R. Hanley S. West Jr., R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The fact that under inducing conditions the level of transcription is significantly higher than under non-inducing conditions suggests that the overexpression is indeed rescuing activated transcription even in the absence of Rpb4. The human homolog of Rpb7 has been shown to interact directly with transcriptional activators (8Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have seen that activators do not interact directly with Rpb4 even though their overexpression rescues the transcriptional activation defect ofrpb4Δ. The effect of Rpb4 on activation is probably mediated through other proteins. Previous reports show that transcriptional activation in the absence of true activators is possible if one tethers TBP to a strong DNA binding domain and recruits it to the promoter (33Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Klages N. Strubin M. Nature. 1995; 374: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In vivo, TBP occupancy at promoters increases on activation of the gene (35Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,36Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These reports have suggested that at least one of the ways in which activators function is by increasing the recruitment of the holoenzyme to the promoter. Because we find that the tethered TBP was ineffective in activation in the absence of RPB4, we conclude that the holoenzyme recruitment through tethering of TBP is not sufficient for activation in the absence of this subunit. In summary, our results show that RPB4 plays an important role in activation of a subset of genes in the model eukaryote, S. cerevisiae. This function is not shared directly by its interacting partner, Rpb7. We thank Drs. E. Golemis, U. Vijayraghavan, L. Nover, J. Bhat, S. Chavez, and T.

The data show that βVLDL activates rabbit smooth muscle cell ERK1/ERK2. Interestingly, ERK1/ERK2 activation is mediated by G protein-coupled receptors that transactivate the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. βVLDL-induced MAP kinase activation depends on Ras and Src activity as well as protein kinase C. The inhibition of lysosomal degradation of βVLDL has no effect on ERK1/ERK2 activation. The contribution of βVLDL-induced activation of ERK1/ERK2 to smooth muscle cell proliferation was also explored. βVLDL induces expression of egr-1 and c-fos mRNA. Despite its ability to stimulate early gene expression, βVLDL alone is unable to inspire quiescent cells into S phase. When added in conjunction with EGF, however, stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and an increase in histone gene expression are observed. Moreover, βVLDL plus EGF synergistically induce cyclin D1 expression and down-regulate p27KIP1 expression. The addition of either βVLDL or EGF stimulates a robust activation of ERK1/ERK2, but the addition of both agents simultaneously sustains the activation for a longer time period.

Interestingly, it has been shown that the activation of MAP kinase can induce not only cell proliferation but differentiation as well, highlighting the importance of measuring biological responses downstream of MAP kinase activation (26Heasley L.E.

The MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 (p44MAPK and p42MAPK, respectively) are stimulated in pathways initiated by extracellular stimuli that activate receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or nontyrosine kinase receptors including G protein-coupled receptors. Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor can activate Ras, commencing the Raf-1→MAP kinase kinase (MEK)→MAP kinase cascade. Pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors such as those for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), thrombin, and α2-adrenergic agonists stimulate the MAP kinase pathway by Gi-mediated Ras activation as shown in Rat-1 cells (31Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPA-mediated activation of MAP kinase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive transactivation of the EGF receptor has also been described (32Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 33Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Standley T. Turkson J. Kraker A.J. Fry D.W. Jove R. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14468-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and Ras-independent activation of MAP kinase through protein kinase C has been noted (34Force T. Bonventre J.V. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although lipoproteins have been shown to activate MAP kinases, the molecular events upstream of MAP kinases leading to their activation remain uncertain. Moreover, the possibility that the atherogenic lipoprotein βVLDL activates MAP kinases has not been explored. We sought to determine whether βVLDL activates MAP kinase and, if so, what the targets upstream of MAP kinase might be. Interestingly, the data show that βVLDL activates the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 via a G protein-coupled receptor that transactivates the EGF receptor, is Ras- and Src-dependent, and involves protein kinase C. Additional experiments examining the effect of βVLDL on the proliferation of quiescent aortic smooth muscle cells showed that despite its ability to activate MAP kinase, βVLDL alone does not stimulate quiescent cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle. In combination with EGF, however, serum-deprived aortic smooth muscle cells enter S phase. Moreover, the stimulation of proliferation is mediated through a sustained activation of MAP kinase. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that a lipoprotein can transactivate the EGF receptor via activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor. Neonatal rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated as described previously (14Schreiber B.M. Jones H.V. Toselli P. Franzblau C.

Jones H.V. Toselli P. Franzblau C. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 95: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Neonatal rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After an overnight incubation, the cultures were washed twice with Puck's saline and then incubated in DMEM containing 0.5–1% FBS for 3 days, at which time the cells were treated with βVLDL, EGF (Sigma), LPA (Sigma), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Life Technologies, Inc.), phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Sigma), or FBS as indicated. Pretreatment with the following inhibitors was also implemented: PD98059 (MEK inhibitor; Calbiochem), AG1478 (EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Calbiochem), pertussis toxin (G protein-coupled receptor inhibitor; List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA), bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C inhibitor; Calbiochem), calphostin C (protein kinase C inhibitor; Calbiochem), or PP2 (specific Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Calbiochem). In addition, the cells pretreated with chloroquine prior to the addition of βVLDL were studied (see below). Total cell protein was isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against the active phosphorylated forms of ERK1/ERK2 or total ERK1/ERK2 (see below). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with an antibody against the EGF receptor followed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then lysed in protein extraction buffer (25 mm Tris Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge) at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) according to manufacturer instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of protein (∼30 µg/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). Stacking gels contained 4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1) and separating gels contained either 8% (for immunoprecipitated EGF receptor) or 12% (all other Westerns) acrylamide/bisacrylamide. Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V in running buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS). The samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) using transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 39 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C with constant stirring. After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were equilibrated in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 min at room temperature and blocked with TBST containing 4% nonfat dry milk (Nestle Foods, Glendale, CA) for 1 h. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies that were diluted in TBST containing 4% milk. After washing twice with TBST containing 4% milk for 10 min, horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted in TBST containing 4% milk (1:1000) was applied for 1 h. The blots were washed once with TBST containing 4% milk for 10 min and then twice with TBST for 10 min. Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer instructions. The primary antibodies (diluted 1:1000) used included mouse monoclonal antibodies against the active forms of ERK1/ERK2 (New England Biolabs) as well as phosphotyrosine, Ras, cyclin D1, and p27KIP1 antibodies from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and a rabbit immunoaffinity-purified IgG that recognizes all forms (active as well as inactive) of ERK1/ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated on ice for 10 min with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge, 4 °C for 10 min) to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA method. Five hundred micrograms of protein were incubated with 1 µg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of the EGF receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-conjugated agarose beads overnight with constant shaking at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and half of each sample was subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine. Quiescent smooth muscle cells were incubated with βVLDL in the presence or absence of chloroquine. All cells received [14C]oleic acid complexed to albumin (0.43 µCi/ml) and were incubated for 24 h. Lipids were extracted and [14C]cholesteryl oleate accumulation was analyzed by thin layer chromatography essentially as described (14Schreiber B.M. Jones H.V. Toselli P. Franzblau C. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 95: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data are expressed as nmol of [14C]cholesteryl oleate/mg of protein. DNA restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase I large fragment (Klenow), and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. The dominant negative ras mutant (ras-17N prepared by Feig and Cooper (36Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Debabrata Mukhopadhyay, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA) was precut with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into pBPST-4 (see below) that was digested with EcoRI andBamHI. lacZ was also ligated into pBPST-4. Theras-17N- and β-galactosidase-expressing vectors are referred to as pBPST-Ras-17N and pBPST-lacZ, respectively. The pBST-4 expression plasmid was generated originally to make stable transfectants and incorporates a tetracycline (tet)-inducible system as shown previously by Paulus et al. (37Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies showed that expression levels in transient transfections were so high that experiments were performed on transiently transfected cultures, and thus the inducible nature of the vector was not taken advantage of in these studies. A tet-inducible retroviral vector was constructed from the tet-inducible expression system containing two plasmids, pUHD15–1 and pUHD10–3 (38Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar), and the puromycin resistance gene (puro), which was isolated from pBabe-puro (39Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) withHindIII and ClaI, and then blunt-ended with the Klenow enzyme. The puro fragment was inserted in a sense orientation by blunt-end ligation into the pBabe-puro that was precut withBamHI and SalI to make plasmid pBabe-puro-puro. The puro gene in pBabe-puro-puro was removed withHindIII and ClaI and replaced with the following fragment containing HindIII, SnaBI, andClaI restriction sites to create plasmid pBPS-SnaBI: 5′-AGCTTTACGTAAT-3′ and 3′-AATGCATTAGC-5′. The pBPS-SnaBI was cut with SnaBI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and then ligated with the tet-regulated transcription activator (tTA) gene, which was isolated from pUHD15–1 with EcoRI andBamHI and blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme. The new plasmid was named pBPST. To generate pBPST-4, a 0.88-kb fragment containing the tet-inducible promoter tetO-CMV was extracted from pUHD10–3 withHinpI I and inserted in reverse orientation to the internal SV40 promoter into pBPST, which was digested with ClaI. Transfection was performed using Effectene transfection reagent according to manufacturer instructions (Qiagen). Briefly, smooth muscle cells were seeded at a density of 5.2 × 103 cells/well. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed and incubated in 0.9 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS for 2–4 h. For each transfection, 0.8 µg of DNA (pBPST-Ras-17N or pBPST-lacZ) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h, at which time the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with Puck's saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. The cells were then control-treated or treated with bFGF, EGF, LPA, or βVLDL for 5 min. Total cell protein was isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against Ras and the active forms of ERK1/ERK2. To examine the transfection efficiency, the cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and incubated in 50 mmferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside (Sigma) in PBS at 37 °C overnight. The percentage of stained (β-galactosidase-positive) cells was evaluated. Quiescent smooth muscle cells were treated with βVLDL, EGF (Sigma), βVLDL plus EGF, or FBS for the indicated time. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis to measure the steady-state levels of expression of egr-1, c-fos, and histoneH2B (see below). DNA synthesis was measured by labeling cells with [3H]thymidine and evaluating its incorporation into DNA and the percentage of radiolabeled nuclei (see below). In some cases, cells were pretreated in the absence or presence of the following inhibitors prior to the addition of reagents: PD98059, bisindolylmaleimide I, AG1478, or pertussis toxin. Total cellular RNA was extracted, and Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (15Schreiber B.M. Jones H.V. Franzblau C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA were loaded onto each lane. Equal loading was evaluated by ethidium bromide staining (data not shown). After transfer, the blots were hybridized with a denatured DNA probe that was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6 × 103 Ci/mmol; DuPont) by the random-primed method using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment according to manufacturer instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Blots were exposed to film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. Blots were probed for histoneH2B, rat egr-1, which was provided kindly by Dr. Vikas Sukhatme of Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) (40Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.M. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), and mouse c-fos cDNA, which was provided kindly by Dr. Michael Karin of the University of California San Diego (La Jolla, CA) (41Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Cells plated into 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates were treated as described above; once rendered quiescent, the cells were incubated with reagents for 20 h, at which time the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM. The cells were radiolabeled for 4 h with 100 µl of [methyl-3H]thymidine (20 µCi/ml, 5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in serum-free DMEM. Cells were harvested, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was assessed as described previously (15Schreiber B.M. Jones H.V. Franzblau C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells similarly treated in 6-well trays were evaluated for the percentage of radiolabeled nuclei as follows: the [3H]thymidine-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and then fixed for 2 min with 100% methanol. The cells were exposed to a photographic emulsion (1:1 Kodak NBT-2/H2O; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 3 days at room temperature in the dark, at which time the radiolabeled nuclei were visualized after counterstaining of the cells with hematoxylin. The percentage of radiolabeled nuclei was determined by counting both positive and negative nuclei and expressing the number of positives as a percentage of the total. To determine whether βVLDL activates MAP kinase, the phosphorylation of MAP kinase isoforms ERK1/ERK2 was monitored in neonatal rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. Fig. 1 a shows that βVLDL activated ERK1/ERK2 in a dose-responsive fashion at concentrations ranging from 3–100 µg/ml βVLDL. Total levels of ERK1/ERK2 were similar in control as well as βVLDL-treated samples (Fig. 1 b). At a concentration of 30 µg/ml, βVLDL induced a time-dependent activation of ERK1/ERK2 with a maximal response noted after 5 min in the presence of the lipoprotein (Fig.1 c). Phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 began to decrease at 15 min and returned to baseline more than 6 h later. To determine whether βVLDL-induced MAP kinase activation is mediated through the classical MAP kinase cascade, PD98059, a MEK-specific inhibitor, was used. The data in Fig. 1 d show that pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 (20 µm) for 30 min blocked baseline activity and completely blocked the βVLDL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2. To analyze the contribution of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins to the βVLDL-induced MAP kinase activation, the effect of pertussis toxin on the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 by βVLDL was examined. The data in Fig. 2 a show that pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 24 h inactivated pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors as evidenced by a loss of LPA-induced MAP kinase activation. As expected, the activation by EGF was unaffected by pertussis toxin treatment. Interestingly, the data clearly show that the βVLDL-induced activation of MAP kinase is mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, because its effect was diminished by the addition by pertussis toxin. In a preliminary study, Western blot analysis of βVLDL-treated cells was performed using an antibody against phosphotyrosine residues. The data (not shown) suggested that a 170-kDa protein was phosphorylated in response to βVLDL. The EGF receptor is 170 kDa and has been shown to be transactivated by LPA (32Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). To determine directly whether βVLDL activated the EGF receptor, AG1478, a specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used. The cells were pretreated with the inhibitor,"
https://openalex.org/W2027658259,"Bacteriophage T4 RNase H belongs to a family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleases that remove RNA primers from lagging strand fragments during DNA replication. Each enzyme has a flap endonuclease activity, cutting at or near the junction between single- and double-stranded DNA, and a 5′- to 3′-exonuclease, degrading both RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA duplexes. On model substrates for lagging strand synthesis, T4 RNase H functions as an exonuclease removing short oligonucleotides, rather than as an endonuclease removing longer flaps created by the advancing polymerase. The combined length of the DNA oligonucleotides released from each fragment ranges from 3 to 30 nucleotides, which corresponds to one round of processive degradation by T4 RNase H with 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein present. Approximately 30 nucleotides are removed from each fragment during coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis with the complete T4 replication system. We conclude that the presence of 32 protein on the single-stranded DNA between lagging strand fragments guarantees that the nuclease will degrade processively, removing adjacent DNA as well as the RNA primers, and that the difference in the relative rates of synthesis and hydrolysis ensures that there is usually only a single round of degradation during each lagging strand cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2133778786,"Ionizing radiation (IR) has been shown to induce apoptosis to a greater extent in a fibroblast cell line AT5BIVA derived from an individual with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) than in control fibroblasts. However, the signaling pathway that underlies IR-induced apoptosis in AT cells has remained unknown. The mechanism of apoptosis in response to γ-irradiation has now been examined in three AT fibroblast lines (AT3BIVA, AT4BIVA, and AT5BIVA) derived from different individuals with AT. The apoptotic indexes of these cell lines at 72 h after irradiation were 12, 31, and 35%, respectively, compared with a value of 2.3% for control fibroblasts. Immunoblot analysis and fluorometric assays revealed that the extents of IR-induced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were markedly greater in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells than in AT3BIVA and control cells. Furthermore, the basal abundance of the apoptotic inhibitor, a cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (c-IAP-1), was markedly reduced in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells compared with that in AT3BIVA and control cells. The overexpression of either caspase-9 mutant forms or recombinant c-IAP-1 in AT5BIVA cells inhibited the IR-induced activation of caspases-3 and 9 and reduced the apoptotic index of the irradiated cells. These results indicate that the extent of IR-induced apoptosis in different AT cell lines is inversely related to the abundance of c-IAP-1 and directly related to the extent of activation of caspases-3 and 9.

The principal effectors of apoptosis in mammalian cells are members of a family of cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases known as caspases (5Nicholson D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Several caspases have been isolated from human cells and characterized as cell type-specific and stimulus-dependent (6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Each caspase is synthesized as an inactive precursor (zymogen) that is converted by proteolytic cleavage to an active heterodimer when cells are exposed to a variety of insults (7Srinivasula S.

Once activated, caspases cleave a host of cellular substrates, resulting in the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation and condensation of cellular organelles (9Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). The characterization of the regulation of various caspases in mammalian cells has led to the definition of two distinct apoptotic signaling pathways (10Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). In one of these pathways, procaspase-8 is recruited by the cytosolic domains of members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (11Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Beyaert R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Such recruitment results in the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8, and the activated enzyme then induces the activation of downstream effector caspases, such as caspases-3, 6, and 7 (7Srinivasula S.

Both the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the protein ATM encoded by the gene mutated in individuals with AT contribute to IR-induced cell death (24Meyn M.S. Strasfeld L. Allen C. Int. J. Radiat.

We have previously shown that the apoptotic index of AT5BIVA cells, a cell line derived from an individual with AT, is increased by γ-irradiation to a greater extent than that of control cells (23Jung M. Zhang Y. Dimtchev A. Dritschilo A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With the use of additional AT cell lines each derived from a different individual with AT, we have now shown that IR-induced apoptosis in these cells is mediated by a series of events that include the activation of caspases-3 and 9. Furthermore, our data suggest that a deficiency of c-IAP-1 may contribute to IR-induced programmed cell death in AT fibroblasts. AT5BIVA fibroblasts were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Bethesda, MD). AT3BIVA, AT4BIVA, and MRC5CV1 (normal fibroblasts) were kindly provided by C. Arlett (University of Sussex, Brighton, UK). The AT and MRC5CV1 cells are immortalized as a result of the expression of SV40 large T-antigen. AT5BIVA/C9DN and /C9Mut were transfected with plasmid DNA containing a dominant negative form (28Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Guo Y. Zhan Y. Lazebnik Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 999-1002PubMed Google Scholar) and the active site mutant (C287A) of caspase-9 (29Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol.

Both plasmid vectors containing either a dominant negative form or an active site mutant on C287A of caspase-9 cDNA were generously provided by Dr. Emad Alnemri at Thomas Jefferson University (Philadelphia, PA). AT5BIVA-c-IAP-1/CL3 cells were isolated as a G418-resistant clone (400 µg/ml) after stable transfection of AT5BIVA cells with a plasmid (pCMV-c-IAP-1N) containing the cDNA for a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged NH2-terminal fragment (residues 1–342) of human c-IAP-1 (15Roy N.

Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml of streptomycin, 100 µg/ml of penicillin, and either 10 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum for MRC5CV1 cells or 10 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 µg/ml of hydrocortisone, and 20% fetal bovine serum for AT cells. They were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. All cell lines were determined to be free of mycoplasma infection by testing at three-month intervals. Adherent and floating cells were collected at various times after exposure to 5 Gy of γ-radiation. The apoptotic index was determined morphologically by staining cells with acridine orange and ethidium bromide, counting the number of apoptotic cells (those with condensed chromosomes or fragmented nuclei) with a fluorescence microscope and expressing their number as a percentage of the total number of cells (23Jung M. Zhang Y. Dimtchev A. Dritschilo A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106) were collected at various times after irradiation and subjected to four cycles of freezing and thawing in 300 µl of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 µm cytochalasin B, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml of leupeptin, 1 µg/ml of pepstatin A, and 10 µg/ml of aprotinin. The resulting cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were stored in −80 °C until use. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described (31Han Z. Li G. Bremner T.A. Lange T.S. Zhang G. Jemmerson R. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (5 × 107) were incubated for 10 min on ice in 0.2 ml of a lysis buffer containing 10 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain each at 50 µg/ml. They were then subjected to six passages through a syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle. The resulting lysate was mixed with 1.25 ml of the same lysis buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose. The mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the nuclei, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet and supernatant from this second centrifugation were stored at −80 °C as the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, respectively. Cell lysates (20 µg of protein) or mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (50 µg of protein) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Enzyme Synthesis, Dublin, CA), to caspases-3 and 9, cytochrome c, Bcl-2 or Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or to c-IAP-1 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal loading and transfer of proteins among lanes were verified by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to actin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by staining the membrane with Ponceau S. The activities of caspases-3, 8, and 9 were assayed fluorometrically with specific fluorogenic substrates: MOCAc-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Ala-Pro-Lys(DNP)-NH2(Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan), Ac-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-MCA (Peptide Institute), and Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFC (Calbiochem), respectively. Cell extracts (60 µg of protein) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 600 nm substrate in a reaction mixture (500 µl) containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, and 50 µg/ml of creatine kinase. The fluorescence of the cleaved substrates was measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer at excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, of 328 and 393 nm for MOCAc-DEVDAPK(DNP)-NH2, 380 and 460 nm for Ac-IETD-MCA, and 400 and 505 nm for Ac-LEHD-AFC. Caspase activities did not differ substantially among the AT and control cell lines under basal conditions. We have previously shown that γ-radiation induces a markedly greater increase in the apoptotic index of AT5BIVA cells than it does in that of control MRC5CV1 cells (23Jung M. Zhang Y. Dimtchev A. Dritschilo A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the effects of IR on the apoptotic index of two additional AT fibroblast lines, AT3BIVA and AT4BIVA. Apoptotic cells were apparent within 24 h after irradiation of AT3BIVA, AT4BIVA, and AT5BIVA fibroblasts, although the apoptotic index varied. At 72 h after irradiation, the apoptotic indexes of AT4BIVA (31%) and AT5BIVA (35%) cells were similar to each other and markedly greater than that of AT3BIVA cells (12%) (Fig. 1 a), suggesting differences in the cell death programs among these AT cell lines. The apoptotic index of MRC5CV1 cells 72 h after irradiation was only 2.3%. Various proteins that contribute to the maintenance of cellular integrity are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. For example, the nuclear enzyme PARP, which plays an important role in the repair of DNA damage and in the maintenance of genomic integrity (32Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufman S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar), is specifically cleaved between its NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain and its multifunctional COOH-terminal domain by caspase-3 or caspase-3-like proteases early during the execution phase of apoptosis (9Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Therefore, we monitored the amounts of PARP after exposure of AT and control cells to IR. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of intact PARP (116 kDa) in all untreated cells (Fig. 1 b). A cleavage product of PARP (89 kDa) appeared within 24–48 h after irradiation in AT5BIVA and AT4BIVA cells but not in AT3BIVA or control cells, correlating with the effects of IR on the apoptotic indexes of these cells. These observations suggest the importance of caspase-3 as a downstream protease responsible for the cleavage of PARP during IR-induced apoptosis in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells. In addition, the abundance of intact PARP gradually increased after the exposure of AT3BIVA and AT4BIVA cell lines to IR. We also measured the activities of caspases-1, 3, 6, and 8 in cell extracts prepared from AT and control cells at various times after irradiation. Fluorometric determination of the cleavage of specific fluorogenic peptide substrates revealed little activity of caspases-1, 6, and 8 (data not shown), but a marked increase in caspase-3 activity in AT5BIVA and AT4BIVA cells that was apparent at 24 h and maximal at 48 h after exposure to IR (Fig. 1 c). In contrast, only a small increase in caspase-3 activity was apparent in AT3BIVA or MRC5CV1 cells by 72 h after irradiation. Immunoblot analysis also revealed that the time course of the conversion of procaspase-3 to the active protease in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells was consistent with the results obtained with the fluorometric activity assay (Fig.1 d). Also consistent with the activity data, the cleavage of procaspase-3 was not detected in AT3BIVA and control cells up to 72 h after irradiation. We next examined the effects of γ-irradiation on the activity of caspase-9 in AT and control cells. Fluorometric assay revealed that IR induced a marked time-dependent increase in caspase-9 activity that was apparent as early as 24 h after irradiation in both AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 2 a). In contrast, the activity of caspase-9 was increased only slightly by IR in AT3BIVA and MRC5CV1 cells. These results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the conversion of procaspase-9 to the active enzyme. Thus, whereas IR induced the proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 to active caspase-9 in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells, no such effect was apparent in AT3BIVA or control cells (Fig. 2 b). IR did not induce the cleavage of procaspase-8 in any of the four cell lines examined (data not shown). Taken together, these data implicated caspases-3 and 9 as effectors of IR-induced apoptosis in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells. To determine a causal relationship between caspase-9 and 3 activities, AT5BIVA cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing either a dominant negative form, which is an alternatively spliced isoform and lacks the central large subunit caspase domain (28Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Guo Y. Zhan Y. Lazebnik Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 999-1002PubMed Google Scholar), or the active site mutant (C287A) form of caspase-9 cDNA (29Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were exposed to IR and harvested at indicated intervals. As shown in Fig. 3, in the expression of either mutant form of caspase-9, the apoptotic index was significantly reduced (∼50%) within 48 h after irradiation (Fig. 3 a). Both caspase-9 and 3 activities were also markedly inhibited as well (Fig. 3, b and c); however, the vector alone did not modify the IR-induced apoptotic index and caspases-9 and 3 activities. These data show that the inhibition of caspase-9 activity attenuates a cellular apoptotic response and the activation of caspase-3, supporting caspase-9 as an upstream effector of caspase-3. In turn, caspase-9 inhibition reduced caspase-3 activity. This observation is consistent with recent reports suggesting that caspase-9 can initiate a caspase-cascade involving caspase-3 (28Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Guo Y. Zhan Y. Lazebnik Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 999-1002PubMed Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol.

The role of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in the IR-induced death of AT cells was examined by immunoblot analysis of the abundance of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, and of Bax, an effector of this pathway, in a mitochondrial fraction. These proteins regulate apoptosis by controlling the release of cytochromec from mitochondria (13Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4276) Google Scholar, 14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). The basal amounts of Bax and of Bcl-2 did not differ markedly among the three AT cell lines, although the abundance of these proteins in the AT cells was greater than that in MRC5CV1 cells (Fig.4). The abundance of Bax in the mitochondrial fraction of AT cells but not in that of control cells was increased 48 h after irradiation (Fig. 4 a). In contrast, the amount of Bcl-2 in the AT cell lines but not that in control cells was decreased 48 h after irradiation (Fig.4 b). We next examined whether the IR-induced activation of caspase-9 in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells is mediated by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. A cytosolic fraction was prepared from irradiated cells under conditions that maintain the integrity of mitochondria (31Han Z. Li G. Bremner T.A. Lange T.S. Zhang G. Jemmerson R. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of this fraction revealed that the basal amounts of cytochrome c in AT cells were similar to each other and greater than that in control cells (data not shown). The amount of cytochrome c released from mitochondria into the cytosol was markedly increased within 24–48 h after irradiation of AT4BIVA or AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, cytochrome oxidase (subunit II), which was assayed as a mitochondrial marker protein, was undetectable in the cytosolic fractions prepared from these cell lines before or after irradiation (data not shown) confirming that the presence of cytochromec in the cytosol was not simply attributable to contamination by mitochondria. Together, these data suggest that IR-induced apoptosis in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells is mediated, at least in part, by the mitochondrial-signaling pathway. The activation of caspase-9 in the mitochondrial-signaling pathway of apoptosis is inhibited by c-IAP proteins (10Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M.

To investigate the role of c-IAP-1 and c-IAP-2 in IR-induced apoptosis in AT cells, we determined the effects of γ-irradiation on the abundance of these proteins. The basal amounts of c-IAP-1 in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells were substantially smaller than those in AT3BIVA or control cells (Fig.6 a). Densitometric analysis revealed that the abundance of c-IAP-1 in AT4BIVA, AT3BIVA, and control cells was 2, 6, and 8 times, respectively, that in AT5BIVA cells. The amount of c-IAP-1 was not affected by IR in any of the four cell lines examined (data not shown). Furthermore, c-IAP-2 was expressed at only a low level in the AT and control cell lines (data not shown). To further investigate the role of c-IAP-1 in IR-induced apoptosis in AT5BIVA cells, which exhibited the highest apoptotic index in response to IR as well as the lowest abundance of c-IAP-1, we transfected these cells with a plasmid encoding an hemagglutinin-tagged fragment of human c-IAP (residues 1–342) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. After G418 selection and subcloning, one G418-resistant clone (AT5BIVA-c-IAP-1/CL3) that overexpressed hemagglutinin-tagged c-IAP-1 (Fig. 6 b) was subjected to further analysis. The extent of IR-induced apoptosis (as reflected by the apoptotic index) in the transfected cells was reduced by ∼50% compared with that observed in the parental AT5BIVA cells (data not shown). The extent of IR-induced cleavage of PARP was also reduced in AT5BIVA-c-IAP-1/CL3 cells (Fig.7 a). Furthermore, fluorometric assays revealed that the IR-induced increases in the activities of caspase-3 (Fig. 7 b) and caspase-9 (Fig. 7 c) were substantially reduced in the transfected cells compared with those apparent in the parental cells. These data suggest that c-IAP-1 inhibits the activation of caspases-3 and 9, and that the abundance of this protein is a critical factor in determining the extent of IR-induced apoptosis in AT cells. Apoptotic cell death is one response to the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. We previously showed that radiosensitive AT5BIVA cells undergo apoptosis in response to γ-irradiation (23Jung M. Zhang Y. Dimtchev A. Dritschilo A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the apoptotic index differs among three AT cell lines after exposure to IR. Furthermore, IR-induced apoptotic signaling in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells that showed the highest apoptotic indexes appears to be mediated by the release of mitochondrial cytochromec and the activation of caspases-9 and 3. The IR-induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol in these two AT cell lines coincided with a decrease in the abundance of Bcl-2. The basal intracellular concentration of c-IAP-1 in AT and control cell lines also appeared to be inversely related to the apoptotic index after exposure to IR, suggesting a role for c-IAP-1 in limiting the extent of caspase-9 activation and apoptosis in these cells. This conclusion was supported by the observation that overexpression of mutant caspase-9 and c-IAP-1 in AT5BIVA cells reduced the extent of apoptosis as well as that of caspase-9 activation in response to γ-irradiation. The activation of caspases is reflected in the proteolysis of intracellular proteins associated with cellular integrity. PARP is a major substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis. We have now shown that the extent of IR-induced cleavage of PARP is consistent with the apoptotic index of AT and control cells, indicating the importance of caspase-3 as a downstream protease during IR-induced apoptosis in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells. The mechanism and role of the IR-induced increase in the abundance of PARP that are also apparent in AT3BIVA and AT4BIVA cell lines examined remain unknown. The activation of caspase-9 is mediated by a mitochondrial signaling that involves the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3 (12Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4461) Google Scholar, 13Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Using dominant negative and active site mutant forms of caspase-9, we demonstrate that caspase-9 is involved in IR-induced apoptotic signaling and activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, the amount of cytochrome c in the cytosol of AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells was markedly increased by exposure to IR. The basal abundance of cytochrome c in the cytosol of AT cells was greater than that apparent in control cells, which possibly contributes to cell death, results from the impairment in mechanisms that protect against oxidative stress in AT cells (37Watters D. Kedar P. Spring K. Bjorkman J. Chen P. Gatei M. Birrell G. Garrone B. Srinivasa P. Crane D.I. Lavin M.F. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that IR-induced apoptosis in AT fibroblasts is mediated by this mitochondrial-signaling pathway involving cytochrome c release and the activation of caspases-9 and 3. The ratio between the amounts of the proapoptotic Bax and the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 is an important determinant of cell survivalversus cell death (39Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Natsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).

IR induced an increase in the amount of Bax and a decrease in the abundance of Bcl-2 in the AT cell lines examined, suggesting that this change in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio contributes to the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and apoptosis in these AT cells. Furthermore, the basal abundance of c-IAP-1 in AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA cells was less than that apparent in AT3BIVA and control cells, consistent with the differences in the apoptotic indexes among these cells and the fact that the abundance of c-IAP is a critical factor in the apoptotic process (20Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). The overexpression of c-IAP-1 in AT5BIVA cells resulted in a marked inhibition of IR-induced apoptosis, PARP cleavage, and an activation of caspase-9, suggesting that the low concentration of c-IAP-1 in AT5BIVA cells contribute to their high sensitivity to IR. These data are consistent with observations by other laboratories demonstrating that IAPs directly or indirectly inhibit the activation of caspases-3, 7, and 9, and that the endogenous threshold level of the IAPs is correlated with cellular sensitivities to apoptosis inducing stimuli in various cell types (10Deveraux Q.L.

In summary, the apoptotic index was shown to differ markedly among three AT fibroblast lines after exposure to γ-radiation being greatest in the AT4BIVA and AT5BIVA lines. Apoptosis in these cells appeared to be mediated by the mitochondrial-signaling pathway involving the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and the activation of caspases-9 and 3. A reduced abundance of c-IAP in these two AT cell lines appeared to be a critical factor in their increased susceptibility to IR-induced apoptosis. Different mutations in the atm gene thus may contribute to the variation in the response of the three AT fibroblast lines examined to IR. We thank Drs. Emad S. Alnemri and Srinivasa Srinivasula at Thomas Jefferson University for providing vectors containing mutant forms of caspase-9, J. Tuturea for technical assistance, and E.

https://openalex.org/W2063473132,"A protein (SNP70) has been isolated that binds to the Src homology domain 3 of p47phox, p85α, and c-src. Cloning and sequencing of the polypeptide revealed it to be a 70-kDa protein that has a number of potential domains, including Src homology 3 binding motifs and several nuclear localization signals. Immunofluorescence using anti-peptide antibodies revealed SNP70 to be primarily concentrated in the nucleus but excluded from nucleoli, in interphase cells. However, it was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in dividing cells. Extraction and subfractionation experiments indicated that SNP70 did not bind directly to DNA but did bind to poly(G)-rich oligonucleotides and was resistant to extraction with non-ionic detergents but was solubilized by treatment with RNase, high salt, or ammonium sulfate. Double-immunofluorescence experiments showed that SNP70 co-localized with two pre-mRNA splicing factors SC35 and U2B“ within the nucleus. A population of SNP70 was found outside the nucleus, and double-immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that it associated with vimentin-containing intermediate filaments, particularly those surrounding the nucleus. The data suggest that SNP70 associates with nuclear or perinuclear filaments and may play a role in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing.

A number of modular domains have now been described that mediate these interactions, and sequence homologies have indicated that these domains are widespread in signaling molecules. Examples of domains that are responsible for intracellular associations of signaling molecules include pleckstrin homology (PH)1 domains, Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (1Cohen G.B.

PH domains are regions of about 100 amino acids, usually of low homology, that associate with small hydrophobic moieties such as inositol phospholipids, and it has been proposed that PH domains are a mechanism for targeting proteins to membranes (3Salim K.

Ligation of receptors at the cell surface results in the formation of complexes consisting of specific intracellular signaling molecules (9Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A.

NMR studies and x-ray crystallography have revealed detailed structures of a number of SH2 domains, and all consist of two anti-parallel β sheets surrounded by two α-helices, with the phosphotyrosine and +3 residue tightly bound to two pockets on the domain surface (12Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are regions of about 50–75 amino acids, which are also commonly found in signaling molecules, in cytoskeletal components, and in the phagocyte superoxide-forming complex, the NADPH oxidase. Many proteins that contain PH and SH2 domains also contain an SH3 domain, however, there are subsets of proteins that can have several permutations or multiples of these domains. SH3 domains bind to proline-rich sequences with a core motif of PXXP, where P are conserved proline residues and X are commonly aliphatic (13Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cichetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Although there is some promiscuity in the binding of some SH3 domains to different proline-rich motifs (14Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D.

All SH3 domain ligands adopt a type II polyproline helix conformation, and structural studies have shown that proline-rich motifs fall into two classes, which can bind to SH3 domains in either forward or reverse orientations (17Booker G.W.

The activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is regulated by the SH3 domain-mediated assembly of cytosolic components with a membrane protein complex containing a proline-rich SH3 domain binding site (25McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although it is well recognized that regulation of SH2 domain interactions occurs by phosphorylation, the regulation of SH3 domain interactions is less well understood and is probably at the level of conformational changes leading to masking or unmasking of the domain or its ligand. In an attempt to identify novel SH3-binding proteins that might be involved in intracellular signaling we have attempted to isolate SH3 domain-containing proteins from cells. This report describes the identification and cloning of a proline-rich, SH3 domain-binding protein that is localized to distinctive regions of both the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Glutathione-agarose beads were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. HEL, Namalwa, Jurkat, and U937 cells were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Flow Laboratories), and COS and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Imperial Laboratories) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All chemicals were Analar grade or better (BDH), and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. cDNA sequence encoding the SH3 domains of PLCγ1, p85α, c-src, n-src, c-fgr, p47phox, and p67phox as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated and used as described previously (15Finan P.M.

Constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, and expression of GST fusion proteins was performed as described previously (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Affinity matrices were prepared by immobilizing 25 µg of fusion protein on 50 µl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Cells were pelleted and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 75 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate was mixed with the GST-SH3 affinity matrices for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively in wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Binding proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and prepared for microsequencing as described previously (15Finan P.M. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O.

Biol. 1996; 261: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells were also lysed into lysis buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin) at 2 mg/ml for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and 0.4 mg of the soluble material was added to 50 µl of a 50% suspension of poly(G)-, poly(A)-, or poly(U)-agarose beads (Sigma) for 20 min. The beads were washed five times in lysis buffer B, and the beads were resuspended in Laemmli lysis buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In some cases the beads were pretreated with 10 µg of RNase for 10 min. A 100-kDa polypeptide that bound to the SH3 domains of p47phox was purified from 109 Namalwa cells by SH3 affinity chromatography as described above. The protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, identified by Coomassie Blue staining, excised, and digested with Lys-C in the gel slice. Peptides were extracted from the gel and separated by tandem ion exchange and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Hewlett-Packard 1090M and diode array detection system. Purified peptides were sequenced using fast cycle, automated Edman chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer, modified as described previously (27Totty N.F. Waterfield M.D. Hsuan J.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences obtained from microsequencing were used to search the dbEST data base. Clone 27176 (accession number R13685) matched peptide LDEMEFNPVQQPXLNEK and was obtained from the IMAGE consortium (28Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos N. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of clone 27176 was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer using the Taq dye terminator cycle sequencing kit. Analysis of the DNA sequence of clone 27176 revealed an open reading frame that contained all the peptide sequences obtained from microsequencing. The cDNA N-terminal to the open reading frame was obtained by 5′-PCR-RACE from human thymus cDNA (Marathon kit, CLONTECH). The extended open reading frame contained a methionine residue within the correct context for the initiation of translation (51Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). The PCR-derived cDNA and clone 27176 were ligated following digestion at a unique restriction site,EspI. For expression of SNP70 in COS7 cells, a cDNA encoding residues 2–641 was amplified by PCR from the full-length p100 cDNA using oligonucleotides containing anEcoRI site (5′-oligonucleotide) and NotI site (3′-oligonucleotide). An EcoRI-NotI-digested PCR fragment was subcloned into a pCDNA3 derivative, which had been modified to contain an Myc epitope (MEQKLISEEDL) followed by an in-frame EcoRI site. Expression of the Myc-tagged protein was driven from a cytomegalovirus promoter. The correct sequence of the Myc-tagged construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. COS7 cells were transfected by electroporation. GFP-tagged SNP70 was constructed using overlapping recombinant PCR. Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify the coding regions of SNP70 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH) so that a second PCR reaction enabled the in-frame gene fusion to be generated. A Kozak sequence was added to the 5′-translation start site of SNP70 to maximize expression. The SNP70-EGFP PCR product was cloned into the MSCVneo vector (CLONTECH) as anEcoRI-XhoI fragment, and the sequence was verified. Anti-peptide antibodies raised against the final 15 C-terminal residues from SNP70 were generated in rabbits and used for Western blotting from cell lysates. SDS-PAGE-separated proteins from 105 cells were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and, after blocking with 5% non-fat milk powder for 1 h, the filters were overlaid with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-SNP70 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. The filters were washed three times in PBS/Tween 20 and overlaid with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Bio-Rad). The bands were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Images were scanned using a Microtek Scanmaker II, densitometry was performed, and peaks were integrated using ScanAnalysis linked to an Apple Macintosh Quadra computer. MDCK cells were subjected to hypotonic shock for 5 min in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, plus 1 mm MgCl2 followed by Dounce homogenization in the presence of protease inhibitors (Mixture set III, Calbiochem). Centrifugation at 1000 × g produced a nuclear pellet, and centrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant at 100,000 ×g for 30 min produced a particulate pellet consisting mainly of the membranous components of the cells and a cytosolic supernatant. Cells were grown for 24 h on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka) in PBS for 10 min. After three washes in PBS the cells were permeabilized by immersion in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 5 min. Staining was performed by a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-SNP70 in PBS plus 2% BSA for 45 min, followed by a 1:100 dilution of FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig with three washes in PBS between antibodies. After an additional three washes in PBS the cells were mounted in Citifluor and viewed using a Zeiss axioplan microscope equipped with epifluorescence. In some experiments cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with Biovision digital confocal microscopy software (Improvision Ltd., Warwick, UK). Double-immunofluorescence was performed using monoclonal antibodies to the pre-mRNA splicing factors SC35 and U2B“ in combination with anti-SNP70 antibodies followed by a mix of FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig and TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig. The FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig and TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies were cross-absorbed against mouse Ig and rabbit Ig, respectively, to prevent cross-species Ig reactivity. The SNP70 full-length cDNA was cut out of the pCDNA3.1 myc-tagged vector using EcoRI and NotI (Life Technologies, Inc.), the 2-kb insert was gel-purified using a QIAquick kit (Qiagen) and radiolabeled to a specific activity of ∼2 × 109 dpm/mg using a RediPrime random prime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Multiple tissue Northern blot containing poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from various human tissues (CLONTECH) was prehybridized with RapidHyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 60 °C. The unincorporated nucleotides ([32P]dCTP) were removed using a nick spin column (Bio-Rad), and the denatured probe was added to the RapidHyb buffer. After overnight hybridization at 60 °C, the blot was washed at high stringency (twice in 2× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS for 20 min each and once in 0.1× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS for 20 min). The blot was exposed for 2 h at −70 °C using Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was subsequently stripped by adding boiling 1% (w/v) SDS and allowing to cool to room temperature. The stripping was confirmed by overnight autoradiography at −70 °C and re-probed using a RediPrime-labeled (as before) actin probe supplied with the Multiple tissue blot. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips, extracted with 0.5% Nonidet P40 in the presence of phalloidin and taxol (Sigma), and processed for immunoelectron microscopy essentially as described previously (29Lawson D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1891-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Fluka) and then preincubated in Tris saline containing 100 mmlysine, 2% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20, pH 8.0, for 20 min. After three further washes, the cells were labeled for 2 h with rabbit anti-SNP70 (1:100) followed by incubation with a 1:20 dilution of anti-rabbit Ig-colloidal gold (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 4 h. All antibodies were diluted in Tris-lysine BSA buffer. The cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m and pH 6.8 for 1 h at room temperature and then stored in Pipes buffer at 4 °C, post-fixed in 0.5% Os5O4 in Pipes buffer for 15 min, and then processed as described previously (29Lawson D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1891-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken on a Phillips CM10 electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips overnight and subjected to one of the following extraction procedures: CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) for 40 min on ice; CSK buffer plus 10 µg/ml RNase A; CSK buffer plus 500 units/ml DNase I for 40 min at 37 °C; CSK buffer plus 0.25m ammonium sulfate for 40 min on ice; CSK buffer plus 2m NaCl for 40 min on ice. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm, was included in all buffers to limit proteolytic digestion. After extraction the cells were washed in ice-cold CSK buffer, fixed, and stained as described above. Alternatively, the cells were grown in 60-mm Petri dishes, and after extraction the cells were lysed directly into SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blotting. Namalwa cells were lysed into Triton X-100-containing buffer, and after centrifugation of insoluble material the lysates were incubated with immobilized fusion protein constructs of GST-SH3 domains. Fig.1 shows that the Namalwa cell proteins, which bound to the tandem N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of p47phox (p47phox N/C) or the SH3 domain of PLCγ1, gave distinct profiles. Both domains bound a polypeptide of ∼60 kDa. Polypeptides of ∼70 and 75 kDa associated only with p47phoxN/C, and a polypeptide of about 90 kDa bound to both PLCγ and p47phox N/C. There was an additional prominent band detected at about 100 kDa, which also bound to the immobilized p47phoxN/C-SH3 domain-containing construct (arrow). This 100-kDa protein did not bind to beads alone, to GST-immobilized beads, or to the SH3 domain of PLCγ1. Larger quantities of the 100-kDa band were prepared from 109 cells and purified by binding to p47phox N/C SH3 domain followed by SDS-PAGE. The band was excised and subjected to microsequencing. Ten peptides were derived from microsequencing of the 100-kDa polypeptide bound to p47phox SH3 domain (Fig. 2). Data base searching revealed several expressed sequence tags with similar identity to that of the 90-kDa protein-derived peptides. The corresponding clones were obtained from the IMAGE consortium. The longest of these clones was clone 27176 (GenBankTMaccession number R13685) with an open reading frame that contained all of the peptide sequences derived from protein microsequencing. The 5′-end was obtained by RACE PCR and contained a methionine residue in the correct context for the initiation of translation. The complete amino acid sequence of SNP70 is shown in Fig.2. The polypeptide has 641 residues, and the predicted amino acid sequence encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 69,997 kDa. The polypeptide has a theoretical pI of 8.28 and contains an unusually high proportion of proline residues (18.6%). It is possible that this could account for its aberrant migration properties on reducing SDS-PAGE, where it runs with an apparent molecular mass of about 100 kDa. The amino acid sequence reveals several possible functional regions in SNP70. Four putative nuclear localization sites are found in the N-terminal half of the protein (residues 2–39, 78–83, 226–233, and 314–322). The C-terminal region contains proline-rich sequences that are likely to be the SH3 domain binding sequences (residues 410–531). In addition there is a potential profilin binding sequence in the C-terminal half (residues 461–489). No membrane signal or other binding motifs were detected. Data base searching revealed no homology with any other known protein. On the basis of this and the following work, we have termed this polypeptide SNP70, for SH3 domain binding Protein, 70 kDa. To gain more information about the function of SNP70, rabbit anti-peptide antibodies were raised against the 15 C-terminal residues. Western blotting using anti-peptide antisera revealed the detection of a single band that runs at about 100 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 A), whereas preimmune sera from the same animals gave no such band. Confirmation that the anti-peptide antibodies recognized the cloned protein was obtained by transfection of myc-tagged SNP70 cDNA into COS7 cells. Immune precipitation using anti-myc antibodies or anti-SNP70 antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-SNP70 antibodies gave identical results showing the presence of a polypeptide of about 90 kDa (Fig.3 B). Thus SNP70 runs with a higher apparent molecular weight than would be predicted from the primary sequence. The reason for this is presently unknown but may be related to its high proline content. Examination of a number of cell lines showed that SNP70 was expressed in all cells tested, which included B cells, T cells, monoblastoid cells, reticuloendothelial cells, and fibroblasts (Fig. 3 A; data not shown). The binding of SNP70 to a panel of 12 immobilized SH3 domains was performed, and the association was detected by immunoblotting (Fig.4). Initial studies indicated that SNP70 bound selectively to the N-terminal SH3 domain derived from the NADPH oxidase component p47phox, and to a construct containing both the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of p47phox. Longer exposures showed that SNP70 bound to the SH3 domains derived from p85α and c-src in addition to p47phox (Fig. 4 B). Direct comparison of binding activities demonstrated that SNP70 bound preferentially to the p47phox N-terminal SH3 domain and more weakly to the p85α and c-src SH3 domains (3 and 6%, respectively, of p47phox binding as assessed by scanning densitometry). No binding was detected to the SH3 domains derived from GAP, GRB2, itk, n-src, abl, PLCγ1, fgr, the C-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox, or either the N- or C-terminal domains of p67phox (Fig. 4, A andB). All cell lines tested were positive for SNP70 by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A; data not shown). Northern blotting experiments on a number of human tissues were performed to examine the tissue expression of SNP70 mRNA. A single band of ∼3 kb corresponding to the SNP70 message was detectable on all tissues examined (Fig.5 A); however, longer exposures showed the presence of further transcripts at ∼4 and 5 kb (data not shown). The highest level of mRNA could be seen in the heart, with pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, and brain also exhibiting comparatively high levels of message. The SNP70 message was lowest in liver and lung, where only a faint band was detected. Western blotting was also performed on human tissue extracts. Consistent with Northern blotting, heart tissue showed the highest levels of SNP70, with skeletal muscle, ovary, testis, brain, and kidney also giving a strong band (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). Lung and liver had no detectable SNP70 protein, again consistent with the low level of message found in Northern blots. Fig. 5 B lower panel shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, indicating that loadings for the Western blots were approximately equal. Preliminary immunofluorescence experiments in a number of cell types revealed nuclear staining of T lymphoid cells, B lymphoblastic cells, monocytic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells (data not shown). MDCK cells were chosen for further investigation, because they are relatively large cells with prominent nuclei and thin cytoplasm, which allows good intracellular localization at the light microscope level. Antibody staining of formaldehyde-fixed, permeabilized cells revealed that SNP70 was localized prominently in the nucleus and had a granular appearance when viewed at high magnification, which was even more apparent when digital confocal microscopy was used (Fig. 6,a and l). There was some diffuse staining present in the cytoplasm of interphase cells. Double staining with propidium iodide showed that SNP70 did not co-localize specifically with DNA, because it was excluded from nucleoli where DNA staining was strongest (Fig. 6, a–c). The localization of SNP70 in dividing cells was different from that of interphase cells. In prophase cells where DNA condensation had just been initiated, the nuclear SNP70 staining became more diffuse throughout the cell (Fig. 6, d–f,arrows), and in metaphase or anaphase cells SNP70 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm but excluded from the condensing chromatids (Fig. 6, g–i, arrows). To examine whether the cloned gene product had a similar localization to endogenous SNP70, cDNA for SNP70 was microinjected into MDCK cells and 24 h later the cells were processed for immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the recombinant protein was localized predominantly in the nucleus, however, there was some excess protein in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the nuclear transport mechanism had been saturated by the overproduction of SNP70 (Fig. 6,j and k). Digital confocal microscopy revealed that SNP70 had a granular, heterogeneous distribution within the nucleus (Fig. 6 l). The intracellular localization of SNP70 suggested that it did not bind directly or indirectly to DNA in the nucleus, because its immunofluorescence staining profile did not exactly coincide with propidium iodide staining. To investigate this further the biochemical characteristics of SNP70 association with cell nuclei were studied by the use of a variety of extraction procedures. SNP70 nuclear localization"

However, implementation of this knowledge into models does not reliably reproduce experimental observations. The standard redox potential (E m0′) reflects the thermodynamics of the equilibrium between redox states. The energetics of rearrangement between redox states will therefore reflect the ability of a system to polarize in an electrostatic field. Assuming that the nature of the iron-ligand interaction remains unchanged, the values of ΔE m0′ of mutation can be regarded as a measure of change in the polarizability, or dielectric response, to the charge of the redox center.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), an attempt to rationalize ΔE m0′mut in terms of polarizability of the protein matrix is made. The measurement of redox potential was made using the method of mixtures (16Wallace C.J.A. Corradin G. Marchiori F. Borin G. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The redox state of the sample protein was assayed in a range of redox buffers set by the ratio of ferro/ferricyanide in solution using anE m0′ for the couple of +0.43 V. Temperature dependence of the equilibrium between the reduced and oxidized form of the cytochromec was measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) with the redox potential of the buffer set at 268 mV using a ferro/ferricyanide ratio of 500. The sample was first prepared, then degassed for 15 min, then flushed with argon and kept in an airtight quartz cuvette. The temperature sweep occurred between 16 and 30 °C with a 2 °C increment using a thermostated cuvette holder (Hewlett-Packard, Mississauga, Canada), and the 550-nm absorption band was monitored. Fully oxidized and reduced proteins, respectively, were generated by the addition of ferricyanide up to a ferro/ferricyanide ratio of 3 and then a small amount of ascorbate. Control runs evaluating the temperature dependence ofE m of the buffer indicated that it was not necessary to apply a correction for the buffer effect over the experimental range of temperature. Sample cytochromes c were prepared in 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.0) in a 1-mm quartz cuvette, and the spectra were recorded from 260 to 180 nm at 10 nm·s−1 at 25 °C. Molar ellipticity was then calculated with exact cytochrome concentrations measured at 410 nm (ε = 106m−1·cm−1). Molecular mechanics were performed using the package DISCOVER (MSI, San Diego, CA) using the coordinates ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae ferrocytochrome cisoform 1 (17Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 527-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A typical conformational search was run over 100 ps using explicit solvent molecules. Fig. 1 was rendered using SWISS-MODELER/POV-ray. The net dipolar moment was calculated by analyzing the average atomic position of the solvent molecules in a trajectory file. A root mean square deviation matrix was generated to identify domains of local stability to allow a sampling typically of 30–40 ps. The dipole moment of a relaxed water molecule used is 1.85 Debyes, and the length of the vectorial sum of O–H bonds calculated from the model of a relaxed water molecule is 1.278 Å. Equation 1 was then applied,d=1.851.278∑ψ=x,y,zψ¯H1−ψ0+ψ¯H2−ψ02(Eq. 1) where ΨHx refers to the averaged coordinate, on a given axis, of one of the two hydrogen atoms and Ψ0′ refers to the averaged position of the oxygen atom. The behavior of E m0′ upon altering the electrostatic landscape of cytochrome c, as in most electron transport proteins, is hardly predictable. In the classical model, an electrostatic field is attenuated by the medium by a factor known as the dielectric constant. However, at the molecular level the medium cannot be treated as a continuum of matter, and the uniform nature of this effect seems to be lost. For this reason, it is preferable to refer to an effective dielectric constant rather than a dielectric constant (18Rees D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For appropriate biological function, the mitochondrial cytochromesc seem to have evolved toward higher values ofE m0′ (19Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry: Selected Data for Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1970: J41-J57Google Scholar), i.e. the protein matrix has been optimized to favor the reduced state of the iron (3Churg A.K Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This is achieved by solvating the buried dipoles that would otherwise polarize to stabilize an extra positive charge of the ferric iron. This is the case in the heme crevice, where every dipole is part of a hydrogen bond network (20Berghuis A.M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The polarity of this network intrinsically acts as a suitable dielectric environment to complement a buried yet charged heme without compromising the protein stability. However, this network as a whole has a sufficiently low dielectric character to differentially disfavor the oxidized iron. Indeed, it may be that because the structure has evolved in this direction that most mutations affecting the network lower the standard redox potential of the protein, indicating that the change favors the oxidized form of the cytochrome c (21Schejter A. Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Sanishvili R. Margoliash E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A series of six positively charged CAMMS derivatives was generated previously. 3C. Blouin and C. J. A. Wallace, unpublished results. The magnitude of ΔE m0′ measured in most chemical derivatives is not large enough to allow the reliable calculation of effective dielectric constants. Only four modifications incurring a ±1 formal charge change were kept for thermodynamic analysis: the mutation K55M and the CAMMS derivatives of mutants V28M, K55M, and I75M (Fig.1 A). The direct use of ΔΔG redox of derivatization to evaluate ε yielded a range of values from −90 to 130. Considering the theoretical minimum ε value of 1 and the practical maximum value of 80, it is clear that ΔE m0′ is not exclusively attributable to a change in the dielectric properties of the protein matrix (as inferred from Coulomb's law). The presence of a “negative dielectric effect” for K55M and CAMMS55 indicates that the change in E m0′ is greater than would be expected from electrostatic interaction exclusively. On the other hand, the effect of the derivatization CAMMS28 is much smaller than would have been expected from dielectric relaxation (ε = 130 ± 20, Table I). This value is in fact higher than the value of ε for the bulk solvent itself. The effect on standard redox potential thus extends beyond dipolar relaxation into a factor(s) yet to be accounted for.Table IApparent dielectric constants applying between the CAMMS probe and the redox centerModificationD (FE-X)1-aDistance from the iron atom to the site of the modification as measured in the respective molecular models.ΔE m0′ΔΔG redox1-bCalculated using ΔΔG Red = −RTΔΔE m0′.ΔΔH redox1-cMeasured using Van't-Hoff's temperature dependence of equilibria graphical method.εΔΔEm0′ 1-dRatio ΔU cal/ΔUexp.

Open table in a new tab If, however, one uses ΔΔH redox to calculate an effective dielectric constant, the data yields a more consistent ε value (Table I), with an average of 19 ± 6. This compares with calculated values of 25 ± 10 for the whole cytochrome c derived from molecular mechanics using the Frohlich-Kirkwood theory of microscopic dielectrics (6Simonson T. Perahia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Derivative CAMMS55 seems to be an exception, but the standard deviation in the measurements of ΔE m0′ is such that it is impossible to formally calculate εΔΔH. A consistent εΔΔH value suggests that the dielectric constant as defined by Coulomb's law applies to microscopic systems with a value of ∼20 for the heme and its immediate environment in cytochrome c. Or, at least, this value would apply to this system extrapolated to 0 K. This implies that, from a purely enthalpic point of view, the polypeptide relaxation with respect to the heme is consistent and independent of the position of a test charge. The dielectric susceptibility in this case could thus be referred to as dielectric constant, which is one of two possible components forming the apparent dielectric constant. Most importantly, this indicates that the great variability in apparent dielectric constants is caused by the entropy of the redox equilibrium. The CD spectra of the mutants N52A, N52S, N52T, N53V, N52H, N52Q, N52I, N52C, N52D, and N52M were checked between 180 and 260 nm for deviation from the wild-type spectrum. The signal of the amide band would be expected to be sensitive to any change in the short stretch of α-helix including position 52. Only the mutants N52D and N52C showed unusual features in this domain and were discarded from the data set. Further molecular modeling of each mutant protein for which no known structure has yet been solved was performed to probe the geometry and environment of the substituted residues. All of the modeled side chain substitutions were accommodated in the heme crevice with no backbone rearrangement. As in mutant N52I (PDB entry 1CRG (10Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.G. McLendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)), the hydrophilic cavity beside the heme in mutation N52M, N52Q, and N52H did not offer sufficient space to keep the structural water molecule bound in the wild-type Asn52. In mutants with side chains smaller than that of asparagine, the ambiguity between one or two buried water molecules was addressed by measuring the stability of the buried water molecule over simulation time by calculating the dipolar moment of the molecule. As a control experiment, a simulation was run on the wild-type ferricytochrome c with the Met80 ligand replaced by Lys73. A large range of buried water molecules was present because a buried pocket was created in this simulation, which included two poorly stabilized solvent molecules (Fig.2, solid data points). The calculated net dipolar moment of a (stable) structural molecule is constant for a structure averaged for >10 ps, whereas the bulk solvent molecules decayed to no net dipolar moment as demonstrated in Fig. 2. The elimination of the amide at 52 decreased the number of dipoles competing for oxygen lone-pairs of Wat166, hence the increase in the net dipolar moment baseline for the mutants. We used as control protein N52A, for which we know that the structure has a crevice large enough to accommodate two water molecules (10Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.G. McLendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this structure, both of these molecules have a high net dipolar moment over the simulation time (Table II). Of the mutants N52S, N52T, and N52V, only N52S allows two water molecules to stably reside in the pocket, whereas the extra methyl in N52T forbids the presence of a second molecule (both averaged molecules attempt to share the same stabilizing groups). It is arguable that the hydrophilic nature of the crevice in mutant N52V would be insufficient to accommodate even a single water molecule. This is supported by a poor net dipolar moment for the model of this mutant.Table IINet dipolar moment of buried water molecules in models of Asn52mutant seriesModelWat1662-aThe water molecule occupying the space of the amide nitrogen of Asn52 in the wild-type structure.Wat13002-bThe second structural water molecule present in the structure of mutant N52A (1IRW,).Wat1212-cThe water molecule tethered between Arg38 and Hpr7.DebyeWild type0.921.37N52A1.271.281.37N52S1.201.351.51N52T2-dOverlapping of atoms by averaged water molecule Wat166–Wat1300.1.171.061.31N52V2-dOverlapping of atoms by averaged water molecule Wat166–Wat1300.0.780.631.632-a The water molecule occupying the space of the amide nitrogen of Asn52 in the wild-type structure.2-b The second structural water molecule present in the structure of mutant N52A (1IRW,).2-c The water molecule tethered between Arg38 and Hpr7.2-d Overlapping of atoms by averaged water molecule Wat166–Wat1300. Open table in a new tab Calculation of ε′ as performed with the CAMMS series could not be applied to mutants at position 52 because of the lack of change in formal charge. Instead, the thermodynamic breakdown ofE m0′ was performed by the independent determination of ΔΔH redox and ΔΔG 0′redox, which permitted the calculation of TΔΔS redox. ΔE m0′ values in the series of mutants involving Asn52 range from −5 mV in N52M to −47 mV in N52I. Mutations at this position have been reported to stabilize the fold of both oxidation states (21Schejter A. Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Sanishvili R. Margoliash E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Plotkin B. Schejter A. Margoliash E. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with an enhanced preference for the oxidized protein (23Lett C.M. Berghuis A.M. Frey H.E. Lepock J.R. Guillemette J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29088-29093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Contraintuitively, the elimination of the dipole of the Asn52 side chain and its replacement by another residue induced a decrease in enthalpy of reduction. This indicates that Asn52 enthalpically favors the oxidized state over any other single mutation at this position. Thus, a mutation at position 52 would be expected to provoke an increase inE m0′. However, most are found below the isocurve ΔE m0′ = 0 (Fig.3), indicating that these mutations lead to a net decrease of E m0′. The favorable enthalpy of reduction is, in these cases, opposed by a larger unfavorable entropic cost. In mutations not involving Asn52 (I75M, V28M, Y67F, and K55M), ΔΔS redox correlates with ΔE m0′. As shown in Fig.4 A, the series of mutations at position 52 have an absolute ΔΔS redoxindependent of the net effect of a mutation onE m0′ and the nature of the substitution. In these mutants, ΔΔS redox averages to −74 ± 3 J·Mol−1·K−1 except for N52S, N52T, and N52H. The first two mutations are the only substitutions in which position 52 conserved the ability to donate a hydrogen bond to the structural water Wat166, which may explain the lesser entropic penalty. This suggests that this bond is responsible for the attributed switchlike properties of the water molecule upon oxidoreduction (10Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.G. McLendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is unclear as to why N52H does not group with the other mutants. The hydroxyl group at position 67 is thought to contribute to the electron-withdrawing power of Met80 (24Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1326-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), to the binding of Wat166(17Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 527-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and to stabilizing the lysine ligands in the state IV alkaline isomer (15Schroeder H.R. McOdimba F.A. Guillemette J.G. Kornblatt J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The ΔΔS redox of mutant Y67F suggests that the hydroxyl group of Tyr67 is not part of the block Asn52-Wat166 (Fig. 4 B). The enthalpy of reduction upon losing the hydroxyl group also favors the reduced state. This is possible either by affecting the electron-withdrawing power of Met80 or more generally by deleting one dipole that is able to react favorably to the fluctuations in the electrostatic charge on the heme. Again, the enthalpic effect is counteracted by a larger entropic effect, resulting in a net decrease of E m0′. The effects of the double mutations Y67F/N52I and Y67F/N52V differ radically from those of the corresponding single mutations. The enthalpy of deleting the polarity at both positions 52 and 67 actually favors the oxidized state. This may be caused by a more direct effect of the negatively charged heme propionate on the cationic iron ion because of the lack of screening by the protein matrix. Alternatively, because these double mutants fail to undergo an alkaline transition3 (10Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.G. McLendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the second heme propionate (Hpr6) is ionized in these proteins, which would clearly favor a positive charge on the heme and hence a lowerE m0′. The entropies of reduction of both double mutants indicate that the temperature-dependent component of the free energy of a fully hydrophobic heme crevice is similar to that of a wild-type fully hydrophilic cavity (Fig. 2 B). This means that the polarizability of the heme crevice is similar whether the heme crevice is made of a fully consistent hydrogen bond network or has no polarity at all. The question of whether the frequently observed enthalpy-entropy compensation is real or artifactual leaves much over which to argue. But as can be inferred from Sharp (25Sharp K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the reason why research groups overlook the “artifact explanation” is that it yields no physical rationale for discussion. Table III shows the thermodynamic values determined in this study. It is clear from these results that the enthalpy of reduction is of an opposing sign to the net change in free energy. If ΔH redox was not compensated by ΔS redox, the magnitude of ΔE m0′ would be in the order of hundreds of millivolts for the Asn52 mutant series in the opposite direction to that which is observed. Some form of compensation must therefore occur.Table IIIThermodynamics of reduction of cytochromes c determined by the Van't-Hoff methodMutationΔE m0′3-aUsing the method of the mixtures.

Open table in a new tab Although we make no attempt to prove this point, it seems logical that preferential distribution into lower energy levels will affect the entropy of a system (26Hill T. An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics. Dover Books, New York1986Google Scholar). This would bind S and H to correlate in accordance with statistical thermodynamics. In the present cases the entropic penalty consistently overcomes the enthalpy regardless of the actual effect on ΔH redox. This suggests that the dynamic nature of the protein matrix weighs more heavily in the balance than the actual energy levels. If the cytochrome chas evolved toward a higher level of intramolecular neutralization of its dipolar groups to restrain its polarizability, any candidate mutation will be likely to free one or more chemical groups and therefore favor the oxidized state, which is what we observe. The sign of ΔΔH redox or even the functional relevance of a mutation to the biological activity, therefore, may have nothing to do with the effect on E m0′. This study concludes that the apparent dielectric constant (ε′) measured for microscopic systems such as cytochromec is comprised of εΔΔH and εΔΔS. The enthalpic factor, εΔΔH, showed a constant nature with a value of about 20, leaving εΔΔS as responsible for the wide variability in ε′. The polarizability of the matrix as a whole, mainly responsible for εΔΔS, refers to conformational polarizability and is therefore not a function of atomic properties or coordinates and cannot be calculated in a straightforward way. Although the network of hydrogen bonds within the protein matrix contributes enthalpically to the oxidized state, if any of its components is deleted, the loss of polarity is overcome by the concomitant conformational freedom of the polar groups left unpaired by the mutations. In dynamic systems such as proteins, the entropic penalty overcomes the enthalpy, which explains why known physical relationships perform poorly at predictingE m0′ changes."

Evidence has been presented that only choline that enters cells through the choline transporter, and not phosphocholine administered to cells by membrane permeabilization, is incorporated into phosphatidylcholine. Here, we show that [14C]phosphocholine derived from the lysosomal degradation of [14C]choline-labeled sphingomyelin is incorporated as such into phosphatidylcholine in human and mouse fibroblasts. Low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis was used to specifically direct [14C]sphingomyelin to the lysosomal degradation pathway. Free labeled choline was not found either intracellularly or in the medium, not even when the cells were energy-depleted. Deficiency of lysosomal acid phosphatases in mouse or alkaline phosphatase in human fibroblasts did not affect the incorporation of lysosomal [14C]sphingomyelin-derived [14C]phosphocholine into phosphatidylcholine, supporting our finding that phosphocholine is not degraded to choline prior to its incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. Inhibition studies and analysis of molecular species showed that exogenous [3H]choline and sphingomyelin-derived [14C]phosphocholine are incorporated into phosphatidylcholine via a common pathway of synthesis. Our findings provide evidence that, in fibroblasts, phosphocholine derived from sphingomyelin is transported out of the lysosome and subsequently incorporated into phosphatidylcholine without prior hydrolysis of phosphocholine to choline.

Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Choline can enter the cell via the ATP-dependent choline transporter present in the cell membrane and is subsequently phosphorylated to phosphocholine (PCho) by the cytosolic enzyme choline kinase (EC 2.7.1.32). PC is then synthesized in two steps, catalyzed by the rate-limiting cytosolic and membrane-bound enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT; EC 2.7.7.15) and the membrane-bound enzyme CDP-choline:sn-1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.2). For some cell types, including fibroblasts, it has been reported that the steps of PC synthesis are tightly linked in a so-called metabolon (2George T.P. Morash S.C. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B.

In contrast, PCho administered to cells by partial membrane permeabilization was not incorporated into PC (2George T.P. Morash S.C. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. St C. Spence M.W. Biochim.

We hypothesized that if only choline, and not PCho, can enter the PC metabolon and be incorporated into PC in human fibroblasts, then PCho that is formed during the degradation of SM by acid sphingomyelinase in the lysosome must be degraded to choline to be incorporated into PC. Candidate enzymes for intralysosomal hydrolysis of PCho to choline are lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (6Waheed A. van Etten R.L.

LAP is ubiquitously expressed, and TRAP is predominantly expressed in alveolar macrophages and osteoclasts (9Drexler H.G. Gignac S.M. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 359-368PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a specific function of the latter enzyme in these cell types. Another possible route for lysosomal SM-derived PCho is transport across the lysosomal membrane (by an unknown transporter), followed by hydrolysis to choline and subsequent incorporation of choline into the PC synthesis metabolon. A candidate enzyme for the hydrolysis of cytosolic PCho is alkaline phosphatase. In human skin fibroblasts, alkaline phosphatase is predominantly located at the plasma membrane (10Fedde K.N. Whyte M.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 767-775PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fedde K.N. Cole D.E.C. Whyte M.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 776-783PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoethanolamine and pyridoxal-5′-phosphate have been described as physiological substrates for this enzyme (10Fedde K.N. Whyte M.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 767-775PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the possible role of LAP, TRAP, and alkaline phosphatase in the hydrolysis of PCho derived from the late endosomal/lysosomal degradation of SM.In this study we compared exogenous choline and late endosome/lysosome-derived PCho as substrates for PC synthesis. Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) was used as an inhibitor of PC synthesis (12Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 6719-6724Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 13Detmar M.

The results indicate that PCho derived from lysosomal SM is not degraded to choline but is incorporated into PC as such. We conclude that the PC synthesis metabolon either does not exist in fibroblasts or is not as inaccessible to PCho as indicated by previous studies.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we describe the incorporation of labeled PCho derived from the late endosomal/lysosomal degradation of SM into PC via the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis (1Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the uptake of [14C]SM·apoE was LDL receptor-mediated and that [14C]SM was exclusively metabolized in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, because NP-A fibroblasts, which are deficient in acid sphingomyelinase, did not metabolize [14C]SM. Also, in this cell line no evidence was found for the incorporation of SM-derived [14C]choline into PC, even after prolonged incubation. This finding excludes the involvement of the reverse reaction catalyzed by SM synthase (27van Helvoort A. van't Hoff W. Ritsema T. Sandra A. van Meer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in our experimental setup. In addition we have clearly shown that during the initial degradation of [14C]SM to [14C]PCho, [14C]PC synthesis was negligible, indicating a lag phase in the process of PC synthesis from SM-derived PCho.In these in situ experiments, we did not observe production of radiolabeled free choline from SM, indicating that SM-derived PCho was not hydrolyzed to choline prior to its incorporation into PC. Even under conditions of energy depletion, when resynthesis of PCho from choline would be inhibited, no radiolabeled free choline was detected. These results corroborate our previous in vitro studies with fibroblast homogenates at acidic pH, where we found PCho, and not choline, as an end product of PC degradation. PCho, which was predominantly generated by acid sphingomyelinase activity, was apparently not further degraded by acid phosphatases (5Jansen S.M. Groener J.E.M. Poorthuis B.J.H.M. BBA (Biochim. Biophys. Acta) Libr. 1999; 1436: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in another in vitro study the incubation of purified rat liver lysosomes with PC or PCho at acidic pH levels produced virtually no free choline (28Kunze H. BBA (Biochim. Biophys. Acta) Libr. 1993; 1169: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar).The possible role of acid phosphatases in the degradation of PCho in the present in situ study was investigated with embryonic fibroblasts from LAP and/or TRAP (double)-deficient mice. These mice have been developed to study the physiological role of the acid phosphatases (17Saftig P. Hartmann D. Lüllmann-Rauch R. Wolff J. Evers M. Köster A. Hetman M. von Figura K. Peters C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18628-18635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 The natural substrates for these enzymes have not been elucidated. However, an early study reported that PCho was a poor substrate for a purified rat liver acid phosphatase in vitro (29Arsenis C. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5702-5708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study shows that PCho is not an in situ substrate for acid phosphatases present in mouse fibroblasts.Because we have not found any indication that SM-derived PCho was hydrolyzed to free choline, it is likely that PCho is an end product of lysosomal degradation. However, most of the intracellular SM-derived PCho was present in the cytoplasm, not in the lysosomes, as was shown by digitonin-induced membrane permeabilization. This suggests that PCho must be transported out of the lysosomes by an as yet unknown transporter. Subsequently, it can serve as a substrate for PC synthesis. The experiments with alkaline phosphatase-deficient human fibroblasts indicate that PCho is not hydrolyzed in the cytosol by alkaline phosphatase. In conclusion, all results indicate that PCho is not hydrolyzed prior to its incorporation into PC.Our data point to a direct incorporation of cytosolic PCho, endogenously produced by the late endosomal/lysosomal breakdown of SM, into PC. This is not compatible with previous reports that concluded that in C6 rat glioma cells, C3H10T½ fibroblasts, and rat hepatocytes the intermediates of PC synthesis are channeled to the enzymes involved, defining a so-called PC synthesis metabolon (2George T.P. Morash S.C. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. St C. Spence M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Bladergroen B.A. Geelen M.J.H. Reddy A.C.P. Declercq P.E. van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on experiments in which PCho, which was delivered to the cytosol via partial membrane permeabilization, was not used for PC synthesis. However, our results show that PCho, which is derived from the lysosomal degradation of SM, is directly incorporated into PC via the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis. The latter is supported by the fact that HePC, a specific inhibitor of this pathway, inhibited the incorporation of both exogenous choline and endogenous PCho into PC. HePC has been shown by several groups to inhibit PC synthesis in different cell types (12Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 6719-6724Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 13Detmar M. Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Orfanos C.E. Reutter W. J. Invest.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 100: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HePC inhibits CT, the rate-limiting enzyme of PC synthesis, which results in the accumulation of PCho. In those previous studies with HePC, the incorporation of exogenous choline into PC was investigated. In the present study with human skin fibroblasts, the inhibition of PC synthesis from exogenous radiolabeled choline by HePC and the subsequent accumulation of PCho were confirmed. HePC also inhibited PC synthesis from lysosomal SM-derived PCho in these cells, suggesting that this PCho, like exogenous choline, entered the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis that is regulated by CT. The fact that the molecular species of PC synthesized from exogenous [3H]choline and of PC synthesized from late endosomal/lysosomal [14C]PCho were nearly identical indicates a common diacylglycerol precursor pool. This supports the idea that [14C]SM-derived PCho enters the normal PC biosynthetic pathway, rather than incorporating to PC via another route.In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that in human skin fibroblasts, PCho that is produced by acid sphingomyelinase activity is transported intact from the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment to the cytoplasm and then enters the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis. This means that if the proposed PC synthesis metabolon exists, it is not as impermeable to intermediates of PC synthesis as indicated by previous studies (2George T.P. Morash S.C. Cook H.W.

Even under conditions of energy depletion, when resynthesis of PCho from choline would be inhibited, no radiolabeled free choline was detected. These results corroborate our previous in vitro studies with fibroblast homogenates at acidic pH, where we found PCho, and not choline, as an end product of PC degradation. PCho, which was predominantly generated by acid sphingomyelinase activity, was apparently not further degraded by acid phosphatases (5Jansen S.M. Groener J.E.M. Poorthuis B.J.H.M. BBA (Biochim. Biophys. Acta) Libr. 1999; 1436: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in another in vitro study the incubation of purified rat liver lysosomes with PC or PCho at acidic pH levels produced virtually no free choline (28Kunze H. BBA (Biochim. Biophys. Acta) Libr. 1993; 1169: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar).The possible role of acid phosphatases in the degradation of PCho in the present in situ study was investigated with embryonic fibroblasts from LAP and/or TRAP (double)-deficient mice. These mice have been developed to study the physiological role of the acid phosphatases (17Saftig P. Hartmann D. Lüllmann-Rauch R. Wolff J. Evers M. Köster A. Hetman M. von Figura K. Peters C. J.

Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 The natural substrates for these enzymes have not been elucidated. However, an early study reported that PCho was a poor substrate for a purified rat liver acid phosphatase in vitro (29Arsenis C. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5702-5708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study shows that PCho is not an in situ substrate for acid phosphatases present in mouse fibroblasts.Because we have not found any indication that SM-derived PCho was hydrolyzed to free choline, it is likely that PCho is an end product of lysosomal degradation. However, most of the intracellular SM-derived PCho was present in the cytoplasm, not in the lysosomes, as was shown by digitonin-induced membrane permeabilization. This suggests that PCho must be transported out of the lysosomes by an as yet unknown transporter. Subsequently, it can serve as a substrate for PC synthesis. The experiments with alkaline phosphatase-deficient human fibroblasts indicate that PCho is not hydrolyzed in the cytosol by alkaline phosphatase. In conclusion, all results indicate that PCho is not hydrolyzed prior to its incorporation into PC.Our data point to a direct incorporation of cytosolic PCho, endogenously produced by the late endosomal/lysosomal breakdown of SM, into PC. This is not compatible with previous reports that concluded that in C6 rat glioma cells, C3H10T½ fibroblasts, and rat hepatocytes the intermediates of PC synthesis are channeled to the enzymes involved, defining a so-called PC synthesis metabolon (2George T.P.

Declercq P.E. van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on experiments in which PCho, which was delivered to the cytosol via partial membrane permeabilization, was not used for PC synthesis. However, our results show that PCho, which is derived from the lysosomal degradation of SM, is directly incorporated into PC via the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis. The latter is supported by the fact that HePC, a specific inhibitor of this pathway, inhibited the incorporation of both exogenous choline and endogenous PCho into PC. HePC has been shown by several groups to inhibit PC synthesis in different cell types (12Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Reutter W. J. Biol.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 100: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HePC inhibits CT, the rate-limiting enzyme of PC synthesis, which results in the accumulation of PCho. In those previous studies with HePC, the incorporation of exogenous choline into PC was investigated. In the present study with human skin fibroblasts, the inhibition of PC synthesis from exogenous radiolabeled choline by HePC and the subsequent accumulation of PCho were confirmed. HePC also inhibited PC synthesis from lysosomal SM-derived PCho in these cells, suggesting that this PCho, like exogenous choline, entered the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis that is regulated by CT. The fact that the molecular species of PC synthesized from exogenous [3H]choline and of PC synthesized from late endosomal/lysosomal [14C]PCho were nearly identical indicates a common diacylglycerol precursor pool. This supports the idea that [14C]SM-derived PCho enters the normal PC biosynthetic pathway, rather than incorporating to PC via another route.In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that in human skin fibroblasts, PCho that is produced by acid sphingomyelinase activity is transported intact from the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment to the cytoplasm and then enters the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis. This means that if the proposed PC synthesis metabolon exists, it is not as impermeable to intermediates of PC synthesis as indicated by previous studies (2George T.P. Morash S.C. Cook H.W.

In the present study we describe the incorporation of labeled PCho derived from the late endosomal/lysosomal degradation of SM into PC via the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis (1Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the uptake of [14C]SM·apoE was LDL receptor-mediated and that [14C]SM was exclusively metabolized in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, because NP-A fibroblasts, which are deficient in acid sphingomyelinase, did not metabolize [14C]SM. Also, in this cell line no evidence was found for the incorporation of SM-derived [14C]choline into PC, even after prolonged incubation. This finding excludes the involvement of the reverse reaction catalyzed by SM synthase (27van Helvoort A. van't Hoff W. Ritsema T. Sandra A. van Meer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in our experimental setup.
