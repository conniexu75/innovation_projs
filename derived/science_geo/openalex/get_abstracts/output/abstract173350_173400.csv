Here we demonstrate that the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes are direct targets of the oxysterol receptors liver X receptor (LXR) α and LXRβ. Diets containing high cholesterol markedly increased the expression of ABCG5/G8 mRNA in mouse liver and intestine. This increase was also observed using synthetic ligands of LXR and its heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor. In situ hybridization analyses of tissues from LXR agonist-treated mice revealed that ABCG5/G8 mRNA is located in hepatocytes and enterocytes and is increased upon LXR activation. In addition, expression of the LXR target gene ABCA1, previously implicated in the control of cholesterol absorption, was also dramatically up-regulated in jejunal enterocytes upon exposure to LXR agonists. These changes in ABC transporter gene expression were not observed in mice lacking LXRs. Furthermore, in the rat hepatoma cell line FTO2B, LXR-dependent transcription of the ABCG5/G8 genes was cycloheximide-resistant, indicating that these genes are directly regulated by LXRs. The addition of ABCG5 and ABCG8 to the growing list of LXR target genes further supports the notion that LXRs serve as sterol sensors to coordinately regulate sterol catabolism, storage, efflux, and elimination.

Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by a series of regulatory pathways to control the synthesis of endogenous cholesterol, the absorption of dietary sterol, and the elimination of cholesterol and its catabolic end products, bile acids. Transcriptional control of many genes vital to these processes can be attributed to two families of transcription factors: the sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), 1The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol-regulatory element-binding proteinABCATP-binding cassetteLXRliver X receptorRXRretinoid X receptormpkmg/kg of body weightFXRfarnesoid X receptorPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor 1The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol-regulatory element-binding proteinABCATP-binding cassetteLXRliver X receptorRXRretinoid X receptormpkmg/kg of body weightFXRfarnesoid X receptorPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor especially SREBP-2, which control the production of key enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis (for review, see Ref. 1Horton J.D.

LXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. LXRs are bound and activated by a specific class of naturally occurring oxysterols (3Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

LXRs bind DNA as obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and can be activated by either LXR agonists or RXR ligands. The RXR/LXR heterodimer binds to a DNA sequence comprised of two direct repeats of the hexanucleotide motif AGGTCA separated by four bases, referred to as an LXR response element of the DR4 type (8Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).

In rodents, high cholesterol feeding results in the production of oxysterols in the liver (9Zhang Z., Li, D. Blanchard D.E. Lear S.R. Erickson S.K. Spencer T.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that activate LXRs thereby increasing expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and promoting cholesterol conversion to bile acids for excretion (10Peet D.J.

LXR activation also promotes the formation of cholesterol esters by increasing expression of SREBP-1c and stearoyl-CoA desaturase, resulting in increased production of oleic acid, the preferred substrate for cholesterol esterification (7Schultz J.R., Tu, H.

Administration of synthetic LXR or RXR agonists to mice has multiple effects on cholesterol metabolism (7Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwender S. Wang S. Thoolen M.

Serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid levels are increased, and the biosynthesis and secretion of both bile acids and cholesterol are enhanced in treated mice (6Repa J.J.

Cholesterol absorption is reduced in LXR agonist-treated mice, and this reduction is associated with a dramatic increase in ABCA1 expression in the intestine (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.-M. A. Medina J., Li, L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Moreover, cholesterol absorption was recently reported to be increased in abca1-knockout mice, suggesting that this ATP-binding cassette transporter may serve to efflux cholesterol back into the intestinal lumen for elimination (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.-M. A. Medina J., Li, L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 20McNeish J.

Two other members of the ABC transporter family, ABCG5 and ABCG8, have also recently been implicated in mediating the secretion of sterols from the liver and efflux of dietary sterols from the gut. Mutations in either of the genes encoding these two proteins cause the autosomal recessive disorder sitosterolemia (21Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A., Yu, L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar, 22Lee M.-H., Lu, K. Hazard S., Yu, H. Shulenin S. Hidaka H. Kojima H. Allikmets R. Sakuma N.

The diagnostic finding in this disorder is markedly elevated serum levels of the plant sterol β-sitosterol, which is normally present in only trace amounts (23Björkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2073-2099Google Scholar). Individuals with sitosterolemia exhibit hyperabsorption of β-sitosterol, as well as other sterols, and have markedly reduced secretion of sterols into the bile. The expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 are both increased in cholesterol-fed mice, suggesting that ABCG5 and ABCG8, as well as ABCA1, are regulated by the RXR/LXR heterodimer (21Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A., Yu, L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide unequivocal evidence that ABCG5 and ABCG8 are direct target genes of LXRs in liver and intestine. Furthermore, using in situ hybridization, we show that the levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8, as well as ABCA1, are dramatically increased in hepatocytes and enterocytes treated with an LXR agonist. These data provide strong evidence that the maintenance of dietary sterol homeostasis is coordinately regulated by the LXR-dependent expression of a family of ABC sterol transporters in the liver and intestine. Nuclear receptor agonists were obtained from the following sources. Fenofibrate, pregnenolone α-carbonitrile, and chenodeoxycholic acid were purchased from Sigma; troglitazone was a generous gift from Roger Unger (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas); LG268 and GW4064 were provided by Richard Heyman and Raju Mohan (X-Ceptor Therapeutics, Inc., San Diego, CA); and T0901317 was supplied by Bei Shan (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). Sodium mevalonate, sodium compactin, and delipidated fetal calf serum were prepared as described previously (24Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Kaneko I. Endo A. J. Biol.

Mice were fed ad libitum a cereal-based mouse/rat diet (No. 7001, Harlan Teklad, Madison WI) that contained 0.02% cholesterol and 4% total lipid. Diets were supplemented with cholesterol (ICN Biomedicals), vehicle (0.9% carboxymethylcellulose, 9.95% polyethylene glycol, 0.05% Tween 80) added at 3.3 ml/100 g of diet, and/or nuclear receptor agonist. Nuclear receptor agonists were added to diets to provide the appropriate dose (mg/kg of body weight, mpk) on consumption of 5 g of diet by a 25-g mouse per day. There were no changes in food consumption observed by animals fed the various synthetic agonists. Following dietary treatment, mice were anesthetized with Nembutal and exsanguinated prior to organ harvest. The small intestine was removed, flushed with ice-cold saline, and opened lengthwise, and the mucosae were gently scraped and transferred to tubes for flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. In some studies the small intestine was divided into three segments of equal length designated duodenum (proximal), jejunum (medial), and ileum (distal). All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee. Total RNA was extracted from tissues of individual mice or from cultured cells using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total RNA from the four to six animals per treatment were pooled, and mRNA was isolated using oligo-dT cellulose columns (Pharmacia). 5 μg of poly(A+) RNA or 10 μg of total RNA were size-fractionated on 1% agarose, formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Zetaprobe, BioRad). Hybridizations were performed using32P-labeled cDNA probes for mouse or rat ABCG5 and ABCG8 (21Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A., Yu, L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), mouse SREBP-1 (26Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The amount of radioactivity in each band was quantified by phosphorimaging and normalized to the signal of β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Total RNA was prepared from FTO2B hepatoma cells using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.), treated with DNase I (RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) to generate cDNA. Primers for each gene were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on sequence data available through GenBankTM (accession numbers in parentheses): rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (AF106860): forward 5′-GAGGTGACCGCATCTTCTTG, reverse 5′-CCGACCTTCACCATCTTGTC; rat ABCG5 (AF312714): forward 5′-CCCTGTCCTGAACATTCCAA, reverse 5′-TTGGGTGTCCACCGATGTCA; and rat ABCG8 (AF351785): forward 5′-CGGCTGGCTTCATGATAAAC, reverse 5′-GGAACGACATCTTGGAAATCC. The real-time PCR contained, in a final volume of 10 μl, 25 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA, a 150 nm concentration of each primer, and 5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All PCRs were performed in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System, and relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative CTmethod. 4User Bulletin No. 2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primers were validated by analysis of a standard curve and dissociation curve for each primer pair in a template titration assay. In addition, real-time PCR results were confirmed by comparison to a Northern analysis for a single experiment. cDNA fragments encompassing the 3′-untranslated regions of mouse ABCG5 and ABCG8 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEM in both orientations to allow the synthesis of RNA riboprobes using the T7 promoter. PCR primers for mouse ABCG5 were 5′-ATCCAACACCTCTATGCTAAATCAC (forward) and 5′-TACATTATTGGACCAGTTCAGTCAC (reverse) to generate a 411-bp fragment. Primers for mouse ABCG8 were 5′-ACAAGGCTCACACAGATCTCTCA (forward) and 5′-TATAATTGGTTCCCATTCCATACTG (reverse) to produce a 212-bp cDNA. A 413-bp cDNA fragment of mouse ABCA1 containing nucleotides 390–802 (GenBankTMaccession number NM_013454) and flanked by BamHI and XhoI sites was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCTCGCCTGTTCTCAGACGC (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGACCACTGGCTTCAGGATGTCC (reverse). Ligating this fragment into pBS(KS−) allowed production of both antisense (T3/BamHI) and sense (T7/XhoI) in situ probes. RNA riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription with the Ambion Maxiscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) in the presence of 35S-UTP (Amersham Biosciences, >1000 Ci/mmol). Probes were purified over G50 spin columns and evaluated by diagnostic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tissues were harvested from A129 strain male mice following a 16-h dietary treatment (see “Animal Studies” for diet information). Organs were removed from anesthetized mice after transcardial perfusion with cold heparinized diethyl pyrocarbonate-saline followed by chilled 4% paraformaldehyde, diethyl pyrocarbonate-phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were fixed for 16 h in paraformaldehyde, transferred to diethyl pyrocarbonate-saline, then dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (27Shelton J.M. Lee M.-H. Richardson J.A. Patel S.B. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal autoradiographic exposure of the slides was achieved at 14 days for ABCG5 and ABCG8 probes and 21 days for the ABCA1 antisense riboprobe. Control slides using sense riboprobes were evaluated at those times and gave no significant signals. The rat hepatoma cell line FTO2B (28Wynshaw-Boris A. Lugo T.G. Short J.M. Fournier R.E.K.

Cells were plated at 700,000/10-cm dish and allowed to adhere overnight. The following morning, the cells were washed, and the sterol depletion medium was applied as described by DeBose-Boyd et al. (29DeBose-Boyd R.A., Ou, J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 + 5% delipidated fetal calf serum + 50 μm compactin + 50 μm mevalonate) for 6 h before the addition of 10 μm T0901317, 10 μm GW4064, 100 μm chenodeoxycholic acid, and/or 500 μm cycloheximide. Cells were harvested at various times later, and RNA was extracted for Northern analysis. Similar results were observed with the rat hepatoma FAO cell line (European Collection of Cell Cultures No. 89042701; Ref.30Wiebel F.J. Park S.S. Kiefer F. Gelboin H.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GraphPad Prism computer software was used to perform all statistical analyses (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Experimental results were tested by a two-way analysis of variance with genotype and diet as factors. In all cases, a significant interaction of these factors was observed and a post-hoc Newman-Keuls test was performed to evaluate differences between the means of the various treatment groups. Statistical significance was declared it the calculated p value was less than 0.05. All values are represented as means ± S.E., and different letters above the graphed means indicate significantly different values. Dietary cholesterol feeding was previously shown to increase duodenal, jejunal, and hepatic expression levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA in wild-type mice (21Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A., Yu, L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). To determine the role of LXRs in the up-regulation of these genes, we challenged mice with various diets under conditions in which either LXRα, LXRβ, or both LXR genes had been ablated. ABCG5 and ABCG8 exhibited a statistically significant ∼2.5–4-fold increase in both transcripts in the liver of wild-type mice after 7–10 days of feeding a 2% cholesterol diet (Fig. 1, A and B). No increase in ABCG5 or ABCG8 was seen in mice lacking either LXRα or LXRα plus LXRβ. In fact, in the lxrα/β-knockout mice the expression levels were significantly reduced by ∼50% upon cholesterol feeding (Figs. 1 and2). Interestingly sterol regulation was maintained in the lxrβ-knockout mice demonstrating that sterol up-regulation of ABCG5/G8 requires LXRα. The apparent LXRα-specific response may be due to the greater abundance of LXRα than LXRβ in the liver (31Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Alternatively LXRα may exhibit a higher activity than LXRβ in activating these genes (10Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M. A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Similar trends in hepatic gene expression have been observed for other LXR target genes such as cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is dependent on LXRα, but not LXRβ, expression (10Peet D.J.

RNA was extracted from liver and intestinal mucosa of the duodenum (D), jejunum (J), and ileum (I). Poly(A+) RNA was prepared from pooled RNA representing equal amounts from the eight mice per group, and 5 μg mRNA/lane was analyzed by Northern analysis. RNA was quantified by phosphorimaging and standardized against cyclophilin to reveal the relative mRNA levels (results for the smaller transcripts of ABCG5 and ABCG8 are shown; larger transcripts gave very similar relative expression changes).

Interestingly the expression levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8 were higher in tissues of lxrα/β−/− mice than wild-type mice fed control diets (Figs. 1 and 2). This increase in expression in lxrα/β-knockout mice has also been observed for other ABC transporters identified as LXR target genes such as ABCA1 and ABCG1 (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.-M. A.

The dietary cholesterol-induced increase in ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression observed only in mice harboring LXR suggested these genes were primary targets of the RXR/LXR heterodimer. To determine the specificity of this effect, wild-type mice were treated for 12 h with a series of synthetic agonists for a variety of nuclear hormone receptors (Fig. 3). This treatment protocol was previously shown to elicit increases in RNA levels of target genes for each of these nuclear receptors (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.-M. A. Medina J., Li, L.

A reproducible increase in expression of these genes was also seen in the liver, but not the intestine, of mice treated with the bile acids chenodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 3) and cholic acid (see Fig. 6 C below), which are known to be ligands for the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR. In these experiments all mice received diets supplemented with 0.2% cholesterol. The simultaneous feeding of cholesterol and bile acids results in increased hepatic sterol levels (33Beher W.T. Baker G.D. Penney D.G. J. Nutr. 1963; 79: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the up-regulation of ABCG5 and ABCG8 by bile acids under these conditions is mediated by LXR rather than being a direct effect of FXR. This mechanism, although possible, seems unlikely since other LXR target genes in the liver were not increased in mice fed bile acids under identical conditions (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2039579794,"Autophagy, responsible for the delivery of cytoplasmic components to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation, is the major degradative pathway in eukaryotic cells. This process requires a ubiquitin-like protein conjugation system, in which Apg12 is covalently bound to Apg5. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate further interacts with a small coiled-coil protein, Apg16. The Apg12-Apg5 and Apg16 are localized in the cytosol and pre-autophagosomal structures and play an essential role in autophagosome formation. Here we show that the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate and Apg16 form a ∼350-kDa complex in the cytosol. Because Apg16 was suggested to form a homo-oligomer, we generated an <i>in vivo</i> system that allowed us to control the oligomerization state of Apg16. With this system, we demonstrated that formation of the ∼350-kDa complex and autophagic activity depended on the oligomerization state of Apg16. These results suggest that the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate and Apg16 form a multimeric complex mediated by the Apg16 homo-oligomer, and formation of the ∼350-kDa complex is required for autophagy in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2069480316,"The proteomics analysis reported here shows that a major cellular response to oxidative stress is the modification of several peroxiredoxins. An acidic form of the peroxiredoxins appeared to be systematically increased under oxidative stress conditions. Peroxiredoxins are enzymes catalyzing the destruction of peroxides.

This strongly suggested that peroxiredoxins behave as a dam upon oxidative stress, being both important peroxide-destroying enzymes and peroxide targets.

Organisms living under aerobic conditions need to protect themselves against the damage caused by reactive oxygen species (O2⨪, H2O2, and OH⋅), arising from either the incomplete reduction of oxygen during cellular respiration or exposure to external agents such as light, ionizing radiation, or some redox drugs (1Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 2Fridovich I. Freeman B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 693-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reactive oxygen species can damage various components of living cells such as unsaturated lipids (giving rise to deleterious organic peroxides), proteins, or nucleic acids. To counter these deleterious processes, cells use several protective systems that either repair the various types of damage (e.g. DNA repair enzymes) or destroy the reactive oxygen species. One of the latter systems depends upon superoxide dismutases, which destroy O2⨪, but in turn produce hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can be destroyed by catalase, but this requires the hydrogen peroxide to reach the peroxisomes, where catalase is present. For destruction of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides without transport to the peroxisomes, various peroxidases exist that are present in many cellular compartments. Whereas catalase destroys H2O2 to produce water and molecular oxygen, peroxidases destroy peroxides by their reduction to the corresponding alcohol (or water) with the simultaneous oxidation of a specific cosubstrate. A typical example is glutathione peroxidase, which in destroying peroxides oxidizes glutathione from its thiol form to its disulfide form. The oxidized glutathione is then reduced back to its thiol form by glutathione reductase, using NADPH as the reducing agent. The final overall reaction is thus the destruction of peroxides to the corresponding alcohols (and/or water) and consumption of NADPH. Among the cellular enzymes using a peroxidase-like mechanism, peroxiredoxins represent a special case. These proteins constitute both the peroxidase and the cosubstrate because the enzyme itself is oxidized upon reaction with the peroxide. Whereas many peroxidases use either heme or selenocysteine in their active site, peroxiredoxins have a cysteine at their active site. The presence of additional conserved cysteines in the sequence is variable and provides the basis for the classification of the peroxiredoxins into two peroxiredoxin subfamilies that are differentiated by the presence of one or two conserved cysteine residues in their sequence (1-Cys and 2-Cys forms) (3Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The active site cysteine can be oxidized by the peroxide to either one of two forms: cysteine sulfenic acid in 1-Cys peroxiredoxins (4Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) or disulfide in the 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (5Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To complete the enzymatic catalytic cycle, the peroxiredoxins are then reduced back to their active thiol form, for example by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system for 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (5Chae H.Z.

Although they were described rather recently, the list of identified peroxiredoxins is growing rapidly, and their ubiquitous nature is apparent.

This hypothesis has received support by inactivation of the PRX1 gene in yeast (11Chae H.Z. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutation in a murine peroxiredoxin correlates with predisposition to atherosclerosis (12Phelan S.A. Johnson K.A. Beier D.R. Paigen B. Genomics. 1998; 54: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, little is known at the protein level in mammalian cells about the response to challenges by oxidative stress because most studies are carried out at the RNA level (e.g. Ref. 13Shull S. Heintz N.H. Periasamy M. Manohar M. Janssen Y.M.W. Marsh J.P. Mossman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24398-24403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a proteomic approach has been used quite successfully in yeast cells (14Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It showed a major reorientation in metabolism and an increase in the synthesis of antioxidant proteins. We therefore decided to investigate the response to oxidative stress in mammalian cells using a proteomics approach, which also detects putative posttranslational responses. An example of such a study can be found recently (15Mitsumoto A. Takanezawa Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nakagawa Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, some changes in peroxiredoxins were shown to occur upon oxidative stress, but these changes were not characterized. Jurkat T-cell lymphoma cells were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mm pyruvate, 10 μm mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Various oxidative stresses were applied before harvesting and cell lysis: (i) the cells (either attached or in suspension) were cultured for 0.5–6 h with 75–150 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or (ii) the cells were treated with 14 units/liter glucose oxidase for 18 h in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the supplements described above (16Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S. Nakayama K. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18633-18636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genotoxic stress was carried out by culturing the cells in the presence of 1 μm daunomycin for 18 h. For recovery studies, the cells were stressed for 0.5 h with 75 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The cells were then washed twice in complete medium without BHP and re-cultured for the desired period of time in BHP-free medium. Leydig cells were prepared from immature porcine testes (from 2–3-week-old animals) by collagenase treatment as described in Ref.17Benahmed M. Morera A.M. Chauvin M.A. De Peretti E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 50: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar. The recovered cells were cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes (20 × 106 cells/dish) at 32 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing sodium bicarbonate (1.2 mg/ml), 15 mm Hepes, and gentamycin (20 μg/ml). This medium was supplemented with insulin (2 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), and α-tocopherol (10 μg/ml). Cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α (Preprotech, Canton, MA) for 65 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA). A buffer volume approximately equal to the packed cell volume was used. The suspension was transferred to a polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 4 volumes (relative to the suspension volume) of 8.75m urea, 2.5 m thiourea, 25 mmspermine base, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. After 1 h at room temperature, the nucleic acids were removed by ultracentrifugation (30 min at 200,000 × g). The protein concentration in the supernatant fraction was determined by a Bradford assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Carrier ampholytes (0.4% final concentration) were added, and the protein extracts were stored at −20 °C. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, using home-made immobilized pH 4–8 gradients with pH plateaus at both ends (18Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The sample was loaded on the immobilized pH gradient strip by in-gel sample rehydration (18Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), using a urea-thiourea mixture as solubilizing agent (19Rabilloud T. Adessi C. Giraudel A. Lunardi J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). 120 μg of total extract were loaded on analytical gels (4-mm-wide immobilized pH gradient strips), and up to 2 mg of total extract were loaded on 6-mm-wide strips for micropreparative purposes. The isoelectric focusing was performed over 24 h for a total of 55,000 V-h. After equilibration of the isoelectric focusing strips (20Görg A. Postel W. Weser J. Günther S. Strahler J.R. Hanash S.M. Somerlot L. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 122-124Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar), SDS electrophoresis was performed on 10% gels. After two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, proteins were stained with silver (21Sinha P. Poland J. Schnolzer M. Rabilloud T. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or with zinc imidazole for subsequent mass spectrometry (22Rabilloud T. Charmont S. Rabilloud T. Proteome Research: Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Identification Methods. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 107-126Google Scholar). Silver-stained gels were analyzed with MELANIE software (Genebio). The analysis consisted of spot detection and quantification after noise and background removal. For each gel, the spots abundances were expressed in parts/million of the sum of the volumes of all the spots detected on the gel. This compensated for the variations in protein loading from one gel to another. Statistical analysis was carried out using a heteroscledastic t test. Excised, chopped, and dehydrated protein spots from gels were rehydrated on ice for 45 min in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 12.5 μg/μl sequencing grade pig trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 15 h. The resulting peptides were extracted by sequential extraction for 20 min each in 50-μl aliquots of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and, finally, 5% acetic acid in 50% acetonitrile. Combined extracts were concentrated in a Speed Vac to ∼5 μl, re-dissolved in 45 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid, and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant fractions were carefully transferred into a fresh tube and concentrated to ∼5 μl. Samples were loaded from a stainless steel chamber pressurized to 1000 p.s.i. onto fused silica capillary (75 μm, inner diameter) slurry packed to 8 cm with Magic C18 beads (Michrom, Auburn, CA). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile in 0.4% acetic acid and 0.005% hepta-fluorobutyric acid over 25 min at 300–400 nl/min. Electrospray ionization was conducted by applying 1.0 kV to a Valco stainless steel union. Capillary columns terminated inside the Valco union, and a fused silica capillary (5 cm × 75 μm × 360 μm) tapered to ∼5-μm inner diameter served as an emitter. The peptides eluting from the column were analyzed directly on a Finnigan tsq7000 mass spectrometer equipped with an in-house built microspray device. Data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired automatically by an Instrument Control Language procedure. Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched with SEQUEST (23Yates J.R. Eng J.K. Clauser K.R. Burlingame A.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spec. 1996; 7: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) against the OWL protein data base. For simple MALDI-TOF analysis, standard procedures were followed (24Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Porcine peroxiredoxin 2 was identified in porcine Leydig cell maps by image matching with a porcine erythrocyte two-dimensional map. This assignment was confirmed by comigration of 100 μg of total Leydig cell extract with 1 μg of porcine peroxiredoxin purified from pig erythrocytes by standard methods (25Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Yun C.H. Kim H.K. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further confirmation was obtained by MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting (24Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) on the putative porcine Prx2 spots obtained from gels loaded with Leydig cell extracts. In a search for protein modification occurring after oxidative stress, we used a proteomic approach on Jurkat cells stressed mildly with glucose oxidase or strongly with butyl hydroperoxide. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1. In the complete two-dimensional gel shown in Fig. 1, one of the most striking phenomena was the marked induction of an acidic satellite spot to peroxiredoxins. This phenomenon was most prominent for peroxiredoxin 2, which is the major enzyme of this family in Jurkat cells, and occurred for various types of oxidative stress. This spot is called acidic because its pI (5.45) is significantly more acidic than the theoretical pI of peroxiredoxin 2 (5.7), whereas the pI of the major spot present in normal lymphocytes and in Jurkat cells under normal culture conditions (5.8) fits the theoretical pI within <0.1 pH unit. The identity of the proteins in the acidic and basic spots was ascertained by MS/MS and in both cases proved to be peroxiredoxin 2. As also shown in Fig. 1, the appearance of an acidic spot also occurred for the mitochondrial peroxiredoxin, peroxiredoxin 3. These acidic spots appeared upon BHP treatment, but cell viability was severely hampered under these conditions because cells died within 6 h of treatment. We therefore investigated whether the acidic spots were associated with oxidative stress or just with cell death. These acidic satellite spots did not appear when other, nonoxidative stresses were used,e.g. treatment with genotoxic agents (1 μmdaunomycin, which induced complete cell death in 48 h), as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, when a strong oxidative stress was applied (BHP), the normal spots disappeared at the profit of the acidic ones within 30 min, whereas cell viability was still >90%. Conversely, under moderate stress conditions (glucose oxidase), the normal spots were still present after 24 h of treatment (as shown in Fig. 2 C), and cell viability was still around 85%.Figure 2Peroxiredoxin spots under various cell injury conditions. Whole cell extracts from Jurkat cells were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Only the 20–30-kDa region of the gels is shown. The peroxiredoxin spots (indicated by arrows) were identified by mass spectrometry. The cells were cultured under normal conditions (A), submitted to oxidative stress with 75 μm BHP for 30 min (B) or 14 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase for 18 h (C), or treated with 1 μm daunomycin for 18 h (D). The increase in the acidic spots is correlated with oxidative stress.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the modifications taking place in the acidic spots, both the normal and acidic spots from peroxiredoxin 2 were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. A modified peptide was found at the LC/MS stage as a peak occurring only in the acidic spot and not in the basic one (Fig. 3). The mass of this peak could correspond to the 30–61 peptide (i.e. with two missed trypsin cleavage sites at lysines 34 and 36) plus three oxygen atoms. To confirm this hypothesis, this peak was analyzed by collision-induced dissociation (Fig. 4). The y ion series identified the peptide as the active site region. A mass difference of 151 absolute mass units was detected between y11 and y10, indicative of the presence of a cysteinyl residue modified by three oxygen atoms. This allowed unequivocal assignment of the oxidation of Cys-51 to cysteic acid. The precision in the mass determination allowed us to exclude intermediate oxidation states of cysteine (namely cysteine sulfenic and sulfinic acids) and any other modification on this peptide. Thus, the acidic spot corresponded to the in vivo oxidation of peroxiredoxin 2 at Cys-51, which is the active site of the enzyme. This oxidation brought an extra negative charge to the protein, resulting in the lower pI observed on the gels. It must be noted that this extra negative charge made the analysis of the peptide by mass spectrometry much more difficult, as shown by the 50 pmol of modified protein required for this determination. These elevated levels prevented us from carrying out the same experiments on peroxiredoxin 3, which gave significantly lower yields than peroxiredoxin 2 in the required micropreparative two-dimensional gels (2 mg of total extract loaded on the strip; data not shown).Figure 4Collision-induced dissociation spectrum of the modified peptide. The collision-induced dissociation spectrum of the m/z 1281 peak provided enough sequence data for unequivocal assignment to peptide 30–61 (i.e. with two missed trypsin cleavage sites) in a triple-charged state and with a modification. A partial MS/MS spectrum of this peak is shown with the assignment of some ions, leading to sequence information. The number in parentheses below or above each amino acid is its position in the sequence of the protein. Some numbers have been omitted to limit the crowding of the figure. The roman series(b and y) corresponds to single-charged fragment ions, whereas the italic series corresponds to double-charged fragment ions. These assignments, together with the mass of the peptide, allowed unequivocal assignment of the modification as the oxidation of Cys-51 to cysteic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, due to the high sequence conservation between peroxiredoxin 2 and 3, we speculate that the acidic peroxiredoxin 3 spot also corresponds to an oxidized form at the active site. This has also been suggested in previous work (26Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Chemically speaking, oxidation of cysteine to cysteic acid is likely to be irreversible under biological conditions. To investigate cell recovery after oxidative stress, we first stressed the cells with BHP for 30 min and then let the cells recover in a BHP-free medium for various periods of time. The cellular extracts were then analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table I. It must be noted that the amount of the modified spots remained unchanged for at least 3 h, whereas that of the normal spots increased back to the original levels. After 24 h of recovery, the cells showed normal levels of normal peroxiredoxin 2 but still showed elevated levels of the oxidized form. Although we cannot formally exclude that the retroreduction of the oxidized form of Prx2 may play a role during recovery of the normal levels of the normal form, the fact that there is a significant increase in the total Prx2 (i.e. normal + oxidized), at least in the early phases of the recovery process (p < 0.01 at 1 and 6 h, p < 0.001 at 3 h), strongly suggested that the recovery of the normal spots occurred mainly through de novo synthesis. This is further evidenced by the persistence of high levels of oxidized Prx2 during the early phases of the recovery process (the variation in oxidized Prx2 is not statistically significant during the first 3 h of recovery). However, when we tried to block de novo synthesis with cycloheximide or emetine during the recovery period to confirm this hypothesis, massive cell death occurred and precluded any analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This was not the case when these protein synthesis inhibitors were used on unstressed cells for the same period of time.Table IQuantitative variation of the normal and oxidized forms of peroxiredoxinsSpot value1-aThe values in the table are the sum of the spots visualized on the entire gels, entered as mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly enough, the recovery kinetics were quite different for peroxiredoxin 2 (cytosolic) and peroxiredoxin 3 (mitochondrial). Whereas peroxiredoxin 2 recovery was >60% complete in 3 h and >80% complete in 6 h (see Table I), peroxiredoxin 3 recovery was barely visible after 6 h and was not complete even after 24 h. In addition, the level of oxidized Prx3 decreased steadily during the recovery process. This decrease is significant as early as 1 h (p < 0.03 at 1 h, p < 0.01 at 3 h, and p < 0.001 at 6 h), whereas the recovery of the normal form is significant only at 24 h. This means that the level of the oxidized form decreased, whereas that of the normal form did not increase in parallel. These data argue strongly against regeneration of Prx3 by a retroreduction of the oxidized form. They are also in agreement with the previous observation that Prx3, probably in its oxidized form, is a substrate for the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease (26Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because the results described above were obtained in transformed cells undergoing an experimental oxidative stress in vitro, we decided to investigate whether the same phenomena could occur under more physiological conditions and in a system where cell viability issues would not bias the results. As a model, we chose porcine Leydig cells in primary culture, which have been shown to be completely resistant to TNF-induced cell death (27Rey C. Mauduit C. Naureils O. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Gasnier F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and thus remain fully viable under these conditions. This provided us with a means to eliminate any interference that could result from cell death or mortal wounding without needing to strongly overexpress peroxiredoxins to restore viability (28Zhang P.

We transformed a mutant impaired in CO(2) uptake and in cmpA-D encoding a HCO(3)(-)transporter with a transposon inactivation library, and we recovered mutants unable to take up HCO(3)(-) and grow in low CO(2) at pH 9.0. They are all tagged within slr1512 (designated sbtA). We show that SbtA-mediated transport is induced by low CO(2), requires Na(+), and plays the major role in HCO(3)(-) uptake in Synechocystis. Inactivation of slr1509 (homologous to ntpJ encoding a Na(+)/K(+)-translocating protein) abolished the ability of cells to grow at [Na(+)] higher than 100 mm and severely depressed the activity of the SbtA-mediated HCO(3)(-) transport. We propose that the SbtA-mediated HCO(3)(-) transport is driven by DeltamuNa(+) across the plasma membrane, which is disrupted by inactivating ntpJ. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that two types of sbtA exist in various cyanobacterial strains, all of which possess ntpJ. The sbtA gene is the first one identified as essential to Na(+)-dependent HCO(3)(-) transport in photosynthetic organisms and may play a crucial role in carbon acquisition when CO(2) supply is limited, or in Prochlorococcus strains that do not possess CO(2) uptake systems or Cmp-dependent HCO(3)(-) transport."

Mutations in the region of human LMNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal tail Lamin A/C are associated with forms of muscular dystrophy and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). To help discriminate tissue-specific phenotypes, we have solved at 1.4-A resolution the three-dimensional crystal structure of the lamin A/C globular tail. The domain adopts a novel, all beta immunoglobulin-like fold. FPLD-associated mutations cluster within a small surface, whereas muscular dystrophy-associated mutations are distributed throughout the protein core and on its surface.

The human AHSG gene is located on chromosome 3q27, and two common allelic forms have been identified that correlate with different bone phenotypes (3Sebetan I.M. Heshmat M.M. Z. Rechtsmed. 1988; 101: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Homozygosity for AHSG*1 allele is associated with shorter stature and reduced bone quality measured by calcaneal broadband ultrasound (4Zmuda J.M. Eichner J.E. Ferrell R.E. Bauer D.C. Kuller L.H. Cauley J.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 63: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further interest stems from the observations that elevated serum AHSG correlates with a common form of mild osteogenesis imperfecta (5Dickson I.R. Bagga M. Paterson C.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas depressed levels are observed in Paget's disease, a condition characterized by increased bone turnover (6Ashton B.A. Smith R. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1980; 58: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). AHSG is also a reverse acute-phase reactant, as serum levels decline by 20–30% during acute inflammation (7Lebreton J.P. Joisel F. Raoult J.P. Lannuzel B. Rogez J.P. Humbert G. J. Clin.

The latter is a disulfide-looped sequence in the N-terminal cystatin domain from Cys-96 to Cys-114 (human sequence) which shares homology with the extracellular domain of TGF-β receptor type II (TβRII) (Cys-84 to Cys-101). In surface plasmon resonance assays, these peptides bind to TGF-β and BMP cytokines with specificity characteristic of native ASHG and TβRII, suggesting they are the major cytokine-binding domains in each glycoprotein (10Demetriou M.

ASHG binds to TGF-β cytokines with KD values ranging from 0.03 to 2.0 μmfor BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 in rank order. Furthermore, ASHG blocked TGF-β1 and BMP-2 anti-proliferative and osteogenic activities in cell culture (10Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol.

Although the affinity of these interactions is modest, the serum concentration of ASHG is ∼12 μm, and based on mass action, ASHG would be expected to influence cytokine availability in vivo. The on and off rates for ASHG-cytokine binding are slow (10Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol.

Endogenous TGF-β1 in rat bone marrow cell cultures is required for differentiation, but at ≥10 pm TGF-β1 completely inhibits mineralization. Osteogenesis was observed to be maximal at ∼1 pmTGF-β1, and as might be expected, addition of either ASHG or neutralizing anti-TGF-β1 antibodies increased the required TGF-β1. Therefore, osteogenesis depends on a molar ratio of ASHG to cytokine, suggesting that ASHG may establish morphogenic fields for osteo-induction and thereby control bone remodeling. Osteogenesis in rat bone marrow cell cultures was optimal at ∼1/300,000 molar ratio of TGF-β1 to ASHG which reflects the relative physiological levels and activities of these proteins (12Binkert C.

Skeletogenesis precedes expression and accumulation of ASHG in mineralizing bone, and indeed Ahsg−/− mice display no obvious anatomical abnormalities at birth (23Jahnen-Dechent W. Schinke T. Tridl A.

However, bone is continuously remodeled during adult life, a process whereby osteoclasts degrade the bone and release cytokines, in turn stimulating osteoblast recruitment from bone marrow to restore the bone. It is possible that bone and serum-derived ASHG bind the released cytokines near the remodeling surface and regulate osteogenic activity. Here we have examined femur histology and geometry, as well as bone structural and dynamic properties in young and old Ahsg−/− mice and their ASHG-expressing littermates. Bone formation was increased and maximum load enhanced in Ahsg−/− mice, whereas chondrogenesis and longitudinal bone growth were impaired. Furthermore, ectopic bone formation in response to intramuscular BMP cytokine implants was enhanced in ASHG-deficient mice, consistent with loss of a negative regulator of osteogenesis. TGF-β/BMP cytokines are known to accumulate in mineralized bone and contribute to chondrogenesis and osteogenesis (24Pelton R.W. Saxena B. Jones M. Moses H.L. Gold L.I. J.

These results also suggest that an age-related imbalance between cytokine and antagonist levels may lead to bone diseases. ASHG-deficient mice were generated by targeted gene mutation in embryonic cells, which removed the entire coding region of the gene as described previously (23Jahnen-Dechent W. Schinke T. Tridl A.

An equal distribution of male and female mice with Ahsg−/−, Ahsg+/−, and Ahsg+/+ genotypes on a 129/sv × C57BL/6 background were generated for the analysis, and the data from both sexes were averaged. Dissected femurs were fixed in 10% formalin for 7 days, decalcified in 10% formic acid, then dehydrated through a series of ethanol (20–100%) and xylene solutions, and finally embedded in paraffin (Paraplast X-Tra). Blocks were softened with mollifex (BDH) and then sectioned. The sections were deparaffinized, hydrated through xylene and ethanol, incubated with a 1/500 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse ASHG antibody in 1.5% serum in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, then incubated with 1/5000 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody, and developed with the horseradish peroxidase substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Three-month-old mice were injected in the tail vein with 10 mg of tetracycline/kg at 10 and 3 days prior to sacrifice. The femurs were dissected and cut coronally, and both halves were fixed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated through increasing strengths of acetone, infiltrated in increasing strengths of spurr/acetone solutions, and embedded undecalcified in polymerized plastic spurr blocks. Blocks were cut into a series of three 5-μm sections and one 7-μm section. The 7-μm section was left unstained for dynamic morphometry. Unstained sections were examined with a fluorescent source and the Bioquant OS2 software to measure length of single label, length of double label, and distance between labels. The 5-μm section next in series to the unstained section was stained using a modified Masson-Goldner trichrome technique that permits optimal discrimination between mineralized and non-mineralized (osteoid) bone (30Villanueva A. J. Histotechnol. 1988; 11: 249-251Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The next section in the series was stained with toluidine blue to enumerate osteoblasts on trabecular bone surfaces and adipocytes in the marrow. The final section in the series was stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase to enumerate osteoclasts. Sections were viewed with a semi-automatic image analyzer (Leitz ASM, Wetzlar, France) and quantified using an IBM-PC microcomputer and Bioquant image analysis software. Static and dynamic parameters of trabecular bone were analyzed by histomorphometric methods, which complied with the nomenclature, and were calculated according to the ASBMR Histomorphometric Nomenclature Committee (31Parfitt A.M. Drezner M. Glorieux F. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 2: 597-610Google Scholar). Data for male and female mice calculated separately showed the same relative differences. Destructive three-point bending was performed on the right femurs of mice using a screw-driven mechanical testing machine (Instron model 1011, Canton, MA). Each bone was placed on two supports spaced 6.7 mm apart, and a load was applied to the bone midway between the supports at a deformation rate of 1 mm/min. From the load displacement curve, the maximum load and maximum displacement were measured, and the stiffness was determined from a linear regression of the initial portion of the curve. The length, diameter, and cortical thickness of the bones were determined using digital calipers. Dual Energy x-ray absorptiometry (Pixi Mus, Lunar Corp., Madison, WI) was used to measure bone mineral content, bone area, and bone mineral density (BMD) of femurs. Femoral bones were removed under aseptic conditions from adult male Wistar rats (120 g), cleaned of adherent soft tissues, and washed extensively in antibiotics. The distal ends were removed, and the marrow contents were flushed out with 10 ml of culture medium. The cells were dispersed by repeated passage through a 20-gauge needle and incubated in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml), antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.3 μg/ml fungizone), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10−8 m dexamethasone, and vitamin C. Following 6 days of culture, the cells were re-plated at a density of 1 × 102 cells/mm2 in 96-well plates, and grown for another 12–14 days without dexamethasone and with 10 nm recombinant BMP-2. At the end of culture, the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and stained for calcium with Alizarin Red-s to identify mineralized bone nodules. To quantify mineralized tissue formation in the cultures, the absorbance at 525 nm was measured using a 96-well plate reader. For the analysis of ectopic bone formation, cytokine embedded in gelatin capsules was implanted into the thigh muscle of mice, using 12 mice per genotype. The capsules contained 5 mg of native human BMP cytokine, extracted and purified from demineralized human bone matrix as described previously (32Mizutani H. Urist M.R. Clin. Orthop. 1982; 171: 213-223PubMed Google Scholar). Serum ASHG was reduced by ∼50% in Ahsg+/− and absent in the Ahsg −/− mice as reported previously (23Jahnen-Dechent W. Schinke T. Tridl A.

ASHG protein was concentrated in the mineralized regions of bones (2Dickson I.R. Poole A.R. Veis A.

The density of ASHG protein displayed heterogeneity in trabecular bone, possibly due to variations in when the bone was last remodeled (Fig. 1 E). ASHG protein was more concentrated in bone surrounding osteocytes (Fig. 1 F), cells that are encased in bone and respond to mechanical stress by secreting paracrine factors that stimulate bone remodeling (33Huiskes R. Ruimerman R. van Lenthe G.H. Janssen J.D. Nature. 2000; 405: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Because polymorphic differences in the coding region of human AHSG correlate with differences in stature, we examined femur growth plate histology and dimensions in the mice. Balanced groups of littermates representing all three genotypes were used throughout our studies. The femur growth plates in 3-month-old Ahsg−/− mice were fragmented, and chondrocytes within the growth plate were poorly organized (Fig. 2, A and B). Twice as many discontinuities or breaks in growth plates were observed in Ahsg−/− compared with Ahsg+/+ mice, and cartilage islands in the metaphysis were 6-fold more frequent in Ahsg−/− mice (Fig. 2, C and D). The cartilage islands failed to calcify as indicated by lack of von Kossa staining, which could indicate a failure of osteoclast remodeling (data not shown). Chondrocytes are normally arranged in vertical columns in the growth plate, where they undergo a spatially precise program of differentiation regulated by Indian hedgehog (Ihh), parathyroid hormone-related peptide, and BMP cytokines (34Bailon-Plaza A.

Chondrocyte appeared disorganized (Fig. 2, E and F), and the number of columns per growth plate was reduced by 53% in Ahsg−/− and unchanged in Ahsg+/− compared with wild type mice (Fig. 2 G). Hypertrophic chondrocytes per growth plate were reduced in Ahsg−/− mice but significantly increased in Ahsg+/− mice (Fig. 3 H), whereas total chondrocyte cell counts per growth plate were not significantly different between genotypes (data not shown).Figure 3Geometric and structural properties of femurs in Ahsg +/+,Ahsg +/−, and Ahsg −/− ice. The length (A), cortical thickness (B), bone mineral content (C), bone mineral density (D), maximum load (failure) (E), and energy (F) were measured in Ahsg+/+, Ahsg+/−, and Ahsg−/− mice at 3–4 and 12–18 months. The energy and load were determined by three-point bending of femurs.

Accordingly, the deficiency in growth plate chondrocyte maturation was associated with reduced longitudinal bone growth in Ahsg−/− mice. Femur length in Ahsg−/− mice compared with wild type age-matched mice was reduced by 9% at 3–4 months and by 14.7% at 12–18 months (Fig. 3 A). However, femoral cortical thickness was significantly increased in the Ahsg−/− mice at both 3–4 and 12–18 months of age, indicating an increase in osteoblastic activity relative to osteoclastic activity in Ahsg−/− mice (Fig. 3 B). Heterozygous mice were not significantly different from wild type for these measurements. Changes in cortical thickness are expected to alter the mechanical and structural properties of bone. Bone mineral content and bone area were determined using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis of mice at 3–4 months and at 12–18 months of age. The Ahsg−/− mice displayed no significant change in bone mineral content, but BMD, which is bone mineral content normalized to bone area, was increased by 15% in the older Ahsg−/− mice as compared with wild type and heterozygous littermates (Fig. 3, C and D). Mechanical properties of femurs were measured at 3–4 and 12–18 months of age using a three-point bending test. Maximum load normally increases with age as we observed here for all genotypes. No differences between genotypes were observed in young mice, but the older Ahsg −/− mice displayed a higher maximum load, consistent with greater BMD and femoral cortical thickness in these mice (Fig. 3 E). The energy to fracture normally decreases with age, but this value increased significantly in the older Ahsg −/− mice (Fig. 3 F). TGF-β/BMP can induce progenitor cells in bone marrow cultures to differentiate along different cell lineages depending on the cytokine concentrations (12Binkert C. Demetriou M. Sukhu B. Szweras M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2195-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Adipocytes in the bone marrow of Ahsg−/− mice were increased 5-fold compared with wild type and heterozygous mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Osteoblasts per trabecular surface were also increased by 60% in Ahsg−/− mice, whereas the osteoclasts per trabecular surface were not significantly different (Fig. 4,C and D). These observations suggest that progenitor cell recruitment along adipogenic and osteogenic lineages occurs at a higher frequency in Ahsg−/− mice compared with age-matched Ahsg+/+ and Ahsg+/− mice. Furthermore, increased osteoblast content and cortical bone thickness indicate that net bone formation rates were enhanced in Ahsg−/− mice (Fig. 3 B and Fig. 4 C). To measure directly the dynamic parameters of bone remodeling, newly forming bone was pulse-labeled with two intravenous injections of tetracycline administered 7 days apart (Fig. 4 E). The mineralizing surface and mineral formation rates were increased 50 and 100% in Ahsg−/− mice compared with Ahsg+/+ and Ahsg+/− mice, respectively (Fig. 4, F and G), consistent with observed differences in osteoblasts/surface (Fig. 4 C). Surprisingly, mineralizing surface and mineral formation rates were significantly decreased in Ahsg+/− mice compared with control mice (Fig. 4, F and G). Correspondingly, mineralization lag time was decreased in Ahsg−/− and increased in Ahsg+/− compared with wild type mice (Fig. 4 H). The histomorphometric measurements of trabecular bone at 3 months of age also indicate an unusual relationship between the ASHG genotypes. Although Ahsg−/− and Ahsg+/+ mice were similar, the heterozygous mice differed significantly for several parameters. Trabecular number and trabecular surface were increased and trabecular separation reduced in Ahsg+/−, whereas total trabecular bone volume was not significantly different between genotypes (Table I). Therefore, the trabecular lattice in Ahsg−/− mice appeared to be of a finer meshwork than that observed in either wild type or ASHG-deficient mice.Table IStatic parameters of femoral trabecular bone from Ahsg+/+, Ahsg+/−, and Ahsg−/− mice at 3 monthsParameterAhsg +/+Ahsg +/−Ahsg −/−Trabecular bone volume (%)11.25 ± 0.9413.03 ± 1.0412.96 ± 1.40Mineralized trabecular bone volume (%)10.73 ± 0.8812.58 ± 1.0112.38 ± 1.42Osteoid volume (%)4.57 ± 0.553.48 ± 0.815.06 ± 1.01Osteoid surface (%)25.60 ± 2.9817.50 ± 2.5928.10 ± 2.841-ap < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg−/−.Osteoid thickness (μm)3.02 ± 0.223.08 ± 0.473.25 ± 0.23Trabecular thickness (μm)34.73 ± 2.1231.77 ± 1.2240.06 ± 2.471-ap < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg−/−.Eroded surface (%)0.70 ± 0.120.58 ± 0.130.59 ± 0.09Trabecular number (mm−1)3.22 ± 0.171-bp < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg+/+ groups, by Student's t test.4.04 ± 0.253.20 ± 0.191-ap < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg−/−.Trabecular separation (μm)287.04 ± 20.251-bp < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg+/+ groups, by Student's t test.223.02 ± 22.84283.56 ± 17.701-ap < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg−/−.Total trabecular surface (μm)6735.19 ± 413.711-bp < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg+/+ groups, by Student's t test.8407.51 ± 558.406392.47 ± 447.501-ap < 0.05 between Ahsg+/− and Ahsg−/−.Total osteoid surface (μm)1645.10 ± 196.451430.77 ± 276.551769.71 ± 193.18Femurs were stained with trichrome, and histomorphometric measurements were taken on eight fields per section from 12 Ahsg+/+, 8 Ahsg+/−, and 12 Ahsg−/− mice.

Lacking the antagonist activity, ASHG-deficient mice were expected to be more susceptible to the bone morphogenic activity of exogenous cytokine. To test the hypothesis in vivo, mice were implanted intramuscularly with pellets containing bone morphogenic cytokines, and ectopic bone formation was measured 4 weeks later. Mineral content and mineralized area at the implant site were significantly greater in Ahsg −/− and Ahsg+/− mice compared with Ahsg +/+ mice (Fig. 5,B and C). The mineralized area displayed the morphology of bone, with osteoblasts on the bone surface, encased osteocytes, and marrow-like compartments (Fig. 5, D and E). Thus, exogenous cytokine induced a greater area of ectopic osteogenesis in Ahsg −/− and Ahsg+/− mice, confirming an interaction between ASHG and cytokine in the regulation of osteogenesis in vivo. ASHG is a TGF-β/BMP antagonist that localizes to mineralized bone, and here we have examined ASHG-deficient mice for bone defects that might be associated with a hyperactive cytokine environment. Chondrocyte differentiation and organization in the growth plate was impaired, and this was accompanied by slower longitudinal bone growth in Ahsg−/− mice compared with Ahsg+/+ and Ahsg+/− mice. An excess of cytokine activity in the Ahsg−/− growth plate may cause this phenotype, as exogenous TGF-β1 has been shown to prevent terminal differentiation of cells in growth plate explants into hypertrophic chondrocytes (37Ballock R.T. Heydemann A. Wakefield L.M. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 414-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The disruption of chondrocyte organization in the epiphyseal growth plate of Ahsg−/− mice may also be due in part to a defect in positioning of prechondrocytes into columnar structures. In this regard, mice lacking the BMP antagonist noggin are"

Although cytosolic Ca2+ has been assumed to play a key role in pacemaking, Ca2+ movements in ICC have not yet been examined in detail. In the present study, using cultured cell clusters isolated from mouse small intestine, we demonstrated Ca2+oscillations in ICC. Fluo-4 was loaded to the cell cluster, the relative amount of cytosolic Ca2+ was recorded, and ICC were identified by c-Kit immunoreactivity. We specifically detected Ca2+ oscillation in ICC in the presence of dihydropyridine, which abolishes Ca2+ oscillation in smooth muscles. The oscillation was coupled to the electrical activity corresponding to slow waves, and it depended on Ca2+ influx through a non-selective cation channel, which was SK&F 96365-sensitive and store-operated. We further demonstrated the presence of transient receptor potential-like channel 4 (TRP4) in caveolae of ICC.

Nature. 1995; 373: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Expression of c-kit and/or c-Kit receptors has been used commonly as a marker of ICC in the GI muscle layers, and it also enables the isolation of ICC. Recent electrophysiological studies using isolated ICC have demonstrated periodic oscillations of the membrane current (9Thomsen L. Robinson T.L. Lee J.C.F. Farraway L.A. Hughes M.J.G. Andrews D.W. Huizinga J.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 10Koh S.D. Sanders K.M. Ward S.M. J. Physiol.

Thus, ICC have been considered as pacemaker cells in recent years. The intrinsic properties underlying the pacemaking mechanism in ICC have been emphasized in previous reports (11Lee J.C.F. Thuneberg L. Berezin I. Huizinga J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G409-G423PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that generation of electrical rhythmicity involves Ca2+ release through inositol trisphosphate (IP3) type 1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent Ca2+ entry into mitochondria (12Suzuki H. Takano H. Yamamoto Y. Komuro T. Saito M. Kato K. Mikoshiba K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 105-111Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Ward S.M. Ördög T. Koh S.D. Baker S.A. Jun J.Y. Amberg G.

From these results, periodic rises in the cytosolic (intracellular) Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) are considered to play a key role in generating slow waves. However, such [Ca2+]i oscillation has not yet been analyzed precisely. Currently, using Ca2+ imaging techniques, Yamazawa and Iino (15Yamazawa T. Iino M. J. Physiol. (Lond). 2002; 538: 823-835Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have demonstrated Ca2+transients in ICC and longitudinal smooth muscles. Their results suggested that [Ca2+]i plays a crucial role in pacemaking and that Ca2+ imaging at the tissue level is a useful technique to investigate slow wave propagation in GI muscle. It is, however, necessary to clearly identify the distribution of ICC and [Ca2+]i in order to analyze the mechanism underlying the generation of electrical rhythmicity in ICC. In the present study we recorded fluorescent Ca2+ images in which ICC were identified by c-Kit immunostaining in small cell clusters isolated from GI muscle. The observed [Ca2+]i oscillation was sensitive to neither TTX nor dihydropyridine so that it was isolated from [Ca2+]i in smooth muscles in the presence of nifedipine. In contrast to the intracellular Ca2+ circuit, periodic activation of plasmalemmal channels to generate pacemaker current has not been demonstrated, although several candidates such as non-selective cation channels including TRPs, Cl−channels, and/or Ca2+-activated K+ channels have been reported (5Horowitz B. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 19-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Huizinga J.D. Thuneberg L. Klüppel M. Malysz J. Mikkelsen H.B. Bernstein A.

To address this, we investigated the pharmacological properties of [Ca2+]i oscillation and the influx in ICC using cultured cell clusters. We also examined expression of putative channels by immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate that [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC requires a Ca2+ influx and that TRP4 is at best a candidate for the mediator. BALB/c mice (10–15 days after birth) of either sex were used. Animals were treated according to the Guide to Animal Use and Care of the Nagoya University School of Medicine. Smooth muscle layers of small intestines were separated from the mucosa, cut into small pieces, and incubated in Ca2+-free Hanks' solution containing collagenase (1.3 mg/ml, Wako Chemical), trypsin inhibitors (2 mg/ml), ATP (0.27 mg/ml), and bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) for 40–45 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with an enzyme-free solution (without collagenase and trypsin inhibitors), the muscle pieces were triturated with fire-blunted glass pipettes. The resultant small cell clusters were placed onto murine collagen-coated coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes and incubated in a culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 units/ml), and penicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. After 2–4 days of incubation, the cultured cell clusters were used for Ca2+imaging. The cultured cell clusters were incubated for 2 h (at room temperature) in a modified Krebs solution containing 10 μm fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Dojindo) and detergents (0.02% Pluronic F-127, Dojindo; or 0.02% cremophor EL, Sigma). A CCD camera system (Argus HiSCA, Hamamatsu Photonics) combined with an inverted microscope was used to monitor oscillation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). [Ca2+]i in ICC was measured in the presence of 1 μm nifedipine (Sigma). The cell clusters were illuminated at 488 nm, and fluorescent emissions of 515–565 nm were recorded at an intensity of fluo-4. Digital Ca2+ images (328 × 247 pixels) were normally collected at 100–400-ms intervals. Because fluo-4 is a single wavelength indicator, it was not possible to apply the ratiometric method for quantitative determination of [Ca2+]i. Therefore, the intensity of fluo-4 fluorescence was normalized in the temporal analysis. The temporal fluorescence intensity of the dyes (Ft) was divided by the fluorescence intensity at the start (F0). These relative values represent integrated [Ca2+]i. After recording the fluorescence intensity with nifedipine, localization of ICC were examined by c-Kit immunohistochemistry, and small c-Kit-positive points (2 μm in diameter) were analyzed as [Ca2+]i in ICC. c-Kit-negative points of the same size were recorded as non-ICC regions. During Ca2+ imaging, the temperature of the recording chamber was kept at 35 °C using a modified micro-warm plate system (DC-MP10DM, Kitazato Supply), and the bath solution was circulated at 0.5 ml/s. In some cell clusters, electrical activity was also measured using a differential amplifier (DP-301, Warner Instruments) and a recticorder (RJG-4022, Nihon Koden). The amplifier was operated in an AC mode (high pass = 0.1 Hz; gain = 1,000). A cut-off frequency of 100 Hz was applied to reduce the noise. Glass pipettes with tips smaller than 10 μm in diameter were filled with modified Krebs solution (see below) and put on the middle of cell clusters during Ca2+ imaging. The cell clusters used for Ca2+ imaging were treated for 5 min with rat anti-c-Kit antibody (ACK2, 10 μg/ml) (7Torihashi S. Ward S.M. Nishikawa S.-I. Nishi K. Kobayashi S. Sanders K.M. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 280: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) conjugated with Alexa Fluoro 594 (Molecular Probes). After washing with modified Krebs solution, the cell clusters were fixed with ice-cold acetone for 2 min and observed using a confocal laser microscope (LSM5 PASCAL, Zeiss). These samples were incubated with mouse anti-γ-enteric actin antibody (1:200; ICN Pharmaceuticals) again and subsequently treated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC (1:200; Vector Laboratories) followed by re-examination of the same clusters using confocal microscopy. Instead of the procedure described above, some cell clusters were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 at 4 °C) for 30 min. They were then incubated with rabbit anti-PGP9.5 antibody (1:8,000; UltraClone) and treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Texas Red (1:200, Vector Laboratories) for confocal microscopy. To examine TRP4 immunoreactivity on ICC, muscle layers fixed with ice-cold acetone for 5 min were treated as whole mount preparations for double labeling with rabbit anti-TRP4 antibody (1:100, either from Alomon Laboratories corresponding to residues 943–958 of mouse TRP4 or Ab236 corresponding to residues 969–981 of bovine TRP4) (20Philipp S. Trost C.T. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalié A. Hoth M. Flokerzi V. J. Biol.

They were detected by goat anti-rabbit IgG with FITC and goat anti-rat IgG with Texas Red (Vector Laboratories). Rabbit anti-TRP6 antibody (1:100; Alomon Laboratories, corresponding to residues 24–38 of mouse TRP6) was also used in the same manner. Another double staining with anti-TRP4 and mouse anti-caveolin 1 antibodies (1:20; BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was tried to cultured cell clusters after Ca2+ imaging and demonstrated by goat anti-rabbit IgG with Texas Red and goat anti-mouse IgG with FITC, respectively. The specificity of immunoreactivity was checked by controls in which primary antibodies were omitted from the initial incubation. For an examination of the expression of TRP4 and TRP6 in the muscle layer, Western blotting was carried out. The muscle layer was homogenized, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed by anti-TRP4 and anti-TRP6 antibodies. Antibodies preincubated with excess antigens were also used to check the specificity and were applied to both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (AmershamBiosciences), and reactions were visualized using Supersignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce). Muscle layers were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and cut into small pieces. After fixation for 30 min at 4 °C, samples were infused with a mixture of sucrose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma) (21Tokuyasu K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryo-sections (50–70 nm) were incubated with rabbit anti-TRP4 antibody (1:100, Ab236) and processed for indirect immunostaining with 5-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The sections were embedded in a mixture of 2% methylcellulose (Nacalai Tesque) and 0.5% uranyl acetate (22Griffiths G. Simons K. Warren G. Tokuyasu T.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 96: 466-483Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). They were then examined using an electron microscope (H-7000, Hitachi). The modified Krebs solution was used as a normal solution in Ca2+ measurements and had the following composition: NaCl, 125 mm; KCl, 5.9 mm; CaCl2, 2.5 mm; MgCl2, 1.2 mm; glucose, 11.8 mm, and Hepes, 11.8 mm. pH was adjusted to 7.4–7.5 with Tris base. For a Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was replaced with NaCl. Several salts such as MnCl2, NiCl2, LaCl3, and CdCl2 were added to the bath solution. SK&F 96365 and thapsigargin were purchased from Biomol. Numerical data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Small pieces of tissue developed into round or ovoid clusters after 2–4 days in culture and were attached to coverslips. The clusters were mainly composed of smooth muscle cells positively stained with anti-γ-enteric actin antibody (Fig. 1, A and B), and most of them included c-Kit-positive ICC. The distribution pattern of ICC, however, was disturbed (Fig. 1 C). In large cell clusters (more than 100 μm in diameter), enteric neurons were also included (Fig. 1 D). Under superfusion with a modified Krebs solution at 35 °C, the cultured cell clusters showed periodic contractions at a rate of 19 ± 3.8 cycles/min (n = 27). The contractions were always associated with periodic depolarization in the cell membrane,i.e. slow waves (measured using patch clamp techniques). 2S. Nakayama and S. Torihashi, unpublished data. Emission light of fluo-4 in these clusters was monitored using a CCD camera system. Fig. 2 shows an example of such experiments, and the movement of [Ca2+]i is indicated by pseudocolor ratio images (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the amount of fluorescent dye loaded to each cell varied, many cells clearly showed a synchronized [Ca2+]i oscillation followed by contractions of the cluster. In Fig. 2 C changes in the fluorescence intensity were measured at the three points indicated in Fig. 2, A and B. [Ca2+]i oscillation was also monitored in the presence of 250 nm TTX, which should have completely suppressed nerve activities. Neither periodic changes in the [Ca2+]i concentration nor contractility were affected by this treatment (data not shown). Dihydropyridine derivatives (nifedipine), which selectively block voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels and consequently prevent smooth muscle contraction, are known to scarcely affect slow waves in the mouse small intestine. In the presence of nifedipine, we further examined properties of [Ca2+]i oscillation in cultured cell clusters. There were regional dihydropyridine-resistant [Ca2+]i oscillations in the cluster although the contractile activity of the cluster was suppressed (Fig. 3, A–C). Points 1 and 2 in Fig. 3, A and B indicate regions inside a cluster showing such [Ca2+]i oscillation during exposure to 1 μm nifedipine. On the other hand, point 3 in Fig. 3, A and B did not show such movement. The maximal and minimal levels of [Ca2+]i indicated by pseudocolor ratio images during [Ca2+]i oscillation are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The time course analysis of [Ca2+]i oscillation is presented in Fig. 3 E (dihydropyridine-resistant at points 1 and 2 and dihydropyridine-sensitive at point 3). The frequency of dihydropyridine-resistant [Ca2+]i oscillation was 21 ± 4.1 cycles/min (n = 30), and results similar to that were seen in the solution without nifedipine described above. The phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 3 C) and c-Kit immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3 D) obtained from the same cell cluster used in Fig. 3, A–D indicate localization of c-Kit-positive cells in the cluster. Points 1–3 in Fig. 3 D respectively correspond to those indicated in Fig. 3, A and B. Comparison of Fig. 3, A and B with Fig. 3 D clearly demonstrates that points 1 and 2 correspond to c-Kit immunopositive regions and generate [Ca2+]i oscillation. On the other hand, point 3 originated from a c-Kit-negative region and did not show [Ca2+]i oscillation. We obtained similar results in 30 of 35 cell clusters examined. This indicates that ICC identified by c-Kit immunostaining show dihydropyridine-resistant [Ca2+]i oscillation and that they play an important role in generating spontaneous rhythmicity in the cluster. Electrical activity corresponding to slow waves was measured using an extracellular recording technique. Simultaneous recordings of the electrical activity and [Ca2+]i oscillations in ICC with 1 μm nifedipine are shown in Fig. 4. The frequency of both slow waves and [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (thick line) was scarcely affected by nifedipine, although [Ca2+]i in a c-Kit-negative region (thin line) did not show oscillation. We obtained the same results in 4 of 5 cell clusters. The frequency of slow waves and [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC were the same, and their movements coincided with each other, reflecting a close temporal relationship. The frequency was 17 ± 3.3 cycle/min (n = 4), and the amplitude of the electrical activity averaged 0.25 ± 0.02 mV (n = 4). When Ca2+-free solution was applied in the presence of 1 μm nifedipine, the amplitude of [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC decreased and subsequently disappeared (n = 5; Fig. 5 A). Modified manganese quenching (200 μm MnCl2 and 1 μm nifedipine in a Ca2+-free bath solution) also abolished [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (n = 4; Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC required extracellular Ca2+. Because nifedipine does not block [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC, the L-type Ca2+ channel is not likely to be involved in the Ca2+ influx of ICC. We then examined the effects of several cations with 1 μm nifedipine. La3+ (50 μm) markedly reduced the amplitude of [Ca2+]i in the cluster and blocked [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (n = 7; Fig. 5 C). Cd2+ (100 μm) increased the intensity of fluo-4 fluorescence in the cluster and disturbed [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (n = 6; Fig. 5 D). On the other hand, Ni2+ (50 μm), known to be a blocker of T-type calcium channel, did not affect [Ca2+]i oscillation rhythms in ICC (n = 5; Fig. 5 E). When a small amount of SK&F 96365 (4 μm), which blocks TRP, was added to the bath solution with nifedipine it significantly reduced the amplitude and prevented [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (n = 5; Fig. 6 A). Some TRPs have been suggested to be involved in Ca2+ entry mediated by store depletion (store-operated channels). When thapsigargin (a Ca2+ pump blocker) was added at 5 μm, the Ca2+ level rose once and then subsided along with a diminution of [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (n = 4; Fig. 6 B). Thapsigargin combined with nifedipine in the Ca2+-free solution quickly blocked [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC. However, no transient increase in the Ca2+ level was recorded (n = 3; data not shown).Figure 6Effects of SK&F96365 and thapsigargin on [Ca2+]1 oscillation in ICC in the presence of 1 μm nifedipine. A, SK&F96365 abolished [Ca2+]i oscillations in ICC. B, thapsigargin, a blocker of Ca2+ pump in ER, hampered [Ca2+]i oscillations in ICC. It increased and then decreased Ca2+ level and inhibited the oscillation eventually.

Double staining with anti-c-Kit and anti-TRP4 antibodies revealed the TRP4 immunoreactivity in c-Kit immunopositive ICC at the myenteric plexus level (Fig. 7,A–D). Not only ICC but also other supposedly smooth muscle cells expressed TRP4. TRP4 expression was stronger in ICC than in the putative smooth muscle cells (Fig. 7 B). The two antibodies used for TRP4 immunohistochemistry showed similar results. Although TRP6 was also positive in the smooth muscle layer as confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 7 E), double immunostaining for TRP6 and c-Kit did not detect TRP6 in ICC (data not shown). The fine localization of TRP4 in ICC was studied using cell clusters by double labeling immunohistochemistry for TRP4 and caveolin-1 in ICC where [Ca2+]i oscillation was recorded in the presence of nifedipine. This double staining demonstrated that localization of TRP4 largely coincided with caveolin-1 (n = 10; Fig. 8,A–D). Immunoelectron microscopy further confirmed that TRP4 was mostly distributed in caveolae in ICC, which were located between the circular and longitudinal muscle layer and identified as ICC morphologically (n = 5; Fig. 9).Figure 8Distribution of TRP4 in ICC.A–C, double immunolabeling of TRP4 and caveolin-1 in ICC.

Immunohistochemistry revealed that smooth muscle cells, c-kit-positive ICC, and sometimes enteric neurons were included in these clusters (Fig. 1). A blockade of the nervous activities with TTX, however, affected neither contractility nor [Ca2+]i oscillation, suggesting that enteric neurons were not indispensable for the generation of the basic spontaneous activity. We assume that the neurons might modulate the basic rhythmicity and coordinate the activity of neighboring contractile units (23Stevens R.J. Publicover N.G. Smith T.K. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 892-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is also well known that dihydropyridine (nifedipine) blocks L-type Ca2+ channels in smooth muscle cells and inhibits their contractions. Our Ca2+ imaging in the presence of nifedipine, therefore, excludes [Ca2+]i oscillation in smooth muscle. In fact, the contractile activity and [Ca2+]i oscillation of the entire cell cluster were blocked with nifedipine. Recent studies have shown that ICC play the role of pacemaker cells. They generate electrical activity, i.e. slow waves, which is propagated to smooth muscle cells and produces spontaneous contractions of the muscle layer. One of the characteristic features of the slow wave is dihydropyridine (nifedipine)-resistant activity (5Horowitz B. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 19-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Lee J.C.F. Thuneberg L. Berezin I. Huizinga J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G409-G423PubMed Google Scholar). Nifedipine does not prevent slow wave generation. This indicates that besides smooth muscle cells special pacemaker cells are present and that ion channels that are different from L-type Ca2+ channels play a critical role in the pacemaking. Ca2+ imaging with nifedipine combined with subsequent immunohistochemistry showed that [Ca2+]i oscillation occurs in c-Kit-positive ICC in the cultured cell cluster (Fig. 3). Furthermore, simultaneous recording of [Ca2+]i and electrical activity in ICC revealed that [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC is synchronized with slow waves and that the two are likely to be causally related (Fig. 4). The slow waves seen in the isolated cell cluster are also similar to those observed in intact tissues in their frequency of oscillation (11Lee J.C.F. Thuneberg L. Berezin I. Huizinga J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G409-G423PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ward S.M. Ördög T. Koh S.D. Baker S.A. Jun J.Y. Amberg G. Monaghan K. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol.

Physiol. 2001; 280: G439-G456PubMed Google Scholar) and temperature-dependence.2 Therefore, the present preparation is a suitable model system for analysis of the pacemaker mechanism as a minimal unit of the GI muscle layer. Studies on electrical rhythmicity in ICC have suggested that IP3 receptor-dependent calcium release from ER is crucial for the generation of slow waves. Circular smooth muscle isolated from mutant mice lacking IP3 type 1 receptor failed to generate slow waves even though the action potential of the smooth muscle was not affected (12Suzuki H. Takano H. Yamamoto Y. Komuro T. Saito M. Kato K. Mikoshiba K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 105-111Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Suzuki H. Jpn. J. Physiol. 2000; 50: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another group reported that inhibitors of IP3 receptor blocked pacemaker activity; a membrane-permeable blocker of IP3 receptor (xestospongin C) and injection of heparin inhibited pacemaker current and slow waves (13Ward S.M. Ördög T. Koh S.D. Baker S.A. Jun J.Y. Amberg G. Monaghan K. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 355-361Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ release from ER through IP3receptor is necessary for [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC. It is also well known that ICC have many mitochondria and that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is thought to be required for electrical pacemaking in ICC. Pacemaker currents were closely related to mitochondrial Ca2+ transient; mitochondrial uncouplers (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP)) and respiratory chain inhibitors (antimycin) blocked pacemaker current (13Ward S.M. Ördög T. Koh S.D. Baker S.A. Jun J.Y. Amberg G. Monaghan K. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 355-361Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a previous report that pacemaking in ICC is dependent upon metabolic activity (26Nakayama S. Chihara S. Clark J.F. Huang S.-M. Horiuchi T. Tomita T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 229-240Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Huang S. Nakayama S. Iino S. Tomita T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G518-G528PubMed Google Scholar). All together, these data suggest that an intracellular calcium event depending upon the periodic release of Ca2+ from ER through IP3 receptor and subsequent uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria is necessary for [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC. Although these two events appear to be primary factors in [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC, the mechanisms integrating Ca2+ handling of ER and mitochondria in ICC and the generation of pacemaker current in the plasma membrane remain to be clarified. In addition to the intracellular calcium events, the present study of [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC demonstrated that the pacemaking mechanism in ICC requires extracellular Ca2+ because Ca2+-free bath solution and Mn2+ inhibited [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC (Fig. 5). The insensitivity to nifedipine clearly shows that Ca2+influx is not mediated by an L-type calcium channel, which is ordinarily required for the contractions of smooth muscle cells. Instead, the channel is thought to be a non-selective cation channel because La3+ and Cd2+ quickly reduced the amplitude of [Ca2+]i oscillation and eventually blocked it. On the other hand, the T-type calcium channel is not likely to contribute to the influx because a considerable amount of Ni2+ did not affect [Ca2+]i oscillation (Fig. 5) (28Farrugia G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 45-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A gene family of TRP channels was cloned recently, and their products are considered to be non-selective cation channels (29Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D.

Bio. 2001; 3: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The expression of trp genes in the murine and canine GI muscle layers was recently reported. Only full-length trp4, trp6, and some splice variants were detected in the muscle layer of the mouse GI tract (18Walker R.L. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1184-C1192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epperson et al. (34Epperson A. Hatton W.J. Callaghan B. Doherty P. Walker R.L. Sanders K.M. Ward S.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C529-C539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that freshly isolated or cultured ICC also express only trp4 and trp6. These reports suggest that TRP4 and/or TRP6 may be involved in [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC. In the present study we showed that [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC was blocked by SK&F 96365, which was used as an inhibitor of TRP4 expressed on Xenopus oocytes (35Kinoshita M. Akaike A. Satoh M. Kaneko S. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, thapsigargin that blocks ER Ca2+-ATPases increased and then decreased [Ca2+]i in ICC and eventually blocked the oscillations. This indicates that the channel involved in oscillation was store-operated and activated by the depletion of Ca2+ in ER. Sensitivity to store depletion is higher in TRP4 than in TRP6 (29Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that the non-selective cation channel involved in [Ca2+]i oscillation in ICC was TRP4. Although it was confirmed that both TRP4 and TRP6 were expressed in the muscle layer of the mouse small intestine by Western blotting (Fig. 7), TRP6 was demonstrated intensely in the smooth muscle but not in ICC by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). We thus think that TRP4 is predominant in ICC, whereas TRP6 is a principal type in smooth muscle. The periodic Ca2+ release through IP3receptor may cause depletion of the Ca2+ store, which then activates TRP4 spontaneously. This Ca2+ influx (mediated by TRP4) might provide pacemaker current in ICC. By immunohistochemistry TRP4 was located mostly in caveolae shown by colocalization with caveolin-1 labeling. The caveolar distribution of TRP4 was corroborated with immunoelectron microscopy. Caveolae are enriched with many signaling molecules and are abundant in ICC (36Rumessen J.J. Dan. Med. Bull. 1994; 41: 275-293PubMed Google Scholar,37Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases concentrated in caveolae are known to regulate TRP activity (38Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V., Li, M. Ramesh V. Zhu X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is strongly suggested that neurotransmitters and hormones work on caveolae to modulate the pacemaking function in ICC. Moreover, a recent paper reported the possibility that TRP3 in caveolae formed direct physical interaction with IP3 receptors in ER and mediated Ca2+ influx in HEK-293 cells (25Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to determine the functional relationship between TRP4, caveolae, and IP3 receptor and to understand the mechanism by which pacemaker currents are generated. In summary, the [Ca2+]i oscillation we demonstrated in ICC using isolated cell clusters from the mouse small intestine was closely linked to pacemaker activity. Ca2+ influx was necessary for [Ca2+]i oscillation, and the non-selective cation channel TRP4 (located mainly in caveolae) was inferred to mediate Ca2+ entry in ICC.

Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the functions of the two gene products, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, remain unclear. Sequence analysis and hydropathy plots suggest that the PKD1 protein, polycystin-1, is a novel integral membrane glycoprotein containing a number of extracellular domains previously described in other proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (3Hughes J.

Polycystin-1 is also highly homologous to the sea urchin sperm receptor for egg jelly (suREJ) protein, which triggers extracellular Ca2+ influx in the acrosome reaction (4Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M.

Therefore, it seems likely that polycystin-1 plays a multifunctional role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and cation transport. Polycystin-2, the PKD2 protein, has significant homology to voltage-activated and transient receptor potential K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels (2Mochizuki T., Wu, G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L.

Nevertheless, the existence of a native polycystin-1-polycystin-2 complex has yet to be demonstrated and is an area of current controversy. There are two main reasons for this uncertainty. First of all, the subcellular location of both proteins appears to be very different. There are convincing data demonstrating an exclusive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) location for polycystin-2 (12Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E., Wu, G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but yeast two-hybrid studies have shown that polycystin-2 can also interact with actin-binding proteins such as Hax-1 and CD2-AP via its C-terminal tail (13Gallagher A.R. Cedzich A. Gretz N. Somlo S. Witzgall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Lehtonen S. Ora A. Olkkonen V.M. Geng L. Zerial M. Somlo S. Lehtonen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32888-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Polycystin-1 immunoreactivity has been observed in different plasma membrane domains as well as within cytoplasmic vesicles but not predominantly in the ER (reviewed in Ref. 15Ong A.C.M. Exp. Nephrol. 2000; 8: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This non-overlapping distribution has made it seem less likely that both proteins form a complex at least within the same membrane domain (see “Discussion”). Second, there is conflicting evidence as to whether polycystin-2 can reconstitute a functional channel independently of polycystin-1. A recent paper showed that transient overexpression of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 but neither one alone increased a non-selective whole-cell conductance in transfected CHO cells (16Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In this study, surface expression of a putative polycystin-1-polycystin-2 channel was inferred by overlapping signals with a co-transfected surface marker protein (CD4) in individual cells. However, using different experimental systems, two other groups later described surface Ca2+ channel activity reconstituted by polycystin-2 alone (7Gonzalez-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 8Vassilev P.M. Guo L. Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Peng J.B. Basora N. Babakhanlou H. Cruger G. Kanazirska M., Ye, C. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These differences might well be cell- or tissue-specific, but the demonstration of polycystin-1-independent polycystin-2 activity could also imply that the two proteins do not interact directly. This conclusion would be consistent with one observation of differential polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 expression (17Foggensteiner L. Bevan A.P. Thomas R. Coleman N. Boulter C. Bradley J. Ibraghimov Beskrovnaya O. Klinger K. Sandford R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 814-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low levels of native polycystin-1 in tissues and cells have made functional studies of endogenous polycystin-1 very difficult (15Ong A.C.M. Exp. Nephrol. 2000; 8: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we have generated renal cell lines from newborn mice transgenic for human PKD1 (18Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R.A., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These mice express a transgene comprising the entire human PKD1 gene with its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions (20 kb upstream, 43 kb downstream) but excluding the HG loci (18Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R.A., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Expression of transgenic polycystin-1 was developmentally regulated in different tissues including the kidney, and expression of transgenic polycystin-1 could rescue the embryonically lethal Pkd1 knockout phenotype observed in pkd1del34 mice (18Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R.A., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We reasoned, therefore, that cells derived from these animals might be good models to study polycystin-1 function because the transgene appeared to be appropriately regulated and the gene product processed, transported, and expressed as a functional protein in vivo. Here we report for the first time the isolation, biochemical characterization, and subcellular localization of a polycystin-1-polycystin-2 protein complex in PKD1 transgenic kidney cells and also describe the existence of this complex in non-transgenic kidney cells and normal adult human kidney. The generation of three founder PKD1 transgenic mice has been described in a previous paper (18Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R.A., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Like the endogenous murine protein, expression of transgenic polycystin-1 is markedly down-regulated between 2 and 4 weeks postnatally (18Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R.A., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We decided therefore to generate cell lines from newborn kidneys (embryonic day 18). Renal cells were cultured using standard techniques from eight newborn (embryonic day 18) mice (M1–M8) resulting from an F1 cross between a heterozygote PKD1 transgenic mouse (TPK3) and a transgenic mouse homozygous for the temperature-sensitive T antigen (Immortomouse) (19Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In brief, renal tissue was minced and digested with type 1 collagenase, and tubular fragments plated onto collagen-coated flasks. Cells were grown in low serum selective medium to encourage epithelial outgrowth (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 5% Nuserum) and cultured at 33 °C in the presence of recombinant mouse γ-interferon (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) to activate T antigen expression (20Jat P.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Two lines (M7 and M8) were selected for further study. Because collecting ducts consistently show the highest polycystin-1 expression in developing and mature kidney (15Ong A.C.M. Exp. Nephrol. 2000; 8: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cells of collecting duct origin were isolated from primary culture by lectin affinity cell separation using the lectin DBA, which is exclusively expressed at the apical cell surface of collecting duct cells in mouse kidney (21Grupp C. Troche I. Steffgen J. Langhans S. Cohen D.I. Brandl L. Muller G.A. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells positive for biotinylated DBA (Vector) were then purified using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (M280 beads, Dynal) as previously described (21Grupp C. Troche I. Steffgen J. Langhans S. Cohen D.I. Brandl L. Muller G.A. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These cells were found to express DBA at the cell surface but not the lectin, Lotus tetragonolobus, which is expressed by proximal tubular segments (data not shown). Cells were studied mainly at early passage (up to passage 15) and retained epithelial morphology throughout. The isolation of the PKD1 probes 3A3 (single copy) and JH8 (duplicated region) and Pkd1 probe MS9 (exons 3–10) has been reported in previous papers (1European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell 77, 1994, 881–894Google Scholar, 18Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R.A., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A new N-terminal probe (PKD1NT) was generated as a 1.4-kb BglII-NotI fragment (nucleotides 1–1232). A 0.9-kb mouse utrophin EcoR1 fragment (nucleotides 425–1330) was used to detect a full-length utrophin transcript (13 kb) (gift of Dr. N. Y. Loh and Prof. K. E. Davies). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) from cultured cells as described previously (22Ward C.J. Turley H. Ong A.C. Comley M. Biddolph S. Chetty R. Ratcliffe P.J. Gattner K. Harris P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The extracted RNA was quantified both by optical density at 260 nm and UV densitometry of the 18 S rRNA subunit. 15 μg of total RNA was run on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose/MOPS/formaldehyde gel, capillary-blotted onto Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK), and cross-linked with 70 mJ/cm2 UV radiation (UV cross-linker, AmershamBiosciences). This membrane was probed with a [32P]dCTP random-primed (Prime a gene, Promega, UK) specific DNA probe. Specific signals were obtained by exposing the blot to Biomax MS film for up to 72 h. The resulting autoradiograph was quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-690 densitometer and Molecular Analyst version 4 software. Values were corrected for loading using repeat probing with the housekeeping gene cyclophilin (23Bergsma D.J. Eder C. Gross M. Kersten H. Sylvester D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D. Livi G.P.

The generation of a mAb to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif of human polycystin-1 (7e12), specific rabbit antisera to the C-terminal 258 amino acids of human polycystin-2 (p30), and C-terminal 205 amino acids of human polycystin-1 (BD3) have been described in previous papers (9Ong A.C.

In this paper, we report the generation of new rabbit polyclonal antisera (PKD1NT2A, PKD1NT2B) to a large N-terminal region (Hin cII fragment, bp 358–3790) of human polycystin-1 (amino acids 50–1144) containing the LRR motif up to the fifth PKD repeat domain (3Hughes J.

A bacterial protein containing this region fused to a thioredoxin histidine tag was prepared in Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3) using the expression vector pET32a+ (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The protein was initially prepared as inclusion bodies, solubilized in 6 mguanidine, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (9Ong A.C. Ward C.J. Butler R.J. Biddolph S. Bowker C. Torra R. Pei Y. Harris P.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1721-1729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and the soluble protein used to immunize rabbits. The domains to which different polycystin-1 (7e12, NT2B, BD3) and polycystin-2 (p30) antibodies were raised are illustrated in Fig. 1. The generation and characterization of p30, a specific antiserum to a fusion protein containing the C-terminal 258 amino acids of human polycystin-2, has been described in a previous publication (9Ong A.C.

More recently, this antiserum has also been found to block cation channel activity reconstituted by recombinant polycystin-2 (7Gonzalez-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M.

A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). p30 was further purified (afp30) by affinity purification to the same fusion protein coupled to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The generation of rabbit antisera to a large N-terminal region of human polycystin-1 (PKD1NT2A, PKD1NT2B) is described above. These antisera were affinity-purified (afNT2A and afNT2B) to the same fusion protein immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a previously published method (26Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An IgG fraction of p30 was isolated using Protein A beads and biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce, Chester, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma membrane enriched fractions from human kidney were prepared and processed for immunoblotting as previously described (9Ong A.C. Ward C.J. Butler R.J. Biddolph S. Bowker C. Torra R. Pei Y.

The binding of biotinylated antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (AmershamBiosciences) after an additional blocking step with an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to remove endogenous biotin signals. Initial experiments demonstrated that the polycystin-1-polycystin-2 complex was equally present in cells cultured at permissive (33 °C) and non-permissive (37 °C for 48 h omitting γ-interferon) temperatures (data not shown). Subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments were therefore performed on cells grown at 33 °C. In brief, cell lysates or membrane fractions were obtained by extraction at 4 °C using detergent lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7) supplemented with a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and precleared for 1 h using recombinant Protein G-Sepharose beads (Gamma-bind, Amersham Biosciences). Protein G-antibody conjugates were then added to the cleared lysates and allowed to incubate on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washes with the binding buffer, the beads were incubated with either reducing (containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol) or non-reducing sample buffer at 50 °C for 30–60 min and processed for immunoblotting. Membrane fractions from kidney or cultured cells were solubilized in 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with a Complete™ mini protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates corresponding to 10–50 μg of total protein were treated with 500 units of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Different membrane fractions were prepared from transgenic cells or human kidney tissue by density gradient ultracentrifugation. In brief, a postnuclear supernatant was first prepared after Dounce homogenization of a cell pellet or tissue homogenate by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. A total cell membrane pellet was then isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1h at 4 °C. Cell membranes or post-nuclear supernatant (human kidney) were then layered onto a continuous 0–15% Optiprep (Sigma, Poole, UK) gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 3h at 4 °C using a swinging bucket rotor. Seventeen fractions were recovered from the top, concentrated, and analyzed for the presence of polycystin-1 (7e12), polycystin-2 (p30), and marker organelle proteins such as calnexin (ER), GM130 (Golgi), and Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit (plasma membrane) by immunoblotting. The relative abundance of each protein within individual fractions was quantitated by scanning densitometry and expressed as relative specific activity (FiPt /PiFt) where Fi = quantity of the marker in fraction i (arbitrary units), Pi = protein content of fraction i (mg), Pt = total cellular protein (mg), and Ft = total cellular content of the marker (arbitrary units). Cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips and were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde or ice-cold methanol-acetone. Alternatively, they were extracted for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 prior to fixation using a previously published protocol (27Nathke I.S. Hinck L. Swedlow J.R. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Dual-color immunofluorescence was performed using 7e12 (polycystin-1) and afp30 (polycystin-2), respectively. Controls included cells stained with the primary antibody omitted, an irrelevant mouse IgG1 mAb (Serotec, Kidlington, UK) as a control for polycystin-1, or a non-immune rabbit IgG fraction (Dako, Ely, UK) as a control for polycystin-2. The specificity of polycystin-2 staining was also demonstrated by pre-incubating afp30 with a polycystin-2 C-terminal fusion protein as previously described (9Ong A.C. Ward C.J. Butler R.J.

TRITC-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (Vector Laboratories) was used to label the Golgi and an antibody to Sec 61β (gift of Dr. T. Rapoport, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA) was used to label the ER. Antibody binding was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and TRITC-labeled goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless otherwise stated.

Morris and Dr. P. Jat, respectively. COS-1 cells were a gift of Dr. D. L. Simmons (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). Four PKD1 transgenic cell lines were generated from a litter of eight newborn mice resulting from an F1 cross between a heterozygote PKD1 transgenic mouse (TPK3) and a mouse homozygous for the temperature-sensitive T antigen (Immortomouse). These lines were shown to express high levels of full-length human polycystin-1 by immunoblotting with the N-terminal mAb, 7e12 (Fig. 2 A). Polycystin-1 was detected as several (3Hughes J. Ward C.J.

However, the native murine protein was only detectable by immunoblotting at much higher protein concentrations (300 μg of protein; data not shown) in non-transgenic cells (M8) but not at the lower protein concentrations (20 μg) shown here (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, polycystin-2 and the SV40-T antigen were present in equivalent amounts in both transgenic (M7) and non-transgenic (M8) cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, overexpression of polycystin-1 had no effect on steady-state levels of polycystin-2.Figure 4Isolation of a polycystin-1-polycystin-2 protein complex from M7 transgenic cell lysates. Immunoprecipitated polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 were detected by immunoblotting with 7e12 and biotinylated p30, respectively.A, the N-terminal polycystin-1 antibody PKD1NT2B precipitated several high (>400 kDa) and low (<220 kDa) molecular mass polycystin-1 bands, whereas polycystin-2 co-immunoprecipitated with the two highest molecular mass polycystin-1 bands normally present as minor bands in total cell lysate. These two bands correspond to full-length polycystin-1 because they are also immunoprecipitated by a C-terminal polycystin-1 antibody, BD3. Non-immune rabbit serum (NIS) and pre-immune sera (data not shown) served as negative controls.

Their transport properties demonstrate that the two proteins are isoforms of the glutamate/H+ symporter described in the past in whole mitochondria. Isoform 1 is expressed at higher levels than isoform 2 in all the tissues except in brain, where the two isoforms are expressed at comparable levels. The differences in expression levels and kinetic parameters of the two isoforms suggest that isoform 2 matches the basic requirement of all tissues especially with respect to amino acid degradation, and isoform 1 becomes operative to accommodate higher demands associated with specific metabolic functions such as ureogenesis.

Functional studies in intact mitochondria have indicated that the inner membranes of mitochondria contain more than 20 transport proteins or carriers that catalyze the net flux or the exchange of physiologically important metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors between the cytosol and the matrix (see Refs. 1Krämer R.

Their sequences all consist of three tandemly repeated homologous domains, about 100 amino acids in length. All of the tandem repeats are related, and each of them contains a conserved sequence motif and two hydrophobic stretches that are thought to span the membrane as α-helices. Therefore, they all belong to the same protein family (1Krämer R. Palmieri F. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics.

Other transport activities observed in whole mitochondria have yet to be associated with specific proteins. For example, the glutamate carrier (GC) 1The abbreviations used are: GCglutamate carrier proteinMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid catalyzes the entry of glutamate into the mitochondrial matrix either with protons or in exchange for hydroxyl ions and plays important roles in amino acid degradation, nitrogen metabolism, and urea synthesis (see Refs. 15LaNoue K.F.

The GC has a high Km value and a low activity and was suggested to limit the effective activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, which is located exclusively in mitochondria, in the direction of glutamate deamination (19Bradford N.M.

The activity of glutamate transport was found to be higher in liver than in kidney (22Schoolwerth A.C. LaNoue K.F. Hoover W.J. J. Biol.

They are 323 and 315 amino acids long, respectively, have the characteristics of the mitochondrial carrier family, and are 63% identical in sequence. Eukaryotic data bases (www.ebi.ac.uk, ensembl.ebi.ac.uk, www.sanger.ac.uk, www.fruitfly.org, and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were screened with the sequences of the human isoforms of the aspartate/glutamate carrier (13Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) with BLASTP and TBLASTN. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.7). The coding sequences for GC1 and GC2 were amplified by PCR from human brain cDNA (CLONTECH). The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the coding sequences (accession numbers AK023106 (GC1) and AY008285 (GC2)) with additional NdeI and Hin dIII (GC1) and NdeI and EcoRI (GC2) sites. The amplified products were cloned into the pRUN expression vector (derived from pKN172 (25Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), and the constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli TOP 10 cells (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on 2xTY plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and screened by direct colony PCR and restriction digestion of plasmids. The sequences of inserts were verified. Total RNAs from human tissues (Invitrogen) were reverse-transcribed with the Gene Amp RNA PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers as primers. For real-time PCRs, primers and probes, based on the GC1 and GC2 cDNA sequences (accession number AK023106 and AY008285), were designed with Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers for GC1 corresponded to nucleotides 1901–1923 and 1954–1969, respectively, and those for GC2 correspond to nucleotides 1650–1667 and 1715–1738, respectively. The GC1 FAM/MGB- and GC2 VIC/MGB-Dark Quencher-labeled probes corresponded to nucleotides 1925–1940 and 1679–1695 of the GC1 and GC2 cDNA sequences, respectively. Real-time PCRs were performed in a MicroAmp optical 96-well plate using the automated ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). 50 μl of reaction volume contained: 5 μl of template (reverse-transcribed first-stranded cDNA), 1× TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 200 nm probe for GC1 or GC2, respectively, and 900 nm of each primer. To correct for differences in the amount of starting first-stranded cDNAs, the human β- actin gene (predeveloped assay reagents, Applied Biosystems) was amplified in parallel. The relative quantification of the two isoforms was performed according to the comparative method (2− ΔΔ Ct) (26Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), 2User Bulletin No.2 P/N 4303859, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA. with brain ΔCt as internal calibrator. GC1 and GC2 were obtained as inclusion bodies in E. coliCO214(DE3) (25Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Fiermonte G.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,13Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins in sarkosyl were reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of 50 mmMES/50 mm HEPES at pH 6.0 (except where otherwise indicated) and with or without substrate (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns, pre-equilibrated with 100 mm sucrose and 10 mm MES/10 mm HEPES at pH 6.0 (except where otherwise indicated). Transport at 25 °C was started by addingl-[U-14]glutamate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to substrate-loaded proteoliposomes (exchange) or to unloaded proteoliposomes (uniport). In both cases, transport was terminated by the addition of 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 10 mm bathophenanthroline (the “inhibitor-stop” method (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). In controls, the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the external substrate. Finally, the external substrate was removed, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values. The initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes after 3 min (in the initial linear range of substrate uptake). Alternatively, the initial transport rate was calculated from the time course of isotope equilibration (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The reconstituted proteins were also assayed for other exchange activities (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye. N-terminal sequencing was carried out as described before (29Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The amount of GC1 or GC2 was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples using carbonic anhydrase as a protein standard (29Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The amount of protein incorporated into liposomes was measured as described previously (29Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). About 18% of GC1 and GC2 was reconstituted. The sequences of two isoforms of the human aspartate/glutamate carrier (13Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) were used to try and find candidates for the glutamate carrier. Several expressed sequence tags with p values between e−57and e−200 were discarded. They are probably orthologues of the aspartate/glutamate carrier. Two human expressed sequence tag sequences (AK023106 and AY008285) with p values of 3.2e−48 and 6.2e−46 encoded protein sequences of 323 (AK023106) and 315 (AY008285) amino acids. They were 63% identical to each other and 33% identical to the 393 amino acids of the C-terminal domains of the two isoforms of the aspartate/glutamate carrier that contain determinants of its transport activity and specificity (13Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). With these protein sequences, two conserved murine isoforms, AK010193 (323 amino acids) and Mm_101666 (315 amino acids), were identified that were 63% identical to each other. The protein sequence of AK010193 was 95 and 63% identical, respectively, to human AK023106 and AY008285, whereas the protein sequence of Mm_101666 was 63 and 87% identical to human AK023106 and AY008285, respectively. The related isoforms in the fruit fly (CG18347 and CG12201) and the nematode (F55G1.5 and F20D1.9) were less conserved, although in both, the isoform pair was 60–65% identical. Therefore, their correspondence with human and murine isoforms could not be deduced. Real-time PCRs were performed on total RNA populations, using primers and probes from the cDNA sequences of GC1 and GC2 (Fig. 1). Both GC1 and GC2 were present at the same level in brain as they have the same threshold cycle value. This value was used as an internal calibration in the relative quantification of both isoforms. With the exception of brain, isoform 1 was expressed at higher levels than isoform 2. It was expressed most strongly in pancreas, liver, brain, and testis with lower levels in heart, kidney, lung, small intestine, and spleen. Isoform 2 was expressed in brain, to a lesser extent in testis, and poorly in all the other tissues. The ratio GC1:GC2 was 30 in liver, 28 in pancreas, 8.7 in spleen, 3.8 in kidney, 6.5 in small intestine, 2.5 in testis, 2 in heart, and 2.6 in lung. GC1 and GC2 were expressed at high levels in E. coli C0214(DE3) (Fig. 2). They accumulated as inclusion bodies and were purified by centrifugation and washing. The apparent molecular masses of the purified proteins (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 6; yield 60–80 mg/l) were 32.8 kDa for GC1 and 31.5 kDa for GC2 (calculated values with initiator methionine, 34.5 and 33.8 kDa, respectively). Their identities were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The proteins were not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before the induction of expression (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4). The transport activities of GC1 and GC2 reconstituted in liposomes were tested in homo-exchange (same substrate inside and outside) experiments with substrates known to be transported by mitochondria. With external and internal substrate concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively, both proteins catalyzed [14C]glutamate/glutamate exchange, inhibitable by a mixture of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline. They did not catalyze homo-exchanges for phosphate, pyruvate, ADP, ATP, malonate, succinate, malate, oxoglutarate, ketoisocaproate, citrate, carnitine, aspartate, ornithine, lysine, arginine, histidine, glutathione, choline, spermine, proline, and threonine. No [14C]glutamate/glutamate exchange activity was observed with GC1 and GC2 that had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes nor by reconstitution of sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for GC1 or GC2 or harvested immediately before the induction of expression. In Fig. 3, the kinetics are compared for the uptake by proteoliposomes of 1 mm[14C]glutamate measured either as uniport (in the absence of internal glutamate) or as exchange (in the presence of 10 mm glutamate). Both the exchange and the uniport reactions catalyzed by GC1 and GC2 followed first-order kinetics, isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially. The ratio of maximal substrate uptake by the exchange and by the uniport was 8.3 for GC1 and 9.5 for GC2, in good agreement with the expected value of 10 from the intraliposomal concentrations at equilibrium (1 and 10 mmfor uniport and exchange, respectively). The initial rates of glutamate uptake deduced from the time courses (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) were 20.1 and 1.4 μmol/min/g of protein for GC1 and 17.1 and 3.0 μmol/min/g of protein for GC2, for the exchange and the uniport reaction, respectively. The addition of 10 mm unlabeled glutamate after 90 min of incubation, when radioactive uptake by the proteoliposomes had approached equilibrium, caused an extensive efflux of radiolabeled glutamate from both glutamate-loaded and unloaded proteoliposomes (data not shown). This efflux shows that the [14C]glutamate taken up by uniport is released by exchange for externally added substrate. Therefore, the above reported results indicate that reconstituted GC1 and GC2 catalyze both the unidirectional transport of glutamate and the glutamate/glutamate exchange, as has been reported for the glutamate carrier studied in intact mitochondria (see Refs. 15LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar and 16LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Ernster L. Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 221-268Google Scholar and references therein). The substrate specificity of reconstituted GC1 and GC2 was examined in detail by measuring the uptake of [14C]glutamate into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various potential substrates (Table I). With both proteins, external l-glutamate exchanged significantly only in the presence of internal l-glutamate. A very low exchange (one order of magnitude lower than the glutamate/glutamate exchange) was found in the presence of internal α-aminoadipate, adipate, glutarate, and α-methylglutamate. Virtually no exchange was observed with the structurally related compoundsl-aspartate, α-aminopimelate,l-homocysteinesulfinate, l-cysteinesulfinate,l-glutamine, l-asparagine,d-glutamate, and d-aspartate (Table I) and with taurine, tartrate, cysteine, fumarate, malonate, succinate,l-malate, pimelate, phosphate, oxoglutarate, citrate, ATP, sulfate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate,l-carnitine, l-ornithine, orl-citrulline (not shown). The residual activity in the presence of these substrates was approximately the same as the activity observed in the presence of sodium chloride. Reconstituted GC1 and GC2, therefore, display a very narrow substrate specificity, which is confined virtually only to l-glutamate.Table IDependence on internal substrate of the transport properties of GC1 and GC2Internal substrate[14C]Glutamate transportGC1GC2μmol/min/g of proteinNone (Cl− present)2.072.06l-glutamate23.3014.49α-methyl-dl-glutamate4.073.17l-aspartate2.192.04l-α-aminoadipate4.634.42l-α-aminopimelate2.302.23l-homocysteinesulfinate1.951.80l-cysteinesulfinate2.142.05l-glutamine2.032.09l-asparagine1.972.03d-glutamate2.102.25d-aspartate2.082.00Glutarate5.013.77Adipate4.603.72Proteoliposomes were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration, 20 mm). Transport was started by adding 1 or 0.25 mm [14C]glutamate to proteoliposomes reconstituted with GC1 or GC2, respectively, and terminated after 3 min. Similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments for each carrier investigated. Open table in a new tab Proteoliposomes were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration, 20 mm). Transport was started by adding 1 or 0.25 mm [14C]glutamate to proteoliposomes reconstituted with GC1 or GC2, respectively, and terminated after 3 min. Similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments for each carrier investigated. The [14C]glutamate/glutamate exchange reactions catalyzed by reconstituted GC1 and GC2 were inhibited strongly by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, bathophenanthroline, mersalyl, and p- hydroxymercuribenzoate (inhibitors of several mitochondrial carriers) as well as by N-ethylmaleimide, tannic acid, and bromocresol purple, which are known inhibitors of the native GC (Fig. 4). In contrast, carboxylatractyloside, bongkrekate, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, inhibitors of other characterized mitochondrial carriers, had no or little effect on the activities of reconstituted GC1 or GC2. Since the glutamate carrier catalyzes a glutamate + H+co-transport across the mitochondrial membrane (see Refs. 15LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar and 16LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Ernster L. Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 221-268Google Scholar for reviews), the influence of the proton gradient on the uptake of glutamate into unloaded liposomes reconstituted with GC1 or GC2 was investigated. In these experiments, the proton gradient across the proteoliposomal membrane was imposed as follows. The proteoliposomes were reconstituted at various pH values (from 6.0 to 8.0). After removal of the external buffer by passage through Sephadex G-75, [14C]glutamate (buffered at pH 6) was added to the proteoliposomes, and the initial rates of uptake were measured. The results, shown in Fig. 5, A and B, demonstrate that with both GC1 and GC2, the rate of glutamate uptake increased several times on increasing the internal pH from 6.0 to 8.0 (at a fixed external pH of 6.0). As a control, we investigated the dependence of the glutamate/glutamate exchange on the proton gradient imposed across the liposomal membrane using the same experimental conditions. Fig. 5, A and B, demonstrates that with both GC1 and GC2, the rate of glutamate/glutamate exchange was very little affected by the increase in the internal pH from 6.0 to 8.0 at a fixed external pH of 6.0. These experiments, showing that alkalinization of the compartment opposite to where glutamate is present stimulates markedly the net transport of glutamate but influences scarcely the glutamate/glutamate exchange, clearly indicate that glutamate is transported across the reconstituted liposomal membrane together with H+ or in exchange for OH−. Thus, the recombinant GC1 and GC2 are also similar in these respects to the glutamate carrier described from studies in intact mitochondria (see Refs. 15LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar and 16LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Ernster L. Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 221-268Google Scholar and references therein). The kinetic constants of the recombinant purified GC1 and GC2 were determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external [14C]glutamate concentrations in the presence of a constant saturating internal concentration of 20 mm glutamate (glutamate/glutamate exchange) or in the absence of internal substrate (glutamate/H+ symport) (Table II). When measured as glutamate/H+ symport at the same internal and external pH of 6.0, the transport affinities (Km) of reconstituted GC1 and GC2 were 5.18 ± 0.48 and 0.26 ± 0.04 mm, respectively, and their specific activities (Vmax) were 12.2 ± 2.9 and 3.9 ± 1.0 μmol/min/g of protein, respectively. Virtually the same Km values were found for both GC1 and GC2 when the exchange mode of transport, instead of symport, was analyzed under the same experimental conditions. In contrast, with both isoforms, the Vmax values were much higher for the glutamate/glutamate exchange transport mode (143.5 ± 32.8 μmol/min/g of protein for GC1 and 34.2 ± 6.5 μmol/min/g of protein for GC2), indicating that the glutamate/H+ symport is limited by the return of the unloaded carrier to the outward facing configuration (Table II). In mitochondria, the glutamate/glutamate exchange was also found to be much faster than the net uptake (16LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Ernster L. Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 221-268Google Scholar). In the presence of a trans-membrane pH gradient (external pH of 6 and internal pH of 8), the Vmax values of the glutamate/H+ symport for both GC1 and GC2 were 4–5 times higher, whereas the corresponding Km values for glutamate remained unchanged (Table II). In contrast, the Vmax values of the glutamate/glutamate exchange were increased only 1.17-fold for GC1 and 1.23-fold for GC2 on increasing the internal pH from 6 to 8 at a fixed external pH of 6. Therefore, with both GC1 and GC2, the Vmax value of the glutamate/H+ symport is markedly stimulated by the trans-membrane pH gradient, whereas the Vmaxvalue of the glutamate/glutamate exchange is almost unaffected, as observed for carriers that catalyze a proton symport.Table IIKinetic constants of GC1 and GC2 isoformsGC1GC2KmVmaxKmVmaxmmμmol/min/gmmμmol/min/gGlutamate/glutamate (pHin6)5.19 ± 0.84143.5 ± 32.80.18 ± 0.0334.2 ± 6.5Glutamate/glutamate (pHin 8)5.04 ± 0.51167.8 ± 45.30.22 ± 0.0341.9 ± 7.3Glutamate/H+ (pHin6)5.18 ± 0.4812.2 ± 2.90.26 ± 0.043.9 ± 1.0Glutamate/H+ (pHin 8)4.85 ± 0.3363.1 ± 14.30.26 ± 0.0315.7 ± 3.3The values were calculated from double reciprocal plots of the rate of [14C]glutamate uptake versus substrate concentrations into liposomes reconstituted with GC1 or GC2.

The existence of a specific transporter for glutamate was inferred first in 1967 from studies of the reduction of mitochondrial NAD(P) by glutamate and of the swelling of liver mitochondria in ammonium glutamate (30Azzi A. Chappell J.B. Robinson B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since then, its main properties have been studied in intact mitochondria (15LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev.

Mefar B.V., Beetsterzwaag, The Netherlands1981: 97-106Google Scholar). However, the protein responsible for the glutamate carrier had not been identified hitherto. From the present study, it is clear that we have identified GC1 and GC2 as distinct isoforms of the glutamate carrier. They have molecular masses close to the usual 30 kDa of most mitochondrial carriers, and both have the tripartite structure and the sequence motif that are characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family (1Krämer R. Palmieri F. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 359-384Google Scholar, 4Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and ΔpH dependence properties of reconstituted GC1 and GC2 match fully those of the native glutamate carrier. However, the two GC isoforms differ markedly in their kinetic parameters. GC1 has a very high Km value for glutamate, whereas the Km value of GC2 is low. The Km value of GC1 (about 5 mm) is virtually identical to the Km values for glutamate uptake (of 4–5 mm) measured in liver and kidney mitochondria (19Bradford N.M. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Meyer J. Vignais P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Hoek J.B. Coll K.E.

Chem. 1983; 258: 1735-1739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This Km value of GC1 is much higher than those of other mitochondrial anion carriers (see Ref. 19Bradford N.M. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholarand references therein). It may be correlated to the high cytosolic concentration of glutamate, which in liver is of the same order of magnitude as the Km value (31Long C. Biochemist's Handbook. Spon Ltd., London1961: 682Google Scholar, 32Tarver H. Rouiller C. The Liver. 1. Academic Press, New York1963: 474Google Scholar). The low Km value for glutamate was probably overlooked in the early studies with intact mitochondria because GC1 is more abundant than GC2 in all tissues (except brain) and particularly in liver (Fig. 1), and the Vmax value of GC1 is higher than that of GC2 (Table II). The almost exclusive substrate for both human GC isoforms isl-glutamate. Therefore, the main physiological role of GC isoforms is to import glutamate from the cytosol, where it is produced by the transamination of amino acids with oxoglutarate, to the mitochondrial matrix, where glutamate dehydrogenase is exclusively located. Although the Vmax value of glutamate transport measured in intact mitochondria is lower than those of the other anion transporters (see Ref. 19Bradford N.M. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and references therein), it has been calculated that the maximal velocity of glutamate transport in rat liver mitochondria is high enough to feed the urea cycle, even if glutamate were the only ammonium source for the mitochondrial synthesis of carbamyl phosphate (19Bradford N.M. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Meyer J. Vignais P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that GC is the only mechanism for the supply of external glutamate to the intramitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase since glutamate entering via the aspartate/glutamate exchanger is necessarily transaminated with intramitochondrial oxaloacetate to form aspartate. Since glutamate is co-transported with a proton by the GC and, therefore, its distribution across the mitochondrial membrane is influenced by ΔpH, the entry of glutamate is favored in energized mitochondria. However, when ammonia rather than glutamate is the major nitrogen source for urea synthesis or when glutamine is generated intramitochondrially, for example by proline oxidation, the GC may operate in the reverse direction to limit the intramitochondrial accumulation of glutamate (21Hoek J.B. Coll K.E. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33McGivan J.D. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport. Plenum Press, New York1992: 101-111Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, prevention of glutamate efflux from mitochondria by cytosolic H+ in kidney tubular cells may play an important role in the kidney response to metabolic acidosis by contributing to increased flux through glutamate dehydrogenase and hence to increased ammonia production (and excretion) from glutamine (16LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Ernster L. Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 221-268Google Scholar, 22Schoolwerth A.C. LaNoue K.F. Hoover W.J. J. Biol.

The tissue specificity of the two GC isoforms differs markedly from that of the isoforms of the phosphate carrier (29Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol.

Endo H. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24950-24958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mammalian proteolipid subunit of the ATP synthase (39Gay N.J. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the three mammalian subunits (VIa, VIIa, and VIII) of cytochrome oxidase (40Schlerf A. Droste M. Winter M. Kadenbach B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2387-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 41Seelan R.S. Grossman L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19752-19757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The common feature of all these proteins is the presence of at least one heart type isoform, which is expressed abundantly only in muscles, and one liver type isoform, which is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues. The isoforms of GC are both ubiquitous, and GC1 is expressed in higher amounts than GC2 in all the tissues (except brain) and is particularly abundant in liver and pancreas. In the light of the observed differences in the kinetic parameters of the two isoforms, it appears that GC2 matches the basic requirement of all tissues especially with respect to amino acid degradation, and GC1 becomes operative to accommodate the higher demands associated with specific metabolic functions, such as ureogenesis, and/or with special metabolic conditions, for example, after protein-rich diets. Thus, when the capacity of isoform GC2, which has a higher affinity for glutamate, is overwhelmed, isoform GC1 with its lower substrate affinity may be brought into operation by increased cytosolic glutamate concentration. Therefore, GC1 and GC2, with their different Km and Vmax values, can modulate the rate of glutamate transport into mitochondria and thus satisfy the tissue-specific metabolic demands.

By an unknown mechanism, this initial event promotes additional autophosphorylation events including modifications of Thr-383 and Thr-387, two amino acid residues located within the activation loop segment within the Chk2 catalytic domain. Chk2 and related kinases possess one or more Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains that are phosphopeptide-binding modules believed to be crucial for their checkpoint control activities. We show that the Chk2 FHA domain is dispensable for Thr-68 phosphorylation but necessary for efficient autophosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation. Phosphorylation of Thr-68 promotes oligomerization of Chk2 by serving as a specific ligand for the FHA domain of another Chk2 molecule. In addition, Chk2 phosphorylates its own FHA domain, and this modification reduces its affinity for Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2. Thus, activation of Chk2 in irradiated cells may occur through oligomerization of Chk2 via binding of the Thr-68-phosphorylated region of one Chk2 to the FHA domain of another.

Therefore, exploring the mechanisms by which Chk2 activity is regulated will enhance our understanding of the complex network of signaling pathways that serve to limit tumor development.

Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In response to ionizing radiation (IR) and double-stranded DNA breaks, ATM phosphorylates Chk2 on Thr-68 within the amino-terminal SQ/TQ-rich domain, and this event is necessary for efficient activation of the Chk2 kinase (16Matsuoka S.

Recent evidence suggests that Chk2 is phosphorylated on Thr-383 and Thr-387 in a phosphothreonine 68 (Thr(P)-68)-dependent manner (19Lee C.-H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These residues are located within the activation loop segment of Chk2 and therefore may be Chk2 autophosphorylation sites that increase the specific activity of the enzyme when modified (19Lee C.-H.

Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with our observations that a catalytic inactive Chk2 fails to exhibit phosphorylation-dependent mobility shifts upon SDS-PAGE even though clearly phosphorylated on Thr-68, suggesting that additional phosphorylation events are dependent upon a functional Chk2 catalytic domain and necessary for full activation (18Ahn J.-H. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar). How Thr-68 phosphorylation specifically leads to Chk2 autophosphorylation and activation is currently unknown. ataxia telangiectasia-mutated ionizing radiation forkhead-associated Li-Fraumeni syndrome glutathione S-transferase wild type kinase-dead gray Additional clues as to how DNA damage-dependent Chk2 phosphorylation might be regulated are revealed through structural and biochemical studies of its two yeast homologues, Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD53 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cds1. In addition to an amino-terminal SQ/TQ-rich domain, Chk2-related kinases like Cds1 and RAD53 contain one or two FHA (forkhead-associated) domains (for review see Ref. 15Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Current structural and biochemical data indicate that FHA domains mediate phosphospecific protein-protein interactions and are thus considered important signaling moieties (21Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 22Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This is exemplified in RAD53, where the carboxyl-terminal FHA domain binds to DNA damage-induced phosphorylated forms of RAD9, and this interaction is required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint functions in budding yeast (21Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This interaction may also be crucial for enhancing RAD53 activity in DNA-damaged cells because phosphorylated RAD9 serves as a scaffold for RAD53 binding via the RAD53 FHA domain and thereby facilitates RAD53 trans-autophosphorylation and activation (25Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the structural and functional similarities between Chk2 and RAD53, the Chk2 FHA domain may play an important role in the regulation of Chk2 activity in irradiated cells. The identification of mutations within the FHA domain of Chk2 in several variant Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families and sporadic cancers strengthens the concept that this domain is important for Chk2 function (10Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C.R. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M.L. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A.

Varley J.M. Godwin A.K. Shannon K.E. Harlow E. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8062-8067PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported previously that the Chk2 FHA domain is required for DNA damage-dependent Thr-68 phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 (19Lee C.-H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus far, only the LFS-associated mutations (I157T or R145W) within the FHA domain have been characterized as to their ability to be phosphorylated on Thr-68 and activated by IR. Others have shown (27Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that the I157T mutant is efficiently phosphorylated on Thr-68 and activated by IR suggesting that this mutation does not affect upstream signaling to Chk2. Unlike the I157T mutant Chk2, the R145W mutant is poorly Thr-68-phosphorylated and activated by IR consistent with this mutation abrogating Chk2 function (19Lee C.-H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, this mutant is also very unstable and may exist in a large, inactive complex that renders it inaccessible to upstream signaling cascades initiated by DNA damage (26Lee S.B. Kim S.H. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C.R. Schiripo T.A. Jorczak M.M. Sgroi D.C. Garber J.E. Li F.P. Nichols K.E. Varley J.M. Godwin A.K. Shannon K.E. Harlow E. Haber D.A.

Therefore, it is difficult to interpret data obtained with the R145W mutant because it is unclear whether this mutation solely affects FHA domain function or induces a more drastic conformational change that alters the entire structure of Chk2. We created a series of defined mutations within the FHA domain of Chk2 to further address whether it is necessary for the activation of Chk2 by ATM. Individual point mutations of theoretical phosphopeptide-binding residues within the Chk2 FHA domain did not alter the stability of the protein nor the ability of ATM to phosphorylate Thr-68. Instead, these mutations negatively affected autophosphorylation. We also demonstrate that the FHA domain of Chk2 binds specifically to the SQ/TQ-rich region of Chk2 in a Thr(P)-68-dependent manner. This association in turn may promote autophosphorylation at multiple sites including the FHA domain resulting in dissociation of this complex. Together, these data suggest that Thr-68 phosphorylation by ATM promotes association of two or more Chk2 molecules by enhancing the affinity of the SQ/TQ-rich domain of one Chk2 molecule for the Chk2 FHA domain of another. Oligomer formation may then facilitate trans-autophosphorylation and activation of Chk2 in irradiated cells. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) specific to phospho-Thr-68 of Chk2 were raised against a peptide containing ETVST(-PO4)QELYS and purified using antigen peptide conjugated to Sepharose (Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). Antibodies were further purified by passage through Thr-68 peptide (ETVSTQELYS)-Sepharose to deplete contaminating antibodies that are reactive with Chk2 not phosphorylated at Thr-68. Commercial antibodies used in this study included monoclonal anti-FLAG M5 (Sigma), monoclonal anti-GST and c-Myc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and polyclonal goat anti-Chk2 N-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 293T/17 and HCT-15 (which contains a heterozygous R145W mutation within the FHA domain of Chk2 (10Bell D.W.

For retrovirus production, 293T/17 cells were co-transfected with pBabe/puro FLAG Chk2 and the amphotropic pEQPAM3 packaging construct using calcium phosphate. After 48 h, media were collected, and HCT-15 cells were exposed three times to retrovirus in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After 2 days, retrovirus-infected cells were selected in 10 μg/ml puromycin and used for the further experimentation. Where indicated, cells were exposed to ionizing radiation from a 137Cs source delivered at a dose rate of ∼1.2 Gy/min.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar) and consists of the first 80 amino acids of Chk2 comprising the SQ/TQ-rich domain fused to GST. cDNA fragments containing the FHA domain (amino acids 60–225) or catalytic inactive kinase domain (amino acids 222–543, D368N) of Chk2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and/or pET-28a (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis of pSG5-FLAG Chk2 (18Ahn J.-H. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar) was performed by a two-step overlap PCR approach using oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation and primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ end of Chk2. FLAG-tagged wild type and mutant Chk2 cDNAs were excised from pSG5 and subcloned into the pBabe/puro retrovirus vector. All oligonucleotide synthesis and plasmid sequence analyses were performed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Escherichia coliBL21/DE3 cells were induced to express recombinant His6 or GST-tagged proteins with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 16 °C. Cells expressing GST-tagged proteins were lysed in STE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mmEDTA) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2% Triton X-100. GST-tagged proteins were then bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Cells expressing His6-tagged FHA or kinase domain were lysed in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 0.3% Sarkosyl, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Nonidet P-40 (0.6%) was added, and His-tagged proteins were bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), washed, and eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm Imidazole. Eluted proteins were then dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. His6-tagged full-length Chk2 was purified as above except that Sarkosyl was omitted from the lysis buffer. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 293T/17 cells or HCT-15 cells expressing wild type or T68A mutant FLAG-tagged Chk2 in NTEN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors). One mg of whole cell extract was incubated with 5 μg of GST-FHA pre-bound to glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound fractions were washed three times with NTEN buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ETVST(-PO4)QELYS (Thr(P)-68) and ETVSTQELYS (Thr-68) peptides were synthesized and conjugated to Sepharose at a concentration of 15 μmol of peptide/g (Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). E. coli expressing GST, GST-FHA, or GST-FHA containing the N166A mutation (GST-N166A) was lysed in STE buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Four mg of each lysate was incubated with 25 μl of Thr-68 or Thr(P)-68-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Mammalian whole cell extracts were prepared in NTEN buffer as above. One mg of each extract was incubated with peptide beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound fraction of each extract was washed three times with STE (E. coli) or NTEN (mammalian) buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Reactions were performed in kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C and contained 1 μg of purified His-tagged wild type (wt) or catalytic inactive (kd) Chk2 plus 2 μg of purified protein substrates. Kinase reactions were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). For binding assays using Chk2-phosphorylated GST-FHA, 10 μg of GST-FHA bound to glutathione-agarose was incubated with wt or kd Chk2 in the same buffer without [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Bound GST-FHA was washed three times with NTEN buffer and once with NTEN buffer containing 500 mm LiCl. One-half of each sample was directly used for the GST-FHA binding assay, whereas the other half was eluted with 10 mm glutathionine and used for the peptide binding assay. Both assays were performed as described above. 293T/17 cells were transiently co-transfected with SG5 FLAG- and Myc-tagged Chk2 constructs (18Ahn J.-H. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Thirty six hours after transfection, cells were exposed to 0 or 10 Gy IR, harvested 30 min later, and then lysed in NTEN buffer. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and soluble fractions were collected and diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. One mg of diluted whole cell extract was incubated with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma) or 10 μg of anti-Myc antibody plus 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Oncogene) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with 0.5× NTEN buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A series of individual mutations within the FHA domain were generated to determine the role of this domain in IR-induced autophosphorylation of Chk2. The crystal structure of the first FHA domain of RAD53 bound to a phosphothreonine-containing peptide reveals that this complex consists of a multiple strand β-sandwich containing short α-helical loops that extend out and make contact with a phosphothreonine-containing peptide (24Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These structural data were used to produce a modified sequence alignment of several FHA domains including Chk2 (24Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we created mutations at conserved residues that are located within the β-sandwich (G116E, H143A, and R145W) or proposed α-helical loops that are expected to make contact with a phosphopeptide ligand (R117A, S140A, K141A, N166A, and I157T) (Fig. 1A). Mutations of residues believed to form the β-sandwich structure of the Chk2 FHA domain (G116E and H143A) appeared to destabilize the protein (data not shown). These results are similar to what has already been documented for the LFS-associated R145W (10Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C.R. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M.L. Verselis S.J.

Mutations within the α-helical loops did not affect protein stability, and these Chk2 mutants were therefore used for further investigation. To determine whether mutations expected to disrupt phosphopeptide binding by the Chk2 FHA domain alter Chk2 activation by IR, we infected HCT-15 cells with retrovirus encoding various FLAG-tagged mutant cDNAs of Chk2. This cell line was chosen because endogenous Chk2 levels and activity are undetectable, and HCT-15 cells do not display normal Chk2 function (9Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J.

FLAG-tagged wild type Chk2 protein exhibited the characteristic phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift upon SDS-PAGE that correlates with kinase activation following DNA damage (1Matsuoka S.

Mutation of the highly conserved Arg-117, Ser-140, or Asn-166 residue to alanine was the most disruptive to DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Chk2, whereas mutation of the less conserved Lys-141 residue to alanine had the least impact. All mutants were phosphorylated on Thr-68 suggesting that the integrity of the FHA domain is not necessary for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Chk2. These observations contrast those observed for the unstable R145W mutant (19Lee C.-H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the catalytic inactive (kd) Chk2 protein containing the D368N mutation did not exhibit a mobility shift even though it showed strong Thr-68 phosphorylation after DNA damage. Therefore, changes in mobility of Chk2 protein during SDS-PAGE are caused by additional phosphorylation events that depend upon intrinsic kinase activity and an intact FHA domain but is independent of Thr-68 phosphorylation. In budding yeast, the FHA2 domain of RAD53 interacts with RAD9 in both a DNA damage- and phosphorylation-dependent manner, and this interaction facilitates trans-autophosphorylation and activation of RAD53 (21Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 25Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Like RAD9, mammalian BRCA1 and 53BP1 contain carboxyl-terminal tandem BRCT (BRCA1 carboxylterminus) motifs, and it has been speculated that either protein could be a functional homologue of RAD9 (29Zhou B.-B. S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Of interest, both BRCA1 and 53BP1 can associate with and/or co-localize with Chk2 and therefore may facilitate Chk2 activation by serving as a scaffold for Chk2 trans-autophosphorylation (8Lee J.-S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.-H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 30Ward I.M., Wu, X. Chen J. J. Biol.

Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar)) efficiently activated Chk2 in response to IR (data not shown) establishing that BRCA1 is not required for IR-induced activation of Chk2. Furthermore, our attempts to determine whether Chk2 and 53BP1 directly interact through co-immunoprecipitation studies were unsuccessful (53BP1 reagents were kindly provided by J. Chen). Therefore, other BRCA1- and 53BP1-independent mechanisms may exist that facilitate Chk2 autophosphorylation in irradiated cells. We considered the possibility that autophosphorylation is facilitated through direct oligomerization of Chk2 which is dependent upon both Thr-68 phosphorylation and a functional FHA domain. Binding assays were performed using recombinant GST protein fused to the Chk2 FHA domain (GST-FHA) as bait and whole cell extracts for a source of Chk2 protein to determine whether Chk2 directly interacts with its own FHA domain. Chk2 protein present in whole cell extract prepared from irradiated cells specifically bound to GST-FHA immobilized on glutathione-agarose (Fig. 2A). The interaction between Chk2 and GST-FHA was decreased if extract made from irradiated cells was pretreated with λ protein phosphatase consistent with the findings that protein interactions with FHA domains are phosphorylation-dependent (23Durocher D. Henkcel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Therefore, binding of Chk2 from irradiated cells to GST-FHA required DNA damage-induced phosphorylation in addition to a functional FHA domain because mutating a highly conserved residue within the FHA domain of Chk2 (GST-N166A) abolished specific binding of Chk2 obtained from irradiated cells (Fig. 2B). Thr-68 phosphorylation by ATM is believed to be the first event in the pathway leading to full activation of Chk2 in irradiated cells. To determine whether Thr-68 phosphorylation was required for Chk2 binding to GST-FHA, we prepared whole cell extracts from HCT15 cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild type or T68A Chk2 protein and subjected them to the in vitroGST-FHA binding assay. T68A mutant Chk2 protein present in irradiated cells failed to interact with GST-FHA suggesting that phosphorylation of Thr-68 is necessary for this DNA damage-dependent interaction (Fig. 2C). To confirm that the FHA domain of Chk2 can specifically bind to Thr(P)-68 Chk2, additional binding assays were performed using extracts made from E. coli expressing GST, GST-FHA, and GST-N166A and a 10-amino acid peptide representing the Thr-68 region of Chk2 conjugated to Sepharose. Only peptide containing Thr(P)-68 bound GST-FHA, and as expected, the N166A FHA domain mutant did not bind to Thr(P)-68 peptide-Sepharose (Fig. 3A). Therefore, a peptide consisting of the Thr(P)-68 region of Chk2 is a phospho-specific ligand for the Chk2 FHA domain, and the N166A mutation disrupts Chk2 FHA domain function without negatively affecting the stability of the protein. Mutations within the FHA domain that alter efficient activation of Chk2 in irradiated cells (R117A, S140A, K141A, and N166A) significantly reduced the ability of Chk2 to bind to Thr(P)-68 peptide in vitro (Fig. 3B). Consistent with its ability to be efficiently autophosphorylated and activated following IR, the I157T mutant bound to Thr(P)-68 peptide as well as wild type (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the efficiency by which Chk2 is autophosphorylated in response to IR grossly correlates with whether Chk2 can bind to P-Thr-68 peptide via the FHA domain. To determine whether the interaction between Thr(P)-68 and Chk2 depends upon a modification induced by IR, 293T/17 cells were irradiated or mock-irradiated, and whole cell extracts were incubated with either Thr-68 or Thr(P)-68 peptide-Sepharose. Chk2 from control rather than irradiated cell extracts bound to Thr(P)-68 peptide-Sepharose suggesting that the affinity of the FHA domain is reduced after cells are exposed to IR (Fig. 3C). Thus, the interaction between Thr(P)-68 peptide and full-length Chk2 depends upon an intact FHA domain but is diminished when Chk2 is modified in DNA-damaged cells. DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of the Chk2 FHA domain may be one mechanism by which Chk2 binding to Thr(P)-68 peptide is reduced. To explore the possibility that Chk2 autophosphorylates within the FHA domain or other potential sites, we purified three different recombinant Chk2 fragments that together represent the entire Chk2 protein molecule and subjected each fragment to in vitro kinase assays using purified wt or kd Chk2 kinase. Consistent with Chk2 autophosphorylating the activation segment, recombinant wt Chk2 phosphorylated a catalytic inactive kinase domain fragment (Fig. 4A). The FHA domain was highly phosphorylated by wt Chk2, whereas the SQ/TQ-rich region of Chk2 does not appear to be a substrate for Chk2 phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation of GST-FHA by wt Chk2 also reduced its ability to bind to Thr(P)-68-Sepharose and to interact with endogenous Chk2 present in extract obtained from DNA-damaged cells (Fig 4, B and C). Therefore, autophosphorylation within the FHA domain of Chk2 may induce rapid dissociation of Chk2 oligomers. It is unclear whether the FHA domain of Chk2 is required for interactions with the proteins it targets for phosphorylation. If this proves to be the case, autophosphorylation within the FHA domain may selectively affect Thr(P)-68 Chk2 binding and not all phosphoprotein interactions. FLAG-tagged and Myc-tagged catalytic inactive (kd) Chk2 proteins were co-expressed in 293T/17 cells to determine whether two or more Chk2 proteins associate with one another in vivo and whether Thr-68 phosphorylation and FHA domain integrity are required for this interaction. By using this approach, we have found that kd Chk2 forms a stable oligomer in 293T/17 cells based on the observation that both the FLAG and Myc antibodies can co-immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged Chk2 (Fig. 5). Despite DNA damage-induced Thr-68 phosphorylation of the N166A/kd double mutant, we were unable to detect oligomer formation by this mutant in irradiated cells suggesting that the integrity of the FHA domain is important for oligomer formation. Oligomer formation by the T68A/kd mutant is also deficient as compared with that exhibited by the kd Chk2 proteins (Fig. 5). Therefore, stable oligomer formation by catalytic inactive Chk2 requires both Thr-68 phosphorylation and an intact FHA domain. Repeated attempts to co-immunoprecipitate two differentially tagged wild type Chk2 molecules using this approach have been unsuccessful (data not shown). The observation that only kd Chk2 formed oligomers suggests that autophosphorylation by Chk2 reduces the affinity of one Chk2 molecule for another. We have frequently found that transient overexpression of wild type Chk2 at high levels in 293T/17 cells is associated with Chk2 autophosphorylation and activation in the absence of DNA damage (data not shown). This phenomenon is analogous to what occurs when RAD53 is expressed at high concentrations in E. coli where it becomes hyperphosphorylated in the absence of RAD9 (25Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inability to co-immunoprecipitate differentially tagged, wild type Chk2 proteins may be due to the fact that Chk2 is already activated and can no longer form stable oligomers once autophosphorylation occurs. This is consistent with our findings that recombinant GST-FHA phosphorylated by Chk2 in vitro exhibits reduced affinity for the Thr(P)-68 region of Chk2 and modified Chk2 expressed in irradiated cells (Fig. 4). In addition to wild type Chk2 activated in a DNA damage-independent manner upon overexpression in 293T/17 cells, we have also observed high levels of constitutive Thr-68 phosphorylation of kd Chk2 under similar conditions (Fig. 5). High levels of Thr-68 phosphorylation may reflect an inability of a specific phosphatase to gain access to Thr-68-phosphorylated kd Chk2 because it is presumably shielded by the FHA domain. The fact that we have only been able to co-immunoprecipitate kd Chk2 suggests that once phosphorylated on Thr-68, oligomerization of kd Chk2 becomes very stable. This is most likely due to low autophosphorylation activity expressed by kd Chk2 that would in turn result in a lower dissociation rate of the oligomer complex. Thus far, this is the first biologically relevant phosphorylation-dependent ligand described for the FHA domain of Chk2. Together, these data support the model that phosphorylation of Thr-68 by ATM promotes binding of the SQ/TQ region of one Chk2 molecule to the FHA domain of another forming oligomers. Oligomerization may effectively increase the local concentration of Chk2 such that trans-autophosphorylation becomes more favorable (Fig. 6). Trans-autophosphorylation within the FHA domain may then cause dissociation of the Chk2 complex. Active Chk2 monomers are released and proceed to phosphorylate effector molecules important for mammalian checkpoint control. Similar work is described in Xu, X., Tsvetko, L. M., and Stern, D. F.

LCA is caused by defects in at least five different genes that disrupt a variety of different cellular functions (2Perrault I. Rozet J.M. Calvas P. Gerber S. Camuzat A. Dollfus H. Chatelin S. Nat.

RPE65 is heavily expressed in RPE cells, where it plays an essential role in the retinoid cycle. This is a set of tightly interconnected events that involve both photoreceptors and RPE cells. The photoisomerization of the visual pigment chromophore (11-cis-retinal) produces all -trans- retinal, which is reduced in the photoreceptor, transferred to the RPE, converted back to 11 -cis- retinal, and then transferred back to the photoreceptor to regenerate the original visual pigment (reviewed in Ref. 9McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The precise function of RPE65 in retinoid processing is unknown. Genetically engineered mice in which the gene for Rpe65 has been eliminated (Rpe65−/−) exhibit changes in retinal morphology, function, and biochemistry that closely resemble the changes seen in human LCA patients. Both rod and cone function is severely disrupted, and the ERG is severely attenuated in Rpe65−/− mice (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M.

There is also a dramatic overaccumulation of all-trans-retinyl esters in the RPE cells in lipid-like droplets (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M.

Thus, the Rpe65−/− mouse provides the opportunity to gain insight into the cellular and molecular origins and consequences of LCA as well as a means to test different therapeutic strategies. Here we describe the results of an in-depth study of the changes in biochemistry and function that occur in Rpe65−/− mice and show how the progression of the disease can be interrupted and the functional effects reversed by providing a supply of 9-cis- retinal. The goals were to: 1) examine the beneficial effects of 9 -cis- retinal treatment on the progression of the disease and on photoreceptor function; 2) evaluate using single cell electrophysiology and ERG recording how 9-cis-retinal treatment affected rod function and light-driven signals in the retina; and 3) investigate the biochemical basis for the low level of residual vision that persists in both LCA patients and Rpe65−/− mice. We find that administration of 9 -cis- retinal to Rpe65−/− mice produces and maintains rod photopigment for more than 6 months in the dark. Early intervention with 9-cis-retinal restores normal rod physiology and significantly attenuates ester accumulation in the RPE but only partially improves retinal function as measured by ERG. These studies demonstrate that pharmacological intervention produces long lasting preservation of visual function in dark-reared Rpe65−/− mice and is a potentially useful therapy for restoring vision in LCA patients. All of the animal experiments employed procedures approved by the University of Washington Animal Care Committee and conformed with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia. Animals were maintained in complete darkness, and all of the manipulations were performed under dim red light employing all Kodak No. 1 Safelight filter (transmittance, >560 nm). Typically, 2–3-month-old mice were used in all of the experiments. RPE65-deficient mice were obtained from Dr. M. Redmond (NEI, National Institutes of Health) and genotyped as described previously (12Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat.

Double knockout Rpe65−/− Rgr−/− were generated by cross-breeding single Rpe65−/− and Rgr−/− mice to genetic homogeneity. All of the procedures were performed under dim red light as described previously (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K.

In addition to previously described methods, retinoid analysis was performed on an HP 1100 series high pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation A.07.01 software, allowing identification of retinoid isomers according to their specific retention time and absorption maxima. A normal phase column (Beckman Ultrasphere Si 5μ, 4.6 × 250 mm) and an isocratic solvent system of 0.5% ethyl acetate in hexane (v/v) for 15 min followed by 4% ethyl acetate in hexane for 60 min at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min at 20 °C (total 75 min) with detection at 325 nm allowed the separation of 11-cis-, 13-cis-, and all-trans-retinyl esters. In addition, all of the experimental procedures related to the analysis of dissected mouse eyes, derivatization, and separation of retinoids have been described previously in detail (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Rh and iso-Rh measurements were performed as described previously (16Palczewski K. Van Hooser J.P. Garwin G.G. Chen J. Liou G.I. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Typically, two mouse eyes were used per assay, and the assays were repeated three to six times. The data are presented with S.E.M. Eye cups were prepared by removing the anterior segment and vitreous. The eyes were collected on ice at PND 1–28 on a weekly basis. “Thin” sections (1.0 μm) were stained with Richardson's blue solution (1%) and subjected to light microscopy. “Ultrathin” sections (0.05 μm) were stained with uranyl acetate/lead citrate and subjected to electron microscopy. Fresh mouse eyes were enucleated immediately after cervical dislocation or CO2asphyxiation. The anterior segment, vitreous, and retina were carefully removed under a microdissecting scope. Typically, 30–40 eyes were dissected for each preparation. RPE cells were separated by placing 12 dissected eyecups in 400 μl of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 1 μm leupeptin and 1 mmdithiothreitol and vigorously shaken for 20 min. The eyecups were then gently brushed with a fine brush to further dislodge the RPE cells. The cell suspension was removed, another aliquot of 400 μl of MOPS buffer was added, and the eyecups were shaken again for 20 min. The cell suspensions were combined and subjected to glass-glass homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 275,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet was then reconstituted in 200 μl of the MOPS buffer and resubjected to glass-glass homogenization. The total protein concentration (typically 0.5–1 mg/ml) was determined by the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The assay used for determining isomerization to 11-cis-retinol was reported previously (17McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of bovine serum albumin (final concentration, 1%), 125 μl of 50 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane, pH 7.5, 10 μl of ATP (1 mm final concentration), 25 μm apo-recombinant CRALBP, 40 μl of RPE microsomes (typically 25–50 μg of total protein), and 0.5 μl of 4 mm all-trans-retinol in dimethylformamide. The reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched using 300 μl of MeOH, and the retinoids were extracted with 200 μl of hexane. The mixture was shaken vigorously for 2 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 4 min for phase separation. The upper organic layer was removed, and a 100-μl aliquot was separated and analyzed using an HP 1100 HPLC (Beckman Ultrasphere Si, 4.6 mm x 250 mm, 1.4 ml/min flow rate using 10% ethyl acetate in hexane) equipped with HP Chemstation software (version A.07.01). Syntheses of pro-S-[4-3H]NADH and pro-S-[4-3H]NADPH were carried out withl-glutamic dehydrogenase, NAD(P), andl-[2,3-3H]glutamic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (15Jang G.F. Van Hooser J.P. Kuksa V. McBee J.K. He Y.G. Janssen J.J. Driessen C.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

The assays were carried out by monitoring the production of [15-3H]retinol (reduction of retinal) using 11-cis-retinal and pro-S-[4-3H]NAD(P)H as dinucleotide substrates in the presence or absence of NADH (18Jang G.F.

Oral gavage was carried out as described previously (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The chemicals were purchased from Sigma/Aldrich unless otherwise specified. Solution A contained 10 mg of 9-cis-retinal, 75 mg of Cremophor EL, 1 mg of α-tocopherol, and 0.6 mg of benzoic acid suspended in 1 ml of lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter). The mixture was vortexed for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the concentration of 9-cis-retinal (7.7 mm) was determined spectrophotometrically. Solution B contained 13 mg of 9-cis-retinal, 50 mg of Cremophor EL, 10 mg of dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline, and 40 mg of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin suspended in 1 ml of lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter). The mixture was vortexed for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the concentration of 9-cis-retinal (10 mm) was determined spectrophotometrically. Solutions A and B (typically, 100 μl) were delivered to the mouse lateral tail vein employing a 1-ml syringe equipped with a 27-gauge needle and a restraint tube. Mice were dark-reared from birth and sacrificed via cervical dislocation, and the eyes were removed. The retina was isolated and stored on ice for up to 12 h in HEPES-buffered Ames' solution (10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Isolated rods were obtained by shredding a small piece of retina (roughly 1 mm2) with fine needles in a 160-μl drop of solution. The drop was then injected into a recording chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse) equipped with an infrared video viewing system and continuously superfused at 2–3 ml/min with bicarbonate-buffered Ames' solution warmed to 37 °C (pH 7.4 when equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% O2). The entire dissection was carried out under infrared illumination using a dissecting microscope equipped with infrared-visible image converters. An isolated rod was drawn by suction into a heat-polished, silanized borosilicate electrode with an opening 1.2–1.5 μm in diameter. The electrode was filled with HEPES-buffered Ames' solution. The electrical connections to the bath and suction electrode were made by NaCl-filled agar bridges that contacted calomel half-cells. Bath voltage was held at ground by an active clamp circuit (19Baylor D.A. Matthews G. Nunn B.J. J. Physiol. 1984; 354: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Membrane current collected by the suction electrode was amplified by an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 30 Hz (−3 dB point) with an 8-pole Bessel low pass filter, and digitized at 1 kHz. Light from light-emitting diodes with peak outputs at 470, 570, and 640 nm were combined using a trifurcated fiber optic and focused on the preparation using a water immersion lens in place of the microscope condensor. The light stimulus was spatially uniform and illuminated a circular area 0.57 mm in diameter centered on the recorded cell. Light intensities were measured at the preparation and converted to equivalent 500-nm photons (λmax for rod sensitivity)) using the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin and the measured light-emitting diode spectrum. Equivalent intensities for each experiment are given in the figure legends. Mice were dark-reared from birth and anesthetized (ketaject/xylaject, 65 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and the pupils were dilated with tropicamide (1%). A contact lens electrode was placed on the eye with a drop of methylcellulose and a ground electrode placed in the ear. ERGs were recorded and analyzed with the universal testing and electrophysiologic system 3000 (UTAS E-3000) (LKC Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The mice were placed in a Ganzfield chamber, and flicker recordings were obtained from one eye. Flicker stimuli had a range of intensities (0.00040–41 cd·s/m2) with a fixed frequency (10 Hz). Rpe65 mice were divided into five groups: Rpe65−/−, Rpe65−/− that were gavaged with 9-cis-retinal and kept in the dark,Rpe65−/− that were gavaged with 9-cis-retinal, exposed to a flash, and kept in the dark for 15 min,Rpe65+/+ that were kept in the dark, and Rpe65+/+ that were exposed to a flash and kept in the dark for 15 min. For the flash experiments, dark-adapted mice were subjected to a flash (Sunpak 433D, 1 ms) from a distance of 2 cm. The retinas were fixed in 4% paraformalydehyde in 0.13 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 15 h at 4 °C, and the tissues were transferred to 5, 10, or 15% sucrose in 0.13 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 30 min each time and stored overnight in 20% sucrose in the same buffer at 4 °C. The tissue was then transferred to optimal cutting temperature cryoembedding compound and sectioned at 10 μm. The cryosections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated Rh A11–82P antibody diluted 1:10. Triton X-100 (0.1%) was included in all phosphate-buffered saline solutions to facilitate antibody penetration. The controls were processed by omitting primary antibodies from the incubation buffer. After incubation in primary antibodies, the sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200). The sections were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline mounted in 5% n-propylgallate in glycerol and coverslipped. In addition to the loss of photoreceptors, a defective interface between ROS and RPE, RPE cells of Rpe65−/− mice contained numerous lipid-like droplets (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,12Redmond T.M., Yu, S.

Sci. 2001; 42: 3023-3030PubMed Google Scholar). In young animals, empty vacuoles were observed in fixed electron microscopy sections of RPE from Rpe65−/− mice but not in controls (data not shown). With increasing age (>PND 21), they were filled with a diffractive material that was retained during electron microscopy section preparation. This observation correlates with the excessive accumulation of all-trans- retinyl esters in Rpe65−/− mice (Fig. 1 A, open circles). Retinyl esters also accumulated with age in Rpe65+/+ mice, albeit at lower levels than for Rpe65−/− mice. By PND 21, ∼800 pmol/eye of retinyl esters accumulated compared with ∼40 pmol/eye for Rpe65+/+. For Rpe65+/+ mice, Rh levels initially exceeded the amount of retinyl esters several-fold. When PND 7 mice were treated with a 0.25-mg dose of 9-cis- retinal (10 mg/ml) every other day until they were 30 days old, a dramatic change in the ester accumulation was observed (Fig. 1 B). With increasing age and continued administration of 1 dose (1.25 mg) per week, the amounts of all-trans- retinyl esters increased, similar to Rpe65+/+, but the overall amounts of esters were dramatically suppressed with concomitant formation of iso-Rh (Fig. 1 C, left panel). Once deposited, the accumulated esters in the RPE were not removed if the treatment began after more than 1 month of age (Fig. 1 C, right panel). When young animals or young adults were treated with 9-cis- retinal, the interface contacts between the RPE and ROS were improved (Fig. 1 D, panels d, f, and h), and the vacuoles appeared to be only partially filled (Fig. 1 D, panels c and e) over several months of this study. These observations suggest that formation of the regenerated pigment significantly slowed down accumulation of esters but did not promote the complete removal of the all-trans- retinyl esters that had been deposited in the eye. Treatment of mice with 9-cis-retinal produced a long lasting increase in photopigment levels and a decrease in accumulation of all-trans- retinyl esters. Rpe65−/− mice (1-month-old) were treated once (2.5 mg) with 9-cis- retinal and then kept under either a 12-h light/dark cycle, or under 24 h dark for 37 days. No appreciable depletion of retinal was observed under either set of conditions (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that a single dose of 9-cis- retinal sustains iso-Rh in these animals under normal laboratory conditions. In another set of experiments, the level of Rh or iso-Rh was measured in 6-month-old Rpe65−/− mice (Fig. 2 B). In these animals, the iso-Rh levels were comparable for three groups of Rpe65−/− mice: mice treated twice with 9-cis-retinal (2.5 mg/dose) at PND 30 and 34, mice treated twice at PND 30 and 120, and mice treated twice at PND 30 and 150. The 50% decrease of iso-Rh in Rpe65−/− (Fig. 2,B compared with A) matches a similar decrease in Rh in Rpe65+/+ as a function of age. The ester levels were reduced by >50% (compared with untreated animals) and were unaffected by the frequency and dose of 9-cis-retinal. No Rh or iso-Rh was detected in untreated dark-adapted Rpe65−/− mice. 9-cis-Retinal, reduced to 9-cis-retinol, can be stored in the eye and liver in the form of 9-cis-retinyl ester. When needed 9-cis-retinol would be liberated by a retinyl hydrolase. To determine how large the reservoir of 9-cis- retinoids is in the eye and liver, a group of mice were treated with 9-cis-retinal (2.5 mg) and after 48 h exposed to multiple flashes at 1-h intervals that bleached ∼30–35% of Rh/flash. Iso-Rh and 9-cis- retinyl esters were significantly depleted after more than three intense flashes (data not shown). Retinyl esters from liver and RPE were completely depleted after five flashes at 24-h intervals (data not shown). Continuous shedding and resynthesis of Rh-containing ROS discs does not affect the long term preservation of the visual pigment. Therefore, it appears that 9-cis-retinal is, in a large part, recycled from phagocytized iso-Rh to newly produced opsin molecules over an extended period of time. Treatment of Rpe65−/− mice with 9-cis-retinal also provided long term improvement of retinal function. The long term physiological effect of 9-cis- retinal treatment was determined from single flash responses of different intensities (data not shown) and flicker ERG measurements on Rpe65+/+ and Rpe65−/− mice. Previous experiments showed a partial recovery of the ERG sensitivity 48 h after oral 9-cis- retinal administration (10Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We found that this partial recovery persisted for more than 12 weeks in Rpe65−/− mice treated once at PND 30. The flicker ERG in Rpe65+/+ mice reached a peak amplitude of 254.9 ± 41.5 μV at a light level of 0.015 cd·s/m2and 95.1 ± 8.9 μV at 7.5 cd·s/m2 (Fig. 2 C, left panel). These data resemble the rod and cone dominant ERG responses, respectively (11Seeliger M.W. Grimm C. Stahlberg F. Friedburg C. Jaissle G. Zrenner E. Guo H. Reme C.E. Humphries P. Hofmann F. Biel M. Fariss R.N. Redmond T.M. Wenzel A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In Rpe65−/− mice without treatment, the flicker ERG reached a significantly smaller peak amplitude, 76.0 ± 12.0 μV, at a light level of 7.5 cd·s/m2 (Fig. 2 C, right panel). Eight weeks after a single treatment with 2.5 mg of 9-cis- retinal, the flicker ERG reached peak amplitudes of 137.3 ± 24.4 μV at 0.059 cd·s/m2 and 40.0 ± 7.1 μV at 13 cd·s/m2 (Fig. 2 C, right panel). These peaks were smaller and occurred at a higher light level than in the Rpe65+/+ mice; however, the response of treated Rpe65−/− mice was 2.1 logarithmic units more sensitive and had larger amplitude than that of untreated mice. Thus, administration of 9-cis- retinal provided a long term, partial recovery of the ERG. To gain additional insight into the enzymatic processes of Rpe65 mice, several direct measurements of relevant enzymatic activities were carried out. It is generally accepted that opsin has some signaling capability. Immunolabeling on retina sections from Rpe65 mice using a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated opsin could provide a clean evaluation of this activity, whereas it would be expected that 9-cis-retinal treatment would inhibit this activity. The retinas from Rpe65+/+ mice (Fig. 3 C, panel A) and Rpe65−/− mice (Fig. 3 C, panel B) were fixed in constant darkness. The ROS in Rpe65+/+ mice showed no labeling (Fig. 3 C, panel A), and the ROS from untreated Rpe65−/− mice were labeled by a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated opsin (Fig. 3 C, panel B).

Autosomal dominant PEO was recently shown to co-segregate with a heterozygous Y955C mutation in the human gene encoding the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase γ (pol γ). Since Tyr-955 is a highly conserved residue critical for nucleotide recognition among family A DNA polymerases, we analyzed the effects of the Y955C mutation on the kinetics and fidelity of DNA synthesis by the purified human mutant polymerase in complex with its accessory subunit.

The Y955C derivative is 2-fold less accurate for base pair substitutions than wild-type pol γ despite the action of intrinsic exonucleolytic proofreading. The full mutator effect of the Y955C substitution was revealed by genetic inactivation of the exonuclease, and error rates for certain mismatches were elevated by 10–100-fold.

Dermaut B. Lofgren A. Martin J.J. Van Broeckhoven C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Located in the active site of pol γ, Tyr-955 is a highly conserved residue among a wide variety of DNA polymerases. As a family A DNA polymerase, pol γ is related to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase, and amino acid sequence alignments reveal that Tyr-955 in pol γ is equivalent to Tyr-766 in E. coli pol I and Tyr-530 in T7 DNA polymerase (see Fig. 1A). The three-dimensional structure of T7 DNA polymerase (13Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) in a ternary complex with DNA and a nucleoside triphosphate places this conserved tyrosine residue in close proximity to the incoming dNTP (see Fig. 1B). Functionally Tyr-530 in T7 DNA polymerase hydrogen bonds with Glu-480 to form part of the binding pocket for the incoming dNTP and to help discriminate against ribonucleotides (13Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Substitution of Tyr-766 in E. coli pol I with serine has only a minor effect onKm(dNTP), and a slight decrease inkcat is attributed to a 2.5-fold increase inKd(DNA) (14Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fidelity of a Y766F substitution in the Klenow fragment does not show an appreciable increase in nucleotide misinsertion; however, substitution with alanine or serine generates an error-prone DNA polymerase attributable to decreased stringency for selection of dNTPs (15Carroll S.S.

Interestingly the Y766A- and Y766S-substituted enzymes exhibited a 17-fold increase in deletions between direct repeat sequences (16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

These results predict that the Y955C substitution may lower the catalytic efficiency and/or the fidelity of human pol γ. We previously cloned and expressed the cDNAs for the catalytic subunit and the accessory subunit of human pol γ (12Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C.

We have also produced a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease-deficient derivative of pol γ to study the fidelity of DNA replication and selection of antiviral nucleotide analogs by pol γ (17Longley M.J. Ropp P.A.

In this report we investigate the effects of the Y955C mutation in human pol γ on the kinetics and fidelity of DNA replication. The His6 affinity-tagged recombinant catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase γ (p140) and the exonuclease-deficient form (p140 Exo−) were purified to homogeneity as described previously (17Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged accessory subunit (p55) was purified to homogeneity, and the two subunit forms of the polymerase (p140·p55 and p140 Exo−·p55) were reconstituted as described previously (18Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The Y955C p140 derivative was made with the QuikChange site- directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers 5′-CTG CCC AGC ACC ACA GAT GCG GCC GTA and 5′-TAC GGC CGC ATC TGT GGT GCT GGG CAG were used to generate Y955C in wild-type and exonuclease-deficient backgrounds in the baculovirus transfer vectors pHuγpVL (17Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and Exo−pQVSL11.4 (20Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23616-23623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), respectively. The Y955C mutation was verified by complete sequencing of the pol γ insert in each vector. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the exonuclease-proficient or -deficient forms of Y955C pol γ were selected and amplified, and protein was purified as described previously (17Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase activities of the wild-type and Y955C mutant pol γ with the accessory subunit were determined at optimal salt concentration with poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18 as substrate (18Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Plots of rate and dTTP concentration in enzyme-limiting reactions utilizing poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18 were fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain apparent kinetic constants. The accuracy of DNA synthesis by human pol γ was measured by copying a single-stranded region of bacteriophage M13 DNA encoding the α-peptide region of the β-galactosidase gene. Replication errors were scored by transfection and plating on chromogenic indicator plates to score plaque colors. The necessary bacterial strains, bacteriophage M13mp2 derivatives, and all procedures related to fidelity assays have been described elsewhere (19Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Gap-filling reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 25 mmHEPES·KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmeach of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, ∼150 ng of gapped M13mp2 DNA, 0.1 m NaCl, and either 20 ng of p140, 20 ng of p140 Exo−, 200 ng of p140/Y955C, or 830 ng of p140/Y955C/Exo−, each reconstituted with 1.3-fold molar excess of p55 accessory subunit. Reaction products were isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and closure of the gaps was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to transfection. Mutation frequencies were calculated as described, and specific nucleotide changes in mutant DNAs were determined by DNA sequencing (19Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments (Fig.1A) and the active site structure of T7 DNA polymerase (Fig. 1B) suggest that Tyr-955 in human pol γ is crucial for dNTP binding and fidelity of nucleotide selection. To study the biochemical properties of the Y955C variant responsible for PEO, we made the Y955C substitution by site-directed mutagenesis and overproduced the mutant protein in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. As compared with the wild-type enzyme in the presence of the accessory subunit, the Y955C pol γ exhibited a 4-fold reduction in overall DNA polymerase activity in our standard DNA polymerase assay (data not shown). Steady state kinetic analyses (Table I) indicated that the basis for the reduced activity was a 45-fold increase in the apparentKm for the incoming dNTP from 2.1 μm(WT Exo−) to 92 μm (Y955C Exo−) with no reduction in kcat and only a slight alteration in Kd(DNA). Thus, the Y955C polymerase has near wild type catalytic efficiency at higher dNTP concentrations. Since early estimates (22Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest nucleotide triphosphate pools in the mitochondrial matrix are high enough to support competent replication by this mutant polymerase, the reduced dNTP binding affinity alone may be inadequate to explain the phenotype in clinically affected heterozygotes (wild type/Y955C). Therefore, we tested whether the Y955C mutation was affecting the fidelity of DNA replication by pol γ.Table IEffects of Y955C mutation on kinetics of DNA synthesis by pol γPol γKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1WT Exo−2.14.62.2Y955C Exo−925.90.064Apparent steady state kinetic values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All values are the averages of at least two independent determinations. Open table in a new tab Apparent steady state kinetic values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All values are the averages of at least two independent determinations. We previously determined the fidelity of wild-type and exonuclease-deficient pol γ with and without the p55 accessory subunit (19Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Pol γ is highly accurate due to high nucleotide selectivity and exonucleolytic proofreading. Indeed genetic inactivation of the exonuclease activity was needed to reveal the complete error spectrum of the polymerase function. Also the p55 accessory subunit mildly decreased fidelity by promoting extension of misinserted nucleotides, and this negative effect may be balanced by the functional benefit of enhanced processivity conferred by the p55 subunit (18Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The accuracy of DNA synthesis by the human Y955C pol γ was measured in vitro by copying a single-stranded region of bacteriophage M13mp2 DNA encoding the α-peptide of the β-galactosidase gene as described previously (21Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The first experiment utilized a sensitive reversion assay that measures eight different single base substitutions at a TGA codon withinlacZα. In the absence of proofreading, the Y955C mutation raised the mutation frequency 42-fold from 13 × 10−5(WT pol γ) to 550 × 10−5 (Y955C pol γ). In the exonuclease-proficient background the mutator effect of the Y955C mutation was 2-fold (0.33 × 10−5 for WT pol γ and 0.72 × 10−5 for Y955C pol γ), implying that the majority of misinsertions produced by the Y955C polymerase are proofread (Table II). Nevertheless this 2-fold increase in base substitution errors should significantly increase the mutant fraction of the heteroplasmic mtDNA pool during the preclinical onset period leading to PEO.Table IIError frequencies of wild-type and Y955C mutant pol γMutation assayPol γ error frequency (×105)Wild typeY955C mutantExo-proficientExo-deficientExo-proficientExo-deficientTGA reversion0.33130.72 (2)550 (42)Forward mutation130500110 (1)3300 (7)Error frequencies were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative effects of the Y955C mutation are indicated in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Error frequencies were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative effects of the Y955C mutation are indicated in parentheses. To gauge the broader effects of the Y955C mutation on fidelity of replication, a substrate bearing a 407-nucleotide mutational target was utilized to score all 12 possible single base substitutions, each in a variety of sequence contexts, as well as additions and deletions of 199 different template nucleotides (21Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The frequencies of lacZmutant plaques generated with and without intrinsic proofreading activity by the wild-type and Y955C forms of pol γ in the presence of the 55-kDa accessory subunit are shown in Table II. Under conditions with active proofreading the Y955C mutation did not significantly change the mutation frequency, indicating that the mutations produced by the Y955C mutant polymerase are proofread by its intrinsic 3′–5′ exonuclease. In the absence of proofreading the Y955C polymerase demonstrated a 7-fold higher mutant frequency as compared with the wild-type polymerase. Sequencing the DNA from mutant plaques revealed primarily single base substitution errors with 45% of the mutant plaques containing more than one mutation. When considering all mispairs, the average base substitution error rate of the Y955C polymerase was elevated 10-fold in the exonuclease-deficient background (Fig. 2). Perhaps the most striking effect of introducing the Y955C mutation was that the rates of forming point mutations due to T·dTMP and T·dGMP mispairs increased by factors of 110 and 81, respectively (Fig. 2). In fact, transition mutations caused by misinsertion of G opposite a template T represent 60% of all of the base substitution errors observed for Y955C pol γ (142 of 235 mutants). Interestingly analysis of point mutations in mtDNA from PEO patients revealed A·T → G·C transitions as the most common mutation (8 of 14 cases listed in the MitoMap data base), although the autosomal defects responsible for these cases of PEO are not known. 2MitoMap data base at www.gen.emory.edu/mitomap.html. Pathogenic base substitutions in mtDNA are well documented for PEO.2 Our in vitro data indicate that pol γ makes both +1 and −1 frameshift errors at almost 20% of the base substitution error rate, although proofreading substantially reduces the frameshift error rate. The Y955C mutation increases the frameshift error rate by 4-fold, but base substitution errors remain the primary replication error catalyzed by Y955C pol γ. Clinical tests based on Southern blots or PCR are designed to detect deletions in mtDNA, and multiple deletions in mtDNA have become a clinical hallmark of PEO. Large deletions in mtDNA between direct repeats, such as the 4977-base pair deletion between nucleotides 8470 and 13447, are found in both dominant and recessive forms of PEO (24Johns D.R. Rutledge S.L. Stine O.C. Hurko O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8059-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Soueidan S.A. Costigan D.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We present a model in which the enhanced base substitution error rate of Y955C pol γ promotes deletions between direct repeats in mtDNA (Fig.3). This mechanism invokes a misinsertion event following correct synthesis through a direct repeat sequence. Failure of the polymerase to proofread the error or to extend the mismatch favors a slippage event between the direct repeats that creates a matched DNA terminus at a downstream template sequence (Fig.3). Large deletions between direct repeats were observed for the analogous Y766S mutation in the Klenow fragment (16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we propose that a common T·dTMP misinsertion by Y955C pol γ (Fig. 2) initiates the 4977-bp deletion observed in some PEO patients. Mitochondrial disorders marked by depletion, deletion, or base substitution of mtDNA are most likely caused by defects in nuclear genes that function to maintain mtDNA. Genetic predisposition to the accumulation of mtDNA mutations, as in PEO patients with the Y955C allele, is consistent with the delayed-onset and progressive course of such degenerative mitochondrial diseases. In addition to our identification of exonuclease-deficient pol γ (19Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Y955C pol γ as mutator DNA polymerases, Zassenhaus (26Zhang D. Mott J.L. Chang S.W. Denniger G. Feng Z. Zassenhaus H.P. Genomics. 2000; 69: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of exonuclease-deficient pol γ in mice is associated with cardiomyopathy and results in accumulation of point mutations, deletions, and large deletions flanked by direct repeats. Thus, mutations that reduce the fidelity of pol γ cause mitochondrial disease through mutagenic replication of mtDNA. The ability of other pol γ mutations linked with disease (11Van Goethem G. Dermaut B. Lofgren A. Martin J.J. Van Broeckhoven C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) to affect the fidelity of the polymerase has not been tested. Multiple mutations within the “Twinkle” gene encoding a putative mitochondrial helicase are also causally linked to dominant PEO with mtDNA deletions (9Li J.N. Spelbrink F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M. Wanrooij S. Garrido N. Comi G. Morandi L. Santoro L. Toscano A. Fabrizi G.M. Somer H. Croxen R. Beeson D. Poulton J. Suomalainen A. Jacobs H.T. Zeviani M. Larsson C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), and a dysfunctional replicative helicase (dnaB) has been shown to enhance deletions in E. coli, possibly by stalling the replication fork (27Saveson C.J. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1997; 146: 457-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the nuclear genes for ANT1 or thymidine phosphorylase also induce pathogenic mutation of mtDNA (7Kaukonen J.

In summary, we believe that autosomal mitochondrial disorders exhibiting point mutations, deletions, and rearrangements have a higher mtDNA mutation rate due to enhanced damage or compromised mechanisms of mtDNA maintenance, and we predict a general mechanism in which point mutations are an early event in PEO and other mitochondrial diseases affecting the integrity of mtDNA.

https://openalex.org/W2171152271,"Abstract Resistin, also known as AdipocyteSecreted Factor (ADSF) and Found inInflammatory Zone 3 (FIZZ3), is a mouse protein with potential roles in insulin resistance and adipocyte differentiation. The resistin gene is expressed almost exclusively in adipocytes. Here we show that a proximal 264-base pair fragment of the mouse resistin promoter is sufficient for expression in adipocytes. Ectopic expression of the adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) was sufficient for expression in non-adipogenic cells. C/EBPα binds specifically to a site that is essential for expression of the resistin promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies of the endogenous gene demonstrated adipocyte-specific association of C/EBPα with the proximal resistin promoter in adipocytes but not preadipocytes. C/EBPα binding was associated with the recruitment of coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein and a dramatic increase in histone acetylation in the vicinity of the resistin promoter. The antidiabetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug rosiglitazone reduced resistin expression with an ED50 similar to its K dfor binding to peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Other TZD- and non-TZD PPARγ ligands also down-regulated resistin expression. However, no functional PPARγ binding site was found within 6.2 kb of the transcriptional start site, suggesting that if PPARγ is involved, it is either acting at a long distance from the start site, in an intron, or indirectly. Nevertheless, rosiglitazone treatment selectively decreased histone acetylation at the resistin promoter without a change in occupation by C/EBPα, CREB-binding protein, or p300. Thus, adipocyte specificity of resistin gene expression is because of C/EBPα binding, leading to the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators and histone acetylation that is characteristic of an active chromatin environment. TZD reduces resistin gene expression at least in part by reducing histone acetylation associated with the binding of C/EBPα in mature adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2057772566,"During bone formation, multipotential mesenchymal cells proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts, and subsequently many die because of apoptosis. Evidence suggests that the receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), the PTH-1 receptor (PTH-1R), plays an important role in this process. Multipotential mesenchymal cells (C3H10T1/2) transfected with normal or mutant PTH-1Rs and MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were used to explore the roles of PTH, PTHrP, and the PTH-1R in cell viability relative to osteoblastic differentiation. Overexpression of wild-type PTH-1R increased cell numbers and promoted osteocalcin gene expression versus inactivated mutant receptors. Furthermore, the effects of PTH and PTHrP on apoptosis were dramatically dependent on cell status. In preconfluent C3H10T1/2 and MC3T3-E1 cells, PTH and PTHrP protected against dexamethasone-induced reduction in cell viability, which was dependent on cAMP activation. Conversely, PTH and PTHrP resulted in reduced cell viability in postconfluent cells, which was also dependent on cAMP activation. Further, the proapoptotic-like effects were associated with an inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. These data suggest that parathyroid hormones accelerate turnover of osteoblasts by promoting cell viability early and promoting cell departure from the differentiation program later in their developmental scheme. Both of these actions occur at least in part via the protein kinase A pathway. During bone formation, multipotential mesenchymal cells proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts, and subsequently many die because of apoptosis.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4732-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the PTH-1R is the major receptor responsible for skeletal actions of PTH and PTHrP, as evidenced by similar phenotypes in the PTHrP and PTH-1R null mouse models (11Lanske B. Amling M. Neff L. Guiducci J. Baron R. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Ablation of the PTH-1R gene in mice results in a neonatal-lethal phenotype with severe abnormalities in development of cartilage and bone (12Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M. Defize L.H., Ho, C. Mulligan R.C. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Science. 1996; 273: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). To form bone, multipotential mesenchymal cells proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts, which secrete an extracellular matrix that becomes mineralized. Mature osteoblasts eventually become osteocytes or lining cells or vanish because of apoptosis. Evidence suggests that the PTH-1R plays an important role in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis that occurs during bone formation. Expression of the PTH-1R is considered a hallmark for osteoblastic differentiation, because the PTH-1R is primarily associated with active collagen-producing osteoblasts compared with osteoblasts in earlier or later stages of differentiation (13McCauley L.K. Koh A.J. Beecher C.A. Cui Y. Rosol T.J. Franceschi R.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further, osteocalcin mRNA, a specific osteoblastic marker, is undetectable in osteoblasts lacking the PTH-1R but becomes detectable after transfecting PTH-1R null cells with wild-type PTH-1R (14Divieti P. Lanske B. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active PTH-1R (H223R) display increased osteoblastic proliferation and decreased apoptosis in trabecular bone leading to an increase in trabecular bone volume (15Calvi L.M. Sims N.A. Hunzelman J.L. Knight M.C. Giovannetti A. Saxton J.M. Kronenberg H.M. Baron R. Schipani E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In humans, genetic abnormalities of the PTH-1R also result in profound skeletal defects. Constitutively active mutant PTH-1 receptors H223R (16Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), T410P (17Schipani E. Langman C.B. Parfitt A.M. Jensen G.S. Kikuchi S. Kooh S.W. Cole W.G. Jüppner H. N. Engl. J.

The expression of H223R, T410P, and I458R in COS-7 cells results in a 4–8-fold increase in basal cAMP accumulation when compared with the wild-type PTH-1R control (16Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 17Schipani E. Langman C.B. Parfitt A.M. Jensen G.S. Kikuchi S. Kooh S.W. Cole W.G. Jüppner H. N. Engl. J.

Roume J., Le Merrer M. Silve C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and P132L (20Zhang P. Jobert A.S. Couvineau A. Silve C. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The mutant Δ373–383 expressed in COS-7 cells does not bind PTH or PTHrP and fails to induce detectable stimulation of either cAMP or inositol phosphate production (19Jobert A.S. Zhang P. Couvineau A. Bonaventure J. Roume J., Le Merrer M. Silve C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). P132L, a milder inactivated mutant receptor, results in severely reduced PTH-induced cAMP accumulation and undetectable PTH-induced inositol phosphate accumulation (20Zhang P. Jobert A.S. Couvineau A. Silve C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the PTH-1R during bone formation has not been thoroughly and mechanistically investigated. Therefore, this study takes advantage of the different functional activities of wild-type and mutant PTH-1 receptors to explore the impact of the PTH-1R in a mesenchymal cell differentiation system. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of overexpressing mutant and wild-type PTH-1 receptors on the cellular growth program of mesenchymal cells. The plasmid constructs utilized for the PTH-1R transfection experiments included pEGFP-N2 (pE), (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and pEGFP-N2 containing cDNA for the wild-type PTH-1 receptor (WT) or mutant PTH-1 receptors Δ373–383 (Δ), P132L (P), and H223R (H) (16Schipani E.

The pCMV-CREB (constitutively expresses the wild-type CREB) (CLONTECH), pCMV-CREB133 (a dominant-negative mutant vector preventing Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB) (CLONTECH), TAM-67 (a c-jun dominant-negative vector) (21Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar), and pcDNA (control plasmid for TAM-67) (Invitrogen) constructs were used to determine the role of CREB and AP-1 complex in signal transduction of apoptosis pathway. C3H10T1/2 is an undifferentiated murine mesenchymal cell line (22Reznikoff C.A. Brankow D.W. Heidelberger C. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 3231-3238PubMed Google Scholar) with the potential to become myoblasts, adipocytes, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (23Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P.

Their induction into the osteoblastic lineage can be stimulated with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (25Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H.

C3H10T1/2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in basal medium Eagle's (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were passaged every 4–5 days. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with different plasmid constructs (pE, WT, Δ, or P) using PerFect-2 (Invitrogen) or LipofectAMINETM Plus (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were selected in 700 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks to establish stable cell lines. The subclones were generated by limiting dilution. Geneticin (350 μg/ml) was added to cultures once a week to maintain the stability of transfectants. For transient transfection experiments, C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with different plasmid constructs (pE, Δ, WT, H, pCMV-CREB, CREB133, TAM-67, or pcDNA) using LipofectAMINETM Plus. MC3T3-E1 cells were obtained through Dr. Renny Franceschi from Dr. M. Kumegawa (Meikai University, Sakado, Japan) and maintained as described previously (27Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in minimum essential medium alpha medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were passaged every 4–5 days. The adenylyl cyclase stimulation and cAMP-binding protein assay were performed as described previously with minor modification (28McCauley L.K. Rosol T.J. Merryman J.I. Capen C.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were plated in triplicate at 20,000 cells/cm2 into 24-well plates, and medium containing ascorbic acid (Fisher) (50 μg/ml) was changed every other day. BMP-4 (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) (50 ng/ml) was added on day 3, and the adenylyl cyclase stimulation assay was performed at day 8. Briefly, the cells in triplicate wells were stimulated with 10−7 m hPTH (1–34) (Bachem, Inc., Torrance, CA) or vehicle control (0.1% bovine serum albumin with 4 mm HCl) in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine at 37 °C for 10 min. After aspirating the medium, cAMP was extracted by adding 250 μl/well ice-cold 5% perchloric acid and incubating overnight at −20 °C. After thawing, the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with 4 n KOH, and the neutralized extract was then assayed for cAMP using a cAMP-binding protein assay. The cAMP-binding protein assay was performed by incubating [3H]cAMP (ICN, Irvine, CA) with standards or unknowns and a cAMP-binding protein sufficient to bind ∼30% of radioactivity for 90 min on ice. The samples were then incubated with dextran-coated charcoal for 20 min and centrifuged to remove unbound from bound cAMP-binding protein-[3H]cAMP complexes. The radioactivity of the supernatants was determined with a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer, and cAMP levels were calculated by the log-logit method using the GraphPad Prism 3 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Triplicate wells were analyzed for DNA content by fluorometric analysis as described previously to standardize cAMP levels (13McCauley L.K. Koh A.J. Beecher C.A. Cui Y. Rosol T.J. Franceschi R.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were plated in triplicate in 24-well plates and treated with experimental reagents at designated times, and viable cell numbers were determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method using a hemacytometer. To determine the effects of PTH/PTHrP on apoptosis, caspase inhibitors 2 × 10−7 m YVAD-cmk (inhibits caspase-1) and DEVD-fmk (inhibits caspase-3 and caspase-8) (CLONTECH) were used to inhibit apoptosis (29Turner P.R. Mefford S. Christakos S. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and dexamethasone (10−7 m) was used to induce apoptosis (5Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) as described previously. During apoptosis, the cell membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Annexin V binds with high affinity to cells with exposed phosphatidylserine. Annexin V conjugated to fluorochromes such as phycoerythrin (PE) can be used in flow cytometry for apoptosis analysis (30Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.

Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). Annexin V-PE staining is used in conjunction with a vital dye, 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD), for detection of early apoptotic cells (Annexin V-PE-positive and 7-AAD-negative). C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in duplicate at 20,000 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates and transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINETM Plus on the second day. Treatment with or without serum deprivation was performed by incubation in basal medium Eagle's with or without 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h after washing cells. The floating cells were collected, and the adherent cells were trypsinized with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). Floating and adherent cells were combined, rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in 1× annexin V binding buffer. Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) staining were performed by adding 5 μl of both agents to all treatment groups. The controls included annexin V-PE only, 7-AAD only, and no staining. The cells were incubated in the dark for 15 min, and flow cytometry was performed within 1 h at the University of Michigan Flow Cytometry Core. Annexin V-PE-positive and 7-AAD-negative cells were defined as apoptotic cells. Apoptosis cleaves cellular DNA into histone-associated fragments. The cell death detection ELISA Plus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) is a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay utilized to measure nucleosomal particles in cytoplasmic fractions. To measure apoptosis in postconfluent cells, WT subclone cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 at day 0. On day 7, after a 3-h treatment with caspase inhibitors (2 × 10−7 m YVAD-cmk + 2 × 10−7 m DEVD-fmk) or vehicle (0.04% Me2SO), the cells were exposed to PTH (1–34) (10−8 m) or vehicle treatment, and apoptosis ELISA was performed at day 8 as described previously (32Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, and 20 μl of supernatant was added to each well in a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. Subsequently, a mixture of anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA-peroxidase monoclonal antibodies was added and incubated with shaking for 2 h. Following several washing steps, the nucleosomes were quantified by adding 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazolin sulfonate] diammonium salt to the peroxidase retained in the immunocomplex. The subsequent color reaction was measured in an ELISA plate reader at 405 nm against a 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazolin sulfonate] diammonium salt blank (reference wavelength at 490 nm). The cells were plated in duplicate at 50,000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm dishes with medium containing ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) for each cell type. After the cells reached confluence, the culture medium was changed into medium containing BMP-4 (50 ng/ml) and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) for 2 days, and then the total RNA was isolated 4 days after confluence. The steady state expression of osteocalcin was determined by Northern blot analysis. RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (33McCauley L.K. Beecher C.A. Melton M.E. Werkmeister J.R. Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Rosol T.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels. The RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Duralon UV) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) via passive transfer and cross-linked with UV transillumination (Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene). The membranes were hybridized with a cDNA probe for osteocalcin labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (AmershamBiosciences) using the Rediprime labeling system (AmershamBiosciences). After hybridization and washing, radioactivity counts were measured using an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co., San Diego, CA) and blots exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 24–72 h. The blots were stripped and probed with an 18 S ribosomal RNA cDNA to control for RNA loading. MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm dishes. The culture medium was changed at days 1, 3, 5, and 7. At day 8, the cells received PTHrP (1–34) (10−7 m) (0–120 min), and the proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis as described (34McCauley L.K. Koh-Paige A.J. Chen H. Chen C. Ontiveros C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After resolving by 10% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked in TBST (10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.85% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:500 dilution of Akt antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or 1:1,000 dilution of phosphorylated Akt antibody (Cell Signaling) in TBST. After three washes with TBST and incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody, the membranes were washed five times with TBST and developed by chemiluminescent detection according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). All of the assays were repeated at least three times with similar results unless otherwise noted. The data were analyzed using either analysis of variance or a Student's t test with the Instat 2.1 biostatistics program (GraphPad Software). PTH binds to the PTH-1R and activates adenylyl cyclase, which leads to increased cAMP. To verify the existence and function of the transfected PTH-1Rs, adenylyl cyclase stimulation assays were performed after cells were induced to differentiate with the addition of BMP-4 and standardized to DNA levels in all samples. BMPs are widely used to induce osteoblastic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells (25Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem.

Baron R. Rawadi G. Bone. 2001; 29: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In stable mixed populations (Fig. 1 A), all groups had elevated cAMP after PTH (1–34) stimulation reflecting the biologic activity of the PTH-1R. WT transfectants had more biologically active PTH-1Rs, as demonstrated by the greatest cAMP response. In contrast, the groups with mild (P132L) and severely (Δ373) inactivated mutant PTH-1Rs showed a lower cAMP response and the least cAMP response, respectively. The cAMP response of the plasmid-only group (pEGFP) indicated the existence of functional endogenous wild-type PTH-1Rs in C3H10T1/2 cells. Representative subclones were also utilized in experiments to get homogeneous populations of each type of stable transfectant. The result of adenylyl cyclase stimulation of selected subclones (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated significant cAMP responses in all groups except Δ373. The cAMP response after PTH stimulation was the highest in the WT subclone and the lowest in Δ373 similar to their respective mixed populations. Interestingly, we noted that WT mixed populations and subclones demonstrated a 65 and 60% increase in DNA content when compared with the respective Δ373 groups, suggesting that the expression of functional PTH-1Rs resulted in increased numbers of cells. The assays were also performed in subclones without BMP induction of differentiation. Basal cAMP levels were not altered in the absence of BMP induction (P132L, 2.24 ± 1.26 pmol cAMP/μg DNA; Δ373–383, 1.27 ± 1.07 pmol cAMP/μg DNA; pEGFP, 0.95 ± 0.66 pmol cAMP/μg DNA; and WT, 1.02 ± 0.81 pmol cAMP/μg DNA). Without BMP treatment, no PTH-induced cAMP levels were found in P132L and Δ373 subclones. WT and pEGFP had 2.7- and 3.3-fold elevated cAMP levels, which demonstrated a PTH response, but significantly lower than when BMP-induced. This suggests that BMP treatment may induce PTH receptor expression as previously demonstrated (25Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S.

Thus, viable cell enumeration assays were performed to determine the effect of PTH on dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in preconfluent WT subclone cells (Fig. 2). PTH (1–34) demonstrated an antiapoptotic-like effect by blocking the dexamethasone-induced decrease in viable cell number. In this assay system, dexamethasone has previously been reported to stimulate apoptosis, and PTH was found to prevent the dexamethasone-induced effect (5Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP is an important intracellular secondary messenger in the PTH-1R signal transduction pathway. To explore the mechanism of PTH on apoptosis in preconfluent cells, flow cytometry detection of apoptosis with parallel adenylyl cyclase stimulation assays were performed on transient transfectants of pEGFP, WT, and H223R. WT had a higher PTH-induced cAMP response than H223R as reported in COS-7 cells (17Schipani E. Langman C.B. Parfitt A.M. Jensen G.S. Kikuchi S. Kooh S.W. Cole W.G. Jüppner H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, H223R demonstrated the highest basal cAMP levels among all groups indicative of its constitutive activity (Fig. 3 A). The H223R transfected cells had a significantly reduced percentage of apoptotic cells (annexin V-PE-positive and 7-AAD-negative cells) after serum withdrawal (Fig. 3 B). Likewise, treatment with forskolin (10−6 m), an activator of cAMP, prevented the dexamethasone-induced reduction in viable cell numbers in preconfluent C3H10T1/2 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that cAMP is responsible for the antiapoptotic effect of PTH in preconfluent undifferentiated cells. CREB and the AP-1 complex are two downstream mediators of the PKA pathway (36Pearman A.T. Chou W.Y. Bergman K.D. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Ofir R. Dwarki V.J. Rashid D. Verma I.M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 55-60PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the PTH/PTHrP antiapoptotic effect in preconfluent cells, WT subclone cells were transiently transfected with specific constructs that inhibit either CREB (CREB133) or the AP-1 complex (TAM-67) and evaluated in viable cell enumeration assays (Fig. 4). PTHrP prevented the apoptosis induced by dexamethasone in the plasmid-only group but not in the CREB133 or TAM-67 transfection groups. This indicates that the PKA downstream mediators, CREB and AP-1 complex, play important roles in mediating the antiapoptotic effect of PTH/PTHrP in preconfluent mesenchymal cells.

However, the downstream components of defense-associated Ca2+ signaling are largely unknown. Because Ca2+ signals are mediated by Ca2+-binding proteins, including calmodulin (CaM), identification and characterization of CaM-binding proteins elicited by pathogens should provide insights into the mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates defense responses. In this study, we isolated a gene encoding rice Mlo (Oryza sativa Mlo;OsMlo) using a protein-protein interaction-based screening of a cDNA expression library constructed from pathogen-elicited rice suspension cells. OsMlo has a molecular mass of 62 kDa and shares 65% sequence identity and scaffold topology with barley Mlo, a heptahelical transmembrane protein known to function as a negative regulator of broad spectrum disease resistance and leaf cell death. By using gel overlay assays, we showed that OsMlo produced in Escherichia coli binds to soybean CaM isoform-1 (SCaM-1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We located a 20-amino acid CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) in the OsMlo C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that is necessary and sufficient for Ca2+-dependent CaM complex formation. Specific binding of the conserved CaMBD to CaM was corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis, a gel mobility shift assay, and a competition assay with a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme. Expression of OsMlo was strongly induced by a fungal pathogen and by plant defense signaling molecules. We propose that binding of Ca2+-loaded CaM to the C-terminal tail may be a common feature of Mlo proteins.

There is considerable interest in identifying and characterizing CaM-binding proteins because at least some are expected to have a direct role in mediating the outcome of plant-pathogen encounters. Barley Mlo is the founder of a plant-restricted and sequence-diversified class of seven-transmembrane proteins located in the plasma membrane (25Devoto A. Piffanelli P. Nilsson I. Wallin E.

Homozygous mutations in barley Mlo confer broad spectrum resistance to the powdery mildew fungus and exhibit a developmentally controlled phenotype of spontaneous leaf cell death, indicating that the wild-type gene has a negative regulatory function in plant defense and leaf cell death (26Wolter M.

Here we report the isolation from rice of a gene encoding an Mlo homologue (OsMlo) that shares 65% sequence identity with the barley gene, HvMlo. OsMlo expression was found to be responsive to pathogen and plant defense signaling molecules. We identified a 20-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal tail of OsMlo that is required for Ca2+-dependent complex formation with CaM. The conservation of the novel CaMBD among Mlo family members in diverse plant species suggests that activity modulation via CaM could be a common feature of Mlo proteins. A rice cDNA expression library was constructed in a λZAPII vector (Stratagene) from rice (Oryza sativa L. Milyang 117) suspension cells treated with a fungal elicitor as described previously (29Kim C.Y. Lee S.-H. Park H.C. Bae C.G. Cheong Y.H. Choi Y.J. Han C.-D. Lee S.Y. Lim C.O. Cho M.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SCaM-1 was conjugated to a maleimide-activated HRP using the EZ-Link maleimide-activated HRP conjugation kit (Pierce) as described in a previous report (30Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Heo W.D. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Cheong Y.H. Kim C.Y. Lee SH. Lee K.J. Bahk J.D. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We screened the rice cDNA expression library as described by Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.2-12.44Google Scholar), using the HRP-conjugated SCaM-1 (SCaM-1:HRP) as a probe. Approximately 4 × 104 plaque-forming units were plated per 15-cm LB plate using Escherichia coli XL1-blue MRF (Stratagene) as the host strain. The plates were incubated at 42 °C until the plaques appeared. The plates were then overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that had previously been soaked in 10 mm IPTG. The incubation was continued at 37 °C for 6–8 h, and the plates were cooled to 4 °C. The filters were removed and rinsed twice in a large volume of TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). The filters were blocked by incubation in 7% (w/v) non-fat dry milk/TBS-T overnight, and the blocked filters were washed three times with TBS-T for 5 min and equilibrated in overlay buffer (50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h. The membranes were blocked a second time by incubating the filters in overlay buffer containing 9% (v/v) gelatin (Sigma), 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1 mmCaCl2 for 3.5 h. SCaM-1:HRP was added to the gelatin-containing buffer at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml, and the filters were incubated for 1 h. Final washing was done in three steps, with each step consisting of five repeats of a 5-min wash: first, in TBS-T/50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2; second, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Tween 20, 50 mm imidazole HCl, 0.5m KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2; and third, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm MgCl2. Bound CaM:HRP was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). A total of 5 × 105 recombinants were screened, and 50 positive clones were isolated after three rounds of screening. cDNA inserts were recovered by in vivo excision with helper phage (ExAssist, Stratagene). To confirm the binding of positive clones to CaM, we expressed positive clones as β-galactosidase fusion proteins in E. coli and examined the clones for CaM binding by a CaM:HRP overlay assay as described above. In brief, we transformed positive clones into XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and induced the expression of β-galactosidase fusion proteins with IPTG treatment. Twenty micrograms of IPTG-induced E. coli crude protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-MP membrane (PVDF, Millipore). The membrane was rinsed in TBS-T, blocked by incubation in 7% (w/v) non-fat dry milk/TBS-T overnight, and processed as described above. For determination of Ca2+-independent binding of CaM, 5 mm EGTA was substituted for the 1 mm CaCl2 in all overlay buffers. The cDNA sequences of the resulting positive clones were determined from both strands of cDNA by dideoxynucleotide chain termination using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI 373A, Applied Biosystems Inc.), and BLAST searches were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. One of the positive clones contained a partial coding region that was homologous to the barley Mlo gene. To obtain the truncated 5′ region of OsMlo cDNA, we performed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The truncated 5′ region of OsMlo cDNA was amplified from cDNA synthesized from mRNA of rice suspension cells treated with a fungal elicitor by using an OsMlo gene-specific oligonucleotide (5′-GCCCTAAACCCATGGTGATGA-CGC-3′) and an adaptor primer from CLONTECH. The amplified product was subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. To obtain a full-length clone, the 5′-RACE product was subcloned into the 5′ region of the partial OsMlo cDNA clone. For mapping the CaM binding domain, several C-terminal deletion constructs were prepared in a pGEX-2T vector. First, a BamHI site was introduced in front of the ATG codon of a full-length cDNA clone (named OsMlo.B) using PCR. The OsMlo.B clone was digested by KpnI, PstI, or SphI and blunted by T4 DNA polymerase. The fragments were then cut with BamHI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into a pGEX-2T vector digested with BamHI and SmaI. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs were named according to the fragment they contained as follows: D0 for BamHI/KpnI (amino acids 1–554), D1 for BamHI/PstI (amino acids 1–488), and D3 for BamHI/SphI (amino acids 1–151). The OsMlo.B clone was also cut with BamHI and then partially digested with EcoRV. The larger and smaller BamHI/EcoRV fragments were both subcloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of the pGEX-2T vector and called D2 (amino acids 1–299) and D4 (amino acids 1–100), respectively. The putative CaMBD (amino acids 440–476) of OsMlo was amplified using a 5′ primer containing BamHI (5′-CGGGATCCGAGCAAACGATGAAGGCGC-3′) and a 3′ primer containing SmaI (5′-TATCCCGGGCGTCGCGAAGTCGACGC-3′), and the amplified fragment was also subcloned into a pGEX-2T vector (GST::OsMlo. CaMBD, denoted by C). To identify the critical residue(s) in the interaction between CaM and OsMlo, we introduced several point mutations into the GST::OsMlo. CaMBD clone. Substitutions of single amino acids were performed using the QuickChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences used are as follows: for L446R, F, 5′-GATGAAGGCGCGGATGAACTGGAGG-3′ and R, 5′-CCTCCAGTTCATCCGCGCCTTCATC-3′; for W449R, F, 5′-GCTGATGAACCGGAGGAAGAAGGC-3′ and R, 5′-GCCTTCTTCCTCCGGTTCATCAGCG-3′; for N448K, F, 5′-GAAGGCGCTGATGAAATGGAGGAAGAAGG-3′ and R, 5′-CCTTCTTCCTCCATTTCATCAGCGCCTTC-3′; for E455K, F, 5′GGAGGAAGAAGGCGATGAAGAAGAAGAAGGTCCGG-3′ and R, 5′-CCGGACCTTCTTCTTCTTCATCGCCTTCTTCCTCC-3′. All the clones were introduced into E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS and expressed. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced by application of 1 mm IPTG for 5 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml lysozyme), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixture was sonicated for 1 min at 50% pulse and then centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. The supernatant (containing the E. coli crude protein) was used for Western blotting and a CaM:HRP gel overlay assay. Twenty micrograms of E. coli crude protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (PVDF, Millipore); expressed GST fusion proteins were detected by a polyclonal GST-specific antiserum. To examine the CaM binding ability of recombinant proteins, a duplicate blot was probed with an SCaM-1:HRP conjugate in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. The CaM:HRP overlay assay was carried out as described above. The bound CaM was visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). A peptide (443MKALMNWRKKAMEKKKVRDA462) corresponding to a stretch of 20 amino acids in the CaMBD of OsMlo was synthesized at a peptide synthesis facility (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.). The CaM binding ability of the synthetic peptide was detected by a relative mobility shift of CaM in the presence of the peptide (32Erickson-Vitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). SCaM-1 (303 pmol) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the peptide (molar ratio: 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0) in a binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), plus 0.1 mmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) at room temperature for 1 h. One-half volume of 50% glycerol plus the tracer bromphenol blue was added, and the mixtures were electrophoresed in 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.375 mTris-HCl (pH 8.8), and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. The gels were run at a constant voltage of 100 V in an electrode buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2or 2 mm EGTA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) assays were performed using commercially available bovine heart CaM-deficient PDE (Sigma). The initial 500-μl reaction volume contained buffer (100 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5), 2.56 mm cAMP, 5.13 mm MgSO4, 1.28 mm CaCl2) with concentrations of SCaM-1 (5–200 nm) in the presence (100 nm) or absence of peptide. The reaction was started with the addition of PDE (0.5 milliunit/μl). The basal level of enzyme activity was determined in the absence of SCaM-1, and the stimulated activity was determined in the presence of SCaM-1 and CaCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by placing the reaction tubes into a boiling water bath for 5 min and on ice for 2 min. Following a brief centrifugation, 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase (10 units) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After vortexing, the precipitates were spun down, and the supernatant (400 μl) was transferred to a new tube. After adding 1 ml of phosphate reagent (19Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and assayed for Pi at OD660. The dissociation constant (Kd) of SCaM-1 for the peptide was calculated from the concentration of SCaM-1 (nm) required to obtain half-maximal (50%) PDE activity either in the presence (100 nm) or absence of peptide. The following equation was used to calculate dissociation constants (32Erickson-Vitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar): Kd = ([Pt ] + K − [CaM])K/([CaM] − K), where [Pt ] is the total concentration of peptide added, and [CaM] and K are the concentrations of CaM required to obtain half-maximal activation of PDE in the presence or absence of peptides, respectively. Fungal spores were isolated from rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) and inoculated into rice suspension-cultured cells (5 × 105 spores/ml) as described by Kim et al. (29Kim C.Y. Lee S.-H. Park H.C. Bae C.G. Cheong Y.H. Choi Y.J. Han C.-D. Lee S.Y. Lim C.O. Cho M.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All of the chemicals used in the procedure were introduced into the rice cell suspension culture, and total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method with subsequent ultracentrifugation (31Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.2-12.44Google Scholar). RNA was separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto a nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were incubated with 32P-labeled full-length OsMlo cDNA at 65 °C overnight and washed under high stringency conditions according to the method of Church and Gilbert (33Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). Rice genomic DNA was extracted as described (34Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9408) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of DNA were digested with EcoRI, Hin dIII, or XbaI, fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membrane was probed with 32P-labeled full-length OsMlo cDNA. Hybridization and washing conditions were as described above for Northern blot analysis. A multiple antigenic peptide (OsMloAg, 103KGLKGKKDHRRRLLW117 in OsMlo) was synthesized at the Peptide Synthesis Facility (Peptron, Daejun, South Korea). The polyclonal antibody against the OsMloAg peptide was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit, and the polyclonal antiserum was purified by antigen affinity chromatography on an OsMloAg peptide-Sepharose column as described (35Chung W.S. Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Heo W.D. Kim M.C. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Lim C.O. Kim W.B. Harper J.F. Cho M.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1393-1407PubMed Google Scholar). The column was prepared by conjugating the OsMloAg peptide to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). A microsomal membrane fraction was prepared from 10-day-old rice leaves according to the procedure described by Chung et al. (35Chung W.S. Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Heo W.D. Kim M.C. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Lim C.O. Kim W.B. Harper J.F. Cho M.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1393-1407PubMed Google Scholar). Rice leaves were ground on ice in prechilled homogenization buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% (w/w) sucrose, 2 mmEDTA, 4 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet per 10 ml of lysis buffer) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min to remove intact organelles and cell walls. The supernatant was divided into a cytosolic protein fraction (supernatant) and a microsomal fraction (pellet) by further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting microsomal pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer (1 ml per 10 g of starting material) using glass homogenizers. Microsomes were applied to a continuous sucrose gradient from 15 to 45% (w/w) in centrifugation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 18 h. Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected from the top, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used. To identify molecular components of the Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling pathways associated with plant defense responses, we screened a rice cDNA expression library constructed from a fungal elicitor-treated rice suspension cell culture using HRP-conjugated SCaM-1 as a probe (29Kim C.Y. Lee S.-H. Park H.C. Bae C.G. Cheong Y.H. Choi Y.J. Han C.-D. Lee S.Y. Lim C.O. Cho M.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). So far, seven highly conserved CaMs (GenBankTM accession numbers X65016 (36Liu Z. Pan N. Chen Z. Acta Bot. Sin. 1991; 35: 363-369Google Scholar),AF441190, AF042839, AF441191, AF042840, L18913, and Z12827) and a divergent CaM isoform containing an unusual 12-amino acid insertion, between the second and third calcium-binding motifs (AB060552), have been identified from rice. SCaM-1 is nearly identical to the conserved type of rice CaMs, showing only a single amino acid difference compared with OsCaM (Ser11 → Ala (37Reddy A.S.N. Narasimhulu S.B. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Plant J. 1996; 10: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) and two amino acid differences compared with the other conserved rice CaMs (GenBankTM accession numbers AF441190 and AF042839: Ser11 → Ala and Arg75 → Lys; GenBankTM accession numbers AF441191, AF042840, L18913, and Z12827: Glu8 → Asp and Ser11 → Ala). High conservation of amino acid sequences between conserved rice CaMs and SCaM-1 may suggest that they can share their target/binding proteins, leading us to expect a similar resu"
https://openalex.org/W2067581172,"This study aimed at determining the signaling pathways underlying calcitonin- and isoproterenol-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase in rat renal collecting duct. H,K-ATPase activity was determined in microdissected collecting ducts preincubated with or without either specific inhibitors or antibodies directed against intracellular signaling proteins. Transient cell membrane permeabilization with streptolysin-O allowed intracellular access of antibodies. The stimulation of H,K-ATPase by calcitonin and isoproterenol was mimicked by cAMP analogues and was abolished by adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Protein kinase A inhibition abolished isoproterenol but not calcitonin effect on H,K-ATPase. Calcitonin increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a protein kinase A-independent manner, and the inhibition of the ERK phosphorylation prevented the stimulation of H,K-ATPase by calcitonin. Antibodies directed against either the cAMP-activated guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Epac I, the monomeric G protein Rap-1 or the kinase Raf-B, curtailed the stimulation of H,K-ATPase by calcitonin, whereas antibodies against the related monomeric G protein Ras or kinase Raf-1 had no effect. In conclusion, calcitonin stimulates H,K-ATPase through a cAMP/Epac I/Rap-1/Raf-B/ERK cascade.

Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 377-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to physically separate pure populations of these different cell types, one can determine the cellular origin of cAMP-mediated responses on the basis of this hormone selectivity. Using this approach, we have previously reported that in rat CCD, the H,K-ATPase is present in both Iα and Iβ cells in which it is stimulated by salmon calcitonin (Sct) and isoproterenol (Iso), respectively (2Laroche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1053-F1059PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of H,K-ATPase, along with that of H-ATPase reported previously (3Siga E. Houillier P. Mandon B. Moine G. de Rouffignac C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1217-F1223PubMed Google Scholar), probably participates in the regulation of proton transport by these two hormones (3Siga E. Houillier P.

Firstly, besides activating the Gs/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, calcitonin and isoproterenol also increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in rat CCD (5Siga E. Champigneulle A. Imbert-Teboul M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F354-F365PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ankorina-Stark I. Haxelmans S. Schlatter E.

Physiol. 1995; 268: F1070-F1080PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, several cAMP-binding proteins other than PKA have now been described: the cAMP receptor of Dictyostelium discoideum, which participates in the regulation of the development of this unicellular eukaryote (8Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Deverotes P.N. Science. 1988; 241: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase, which participates in the regulation of protein methylation (9Hohman R.J. Guitton M.C.

Thus, depending on the nature of cAMP-binding proteins expressed in different cell types and on their supramolecular organization, the effects of cAMP may be mediated by PKA-dependent or independent mechanisms. Interestingly, the kidney is one of the tissues displaying the highest levels of expression of mRNAs encoding Epac I (12de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verhaijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B.

Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), making possible an important role of these two proteins in the signalization of cAMP actions in kidney cells. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the signaling pathways underlying the stimulation of H,K-ATPase activity by Sct and Iso in the rat CCD, in particular the involvement of the cAMP-binding proteins PKA, Epac I, and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Experiments were carried out on male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). Cortical collecting ducts were dissected at 4 °C from collagenase-treated kidneys as described previously (16Imbert M. Chabardès D. Montégut M. Clique A. Morel F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1975; 354: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After microdissection, the ducts were photographed to determine their length, which served to normalize results. Unless indicated otherwise, microdissection was carried out in a solution containing (in mm) 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 4 NaHCO3, 0.2 NaH2PO4, 0.15 Na2HPO4, 5 glucose, 0.5 CaCl2, 0.08 dextran, 2 lactate, 20 Hepes, 4 essential and nonessential amino acids, 0.03 vitamins, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The pH was adjusted to 7.4, and osmotic pressure was adjusted to 400 mosmol/kg with mannitol. For RNA extraction, tubule isolation was run under “RNase-free conditions” (17Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Tessiot C Bellanger A.C. Dublineau I de Rouffignac C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For Western blotting analysis, antiproteases (1 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 10 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 10 μg ml−1aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg ml−1antipain) were added to the dissection solution. Microdissected CCDs were preincubated with specific inhibitors of different intermediates of signaling pathways or with their solvent before incubation with hormones. Pools of CCDs dissected from collagenase-treated kidneys (2–4 mm in length) were pretreated with or without the inhibitors at 30 °C for 45–120 min before treatment with hormones (10 min at 37 °C). The hormone treatment was stopped by cooling the samples at 4 °C. H89 dihydrochloride, myristoylated protein kinase A peptide inhibitor 14–22 amide, and bisindolylmaleimide I were from Calbiochem. U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis-(O-aminophenylmercapto)butadiene) was from Sigma. All inhibitors were prepared from aqueous solutions with the exception of U0126, which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The corresponding control groups contained the same concentration of Me2SO (<0.1% v/v). When specific inhibitors were not commercially available, we evaluated the effect of antibodies directed against several signaling proteins. Intracellular entry of antibodies was made possible by transient permeabilization of CCD cells by streptolysin-O (18Abdel Ghani E.M. Weis S. Walev I. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15204-15211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Leino L. Forbes L. Segal A. Cockcroft S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For this purpose, pools of CCDs were first preincubated at 37 °C for 8 min and then for 90 min at 4 °C with or without the antibody in a medium containing (in mm) 137 NaCl, 3 KCl, 5 glucose, 20 Pipes, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 IU/ml streptolysin-O (Sigma) at pH 6.8. CCDs were then transferred into the usual dissection medium and incubated with hormones as described above. All antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France): affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide mapping at the C terminus of the α-catalytic subunit of human PKA (sc-903); affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibodies against a peptide mapping near the C terminus (catalytic domain) or at the N terminus (cAMP-binding domain) of human Epac I (sc-8880 and sc-8879, respectively); affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide mapping at the C terminus of human B-Raf (sc-166); rabbit polyclonal IgG against an epitope mapping near the C terminus of human Rap-1A (sc-65); a monoclonal IgG1 antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the C terminus of Raf-1 p74 of human origin (sc-7267); and an affinity purified rat monoclonal antibody derived by fusion of spleen cells from a rat immunized with Y3Ag 1.2.3. rat myeloma cells (sc-35). Although all of these antibodies were directed against the active portion of the proteins (12de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verhaijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L.

H,K-ATPase activity was determined using the radiochemical microassay described previously (23Buffin-Meyer B. Younes-Ibrahim M. Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F124-F131PubMed Google Scholar) and adapted for microplate assay. To avoid contamination with Na,K-ATPase, CCDs were rinsed in a cold Na+-free solution containing (in mm) 0.8 MgSO4, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 100 Tris-HCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and mannitol up to 400 mosmol/kg at pH 7.4. After transfer within 0.5 μl of rinsing solution into a 96-well flat bottom plastic microplate, samples were permeabilized by adding 2 μl of hypotonic solution (10 mm Na+-free Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with or without 10−4m Sch-28080) to each sample and freezing on dry ice. After thawing and adding 10 μl of assay medium (see composition below), the microplate was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The incubation was stopped by cooling and adding 300 μl of an ice-cold suspension of 15% (w/v) activated charcoal. After centrifugation, aliquots of 50 μl of each supernatant were transferred to a 96-well sample microplate for Cerenkov counting (Trilux microbeta 1450, Wallac, Finland). H,K-ATPase activity was distinguished from other ATP-hydrolyzing activities on the basis of its sensitivity to Sch-28080, a specific inhibitor of the renal H,K-ATPase activities (23Buffin-Meyer B. Younes-Ibrahim M. Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F124-F131PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for each experimental condition, eight samples were divided into two groups, one for measuring total ATPase activity and the other for measuring the ATPase activity in presence of Sch-28080. H,K-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between these two mean ATPase activities. The ATPase assay medium contained (in mm) 25 Tris-HCl, 10 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 2.5 KCl, 50 Tris-ATP, and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with or without 300 μmSch-28080. Pools of 30 CCDs dissected in medium supplemented with leupeptin (25 μg ml−1) and aprotinin (25 μg ml−1) were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with or without H89 and then at 37 °C for 10 min with or without hormones. Samples were then transferred with 0.5 μl of incubation medium into 14.5 μl of lysis buffer containing (in mm) 100 NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 2 sodium pyrophosphate, 2.5 glycerophosphate, 30 NaF, 1 EGTA, 20 Hepes, 1 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 10 μg ml−1aprotinin, 10 μg ml−1 aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg ml−1 antipain at pH 7.4, vortexed, and kept on ice for 1 h. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed and stored at −80 °C until use. Supernatants were resuspended (v/v) in 2× Laemmli, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were electrotransferred on polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and incubated for 1 h with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (dilution 1:2000) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) and with 5% (w/v) dried nonfat milk. After washing in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, membranes were incubated for 45 min with an anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution 1:5000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal substrate method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each experiment, the amounts of proteins loaded to each lane of the electrophoresis gel corresponded to the same initial length of isolated CCDs (±5%). The chemiluminescence of each lane was quantified by densitometry (arbitrary units) and expressed in each experiment as the percent of the control lane (no hormone treatment). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. from several animals. RNAs were extracted from pools of 20–50 microdissected glomerulus or nephron segments as previously described (17Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Tessiot C Bellanger A.C. Dublineau I de Rouffignac C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and summarized below. The pools of tubules were transferred with 10 μl of microdissection solution into 400 μl of denaturing solution (4 m guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% sarcosyl) and 20 μg of yeast RNA (Amersham Biosciences) used as a carrier. After phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation, the final RNA pellet was dried under vacuum and dissolved in RNA dilution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units/ml RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI)). The yield of this RNA extraction procedure is ≥90% (17Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Tessiot C Bellanger A.C. Dublineau I de Rouffignac C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Expression of mRNAs encoding Epac I and Rap-1 was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR using the following specific primers: Epac I sense (5′-CGAGCAGGAACGCAGCACCTACATC-3′) and antisense (5′-TCACTTCCCTCACGGAGGCTGTCAC-3′), bases 1429–1453 and 1811–1836 from the initiating ATG, respectively; and Rap-1 sense (5′-GCTCTGACAGTTCAGTTTGTTCAGGGAA-3′) and antisense (5′-AACATCTTCCGTGTCCTTAACCGGTAAA-3′), bases 6–34 and 254–282, respectively. Reverse transcription was carried out for 45 min at 45 °C in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of RNAs from 1 glomerulus or 1 mm of tubular length, of antisense primer (6.25 pmol), dNTP (200 μm), and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units). PCR was subsequently carried out in the same tube in a final volume of 100 μl after the addition of the sense primer (6.25 pmol), 5 μCi [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci mmol−1), and Taq polymerase (1.25 units). Samples were submitted to 30 cycles of three temperature steps: 95 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min with the exception of the last cycle in which the elongation lasted 10 min. The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose slab gels, which were analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) for determining the intensity of the signals. Intracellular calcium concentration was measured in single microdissected CCDs by using the calcium-sensitive fluorescence probe Fura-2/AM as described previously (5Siga E. Champigneulle A. Imbert-Teboul M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F354-F365PubMed Google Scholar). After 1 h of loading with 10 μm Fura-2/AM in presence or absence of 1 μm PKA inhibitor H89, each CCD was transferred into a superfusion chamber on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss IM 35, Oberkochen, Germany). The tubules were superfused (3–4 ml min−1) at 37 °C with a solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 0.44 NaH2PO4, 0.33 Na2HPO4, 1.0 CaCl2, and 5 glucose with or without 1 μm H89 at pH 7.4. After 5–10-min equilibration period, calcitonin or ATP used as a positive control was added to the superfusate. The tubular portion selected for fluorescence measurements included approximately 30 cells. Double wavelength measurements of Fura-2/AM fluorescence were recorded every 2 s. The calculation of [Ca2+]i was performed as described previously (5Siga E. Champigneulle A. Imbert-Teboul M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F354-F365PubMed Google Scholar). Results are given as the means ± S.E. from different animals. The data were compared according to either paired or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate or when comparing more than two groups together according to ANOVA test with PLSD Fisher. Incubation of CCDs with 10 nm Sct or with 1 μm Iso resulted in a mean 4-fold stimulation of H,K-ATPase activity. However, nonstimulated and stimulated H,K-ATPase activities were quite variable between animals, making it necessary to test the different experimental conditions of a same group in the same animals (paired experiments). Preincubation with 1 μm H89 (Fig. 1A) did not modify basal and Sct-stimulated H,K-ATPase activity but totally blocked the stimulation by Iso. Preincubation with 10 μm myristoylated inhibitory peptide 14–22 amide, another inhibitor of the PKA catalytic subunit, also blocked Iso-induced but not Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase (Fig. 1B). The effect of H89 and myristoylated inhibitory peptide 14–22 amide were also mimicked by a polyclonal antibody directed against PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 1C). In summary, these results demonstrate that Iso stimulates H,K-ATPase activity through the canonical PKA signaling pathway, whereas the effect of calcitonin is independent of PKA. Therefore, we attempted next to determine the signaling mechanism of calcitonin. To investigate whether or not cAMP is the second messenger that underlies Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase in Iα cells, the requirement for adenylyl cyclase and cAMP was determined by three approaches. Firstly, CCDs were pretreated with 2.5 mm2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase. Results show that 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine did not change basal H,K-ATPase activity but abolished its stimulation by Sct (Fig. 2A). This finding demonstrates that adenylyl cyclase activity is essential for the stimulation of H,K-ATPase by Sct. Secondly, to further investigate the role of cAMP in Sct-induced enzyme activation, we determined the effects of the permeant cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP (100 μm) and of forskolin (1 μm). Because the results obtained with the two compounds were similar, they were pooled (Fig. 2B). The addition of 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin stimulated H,K-ATPase activity over 8-fold. The fact that this stimulatory factor (×8) equals the sum of those observed in response to Iso (×4) and Sct (×4) suggests that 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin mimick the effects of the two hormones. This observation is further demonstrated by the finding that stimulation by 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin was inhibited by 50% with H89 (as expected from inhibition of β-intercalated cells). Finally, Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase was also mimicked by (Rp)-cAMP (Fig. 2C), a diastereomer of cAMP that inhibits PKA (24Rothermel J.D. Parker Botelho L.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that in Iα cells, cAMP interacts with a cAMP-binding protein, different from PKA that mediates the stimulation of H,K-ATPase activity. Interestingly, this cAMP-binding protein is equally well activated by cAMP and by its analogue (Rp)-cAMPs conversely to PKA regulatory subunit, which is inhibited by (Rp)-cAMPs. Because cyclic nucleotide-gated channels 3 are expressed at a high level in the kidney (15Biel M. Zong X. Distler M. Bosse E. Klugbauer N. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and because Sct increases [Ca2+]i in rat CCD (5Siga E. Champigneulle A. Imbert-Teboul M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F354-F365PubMed Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and [Ca2+]imight possibly mediate the stimulation of H,K-ATPase activity. However, Sct-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was markedly reduced by pretreating CCDs with 1 μm PKA-specific inhibitor H89 (Fig. 3). This finding demonstrates that these increases in [Ca2+]iresulted from the activation of the canonical cAMP/PKA cascade. This conclusion is corroborated by the lack of stimulation of phospholipase C by calcitonin in CCDs (data not shown). These findings rule out a contribution of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and increased [Ca2+]i in the mediation of Sct on H,K-ATPase activity. They also demonstrate the presence of a functional H89-sensitive cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in Iα cells. Epac I (also called cAMP-GEF I) is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor specific of the monomeric G protein Rap-1, which is directly activated by cAMP (12de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verhaijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 13Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Because Epac I is expressed at high levels in kidneys (12de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verhaijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 13Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether it might be the target of cAMP involved in the stimulation of H,K-ATPase by Sct in Iα cells. For this purpose, we determined (a) whether Epac I and its target Rap-1 are expressed in rat collecting duct and (b) the role of Epac I in Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase. Reverse transcription-PCR on microdissected nephron segments revealed that mRNAs encoding Epac I (Fig. 4A) and Rap-1 (Fig. 4B) were expressed along the whole nephron. However, the highest levels of expression were found in CCDs, which is compatible with a possible involvement of Epac I and Rap-1 in Sct action in CCD Iα cells. Indeed, the pretreatment of CCDs with polyclonal antibodies directed against either the C terminus (Fig. 5A) or the N terminus of Epac I (Fig. 5B) abolished Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase activity, whereas they did not alter the effect of Iso. Altogether, these results identify Epac I as the cAMP-binding protein involved in the stimulatory effect of calcitonin in CCD Iα cells.Figure 5Role of Epac I and Rap-1 on hormone-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase. CCDs were transiently permeabilized with streptolysin-O (0.4 units ml−1 for 8 min at 37 °C) in the absence (Control) or the presence of two antibodies (dilution 1:100) directed against the C terminus (A) or the N terminus of Epac I (B) and incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. Afterward, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min without hormone (solid bars) or with either 10 nm salmon calcitonin (open bars) or 1 μm isoproterenol (hatched bars) before measuring H,K-ATPase activity.N, number of experiments.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we evaluated (a) the roles of Rap-1 and B-Raf in Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase, (b) whether Sct activates ERK1/2 in CCDs, and (c) whether activation of ERK1/2 mediates the stimulation of H,K-ATPase. The pretreatment of CCDs with a polyclonal antibody directed against an epitope close to the C terminus of Rap-1 curtailed the stimulatory effect of Sct (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of the related G protein Ras did not alter the effect of Sct on H,K-ATPase activity (Fig. 6B). Similarly, the pretreatment with an antibody directed against the C terminus of B-Raf abolished the stimulatory effect of Sct on H,K-ATPase, whereas a monoclonal antibody mapping a C terminus epitope of the related kinase Raf-1 had no effect (Fig. 6, C and D). Western blot analysis using an antibody against phospho-ERKs p42 and p44 demonstrates that calcitonin increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by >50% and that this effect was insensitive to the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 7A). (Rp)-cAMPs mimicked the effect of calcitonin on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). These findings are compatible with the involvement of ERK activation in the stimulation of H,K-ATPase by Sct. Indeed, the preincubation with 5 μmU0126, an inhibitor of the ERK kinase MEK (27Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), abolished Sct-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase (Fig. 7C). This study shows that calcitonin-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase in Iα cells of rat collecting duct is mediated by cAMP but is independent of PKA. Instead, it involves Epac I, the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of the monomeric G protein Rap-1, whose activation triggers B-Raf and the MAPK kinase ERKs. A myriad of molecules participates in the intracellular control of cell functions. These molecules can constitute different signaling networks according to their level of expression, the presence of their various isoforms and their subcellular compartmentalization. Thus, the signaling pathways characterized in cultured and/or transfected cells may not be relevant in native cells under physiological conditions, especially in highly differentiated cells such as kidney epithelial cells. However, deciphering signaling pathways in native cells remains difficult because we lack specific pharmacological inhibitors for most intracellular signaling molecules. In this study, we tentatively used antibodies directed against signaling proteins as specific inhibitors based on the hypothesis that the binding of an immunoglobulin on or close to the active site of a protein should alter its activity and/or its interaction with other proteins located upstream or downstream the signalization cascade. Although an inhibitory activity was previously demonstrated only for the anti-Ras antibody (22Signal I.S. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Scolnick E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4725-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the five antibodies, which were tested in this study, proved to display a biological effect. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of an antibody may be as potent as that of a pharmacological inhibitor as illustrated in Fig. 1 for the anti PKA antibody. In addition, the biological effects of the antibodies were specific. (a) As shown on Fig. 1C, the anti-PKA antibody inhibited the effect of isoproterenol in Iβ cells but not that of calcitonin in Iα cells, whereas two different anti Epac I antibodies curtailed calcitonin but not isoproterenol action (Fig. 5). (b) Antibodies directed against Rap-1 and B-Raf abolished calcitonin action, whereas antibodies directed against Ras and Raf-1, two related proteins of the same families, had no effect (Fig. 6). Finally, transient permeabilization of cell membranes with streptolysin-O is a convenient method for integrating macromolecules into native epithelial cells, because it allows to maintain a cell integrity sufficient to preserve the activity of H,K-ATPase as well as its stimulation by hormones (see control activities in Figs.1C, 5, and 6). This method could be useful to integrate recombinant proteins with constitutive activating or inhibiting mutations (positive or negative dominants). Although calcitonin and isoproterenol receptors can couple to effectors other than adenylyl cyclase (28Chen Y. Shyu J.-F. Santhangopal A. Inoue D. David J.-P. Dixon S.J. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), cAMP is responsible for the stimulation of H,K-ATPase in both Iα and Iβ cells. Indeed, cAMP analogues or forskolin mimicked the hormone effects (Fig. 2, B and C), and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase prevented them (Fig. 2A). In Iβ cells, cAMP effect on H,K-ATPase activity is mediated by PKA (Fig. 1) by a mechanism that has not been investigated. In contrast, in Iα cells, the blockade of PKA did not alter calcitonin-induced stimulation of H,K-ATPase (Fig. 1) despite the presence of a functional enzyme attested by its involvement in Sct-induced rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3). Instead, the stimulatory effect of cAMP on H,K-ATPase activity in Iα cells is mediated through its binding to Epac I (Fig. 5). Data from the literature indicate that the binding of cAMP to Epac I stimulates its guanine-nucleotide exchange activity and thereby activates the monomeric G protein Rap-1 (12de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verhaijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 13Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N.

Activated Rap-1 stimulates the kinase activity of B-Raf and the phosphorylation of the MAPK kinase MEK (26Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK. The results from this study demonstrate the key roles of Rap-1, B-Raf, and ERK (Figs. 6 and 7) in the signalization of calcitonin action on H,K-ATPase in Iα cells (summarized in Fig. 8). The involvement of ERKs in the regulation of H,K-ATPase activity in rat CCD Iα cells is demonstrated by the following. (a) Calcitonin increased the phosphorylation of ERKs (Fig. 7A). (b) The regulation of ERK and H,K-ATPase by calcitonin were both independent of PKA (Figs. 1 and 7A). (c) The inhibition of the ERK kinase MEK abolished the stimulatory effects of calcitonin on H,K-ATPase (Fig. 7C). Because PKA was shown to stimulate ERK through direct activation of either Rap-1 (32Lerosey I. Pizon V. Tavitian A. DeGunzburg J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or B-Raf (31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), the Epac I- and PKA-dependent mechanisms of ERK activation could coexist in the same cell. However, the finding that the anti-Epac I antibodies fully inhibited the effect of calcitonin on H,K-ATPase (Fig. 5) shows that PKA is not able to activate Rap-1 or B-Raf in Iα cells. This result suggests that the PKA pathway and the Epac I/Rap-1/B-Raf pathway are segregated into distinct subcellular compartments in CCD Iα cells. In this study, the mechanism of H,K-ATPase activation beyond ERK has not been investigated. In most cells, the activation of ERK triggers its translocation into the nucleus where it activates transcription factors through direct phosphorylation (Elk-1, Myc, cAMP-response element-binding protein, Sap-1) or through phosphorylation of kinases such as p90RSK. In turn, these activated transcription factors control the expression of specific genes. The rapid time course of calcitonin-induced activation of H,K-ATPase activity (<10 min) rules out a possible mediation through de novo synthesis of its subunits and suggests an activation of preexisting ATPase units. Several observations support that calcitonin may stimulate H,K-ATPase activity through exocytotic insertion into the plasma membrane of H,K-ATPase units present in the membrane of cytoplasmic vesicles. (a) H,K-ATPase colocalizes with H-ATPase (33Bastani B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1476-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an other proton pump that is controlled through exocytosis/endocytosis in CCD Iα cells (34Schwartz G.J. Al Awqati Q. J. Clin.

In conclusion, this study provides original data regarding several aspects of protein G-coupled receptor signalization in native kidney cells. (a) It outlines the important role of Epac I in mediating some effects of cAMP in collecting duct cells. (b) It demonstrates an intracellular compartmentalization of cAMP effects. (c) It indicates that ion transporters such as H,K-ATPase can be extranuclear effectors of ERK signalization. The expression of Epac I in other nephron segments (Fig. 4A) suggests that many other effects of cAMP-producing hormones, usually attributed to the activation of PKA, may be mediated in fact through the activation of Epac I and ERKs.

In addition to their roles to induce transcription of target genes, IRE1 activation in response to ER stress also leads to activation of caspase-7 and caspase-12, resulting in apoptosis (7Nakagawa T.

In addition, ATF6 is an ER membrane-localized stress-specific transcription factor, and its activation is regulated by ER stress-induced proteolysis (10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J.

Because deletion of Ire1α and/or Ire1β did not interfere with BiP induction in response to ER stress, it remains unknown if IRE1 plays a significant role in this process. PERK, although not present in S. cerevisiae, is a protein kinase that is activated by ER stress to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 on its α subunit (eIF2α). Phosphorylated eIF2α inhibits protein synthesis at the level of translation initiation, thereby limiting the amount of proteins that require folding (13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar, 14Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R., An, J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). The translation of cyclin D1 was decreased in response to prolonged ER stress, causing a cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (16Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The importance of IRE1 and PERK signaling was further demonstrated by studies at the organismal level through gene knock-out and knock-in approaches. Ire1α is an essential gene that is required for normal embryogenesis in early development (9Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). Although knock-in mice with a homozygous mutation at the PERK eIF2α phosphorylation site (Ser51Ala) die within 18 h after birth due to severe hypoglycemia, Perk knock-out homozygous mice developed hyperglycemia (18Harding H.P.

Therefore, at a minimum, translational control through PERK is linked to in vivo glucose homeostasis. Although studies of the UPR in recent years have generated a growing body of exciting results, one basic question remains as to how ER stress activates IRE1 and PERK. The UPR represents a novel intracellular ER transmembrane signaling pathway. IRE1 and PERK are structurally similar to type I growth factor receptors that are activated by ligand-induced dimerization. Whereas the activation mechanism of growth factor receptors is well understood, the mechanism of IRE1 and PERK activation remains largely unknown. Both IRE1 and PERK contain a remarkably large N-terminal luminal domain (NLD) residing in the ER. Although the primary amino acid sequences of the NLDs show limited homology and have diverged among species, we demonstrated that stress-induced oligomerization of the NLD is sufficient for IRE1 or PERK activation (20Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We showed that the NLDs of IRE1 and PERK are required for and functionally interchangeable in the transcriptional induction of KAR2 upon ER stress (20Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, replacement of Ire1p NLD with a functional leucine zipper dimerization motif yielded an active kinase that, surprisingly, was activated by ER stress (20Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These findings support a ligand-independent negative regulatory model for IRE1 and PERK activation. Recent studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between BiP and IRE1 or PERK (21Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 22Okamura K. Kimata Y. Higashio H. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (results from this study). Therefore, BiP was proposed to bind the NLD by direct protein interaction and repress IRE1 and PERK signaling through maintaining them in a monomeric state. Upon ER stress, unfolded proteins relieve the repression by triggering the release of BiP from the NLDs of IRE1 and PERK (20Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 21Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Although the proposed model may be oversimplified, it is generally agreed that the NLDs of IRE1 and PERK sense conditions in the ER lumen using a similar mechanism and transmit stress signals to regulate their cytoplasmic domains. We sought to illustrate the activation mechanism by focusing our studies on the NLD of human IRE1α. To provide an experimental system amenable to a detailed biochemical and structural investigation of the receptor activation mechanism, a sufficient amount of pure protein is needed. However, at present, it is extremely difficult to solubilize and purify receptor proteins from membrane preparations. Our initial attempts to express the NLD in bacteria and in yeast were not satisfactory. In the present studies, we have developed a method to express the soluble NLD protein in COS-1 cells by transient DNA transfection. Here we describe the expression, purification, and characterization of the soluble N-terminal luminal domain (NLD) of human IRE1α. This is the first demonstration that the NLD of IRE1α forms stable dimers and functions as a novel ligand-independent dimerization domain. HIT-T15 β cells and COS-1 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was from Pierce; α-KDEL and α-BiP antibodies were from Stressgene; α-NLD antibody raised against the NLD and α-CD antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of human IRE1α were previously described (4Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar); Ni-NTA resin was purchased from Qiagen; S-protein-agarose beads were from Novagen; all salts and buffer reagents were from Sigma, Fisher, or Calbiochem. The DNA fragment corresponding to the soluble NLD was amplified using Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) and inserted into pED vector at the XbaI/EcoRI sites. The final expression construct was designated pED-NLD or pED-NLD-His (His6tag). The two oligonucleotides designed to amplify the NLD region of IRE1α cDNA were derived from sequences encoding the signal sequence (MPARRLL) and the N terminus of the transmembrane segment (APVDSML). The antisense primer allows for the addition of a His6 tag to the C terminus followed by an EKDEL sequence. Similarly, pED-NLD-S tag was constructed in which the His6tag in NLD-His was replaced with a DNA sequence corresponding to the S tag (KETAAAKFERQHMDS). The mutant N176Q was constructed by PCR-based overlapping site-directed mutagenesis so that the Asp-176 (AAT) was mutated to Gln (CAG). In addition, pED-NLD with no tag was also constructed in a similar manner. PCR-amplified DNA was verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA used for COS-1 cell transfection was prepared using plasmid purification kits (Qiagen). COS-1 cells were cultured, and DNA transfection was performed as described previously (4Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). At 60 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and cell extracts were used for protein purification. For in vivo cross-linking, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with gentle shaking for 30 min on ice with the thiol-non-cleavable cross-linker DSS at 0.3 mm diluted in PBS from a 30 mm stock in Me2SO. The cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline to terminate the reaction. Cross-linked protein complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Their molecular masses were determined from the logarithmic plot of molecular masses of known protein standards versus their relative electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-PAGE. To induce ER stress, sub-confluent HIT-T15 cells were either left untreated or treated with ER stress reagents for the indicated periods of time. To detect the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges, transfected cells were incubated in PBS with or without N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (10–20 mm) at room temperature for 1 h. Protein samples were processed in the continued presence of NEM starting from the point of cell lysis, including gel electrophoresis and protein purification steps. NEM was also included in the loading buffer in the presence or absence of 100 mm DTT. The Ni-NTA-agarose resin was first equilibrated with 1× protein binding buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) and pre-equilibrated cell protein extract was added. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C with gentle vertical rotating for 30 min and poured onto a column. The resin was washed extensively with 1× binding buffer and then with 1× wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The NLD protein was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was concentrated with a filter apparatus (Millipore). 1 ml of protein solution was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration FPLC column (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.). The column was pre-equilibrated with PBS buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), gamma globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa) (Bio-Rad). Protein was eluted with PBS buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the position of NLD proteins in the elution profile was determined. Protein fractions corresponding to major peaks were collected and concentrated. Concentrations of cell protein extracts were determined photometrically by the Bradford assay method at 595 nm using BSA as a standard (Bio-Rad protein assay kit). The concentration of purified protein was determined photometrically according to ε (1 mg/ml) 280 nm = 1.3. Its extinction coefficient at 280 nm ε280 = 62990m −1 cm−1) was calculated from its amino acid composition. For enzymatic deglycosylation analysis, the high mannose-containing oligosaccharides were removed by digestion with endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described (23Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were pre-absorbed with protein A-Sepharose beads. Precleared cell extracts were subsequently incubated with specific antibodies in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2–4 h, and then the immuno-complexes were absorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads for 1–2 h. The beads were thoroughly washed, and immuno-complexes were eluted by boiling in standard sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or with silver nitrate. For detection by Western blotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) gelatin in PBS buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST), washed with PBST and incubated with the primary specific antibody in PBS containing 3% gelatin for 2 h at room temperature. After washes with PBST, the blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody in PBS containing 3% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature, and bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.). For native PAGE analysis, protein samples were mixed with sample buffer free of SDS and reducing agent and run in Tris-glycine buffer at 4 °C for overnight. After gel electrophoresis, the gels were placed in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) at room temperature for 30 min with shaking, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. Native protein markers used were: chicken egg albumin (45 kDa), BSA (monomer 66 kDa and dimer 132 kDa), jack bean urease (trimer 272 kDa and hexamer 545 kDa) (Sigma). For non-reducing PAGE analysis, 100 mm DTT or 2% of β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample buffer. Proteins were boiled in the presence of 2% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein extracts (0.9 ml/10-cm plate) were equilibrated with 100 μl of 10× bind/wash buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mNaCl, 1% Triton X-100) prior to the addition of S-protein-agarose beads (Novagen). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C with gentle vertical rotating for 1 h. Protein complexes were washed three times with 1× bind/wash buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of sample buffer. The eluted sample (10 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by silver staining. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) was run on a PE Biosystems Voyager DE-STR in linear mode with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (sinapinic acid, SA) (Aldrich) as the matrix. Samples were diluted with water and added 50:50 (v:v) to matrix solution (10 mg of sinapinic acid in 1 ml of 60% water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 40% acetonitrile). Calibration was done externally using bovine serum albumin as calibrant. CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-500 CD spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using 1-mm light path-length for far UV spectra and 1 cm for near UV spectra while flushing the cuvette chamber with nitrogen gas. The protein concentration was ∼0.5 mg/ml in 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0. All the solutions were centrifuged before measurement. CD spectra represent the average of three runs and have buffer blanks subtracted. Mean residue mass ellipticities θ (degree·cm2·d·mol−1) were calculated based on 111 as the average molecular mass per residue. The steady-state tryptophan fluorescence was measured in 1-cm path-length cells in a Shimadzu fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Emission spectra were taken from 300 to 450 nm. The bandwidth was 5 nm for excitation as well as emission. The protein concentration was ∼0.25 mg/ml in PBS buffer. To denature the protein, guanidine hydrochloride was added to a final concentration of 6m. Appropriate buffer blanks were subtracted from each spectrum. All fluorescence spectra were expressed in arbitrary units. Our initial attempts at expressing the NLD in Escherichia coli and in Pichia pastoris were unsatisfactory, because the recombinant NLD formed inclusion bodies in bacteria and its expression level was extremely low in yeast. Therefore, we produced the soluble NLD in a eukaryotic expression system to enhance correct folding and post-translational processing and modification. The nucleotide sequences corresponding to IRE1α from the signal peptide to the N terminus of the transmembrane segment were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pED. The expressed NLD protein was designed to contain a His6 tag at the C terminus followed by a KDEL ER retention sequence, which retains the soluble NLD in the ER lumen (24Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To our surprise, the NLD was highly expressed in COS-1 cells and easily visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 B). The extremely high expression level in transfected COS-1 cells did not significantly induce BiP mRNA expression (Fig. 1 C). As a control, overexpression of the hamster immunoglobulin heavy chain (μ), a wild-type glycosylated protein, in the absence of its light chain, induced BiP transcription. In contrast, overexpression of a mutant μ heavy chain deleted of the signal peptide did not induce the UPR. The NLD protein was purified to homogeneity by a two-step purification procedure. The recombinant soluble NLD protein in cell extract was initially purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose beads, and the eluted NLD was further fractionated by FPLC size-exclusion chromatography. The fractions corresponding to the major peak in the chromatogram were collected. The integrity and purity of the protein were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of overloaded gels (Fig. 1 D). The non-glycosylated NLD protein (designated N176Q with its N-linked glycosylation site mutated from Asn-176 to Gln) was expressed and purified in parallel (Fig. 1 D). The Asn to Gln mutation did not affect the level of protein expression or BiP induction in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Analysis of molecular mass by SDS-PAGE after endoglycosidase H digestion demonstrated that the recombinant NLD is glycosylated (Fig. 1 E). The molecular masses of the purified N176Q and NLD are 48.2 and 50.2 kDa, respectively, as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see Fig. 7 below). This result demonstrated a mass difference of ∼2 kDa between the glycosylated NLD and non-glycosylated N176Q, consistent with the mass of one high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide. The purified proteins were subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing. The first ten residues of the mature NLD were STVTLPETLL, supporting that signal peptide is composed of 23 residues. Although the signal peptide was predicted to be cleaved before IFGSTSTVTL (4Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), it is most likely that the N-terminal sequence that we identified is the native cleavage site in vivo. Because the NLD represents a novel protein domain with no homologous proteins in the data base and no structural information available, we decided to determine its signature spectra. The NLD and N176Q proteins showed identical absorption spectra (220–350 nm) (Fig. 2 A) with no absorbance from 310 to 340 nm, supporting the absence of large proteins or aggregates in the solution. For spectroscopic studies, all the proteins were dissolved in 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0. Elimination of NaCl did not cause significant protein precipitation in the phosphate buffer. The far UV and near UV CD spectra of the NLD and N176Q were compared as an indicator of the secondary structures of the two species. Measurements made on the same material at a later date and on different preparations were very similar, suggesting that the protein was stable and that there was little variation between individual preparations. The far UV spectra of NLD and N176Q were characterized by two extrema, a minimum at 208 nm and a maximum at 202 nm, and a characteristic shoulder at 230 nm (Fig. 2 B). The near UV spectrum was negative throughout, with two minima at 286 nm and 292 nm, and the minimum at 286 nm had a larger intensity than that at 292 nm (Fig. 2 C). The CD spectra of the NLD and N176Q were identical both in shape and intensity or the molecular ellipticity values, demonstrating that the NLD and N176Q assume identical conformations. In addition, the CD spectra also suggested that the native NLD protein contains α-helices and β-sheets, and it is not predominated by either structure. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of a protein is a sensitive indicator of the local environment of its tryptophan residues. The NLD contains 7 tryptophan residues. The fluorescence emission spectra of the NLD, N176Q, and denatured NLD were analyzed at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (Fig. 2 D). The emission maxima of the NLD and N176Q were identical at 352 nm whereas that of the denatured protein was at 363 nm. This red shift, indicative of fully exposed Trp residues, suggests that the secondary structure of the protein was characteristic and was lost upon denaturation. The emission intensity difference between NLD and N176Q represents the difference in protein concentration used in the analysis. We extended the steady-state experiment to time-resolved fluorescence. A comparison of relative amplitudes and lifetimes indicates that the NLD and N176Q assume identical folding and conformation (data not shown). In support of the biophysical conclusion that the NLD and N176Q assume identical conformations, functional protein binding assays showed that N176Q was capable of interacting with S-tagged NLD (Fig. 3 B). Together with results from functional analysis in yeast (20Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), we concluded therefore that the highly conserved N-linked glycosylation site is not required for proper protein folding and self-association, and it is not required for IRE1α activation and UPR induction. Previous studies suggested that the NLD serves as an oligomerization domain, and its oligomerization initiates the activation of kinase and RNase activities of IRE1 and PERK (20Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We first asked whether the soluble NLD can form homo-oligomers. To test this, NLD-S (S-tag) was co-transfected into COS-1 cells with NLD-no tag (without a tag), and homo-oligomer formation was detected by an S-protein binding assay. NLD-S bound to S-protein-agarose beads whereas the NLD-no tag did not. NLD-no tag was pulled down by S-protein-agarose through its interaction with NLD-S (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, NLD-S also interacted with N176Q, demonstrating that glycosylation is not required for oligomer formation (Fig. 3 B). ER stress did not significantly affect homo-oligomer formation in transfected cells, possibly due to protein overexpression (data not shown). Thus, these protein binding analyses demonstrated that the NLD exists as homo-oligomers. Next we tested wheth"

Selenite was injected into the peritoneum of allergen (ovalbumin)-sensitized mice before allergen challenge. Ovalbumin challenge resulted in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and an increase in the expression of cell adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin, which are encoded by NF-κB-dependent genes) in lung tissue as well as in the recruitment of eosinophils to lung airways. These effects of ovalbumin challenge were all inhibited by pretreatment of mice with selenite. Selenite administration also increased the activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase in lung tissue. Furthermore, supplementation of A549 human airway epithelial cell cultures with selenite increased glutathione peroxidase activity as well as inhibited both the generation of hydrogen peroxide and the activation of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor α in these cells. Selenite also reversed in vitro the activation of NF-κB induced by this cytokine in intact A549 cells. These results suggest that selenite regulates the activity of NF-κB by increasing the activity of glutathione peroxidase, thereby removing potential activators of NF-κB, and possibly also by direct oxidation of critical sulfhydryl groups of this transcription factor.

An increase in the amount of GPx in selenium-supplemented cells has been shown to inhibit both the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p38, JNK1 or JNK2, and ERK1 or ERK2 as well as the NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway (22Stapleton S.R.

This chemopreventive effect is thought to result from modulation of cysteine residues in proteins by selenium.

Given that the activities of GPx and NF-κB are determined by selenium availability, we have now investigated the effects of the activity levels of these proteins on allergen-induced asthmatic reactions both in selenite-treated mice and in selenite-supplemented airway cells. We now show that the increased GPx activity in selenite-treated mice is associated with inhibition of allergen-induced NF-κB activation as well as of consequent inflammatory gene expression and eosinophil recruitment to the airways. In addition, NF-κB activity in A549 airway epithelial cells supplemented with selenite was directly inhibited as a result of thiol modification of this transcription factor. Furthermore, selenite-supplemented A549 cells were shown to scavenge reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), such as H2O2, that contribute to NF-κB activation.DISCUSSIONAlthough selenium has been implicated as a determinant of asthma severity (13Baker J.C. Ayres J.G. Respir. Med. 2000; 94: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Picado C. Deulofeu R. Lleonart R. Agusti M. Mullol J. Quinto L. Torra M. Allergy. 2001; 56: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the mechanism for such an association has been unclear. We have now investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of selenium on asthma by intraperitoneal injection of selenite in allergen-sensitized mice. Such treatment with selenite greatly reduced the extent of NF-κB activation, NF-κB–dependent inflammatory protein expression, and eosinophil infiltration in the lung induced by allergen challenge. Selenite treatment also increased GPx activity in the lung. Furthermore, supplementation of A549 airway epithelial cells with selenite also resulted in an increase in GPx activity as well as in removal of H2O2 and in inhibition of NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α. Selenite also reversed in vitro the activation of NF-κB induced by TNF-α in A549 cells. Together, our results thus indicate that selenite regulates NF-κB activity by increasing the activity of GPx and possibly also by direct oxidation of essential sulfhydryl groups of this transcription factor, thereby greatly ameliorating the allergen-induced asthmatic response (Fig. 8).Selenium is an essential trace element in mammals. It is incorporated into selenoproteins as selenocysteine, which is encoded by a UGA codon that normally functions as a signal for the termination of protein synthesis (15Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y.Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Selenoproteins include the antioxidants GPx, selenoprotein P, and thioredoxin reductase as well as thyroxine 5′-deiodinase (45Holben D.H. Smith A.M. J. Am. Diet Assoc. 1999; 99: 836-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The activity of these proteins thus depends on the concentration of selenium available for their biosynthesis (19Stewart M.S. Spallholz J.E. Neldner K.H. Pence B.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Helmy M.H. Ismail S.S. Fayed H. El-Bassiouni E.A.

Med. 2000; 28: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In a mouse model of asthma, we have now shown that ovalbumin-induced asthmatic symptoms, such as lung obstruction and eosinophil recruitment to lung airways, were greatly reduced in animals pretreated with selenite. In investigating the mechanism of this anti-inflammatory effect, we showed by EMSA analysis that the increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in lung tissue induced by ovalbumin challenge was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of mice with selenite. Selenite also inhibited the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells treated with TNF-α. This inhibition was reversed by the subsequent addition of 2 mmDTT to the nuclear extracts. Furthermore, the addition of selenite to A549 cell cultures resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α.NF-κB plays a critical role in the transcription of genes for various inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, eotaxin, and cell adhesion molecules (6Oitzinger W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The expression of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin on endothelial cells during inflammation is thus regulated through NF-κB activation (6Oitzinger W. Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Koshelnick Y. Binder B.R. de Martin R. Blood. 2001; 97: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Kim I. Moon S.O. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol.

Med. 1998; 188: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin is increased in the lung tissue of ovalbumin-challenged mice and that this increased expression is abolished by pretreatment with selenite. These data thus suggest that the transcription of the genes for these cell adhesion molecules in lung endothelium is controlled by NF-κB and that inhibition of NF-κB activation by selenite blocks their expression as well as the consequent recruitment of eosinophils to the lung airway.Overexpression of GPx inhibits NF-κB-dependent signaling (46Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the activity of selenium-dependent GPx was increased in the lungs of selenite-treated mice as well as in extracts of A549 cells cultured in the presence of selenite. These selenite-induced increases in GPx activity were accompanied by increases in the abundance of GPx protein. Moreover, the concentration of total glutathione in the blood of mice treated with selenite was twice that in mice not treated with selenite (data not shown). The rate of glutathione depletion in cells is increased by selenite supplementation, with the oxidized form of glutathione being released from the cells, and this increased rate of glutathione depletion is indicative of an increased GPx activity (21Tolando R. Jovanovic A. Brigelius-Flohe R. Ursini F. Maiorino M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The selenite-induced increase in GPx activity in the lungs of ovalbumin-challenged mice thus likely results in the rapid removal of ROI (such as H2O2) that contribute to the activation of NF-κB.ROI generated in cells are thought to function as second messengers in the NF-κB signaling pathway (43Haycock J.W.

Our present data support this notion: (i) TNF-α induced the intracellular accumulation of H2O2 in A549 cells; (ii) preincubation of the cells with selenite prevented this effect of TNF-α; and (iii) the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB in A549 cells was blocked by pretreatment with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis that increases the basal concentration of peroxide (data not shown).The NF-κB signaling pathway has been proposed as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases (53Lewis A.J.

In summary, we have shown that GPx activity is increased in the lung tissue of selenite-treated mice and in selenite-supplemented A549 cells. Furthermore, selenite blocks the TNF-α-induced generation of H2O2 and activation of NF-κB in A549 cells as well as the allergen-induced activation of NF-κB, inflammatory mediator gene expression, and eosinophil infiltration in the lungs of mice. Together, our data indicate that selenite ameliorates asthmatic symptoms and that ROI (such as H2O2) play a pivotal role in allergen-induced inflammatory signaling. Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by three major symptoms: airway hyper-reactivity, airway obstruction, and lung inflammation.

An increase in the amount of GPx in selenium-supplemented cells has been shown to inhibit both the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p38, JNK1 or JNK2, and ERK1 or ERK2 as well as the NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway (22Stapleton S.R.

This chemopreventive effect is thought to result from modulation of cysteine residues in proteins by selenium. Selenium regulates the functions of many proteins by reacting with essential thiol groups to form S-Se-S (selenotrisulfide) or S-Se adducts (28Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that proteins modulated as a result of thiol modification by selenium include the Na+- and K+-dependent ATPase, the glucocorticoid receptor, prostaglandin D synthase, the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB, the protease caspase-3, and the protein kinases Cdk2, protein kinase C, and JNK (32Bergad P.L.

In remains unclear, however, whether a low dietary intake of selenium and reduced GPx activity are associated with an increased risk of asthmatic inflammation. Given that the activities of GPx and NF-κB are determined by selenium availability, we have now investigated the effects of the activity levels of these proteins on allergen-induced asthmatic reactions both in selenite-treated mice and in selenite-supplemented airway cells. We now show that the increased GPx activity in selenite-treated mice is associated with inhibition of allergen-induced NF-κB activation as well as of consequent inflammatory gene expression and eosinophil recruitment to the airways. In addition, NF-κB activity in A549 airway epithelial cells supplemented with selenite was directly inhibited as a result of thiol modification of this transcription factor. Furthermore, selenite-supplemented A549 cells were shown to scavenge reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), such as H2O2, that contribute to NF-κB activation. DISCUSSIONAlthough selenium has been implicated as a determinant of asthma severity (13Baker J.C. Ayres J.G. Respir. Med. 2000; 94: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Picado C. Deulofeu R. Lleonart R. Agusti M. Mullol J. Quinto L. Torra M. Allergy. 2001; 56: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the mechanism for such an association has been unclear. We have now investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of selenium on asthma by intraperitoneal injection of selenite in allergen-sensitized mice. Such treatment with selenite greatly reduced the extent of NF-κB activation, NF-κB–dependent inflammatory protein expression, and eosinophil infiltration in the lung induced by allergen challenge. Selenite treatment also increased GPx activity in the lung. Furthermore, supplementation of A549 airway epithelial cells with selenite also resulted in an increase in GPx activity as well as in removal of H2O2 and in inhibition of NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α. Selenite also reversed in vitro the activation of NF-κB induced by TNF-α in A549 cells. Together, our results thus indicate that selenite regulates NF-κB activity by increasing the activity of GPx and possibly also by direct oxidation of essential sulfhydryl groups of this transcription factor, thereby greatly ameliorating the allergen-induced asthmatic response (Fig. 8).Selenium is an essential trace element in mammals. It is incorporated into selenoproteins as selenocysteine, which is encoded by a UGA codon that normally functions as a signal for the termination of protein synthesis (15Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y.Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Selenoproteins include the antioxidants GPx, selenoprotein P, and thioredoxin reductase as well as thyroxine 5′-deiodinase (45Holben D.H. Smith A.M. J. Am. Diet Assoc. 1999; 99: 836-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The activity of these proteins thus depends on the concentration of selenium available for their biosynthesis (19Stewart M.S. Spallholz J.E. Neldner K.H. Pence B.C. Free Radic. Biol.

In investigating the mechanism of this anti-inflammatory effect, we showed by EMSA analysis that the increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in lung tissue induced by ovalbumin challenge was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of mice with selenite. Selenite also inhibited the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells treated with TNF-α. This inhibition was reversed by the subsequent addition of 2 mmDTT to the nuclear extracts. Furthermore, the addition of selenite to A549 cell cultures resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α.NF-κB plays a critical role in the transcription of genes for various inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, eotaxin, and cell adhesion molecules (6Oitzinger W.

The expression of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin on endothelial cells during inflammation is thus regulated through NF-κB activation (6Oitzinger W. Hofer-Warbinek R.

We have now shown that the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin is increased in the lung tissue of ovalbumin-challenged mice and that this increased expression is abolished by pretreatment with selenite. These data thus suggest that the transcription of the genes for these cell adhesion molecules in lung endothelium is controlled by NF-κB and that inhibition of NF-κB activation by selenite blocks their expression as well as the consequent recruitment of eosinophils to the lung airway.Overexpression of GPx inhibits NF-κB-dependent signaling (46Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the activity of selenium-dependent GPx was increased in the lungs of selenite-treated mice as well as in extracts of A549 cells cultured in the presence of selenite. These selenite-induced increases in GPx activity were accompanied by increases in the abundance of GPx protein. Moreover, the concentration of total glutathione in the blood of mice treated with selenite was twice that in mice not treated with selenite (data not shown). The rate of glutathione depletion in cells is increased by selenite supplementation, with the oxidized form of glutathione being released from the cells, and this increased rate of glutathione depletion is indicative of an increased GPx activity (21Tolando R.

https://openalex.org/W2011575830,"In Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblasts (IIC9 cells) α-thrombin activates the MAPK(ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathways, and both are essential for progression through the G1phase of the cell cycle. We investigated in IIC9 cells, the role of β-arrestin1 in α-thrombin signaling to these pathways. α-Thrombin stimulates rapid and sustained PI 3-kinase and Akt activities. Expression of a dominant negative β-arrestin1 (β-arrestin1(V53D)) inhibits rapid but not sustained PI 3-kinase and Akt activities. Surprisingly, expression of β-arrestin1(V53D) does not block activation of the MAPK(ERK) pathway. PI 3-kinase and Akt activities are also inhibited by expression of a β-arrestin1 mutant, which impairs binding to c-Src (β-arrestin1(P91G-P121E)), indicating the involvement of c-Src in the rapid stimulation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Consistent with these results, PP1, a selective inhibitor of c-Src family kinases, prevents α-thrombin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Expression of β- arrestin1(V53D) does not prevent G1 progression, as its expression has no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. In agreement with the ineffectiveness of β-arrestin1(V53D) to block G1progression, cyclin D1 protein amounts and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity is unaffected by expression of β-arrestin1(V53D). Thus in IIC9 cells, α-thrombin activates rapid β-arrestin1-dependent and sustained β-arrestin1-independent Akt activity, suggesting that two mechanisms are involved. Furthermore, although blocking the β-arrestin1-independent PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway prevents G1 progression, inhibition of the β-arrestin1-dependent pathway does not, indicating different roles for the rapid and sustained activities. In Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblasts (IIC9 cells) α-thrombin activates the MAPK(ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathways, and both are essential for progression through the G1phase of the cell cycle. We investigated in IIC9 cells, the role of β-arrestin1 in α-thrombin signaling to these pathways. α-Thrombin stimulates rapid and sustained PI 3-kinase and Akt activities. Expression of a dominant negative β-arrestin1 (β-arrestin1(V53D)) inhibits rapid but not sustained PI 3-kinase and Akt activities. Surprisingly, expression of β-arrestin1(V53D) does not block activation of the MAPK(ERK) pathway. PI 3-kinase and Akt activities are also inhibited by expression of a β-arrestin1 mutant, which impairs binding to c-Src (β-arrestin1(P91G-P121E)), indicating the involvement of c-Src in the rapid stimulation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Consistent with these results, PP1, a selective inhibitor of c-Src family kinases, prevents α-thrombin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Expression of β- arrestin1(V53D) does not prevent G1 progression, as its expression has no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. In agreement with the ineffectiveness of β-arrestin1(V53D) to block G1progression, cyclin D1 protein amounts and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity is unaffected by expression of β-arrestin1(V53D).

Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β therefore results in the accumulation of cyclin D1 and the activation of CDK4-cyclin D1, which is critical for G1progression of IIC9 cells (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and NIH 3T3 cells (24Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar).Originally β-arrestin was thought to be involved in receptor desensitization of GPCR due its role in uncoupling the receptor from the G protein and targeting the receptor for endocytosis (26Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data, however, demonstrate that β-arrestins are also important in the activation of the MAPK pathways, by acting as scaffolding proteins (27Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,28Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Scaffolding proteins mediate protein–protein interactions that could prevent or minimize cross-talk between related pathways and also increase the responsiveness of the signaling cascade to the incoming signals. β-Arrestin2 specifically interacts with both JNK3 and ASK1 to stimulate JNK3 phosphorylation following activation of angiotensin type 1A receptor by angiotensin II (29McDonald P.H.

It also scaffolds c-Raf1, MEK1, and ERK2 onto the angiotensin type 1A receptor (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin1 binds c-Src through interactions involving both the Src homology 3 and catalytic domain of c-Src (31Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This association results in the recruitment of c-Src to β2-adrenergic receptor and is essential for activation of ERK2 by angiotensin type 1A receptor (31Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). In addition to angiotensin II, substance P and interleukin-8 mediate ERK1/2 activation by recruitment of c-Src or c-Src family members to the activated neurokinin through β-arrestin (33DeFea K.A.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) receptors, respectively. Furthermore, stimulation of the PAR2 receptor, a member of the protease-activated receptor family, results in complex formation with β-arrestin1; the internalized receptor-β-arrestin1 complex associates with Raf1 and ERK1/2 and results in the activation of ERK1/2 and its cytosolic retention (35DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar).We investigated the role of β-arrestin in α-thrombin-induced ERK1/ERK2 and Akt phosphorylation in IIC9 cells. We find that α-thrombin stimulates β-arrestin1-dependent Akt phosphorylation. Both expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin1 mutants that impair binding to c-Src block the rapid phosphorylation of Akt but not ERK1/2. Surprisingly, the inhibition of the rapid activation of Akt does not prevent α-thrombin-induced G1 progression of IIC9 cells as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity. Consistent with its inability to block CDK4-cyclin D1 activation, expression of dominant negative β-arrestin is not involved in sustained activation of Akt phosphorylation. These data indicate that in IIC9 cells, α-thrombin stimulates Akt phosphorylation by two mechanisms, and only one is β-arrestin1-dependent. Furthermore, the β-arrestin1-dependent pathway is not important for α-thrombin-induced G1 cell cycle progression.DISCUSSIONThis is the first study to demonstrate a critical role for β-arrestins in the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In IIC9 cells, α-thrombin-induced Akt phosphorylation increases within 5 min and is sustained for up to 6 h. The rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation is sensitive to expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1, whereas sustained phosphorylation is insensitive. Because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3s bind β-arrestins with high affinity and are important regulators of receptor internalization (41Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), it has been thought that β-arrestins are downstream targets of PI 3-kinase activity. Our data clearly show that α-thrombin-induced rapid PI 3-kinase and Akt activities are downstream of β-arrestin1. Our data also demonstrate a role for c-Src or a Src family member in the phosphorylation of Akt. Transient expression of β-arrestin1(P91G-P121E), which prevents the binding of c-Src to β-arrestin1 but does not inhibit internalization (31Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), also blocks α-thrombin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. In agreement with a role for c-Src or an Src family member in the phosphorylation of Akt, treatment of IIC9 cells with PP1, a selective inhibitor of the Src family kinases (40Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J. Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), prevents α-thrombin-induced rapid Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that in IIC9 cells the association of β-arrestin1 with c-Src is essential for α-thrombin-induced Akt phosphorylation.Although expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 blocks the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, it does not inhibit stimulation of the MAPK(ERK) pathway. The inability of β-arrestin1 to affect the MAPK(ERK) pathway is surprising, because others (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have shown that β-arrestin1 can mediate MAPK(ERK) pathway activation. We found previously that α-thrombin-induced stimulation of the MAPK(ERK) pathway is downstream of Ras (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Consistent with the ineffectiveness of dominant negative β-arrestin1 to prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Ras activation is unaffected by expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1. Importantly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is insensitive to treatment with PP1. These results suggest that the ability of β-arrestin1 to assemble selective signaling components into functional complexes varies depending on the receptor and cell types.In IIC9 cells α-thrombin activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt appears to be complex in IIC9 cells. We found that rapid and sustained Akt phosphorylation is differentially regulated. Rapid phosphorylation of Akt is dependent on β-arrestin1; however, the sustained is not. Previous data from our laboratory (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Phillips-Mason P.J. The Signaling Pathways Regulating Thrombin-induced Cyclin D1 ExpressionPh.D. dissertation. Saint Louis University, 2000Google Scholar) found that the rapid increase in PI 3-kinase activity can be determined by generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in p85 immune complexes, suggesting a role for class 1A PI 3-kinase in the rapid increase. At present the PI 3-kinase important for sustained Akt phosphorylation is unknown and requires further study.PI 3-kinase is required for DNA synthesis in response to several mitogens (43Krasilnikov M.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 2000; 65: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar) including α-thrombin (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In IIC9 cells, inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation by pretreatment with the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY42009, prevents the accumulation of cyclin D1 protein and the increase in CDK4-cyclin D1 activity in response to α-thrombin (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 inhibits PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway activation, we expected it to prevent passage through G1 into S phase. Surprisingly, expression of the mutant is ineffective in blocking G1 progression as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Also α-thrombin-induced increases of cyclin D1 protein and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity are not affected by expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1. Consistent with the dependence of G1 progression on the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 inhibits the rapid phosphorylation of Akt but not sustained phosphorylation. These data suggest that rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Akt have distinct mechanisms of activation and different sets of targets. Interestingly, the β-arrestin-dependent increases in phosphorylated JNK3 (29McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) are localized to the cytosol, suggesting that activating these kinases through a β-arrestin scaffold limits the subcellular targets of these kinases. Determining the different mechanisms for activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway will be important for understanding how these mechanisms affect function. In a variety of cell types (1Belloni P.N.

Recent data in IIC9 cells (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) show that Akt kinase mediates the accumulation of cyclin D1 by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β, the kinase that phosphorylates cyclin D1 and targets cyclin D1 for degradation via a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism (25Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β therefore results in the accumulation of cyclin D1 and the activation of CDK4-cyclin D1, which is critical for G1progression of IIC9 cells (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and NIH 3T3 cells (24Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Originally β-arrestin was thought to be involved in receptor desensitization of GPCR due its role in uncoupling the receptor from the G protein and targeting the receptor for endocytosis (26Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data, however, demonstrate that β-arrestins are also important in the activation of the MAPK pathways, by acting as scaffolding proteins (27Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,28Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Scaffolding proteins mediate protein–protein interactions that could prevent or minimize cross-talk between related pathways and also increase the responsiveness of the signaling cascade to the incoming signals. β-Arrestin2 specifically interacts with both JNK3 and ASK1 to stimulate JNK3 phosphorylation following activation of angiotensin type 1A receptor by angiotensin II (29McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also scaffolds c-Raf1, MEK1, and ERK2 onto the angiotensin type 1A receptor (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin1 binds c-Src through interactions involving both the Src homology 3 and catalytic domain of c-Src (31Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This association results in the recruitment of c-Src to β2-adrenergic receptor and is essential for activation of ERK2 by angiotensin type 1A receptor (31Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). In addition to angiotensin II, substance P and interleukin-8 mediate ERK1/2 activation by recruitment of c-Src or c-Src family members to the activated neurokinin through β-arrestin (33DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and interleukin-8 (34Barlic J. Andrews J.D. Kelvin A.A. Bosinger S.E. DeVries M.E. Xu L.L. Dobransky T. Feldman R.D. Ferguson S.S.G. Kelvin D.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) receptors, respectively. Furthermore, stimulation of the PAR2 receptor, a member of the protease-activated receptor family, results in complex formation with β-arrestin1; the internalized receptor-β-arrestin1 complex associates with Raf1 and ERK1/2 and results in the activation of ERK1/2 and its cytosolic retention (35DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of β-arrestin in α-thrombin-induced ERK1/ERK2 and Akt phosphorylation in IIC9 cells. We find that α-thrombin stimulates β-arrestin1-dependent Akt phosphorylation. Both expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin1 mutants that impair binding to c-Src block the rapid phosphorylation of Akt but not ERK1/2. Surprisingly, the inhibition of the rapid activation of Akt does not prevent α-thrombin-induced G1 progression of IIC9 cells as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity. Consistent with its inability to block CDK4-cyclin D1 activation, expression of dominant negative β-arrestin is not involved in sustained activation of Akt phosphorylation. These data indicate that in IIC9 cells, α-thrombin stimulates Akt phosphorylation by two mechanisms, and only one is β-arrestin1-dependent. Furthermore, the β-arrestin1-dependent pathway is not important for α-thrombin-induced G1 cell cycle progression. DISCUSSIONThis is the first study to demonstrate a critical role for β-arrestins in the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In IIC9 cells, α-thrombin-induced Akt phosphorylation increases within 5 min and is sustained for up to 6 h. The rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation is sensitive to expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1, whereas sustained phosphorylation is insensitive. Because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3s bind β-arrestins with high affinity and are important regulators of receptor internalization (41Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), it has been thought that β-arrestins are downstream targets of PI 3-kinase activity. Our data clearly show that α-thrombin-induced rapid PI 3-kinase and Akt activities are downstream of β-arrestin1. Our data also demonstrate a role for c-Src or a Src family member in the phosphorylation of Akt. Transient expression of β-arrestin1(P91G-P121E), which prevents the binding of c-Src to β-arrestin1 but does not inhibit internalization (31Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), also blocks α-thrombin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. In agreement with a role for c-Src or an Src family member in the phosphorylation of Akt, treatment of IIC9 cells with PP1, a selective inhibitor of the Src family kinases (40Liu Y. Bishop A.

Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), prevents α-thrombin-induced rapid Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that in IIC9 cells the association of β-arrestin1 with c-Src is essential for α-thrombin-induced Akt phosphorylation.Although expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 blocks the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, it does not inhibit stimulation of the MAPK(ERK) pathway. The inability of β-arrestin1 to affect the MAPK(ERK) pathway is surprising, because others (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have shown that β-arrestin1 can mediate MAPK(ERK) pathway activation. We found previously that α-thrombin-induced stimulation of the MAPK(ERK) pathway is downstream of Ras (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Consistent with the ineffectiveness of dominant negative β-arrestin1 to prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Ras activation is unaffected by expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1. Importantly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is insensitive to treatment with PP1. These results suggest that the ability of β-arrestin1 to assemble selective signaling components into functional complexes varies depending on the receptor and cell types.In IIC9 cells α-thrombin activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt appears to be complex in IIC9 cells. We found that rapid and sustained Akt phosphorylation is differentially regulated. Rapid phosphorylation of Akt is dependent on β-arrestin1; however, the sustained is not.

Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In IIC9 cells, inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation by pretreatment with the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY42009, prevents the accumulation of cyclin D1 protein and the increase in CDK4-cyclin D1 activity in response to α-thrombin (13Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 inhibits PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway activation, we expected it to prevent passage through G1 into S phase. Surprisingly, expression of the mutant is ineffective in blocking G1 progression as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Also α-thrombin-induced increases of cyclin D1 protein and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity are not affected by expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1. Consistent with the dependence of G1 progression on the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, expression of dominant negative β-arrestin1 inhibits the rapid phosphorylation of Akt but not sustained phosphorylation. These data suggest that rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Akt have distinct mechanisms of activation and different sets of targets. Interestingly, the β-arrestin-dependent increases in phosphorylated JNK3 (29McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Serwadda D. Honess R. Crawford D. Jarrett R. Griffin B.E. Lancet. 1987; 2: 390Abstract PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Zaire (3Lopez C. Pellett P. Stewart J. Goldsmith C. Sanderlin K. Black J. Warfield D. Feorino P. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 1271-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Molecular, biological, and immunological analyses between various isolates led to the sub-division into HHV-6 variant A (U1102 and GS strains) and variant B (Z29 and HST strains) (4Ablashi D.V.

HHV-6 primary infection, occurring within 24 months from birth, is characterized by acute febrile illnesses with intense fever and occasional seizures (5Hall C.B. Long C.E. Schnabel K.C. Caserta M.T.

HHV-6 is the causative agent of the sixth childhood disease exanthem subitum (6Yamanishi K. Okuno T. Shiraki K. Takahashi M. Kondo T. Asano Y. Kurata T. Lancet. 1988; 1: 1065-1067Abstract PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). In industrialized countries, primary HHV-6 infections are almost always caused by the B variant (7Dewhurst S. McIntyre K. Schnabel K. Hall C.B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 416-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) although primary infections with variant A have been reported in Africa (8Kasolo F.C. Mpabalwani E. Gompels U.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Other complications of primary HHV-6 infection include hepatitis (9Asano Y. Yoshikawa T. Suga S. Yazaki T. Kondo K. Yamanishi K. Lancet. 1990; 335: 862-863Abstract PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), meningitis (10Huang L.M. Lee C.Y. Lee P.I. Chen J.M. Wang P.J. Arch. Dis.

More recently, a potential association between HHV-6 infection and the neurological disease multiple sclerosis has been made. Although several papers have reported that HHV-6 could be involved in such pathology (13Soldan S.S. Berti R. Salem N. Secchiero P. Flamand L. Calabresi P.A. Brennan M.B. Maloni H.W. McFarland H.F.

One undisputed fact, however, is the presence of HHV-6-infected cells within the brain suggesting that HHV-6 is neurotropic and therefore can possibly play a role in neurological diseases. More work is therefore needed to determine the potential link between HHV-6 and multiple sclerosis.A recent report (18Santoro F. Kennedy P.E. Locatelli G. Malnati M.S. Berger E.A. Lusso P. Cell. 1999; 99: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) indicates that HHV-6 infects cells through the widely distributed cell surface CD46 receptor. A second receptor is likely to be necessary for infection given the fact that HHV-6 variants A and B infect different cell lines in vitro and that CD46 appears necessary but not sufficient for infection (18Santoro F. Kennedy P.E. Locatelli G. Malnati M.S. Berger E.A. Lusso P. Cell. 1999; 99: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Infection of susceptible host cells by human herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), is often associated with cellular alterations allowing for a successful infection to be initiated. Such cellular modifications include, among others, the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis and destruction of punctate nuclear bodies known as ND10 (nuclear dot domain) or PODs (promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) oncogenic domain) (19Ahn J.H. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4599-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Everett R.D. Maul G.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 21Kelly C. Van Driel R.

The first genes expressed following viral entry and associated/responsible for such cellular disturbance are the immediate-early (IE) genes. Transcription of IE genes occurs within minutes to hours post-entry, is independent of de novo protein synthesis, and often relies on virion-associated proteins such as the tegument proteins for proper expression (24Liu B. Stinski M.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4434-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HHV-6 genome contains several putative IE genes encoding proteins having a US22 amino acid sequence motif. Two major loci of IE genes have been identified as follows: locus B encompasses open reading frames 16–19, whereas locus A contains two large open reading frames, U89 and U86 (25Dominguez G. Dambaugh T.R. Stamey F.R. Dewhurst S. Inoue N. Pellett P.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8040-8052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Isegawa Y. Mukai T. Nakano K. Kagawa M. Chen J. Mori Y. Sunagawa T.

Virology. 1995; 209: 29-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Several years ago, the mapping of HHV-6 variant A IE1 transcripts was reported (29Schiewe U. Neipel F. Schreiner D. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2978-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using a probe spanning from the middle of U89 up to the KpnI repeats, the authors have identified four transcripts of 1.0, 1.5, 3.5, and 4.7 kb. However, only the 3.5-kb transcript was expressed under IE conditions, in absence of de novo protein synthesis. This transcript is composed of five (four small and one large (U89)) exons with translation initiating in the middle of the third exon, potentially encoding a 104-kDa protein (29Schiewe U. Neipel F. Schreiner D. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2978-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using genomic DNA clones, Martin et al. (27Martin M.E. Nicholas J. Thomson B.J. Newman C. Honess R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5381-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that U89 of HHV-6 variant A was capable of transactivating heterologous promoters suggesting a putative role for IE1 in transcriptional regulation. Finally, using sera of mice immunized with β-galactosidase-IE1 fusion proteins, Takeda et al. (31Takeda K. Nakagawa N. Yamamoto T. Inagi R. Kawanishi K. Isegawa Y. Yamanishi K. Virus Res. 1996; 41: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have shown that HHV-6 variant B IE1 protein can be detected by 4 h post-infection and that two forms (155 and 170 kDa) of the proteins can be detected in lysates of infected cells.In the present work we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of HHV-6 variant B (Z29 strain) IE1 gene and protein in infected cells. Kinetics of IE1 mRNA, proteins, and nuclear distribution are reported. Post-translational modifications of HHV-6 IE1 protein are presented. Finally, a comparative functional analysis of IE1 from variants A and B is presented.DISCUSSIONIn the present paper we report the cloning of a transcript encoding the full coding sequence for HHV-6 variant B (Z29) IE1 protein. IE1 transcripts for HHV-6 variant A (U1102 strain) have been described previously (29Schiewe U. Neipel F. Schreiner D. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2978-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall structures of HHV-6 IE1 transcripts are similar in both A and B variants and are composed of five exons with translation initiating in the middle of the third exon. The 3.7-kb IE1 transcript from variant B is slightly larger than the 3.5-kb of variant A. Two deletions of 123 and 215 nucleotides within the coding region of IE1 from the A strain account for most of the differences, which translates into a 941-amino acid protein for variant A compared with 1078 amino acids for variant B. IE1 proteins from both variants share 62% overall amino acid identity and 72% similarity (Ref. 25Dominguez G. Dambaugh T.R. Stamey F.R. Dewhurst S. Inoue N. Pellett P.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8040-8052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this work), whereas the amino acid identity between strains of variant B IE1 (HST and Z29 strains) is 92% (26Isegawa Y. Mukai T. Nakano K. Kagawa M. Chen J. Mori Y. Sunagawa T. Kawanishi K. Sashihara J. Hata A. Zou P. Kosuge H. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8053-8063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the 3.5-kb IE1A transcript, Schiewe et al. (29Schiewe U. Neipel F. Schreiner D. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2978-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of a lately expressed 4.7-kb transcript encoding for the same IE1A protein. Similarly, a 5.6-kb mRNA and two additional larger transcripts of 7.0 and 8.9 kb were observed during our Northern blot analysis of HHV-6 variant B infected cells. Characterization of these transcripts has yet to be performed, but these clearly suggest that, depending on the stage of infection, transcription of IE1-related genes can be initiated from multiple promoters. None of these large transcripts were detected under IE conditions, suggesting different kinetics of expression than the 3.7-kb IE1 mRNA. Whether these larger transcripts encode variants of the IE1B protein remains to be determined.Although the HHV-6 IE1 gene is a positional homologue of HCMV IE1 gene (UL123), no significant identity between the encoded proteins exists. Functionally, a genomic segment coding for HHV-6 IE1 from variant A and the HCMV IE1 protein was shown to activate heterologous promoters (27Martin M.E. Nicholas J. Thomson B.J. Newman C. Honess R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5381-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Flamand L. Romerio F. Reitz M.S. Gallo R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8797-8805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Biegalke B.J. Geballe A.P.

Because the only known measurable activity of HHV-6 IE1 pertains to its effect on heterologous promoter transactivation, we compared the ability of variants A and B to activate the HIV LTR promoter. IE1 from variant B has marginal activity compared with the IE1 from variant A in promoting transcription from the HIV LTR. This difference in the behavior of IE1 may account for some of the divergence in biological properties between both variants. Conflicting reports exist regarding the ability of HHV-6 infection to activate or repress HIV (53Grivel J.C. Margolis L.B. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 54Bonura F. Perna A.M. Vitale F. Villafrate M.R. Viviano E. Guttadauro R. Mazzola G. Romano N.

Virol. 1991; 65: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for this remain unknown but are likely attributable to the varying experimental procedures used and do not appear related to the ability of IE1 from both variants to differentially activate the HIV LTR.HHV-6 IE1B protein, like that of HCMV, is phosphorylated and is expressed in the nuclei of infected cells. In terms of kinetics of expression, we first could detect HHV-6 IE1B at 4 h P.I. Attempts to detect the protein at earlier time points (2 h) proved unsuccessful. Efficient cell-free HHV-6 infections are sometimes difficult to achieve, a feature that could have explained our inability to detect IE1B at such early time points. However, given the fact that HHV-6 IE1B mRNA can easily be detected by 2 h of infection, the protein may not be synthesized in sufficient quantity to be detected. Thus, in terms of kinetics, HCMV IE1 is possibly expressed more rapidly (i.e. at 2 h) upon infection than IE1B of HHV-6. By 4–6 h post-HCMV infection, the punctate pattern is lost, and IE1 is diffusely distributed throughout the nuclei of infected cells (19Ahn J.H. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4599-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, HHV-6 IE1B is first observed as small granules whose intensity increases with time. By 12 h P.I., the number of IE1B punctate bodies is maximal, reaching 8–10 such entities per nucleus. By 24–48 h P.I., the IE1B bodies condense together into 1 or few large bodies per nucleus, while at later time points (72–96 h P.I.), a mixture of large and small IE1B granules is observed, the latter presumably resulting from secondary infection.Targeting/disruption of PML bodies by herpesviruses IE proteins appears to be a generalized phenomenon as it is observed following infection by HCMV, HSV, and Epstein-Barr virus (19Ahn J.H. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4599-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Everett R.D. Maul G.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 21Kelly C. Van Driel R.

Virol. 1994; 75: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 48Adamson A.L. Kenney S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 58Ahn J.H. Brignole III, E.J.

Cell Res. 1996; 229: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Likewise, HHV-6 IE1 from both variants target PML bodies soon after infection. A major difference with other human herpesviruses, however, is that HHV-6 infection does not lead to the dispersal of PML bodies but rather leads to the condensation of PML bodies into few large entities into which IE1 and SUMO-1 colocalize. HHV-6 IE1 remains associated with PML bodies throughout the infection process. In transfection experiments and in the absence of other viral proteins, IE1 is present in numerous nuclear entities that colocalize with PML bodies. The PML bodies patterns remain unaffected suggesting that additional viral proteins are necessary for IE1 and PML bodies condensation. Modification (dispersal or condensation) of PODs following herpesviruses infections likely represents an important step for efficient transcription and replication of the viral genome. In fact, treatment of cells with arsenic trioxide, which increases the stability of PODs, effectively inhibits the generation of infectious HSV particles in vitro(60Burkham J. Coen D.M. Hwang C.B. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2353-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Input of viral genomes and transcription of IE genes were reported to occur at or in the very close proximity of PODs (61Ishov A.M. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 62Ishov A.M. Stenberg R.M. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 63Maul G.G. Ishov A.M. Everett R.D. Virology. 1996; 217: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the targeting of PODs by herpesviruses represents a way to free cellular factors implicated later during the infectious process such as those involved in replication. In the case of HHV-6, however, where PODs condensation rather than dispersal is observed, this event may bring together factors involved in viral DNA replication. In support of this hypothesis, our preliminary results suggest that maximal PODs aggregation correlates with the initiation of viral DNA replication (24 h). Current work is in progress to address the precise localization of the viral DNA replication compartments and their position relative to the aggregated PODs. The condensation of PODs into one or two larger nuclear entities is somewhat reminiscent of the phenotype of triple mutant of PML (3M-PML), which can no longer be sumoylated (64Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PML−/−-transfected cells, the 3M-PML protein is distributed into a few large entities, in striking contrast to the wild type PML speckled pattern (64Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that HHV-6 IE1, by sequestrating the majority of free SUMO residues, present in limited amounts within cells, prevents the SUMO conjugation and hence the improper nuclear distribution of the newly synthesized PML proteins. Thus, in a manner similar to HSV-1, HHV-6 infectious process may be associated with the loss of SUMO-conjugated PML isoforms causing the aberrant distribution of PML. Finally, the possibility that PODs may play a role in the establishment of an antiviral state following treatment with interferons has also been proposed. Following interferon treatment, twice as many PODs can be observed within the nucleus. Expression of the main proteins composed within PODs, the PML and Sp100 proteins, are strongly up-regulated by interferon stimulation (65Lavau C. Marchio A. Fagioli M. Jansen J. Falini B. Lebon P. Grosveld F. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Dejean A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 871-876PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the PML protein has been reported to affect the replication of RNA viruses such as the human foamy virus, the vesicular stomatitis virus, and the influenza virus by interfering with viral mRNA and protein synthesis (66Regad T. Saib A. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Pandolfi P.P. de The H. Chelbi-Alix M.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3495-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 67Chelbi-Alix M.K. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Koken M.H. de The H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, by modifying the overall PODs architecture, viruses may dampen the mounting of an antiviral state initiated following interferon stimulation.Two putative SUMO conjugation sites are present within variant B IE1 protein. At least one of the sites is efficiently conjugated by SUMO-1 during the infectious process. Our results also suggest that more than one SUMO-modified form of IE1 is present in infected cells. Whether lysine 281, lysine 802, or both are covalently modified remain to be determined. IE1 from variant A has only one SUMO site (Lys-665) that gets sumoylated during infection. This suggests that Lys-802 of variant B, a positional homologue of Lys-665 from variant A, is likely a target for SUMO conjugation. Higher molecular weight species of SUMO-IE1 is also suggestive of multiple SUMO conjugation events occurring. At least three forms of SUMO have been described so far (46Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 68Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although multimerization of SUMO-1 has never been reported, branching of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 has been described (72Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). A SUMO conjugation site within SUMO-2 and –3 allows these proteins to be sumoylated themselves in a manner analogous to the polyubiquitination reaction. Thus, the high molecular weight forms of SUMO-IE1 may represent polysumoylated IE1. Work is in progress to address this issue. Sumoylation of herpesviruses IE proteins have also been reported for HCMV and Epstein-Barr virus (36Xu Y. Ahn J.H. Cheng M. apRhys C.M. Chiou C.J. Zong J. Matunis M.J. Hayward G.S. J.

The effects of SUMO conjugation on the functionality of HHV-6 IE1 remain unknown. SUMO conjugation is reported to affect proteins function in a variety of different ways. For example, the ability of the p53 and HCMV IE2 proteins in promoting transcriptional activation is positively influenced by SUMO conjugation (73Ahn J.H., Xu, Y. Jang W.J. Matunis M.J. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3859-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 74Hofmann H. Floss S. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2510-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 75Gostissa M.

Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Whether a similar activity can be expected for IE1 of HHV-6 remains to be determined. Alternatively, SUMO conjugation could affect the half-life through competition with the ubiquitination process of IE1, as in the case of IκBα (35Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Finally, in a manner analogous to the RanGAP1 protein (68Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 77Saitoh H., Pu, R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), SUMO conjugation of IE1 may facilitate its transport to the nuclear pore complex. Further work is needed to address these possibilities.The IE1 protein encoded by the IE-A locus of HHV-6 is the second most divergent protein (after U91) between A and B strains with an identity of sequence of 62%. HHV-6 variants A and B possess divergent biological properties such as their ability to infect the HSB-2 and the Molt-3 cell lines, respectively. Another example of segregation between HHV-6 variants A and B is the association with roseola infantum, where the vast majority of cases is caused by B variant infections (6Yamanishi K. Okuno T. Shiraki K. Takahashi M. Kondo T. Asano Y. Kurata T. Lancet. 1988; 1: 1065-1067Abstract PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Until the true functions of IE proteins are fully understood, an association between the divergence of IE1 proteins and biological and pathogenic differences between A and B variants of HHV-6 remains speculative. Precise comparative studies on IE1 proteins from both HHV-6 variants are therefore essentia"

In the present study, we found a secreted PLA2, which is produced by a soil bacterium, Streptomyces violaceoruber A-2688, demonstrating that the enzyme is the first phospholipase A2 identified in prokaryote. After characterization of the novel PLA2, a gene encoding the enzyme was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed using a Streptomyces host-vector system. The amino acid sequence showed that the prokaryotic PLA2 has only four cysteines and less homology to the eukaryotic ones, which have 12–16 cysteines. The solution structures of the prokaryotic PLA2, bound and unbound with calcium(II) ion, were determined by using the NMR technique and structure calculation. The overall structure of the S. violaceoruber PLA2, which is composed of only five α-helices, is completely different from those of eukaryotic PLA2s, which consist of β-sheets and α-helices. The structure of the calcium-binding domain is obviously distinct from that without the ion; the ligands for the calcium(II) ion are the two carboxylates of Asp43 (monodentate) and Asp65(bidentate), the carbonyl oxygen of Leu44, and three water molecules. A calcium-binding experiment showed that the calcium dissociation constant (∼5 mm) for the prokaryotic PLA2 is much larger than those of eukaryotic ones.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular PLA2s are divided into calcium-dependent and calcium-independent types. Since a certain calcium-dependent intracellular PLA2catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid and participates in the inflammatory cascade, the development of drugs inactivating the human PLA2 is of great pharmacological interest (2Dennis E.A. Drug. Dev. Res. 1987; 10: 205-220Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 4Dennis E.A. Biotechnology. 1987; 5: 1294-1300Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar).All secreted PLA2s require calcium(II) ion for the expression of catalytic activity. These PLA2s have been grouped into three classes based on their primary structures (5Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Class I enzymes are found in mammalian pancreatic juice and cobra venom. Class II enzymes are contained in synovial fluid and rattlesnake venom. The PLA2s included in both classes have a molecular mass of 14 kDa and mutually exhibit high similarities on their primary structures. A PLA2 contained in bee venom has a molecular mass of 12 kDa and is classified into class III.With respect to the physiological functions of PLA2, for example, snake venom PLA2s have evolved into extremely potent toxins displaying neurotoxic, myotoxic, anticoagulant, and proinflammatory effects (6Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7Hawgood B. Bon C. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins: Reptile Venoms and Toxins. 5. Marcel Dekker, New York1991: 3-52Google Scholar). Pancreatic PLA2, secreted from the pancreatic acinar cells as an inactive zymogen, functions as a digestive enzyme after proteolytic cleavage of the pro form by trypsin to the mature form (8de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have shown that the mature form of human pancreatic PLA2, but not its precursor form, stimulates the proliferation of a human pancreatic cancer cell line (9Hanada K. Kinoshita E. Itoh M. Kajiyama G. Sugiyama M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have found that the proliferation is mediated via the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase after binding of the mature PLA2 to its specific receptor (10Kinoshita E. Handa N. Hanada K. Kajiyama G. Sugiyama M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but not via its catalytic property (11Kinoshita E. Hanada K. Itoh M. Kumagai T. Kajiyama G. Sugiyama M. Int. J. Oncol. 1996; 9: 1219-1225PubMed Google Scholar). In the proliferation experiment, since the bacterial PLA2 was ineffective, we examined the tertiary structural difference for the binding of PLA2 to the specific receptor between the human pancreatic and bacterial PLA2s.Several structural studies of PLA2 in solution (12van den Berg B.

These additional forms are clearly related to classes I, II, and III PLA2s but do not easily fit into those groups. This has led to the establishment of classes V, IX, X, XI (21Six D.A. Dennis E.A.

Highly conserved motifs in the N termini of both subunits predict that the protein is an ATPase. To study the significance of these motifs to mismatch repair, we have expressed in insect cells wild type human MutLα and forms altered in conserved glutamic acid residues, predicted to catalyze ATP hydrolysis of Mlh1, Pms2, or both. Using an in vitro assay, we showed that MutLα proteins altered in either glutamic acid residue were each partially defective in mismatch repair, whereas the double mutant showed no detectable mismatch repair. Neither strand specificity nor directionality of repair was affected in the single mutant proteins. Limited proteolysis studies of MutLα demonstrated that both Mlh1 and Pms2 N-terminal domains undergo ATP-induced conformational changes, but the extent of the conformational change for Mlh1 was more apparent than for Pms2. Furthermore, Mlh1 was protected at lower ATP concentrations than Pms2, suggesting Mlh1 binds ATP with higher affinity. These findings imply that ATP hydrolysis is required for MutLα activity in mismatch repair and that this activity is associated with differential conformational changes in Mlh1 and Pms2.

As a result, of the four exonucleases that have been found to participate in the pathway, two have 5′ to 3′ polarity, and the others have 3′to 5′ polarity (7Burdett V. Baitinger C. Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The single strand gap formed by the exonuclease is filled in by DNA polymerase III, and the nick is sealed by DNA ligase. The pathway in eukaryotes is less understood than in E. coli(reviewed in Refs. 8Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar and 9Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Instead of one MutS, there are three MutS-like proteins that are involved in mutation avoidance, Msh2, Msh3, and Msh6. Msh2 and Msh6 associate to form MutSα, the major MutS activity in MMR (reviewed in Ref. 9Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Illustrating a similar level of complexity, there are four MutL homologs in mammals: Mlh1, Pms2 (closest to Pms1 in yeast), Pms1, and Mlh3. Mlh1 and Pms2 (or Mlh1 and Pms1 in yeast) associate to form MutLα, the major MutL activity in the pathway (9Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev.

Subsequent to mismatch binding by MutSα, a ternary complex involving MutLα forms at the mismatch (12Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

No homologue has been identified for MutH, and the mode of strand discrimination is not clear. ExoI, a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease, is thought to participate in MMR based on physical and genetic interactions with Mlh1 and Msh2 in yeast and human cells (13Tran P.T. Simon J.A. Liskay R.M. Proc. Natl.

The role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in early MMR may provide a clue to the mode of strand discrimination (24Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). MutL has been shown to be a member of the GHL superfamily of ATPases, which includes the homodimeric E. coli gyrase B and eukaryotic Hsp90 (reviewed in Ref. 25Dutta I. Inouye I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The ATPase motif that resides in the N-terminal domain is distinct in organization and catalytic mechanism from “Walker motif” ATPases, including MutS proteins. Upon ATP binding, a conformational change is associated with dimerization of the N termini of the two protomers (26Williams N.L. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 969-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutation of this glutamic acid in gyrase B affected ATP hydrolysis but not binding (30Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the analogous mutation in MutL while eliminating hydrolysis activity also had a small effect on binding (28Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). MutL is a weak ATPase (31Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), in support of a model in which MutL acts to recruit and activate downstream effector proteins following mismatch binding by MutS (32Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The MutL-like ATPase domain is highly conserved, suggesting that eukaryotic MutL homologues also possess ATPase activity. Indeed, the N-terminal fragment of human Pms2 has been shown recently to have an ATPase activity catalyzed by the conserved glutamic acid (33Guarne A. Junop M.S. Yang W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5521-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies in bacteria and yeast indicate the importance of the ATPase domain in MMR (34Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Tran P.T. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6390-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this report, we present results demonstrating the importance of the ATPase domains of human MutLα during MMR. Furthermore, the results suggest an asymmetry within human MutLα as reflected by differential conformational changes in response to adenine nucleotides. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for both Mlh1 and Pms2 (MP-1) were derived by crossing doubly heterozygous animals in a C57BL/6 genetic background. Embryos were harvested from timed pregnancies, homogenized, and placed in culture as described (36Prolla T.A. Baker S.M. Harris A.C. Tsao J.L. Yao X. Bronner C.E. Zheng B. Gordon M. Reneker J. Arnheim N. Shibata D. Bradley A. Liskay R.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Immortalized clones arising spontaneously after senescence were pooled and expanded. Genotyping to identify the Mlh1−/−; Pms2−/− cells was performed by using a PCR assay (37Baker S. Plug A. Prolla T.

Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described (39Thomas D.C. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 187-197Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in up to 40 P-150 plates; trypsinized; washed once with PBS, once with isotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); resuspended in hypotonic buffer at a density of 7 × 107 cells/ml; and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. The swollen cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer using pestle B and then incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this step, which is the cytoplasmic extract, was aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All substrates were prepared from phage DNA kindly provided by Dr. Paul Modrich. A 5′ nick G-T mismatch DNA substrate was prepared from f1MR1 phage ssDNA and f1MR3 phage dsDNA linearized with Sau96I (40Su S.-S. Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nick is located 125 bp 5′ to the mismatch on the complementary strand. Repair of the nicked (complementary) strand renders the substrate sensitive toHindIII. Repair of the intact (viral) strand renders the substrate sensitive to XhoI. A 5′ nick one-base loop substrate was prepared from f1MR22 phage ssDNA and f1MR21 phage dsDNA (41Drummond J.T., Li, G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) linearized with Sau96I. The nick is located 125 bp 5′ to the mismatch on the complementary strand. Repair of the nicked strand renders the substrate sensitive to XcmI. Repair of the intact (viral) strand renders the substrate sensitive toBglI. In this substrate, the mismatch is an unmatched A in the complementary strand. To prepare a 3′ nick one-base IDL substrate, a 150-bp PCR fragment site was amplified using pBluescript as a template and the primers 5′-GTGACTCTAGAGAATTCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTGACTCTAGAGAGTTAGCTCACTCATTAGG-3′. The fragment that contained an EcoRI site provided by the upstream primer (underlined) was digested with XbaI and cloned into a unique NheI site in both f1mR21 and f1MR22, generating f1MR21RI and f1MR22RI, respectively. TheNheI site is located 10 bp from the mismatch and on the other side of it relative to Sau96I. f1MR21RI dsDNA was linearized with EcoRI and then mixed with f1MR22RI phage ssDNA. In this substrate, the nick is located 130 bp 3′ to the mismatch on the complementary strand. Sensitivities to restriction enzymes are the same as the 5′ nick one-base IDL substrate. All substrates were prepared as follows: following linearization of the phage dsDNA, the reaction was desalted using Microcon 30 (Amicon). 5 μg of dsDNA was mixed with 7.5 μg of the appropriate ssDNA at a volume of 100 μl, incubated at 75 °C for 15 min, and put on ice for 5 min, followed by the addition of 20× SSC to 2× SSC final concentration and incubation for an additional 10 min on ice. Up to six reactions were loaded on a 1% low melt agarose gel and run in TBE for 36 h at 20 V. The band containing the heteroduplex was cut out, chopped to small pieces, washed with β-agarase buffer (10 mmBis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA) twice by incubating on ice for 30 min, and melted at 70 °C. After cooling to 40 °C, β-agarase (New England Biolabs) was added (5 units/200 μl) and incubated for 2 h at 40 °C. The mixture was extracted sequentially with phenol, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture, and chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA pellet was resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer. A typical assay (20 μl) contained 100 μg of cytoplasmic extract, 100 ng of DNA substrate in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 4 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmglutathione, 50 mm KCl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, quenched by the addition of 60 μl of stop solution (1.2% SDS, 25 mm EDTA), heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min, incubated with 1 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min, and extracted sequentially with phenol, phenol/chloroform, and chloroform, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The DNA pellet was resuspended in restriction mix (15 μl) containing 5 units ofClaI and either 5 units of Hind III (for G-T substrate) or 5 units of XcmI (for one-base IDL substrates), incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and resolved on 1% agarose gels for 16 h at 40 V in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Ethidium bromide-stained bands were visualized using Gel Doc 1000 (BioRad). The gels were quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad). Repair efficiency of 5′ nick DNA substrates was calculated by dividing the sum of the 3.1- and 3.3-kb bands by the total intensity of the bands in the lane (6.4 kb + 3.3 kb + 3.1 kb). Repair efficiency of 3′ nick DNA substrates was calculated by dividing the sum of the 3.2- and 3.3-kb bands by the total intensity per lane. A typical reaction (20 μl) contained 200 ng of MutLα, up to 10 mm ATP, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was preincubated with ATP at 30 °C for 5–15 min, and then 20–50 ng trypsin (Promega) were added and incubation continued for 5–20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 μl of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and immediately boiled at 100 °C for 8 min. Two equal volumes from a given reaction were each separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.), and blotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human Pms2 or Mlh1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:500 dilution followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Oncogene Research Products) at a 1:2000 dilution. The blots were developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film. The films were scanned using ScanMaker5 (Microtek) and quantified using Multi-Analyst software (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used were as follows: sc-581, anti-human Mlh1 N terminus; sc-582, anti-human Mlh1 C terminus; sc-617, anti-human Pms2 N terminus; sc-618, anti-human Pms2 C terminus. The glutamic acid to alanine substitutions have been made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Two 36-mer mutagenic oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation (underlined, from GAG to GCC) in their middle (5′-GCACTGCGGTAAAGGCCTTAGTAGAAAACAGTCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGACTGTTTTCTACTAAGGCCTTTACCGCAGTGC-3′) were annealed to the same sequence on opposite strands of a plasmid containing the human Pms2 cDNA. Similarly, two 38-mer mutagenic oligonucleotides (5′-CGGCCAGCTAATGCTATCAAAGCCATGATTGAGAACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTCTCAATCATGGCTTTGATAGCATTAGCTGGCCG-3′) were annealed to another plasmid containing the human Mlh1 cDNA. PCR was carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase using 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min each. The products, which are nicked circular strands, were incubated with DpnI to digest the methylated, nonmutated parental DNA template and were used to transform DH10B E. coli cells. Plasmids were retrieved from transformants and sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. Fragments spanning the mutation were cut out and replaced the corresponding wild type fragments in Mlh1 or Pms2 cDNAs. The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus (Invitrogen) expression system was used to express MutLα in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. Human Pms2 cDNA was cloned into pFastBac DUAL in two steps. A 760-bp fragment from the 5′-end was PCR-amplified using an upstream primer (5′-ATCAGCTGGGATCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGAGCGAGCTGAGAGCTCGAG) encoding six consecutive histidines in front of the second amino acid and 5′-GGGGCAGCTGAACAAAAGG as downstream primer. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and PvuII and subcloned into pFastBac DUAL between BbsI and PvuII under the p10 promoter. This plasmid was cleaved withPvuII and ligated to the 3′ fragment of Pms2. Mlh1 cDNA was subcloned into the resulting plasmid between XbaI and EcoRI in the other multicloning site under the polyhedrin promoter. Recombinant pFastBac DUAL plasmids were used to transform DH10Bac E. coli. cells (Invitrogen) that contain baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid). Transformants in which the expression cassettes containing the cloned cDNAs from the pFastBac DUAL plasmids were transferred by transposition into the bacmid were isolated. Recombinant bacmid preparations from these transformants were used to transfect Sf9 cells. 150–300 ml of logarithmic phase Sf9 cells grown in Sf-900IISFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) were infected with baculovirus stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 3 for 48 h. The cells were lysed with five packed cell volumes of Sf9 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, one EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The supernatant, supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, was loaded on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer H (25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) plus 20 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer H plus 20 mm imidazole, and the bound protein was eluted with buffer H plus 500 mm imidazole. The eluate from the nickel column was diluted to 100 mm NaCl and loaded on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with buffer T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) plus 100 mm NaCl, and eluted with a 0.1–1 mNaCl gradient in buffer T. Fractions containing MutLα that eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 30 concentrator (Amicon), and the buffer was exchanged to MutL storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA). Human MutLα, purified after expression in insect cells (Fig.1A), was tested for complementation of extracts from a MEF cell line (MP-1) genetically deficient in both Mlh1 and Pms2. The validity of this “human/mouse” approach is supported by reports showing that a human Mlh1 cDNA can complement the “MMR” phenotypes of Mlh1-deficient MEFs (42Buermeyer A.B. Wilson-Van Patten C. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 538-541PubMed Google Scholar) and that human chromosome 2 that contains the MSH2allele complements mouse Msh2−/− cells (43Marra G. D'Atri S. Yan H. Perrera C. Cannavo E. Vogelstein B. Jiricny J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7719-7721PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate the high degree of conservation of the mammalian MMR system. We used mismatch-containing plasmid substrates as previously described (44Holmes J.J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) with the modification of using cytoplasmic extracts instead of nuclear. As shown in Fig. 2, A(lane 1) and B (lane 1), MP-1 cytoplasmic extract was inefficient in the repair of a 5′ G-T and a 5′ one-base IDL (insertion deletion loop) heteroduplexes, respectively. The addition of recombinant human MutLα restored repair activity (Fig. 2, A (lane 3) and B (lane 2)). These repair levels were comparable with those of MMR-proficient MEF and HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts (data not shown) and were in the range reported for HeLa cell nuclear extracts (10Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 44Holmes J.J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This repair activity meets other criteria characteristic of in vitro MMR including sensitivity to aphidicolin (data not shown) and being limited to the nicked strand (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). To test the role of the putative ATPase domain of human MutLα in MMR, we mutated a conserved glutamic acid residue in the N terminus of Mlh1 and Pms2 (Fig.1B). We chose to mutate this residue because it was clearly implicated in the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis in human Pms2 (33Guarne A. Junop M.S. Yang W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5521-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as well as E. coli MutL (28Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and gyrase B (30Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be essential for in vivo MMR in E. coli(45Aronshtam A. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and yeast (35Tran P.T. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6390-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have purified human MutLα expressed in insect cells, in which the glutamic acid residue was substituted to alanine in either Mlh1 at position 34 (MutLα mE34A), Pms2 at position 41 (MutLα pE41A), or both (MutLα mE34A/pE41A) (Fig. 1A). Studies showed that heterodimer formation is dependent upon interaction of the C termini of Mlh1 and Pms2 (46Guerrette S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6336-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, not surprisingly, these mutations did not affect heterodimer formation as evidenced by similar ratios of the two protomers in both the wild type and mutant dimers (Fig.1A). Moreover, the expression levels and protein yields were similar to wild type MutLα, suggesting that neither mutation affected overall structure or stability. As seen in Figs. 2B and 3A, whereas wild type MutLα complemented the Mlh1−/−;Pms2−/−-deficient extract for repair of a 5′ nicked substrate containing a one-base IDL mispair, the double mutant form of MutLα (MutLα mE34A/pE41A) showed no detectable activity. Furthermore, the two single mutant MutLα proteins, MutLα mE34A and MutLα pE41A, were each partially active, and repair increased with similar kinetics. A previous report suggested that “5′ repair” might be dependent primarily on PMS2, whereas “3′ repair” is dependent primarily on MLH1 (47Nicolaides N.C. Littman S.J. Modrich P. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether the conserved glutamic acid might be involved in determining “directionality” of repair, we repeated the assay using a similar substrate in which the nick was located at a similar distance but 3′ relative to the one-base IDL (Fig.3B). As shown, similar to the 5′ nicked one-base IDL substrate, the two single mutants each showed similar and partial repair efficiency. Whereas repair of the two substrates by wild type MutLα was saturated early in the reaction, repair efficiencies of the single mutants continued to increase. A similar trend of repair was observed for 5′ nicked G-T substrate (Fig. 2A). For both of the single mutant MutLα proteins, residual repair of the G-T mismatch was limited to the nicked strand (Fig. 2A). We next asked whether the putative ATPase activity of MutLα drives conformational changes similar to MutL, and asked what is the contribution of the individual protomers. Limited proteolysis analysis is often used to detect conformational changes in proteins (48Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).

Here, we performed limited proteolysis followed by Western blotting, using specific antibodies to the N termini of Mlh1 or Pms2, to study the effect of ATP on possible conformational changes in each protomer of human MutLα.

https://openalex.org/W1989445043,"The formation of dentin provides one well accepted paradigm for studying mineralized tissue formation. For the assembly of dentin, several cellular signaling pathways cooperate to provide neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells with positional information. Further, “cross-talk” between signaling pathways from the mesenchymal derived odontoblast cells and the epithelially derived ameloblasts during development is responsible for the formation of functional odontoblasts. These intercellular signals are tightly regulated, both temporally and spatially. When isolated from the developing tooth germ, odontoblasts quickly lose their potential to maintain the odontoblast-specific phenotype. Therefore, generation of an odontoblast cell line would be a valuable reproducible tool for studying the modulatory effects involved in odontoblast differentiation as well as the molecular events involved in mineralized dentin formation. In this study an immortalized odontoblast cell line, which has the required biochemical machinery to produce mineralized tissue in vitro, has been generated. These cells were implanted into animal models to determine their in vivo effects on dentin formation. After implantation, we observed a multistep, programmed cascade of gene expression in the exogenous odontoblasts as the dentin formed de novo. Some of the genes expressed include the dentin matrix proteins 1, 2, and 3, which are extracellular matrix molecules responsible for the ultimate formation of mineralized dentin. The biological response was also examined by histology and radiography and confirmed for mineral deposition by von Kossa staining. Thus, a transformed odontoblast cell line was created with high proliferative capacity that might ultimately be used for the regeneration and repair of dentin in vivo.

Thus, a transformed odontoblast cell line was created with high proliferative capacity that might ultimately be used for the regeneration and repair of dentin in vivo. Cells destined to form the mineralized tissues are derived from three distinct lineages. The cranial skeleton develops from neural crest cells. Most of the axial skeleton like skull, ribs, and sternum comes from the sclerotomes. Finally, the appendicular bones are derived from lateral plate mesoderm. Neural crest cells additionally have the plasticity to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal derivatives such as bone, cartilage, dentin, and dental pulp (1Thesleff I. Vaahtokari A. Partanen A.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 35-50PubMed Google Scholar). Odontoblasts, which are responsible for the synthesis of dentin (2Goldberg M. Septier D. Torres-Quintana M. Lecolle S. Hall R. Gafni G. Menachi S. Embery G. Goldberg M. Boskey A. Robinson C. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL1998: 297-303Google Scholar), arise from neural crest progenitors that have undergone differentiation in a multistep lineage pathway. At its later stages, odontoblast development involves cells called preodontoblasts, which, after a number of cell divisions, terminally differentiate into postmitotic tall columnar odontoblast cells responsible for the synthesis of a mineralized matrix. This event is highly coordinated and regulated by extracellular matrix molecules, signaling molecules, growth factors, and their receptors. During the differentiation process, precise cell-cell, cell-matrix, and matrix-matrix interactions are responsible for triggering odontoblast differentiation and synthesis of the key components responsible for matrix calcification. Researchers have implicated several regulatory factors and complex interactions with the epithelially derived ameloblasts in the regulation of odontoblast differentiation (3Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Begue-Kim C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 51-68PubMed Google Scholar). Regulatory events that occur during dentinogenesis result in the onset of odontoblast-specific gene expression for dentin matrix protein 2 (DMP2) 1The abbreviations used are: DMPdentin matrix proteinDSPdentin sialoproteinDSPPdentin sialophosphoproteinNCPnoncollagenous proteinshTERThuman telomerase reverse transcript1The abbreviations used are: DMPdentin matrix proteinDSPdentin sialoproteinDSPPdentin sialophosphoproteinNCPnoncollagenous proteinshTERThuman telomerase reverse transcript and dentin sialoprotein (DSP) (4George A.

Various other phosphoproteins synthesized by the odontoblasts, such as dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) along with DMP2, may play a structural and/or regulatory role in the calcifying organic matrix by providing sites for apatite nucleation.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1981: 233-243Google Scholar) first suggested that defects in the genes for dentin extracellular noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) were likely candidates for the dentinogenesis imperfecta Type II, a rare disorder marked by mineralization defects. Takagi et al. (9Takagi Y. Veis A. Sauk J.J. Clin. Orthop. 1983; 176: 282-290PubMed Google Scholar) further suggested that dentinogenesis imperfecta patients might show reduced levels of acidic phosphoproteins such as dentin phosphophoryn (now known as DMP2). Recently, a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of DSPP gene was reported to be responsible for one case of dentinogenesis imperfecta Type II (10Zhang X. Zhao J., Li, C. Gao S. Qiu C. Liu P., Wu, G. Qiang B. Lo W.H. Shen Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Only two dentin-specific NCPs, the phosphophoryns and DSP have been identified thus far (4George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32869-32873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X.

Although many investigators have demonstrated the abundance of these proteins in the dentin matrix, their precise role is not known. Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms involved in the terminal differentiation and synthesis of odontoblast-specific matrix molecules requires a homogenous population of cells. However, primary odontoblast cells cannot be maintained in cultures for a long time due to their finite life span (3Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Begue-Kim C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 51-68PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sakamoto S. Baird S.A. Sakamoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Several methodologies have been employed by investigators to develop cell lines from various mineralized tissues, the most common being SV-40 large “T” antigen gene (12Winn S.R. Randolph G. Uludag H.

It has been demonstrated that cultured primary cells can circumvent senescence and continue to proliferate when transformed by a number of agents. Here we report the successful immortalization of rat odontoblasts using a gene for telomerase, a multicomponent enzyme that regulates chromosomal length upon cell division. As telomerase is composed of a template RNA plus an essential catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcript (hTERT) (18Meyerson M. Counter C.M., Ng Eaton E. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L. Beijersbergen R.L. Davidoff M.J. Liu Q. Bacchetti S. Haber D.A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 785-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), functional telomerase activity can be reconstituted by providing the catalytic subunit absent from somatic cells through ectopic expression of hTERT (19Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In this study, odontoblast cells have been immortalized by reconstitution of telomerase activity. The result was immortal cell cultures that are highly proliferative and can grow without senescence. These immortalized cells demonstrate the presence of fully differentiated odontoblast-specific markers, namely DMP1, DMP2, and DMP3, and also have the potential to produce a mineralized dentin matrix both in vitro and in vivo. The availability of this cell line will provide a unique opportunity to determine the mechanisms responsible for differentiation of the neural crest-derived cells into odontoblast-like cells. These cells could ultimately be manipulated for tissue engineering of damaged dentin and to identify novel genes that are odontoblast-specific. First and second molar tooth germs were dissected aseptically from 3–5-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, and primary cell culture was conducted as described before (20Kasugai S. Shibata S. Suzuki S. Susami T. Ogura H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues were cut into small particles (about 0.1 cm3) and incubated with 10 ml of 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. The released cells were passed through a 100-μm cell strainer (BD Labware) and pelleted by centrifugation (3600 rpm for 10 min). The pellet was resuspended and maintained in the culture medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Cellgro), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2.5 units/ml fungizone, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. The medium was changed every 3 or 4 days. 80% confluent primary tooth germ cells were transfected with pCI-Neo-hTERT (kind gift from Weinberg Laboratories, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT) and pMx1-SV40T-Neo-195 (kind gift from Dr. S. R. Winn, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were replated at a low density and were then selected with 0.7 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Sigma). A standard sterile disc cloning (Bel-Art Products) method selectively removed well isolated colonies. They were replated at low densities to obtain secondary colonies, which were then expanded into cell lines. Two single clones (T4-4 and T3-2) from hTERT transfection and one (A4-4) from SV40 large T antigen transfection were identified by this method, and they exhibited characteristic odontoblastic morphology. These cells were expanded, passaged, and assayed for different phenotypic markers. Total RNA was extracted from A4-4, T3-2, and T4-4 cell lines and rat tooth germs using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNaseI (RNase-free, RQ1, Promega). Three micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed for 90 min at 42 °C with Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR Supermix (Invitrogen) was used in all of the PCR reactions. Primers for the PCR reaction for DMP1, DMP2, DMP3, alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I, ameloblastin, CBFA1, cytomegalovirus, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were designed from available sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene data bank. The PCR products were verified by sequencing. For DMP2 Northern blot the primers were designed from the untranslated region. Northern blots were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). mRNA was extracted from cultured cells at the 22nd passage using a FastTrack Kit (Invitrogen). Five-microgram samples of mRNA were resolved on 0.8% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized with the use of HyperHyb (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) and probed with randomly labeled (Decaprime kit; Ambion) appropriate probes. The probes used were cDNAs for DMP1, DMP2, DMP3, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Transfected cell clones at passage 23 were seeded on glass chamber slides (BD Labware) and maintained in standard medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml G418 for 7days. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin in neutral buffer (Sigma) and incubated overnight with polyclonal antibodies against DMP1 (22Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), DMP2 (gift from Dr. A. Veis), and DMP3 (gift from Dr. W. Butler) and hTERT polyclonal antibody (sc-7214, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Thereafter, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody (Sigma) for another 2 h. Microphotographs were taken using a confocal microscope. The pCI-Neo-hTERT expression vector carries a strong constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter and the neomycin gene to confer resistance to G418 sulfate for selection of stable transfectants. The stable transfectants were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR with primers specific for cytomegalovirus promoter and immunostaining with hTERT antibody. The mineralization microenvironment was created by treating T4-4 cells at passage 24 (80–90% confluent) with 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate along with 10 nmdexamethasone for 45 days. mRNA was extracted from the T4-4 cell line at 0, 15, 30, and 45 days for Northern blot analysis to check the expression of DMPs during the mineralization process. The T4-4 cells undergoing mineralization (40 days in culture) were fixed with 10% formalin in neutral buffer (Sigma) for 15 min. The slides were washed with distilled water and then treated with 1% AgNO3 for 1 h, washed again with distilled water, and treated with 2.5% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min. The specimens were counterstained and then examined under a light microscope. The samples were dried at room temperature (24 °C) and placed on aluminum grids. X-ray diffraction of the samples was carried out with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (= 1.54 Å), at a scanning rate of 1° (2θ)/min. About 5 × 106 of T4-4 cells at passage 25 were mixed with 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 of Collagraft (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN), incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h, and then transplanted subcutaneously on the dorsal surface and intramuscularly (quadriceps muscles) in 15-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The procedures were performed in accordance with specifications of an approved small animal protocol (UIC No. 99–040). Radiographs were closely examined for signs of mineralized tissue formation every 10 days. At 12 weeks post-transplantation, the transplants were removed, fixed with 10% formalin, decalcified with buffered 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) for a short duration, and then embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized and stained for histological and immunohistological evaluation. Collagraft with RPC-C2A, a dental pulp cell line (23Kasugai S. Adachi M. Ogura H. Arch. Oral. Biol. 1988; 33: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was used as a control. The telomerase-containing plasmid was transfected into 3-day-old rat molar tooth germ cells. Cells were selected for neomycin by G418 in the medium. Several individual single cell clones were isolated, and integration of the telomerase gene was detected by PCR and immunostaining. Two of these transfected clones, T4-4 and T3-2, are currently being maintained in culture for over 60 passages. Fig1, A and B, depicts the primary cells from the rat tooth germ after 1 h and 2 days in culture, respectively. The immortalized cells during G418 selection are shown in Fig 1 C. Fully differentiated odontoblasts are characterized by a polarized morphology with the nucleus situated at the basal third of the cell body and a long odontoblastic process at the apical end. Fig. 1 D depicts a single telomerase-expressing cell, which has the characteristic odontoblastic phenotype. Fig. 1, E and F, shows transformed single cells having the same characteristic odontoblast-like morphology. As the morphology of the transformed cells resembled the native odontoblasts, telomerase appears to have conferred upon primary cells the ability to express phenotypic characteristics of differentiated odontoblasts. To confirm that the identified cell clones were functioning as differentiated odontoblasts we used reverse transcription-PCR to measure gene expression of various NCPs. Fig. 2 A shows that the transformed cell line synthesized various dentin NCPs like dentin matrix protein 1, 2, and 3. The transformed cells also expressed other extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase, and CBFA1 (Fig. 2 A) as soon as the cells were confluent (6 days in culture). Northern blot analysis further confirmed the expression of odontoblast-specific non-collagen genes such as DMP1, DMP2, and DMP3, indicating odontoblastic differentiation (Fig. 2 B). Immunocytochemical studies further confirmed that the cell line (T4-4) expressed the major NCPs in dentin, namely DMP1, DMP2, DMP3, and hTERT (Fig. 3). Thus, the transformed cells appear to function as differentiated odontoblasts on the molecular level.Figure 3Immunostaining of DMPs in T4-4 cells. The expression of various DMPs was analyzed by immunostaining with specific antibodies using confocal microscopy. The expression of hTERT in the transformed cell line was also analyzed.

Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the T4-4 cells could make a mineralized dentin matrix, the cells were cultured in the presence of differentiation medium containing ascorbic acid, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone. Results from the Northern blot data demonstrated that these transformed cells are able to induce the expression of dentin matrix proteins 1, 2, and 3 in the extracellular matrix. Between 0 and 15 days in culture the expression of DMP1 increased but then dropped after 15 days. In situ data showed a similar time course of gene expression (data not shown). Between 0 and 45 days in culture, transformed cells linearly increased their expression of DMP2 and -3 (Fig. 4). Thus, the pattern of expression of the dentin matrix proteins by transformed odontoblasts mimicked the expression pattern by native differentiated odontoblasts. When placed under conditions known to foster mineralization in vitro, the T4-4 cells formed well defined mineralized nodules, as observed by phase microscopy (Fig. 5, A1) This was confirmed histologically by the von Kossa staining method used for the detection of phosphates (Fig. 5, A2). Transformed cells in culture for 40 days produced calcified nodules, as depicted by black-stained particles in Fig. 5, A2. We further characterized the deposited mineral by x-ray diffractometry. The analysis identified the nodules' composition as crystalline hydroxyapatite, due to the presence of a sharp peak at 2θ = 31.8 (Fig. 5 B). Thus the calcification of the extracellular matrix under in vitro mineralization conditions demonstrates that the entire process is a dynamic process resulting from the synthesis of specific matrix molecules and formation of mineralized nodules. Also the formation of mineralized nodules provides a model for dentin-like tissue formation in vitro. Thus the transformed cells behaved just like differentiated cells in vitro. To confirm that the in vitro data accurately recapitulate mineralization events in vivo, we implanted the T4-4 cells both subcutaneously and intramuscularly in Sprague-Dawley rats. Collagraft, a three-dimensional scaffold, was used to immobilize the T4-4 cells. The cell-impregnated scaffold had the potential to proliferate and synthesize a mineralized matrix when implanted in rats. After subcutaneous implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats the immobilized cells showed the potential to maintain their differentiated state, proliferate, and synthesize a mineralized matrix within 6 weeks. After 12 weeks of implantation, the cellular scaffolds were harvested and subjected to histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Morphological examination showed no evidence of inflammation or rejection. Transformed, explanted cells appeared well organized surrounded by a mineralized matrix that was laid down in a polarized manner (Fig. 7 A). Protein expression using polyclonal antibodies directed against DMP1 (Fig. 7 D) and the DSP portion of DMP3 (Fig. 7 E) shows that the transformed cells not only expressed the proteins intracellularly but also in the mineralized matrix. An antibody directed against telomerase confirmed the identity of the matrix-producing cells, as the implanted transformed cells (data not shown). Terminal differentiation of native odontoblasts is accompanied by the synthesis of NCPs such as DMP1, DMP2, and DMP3, which have been hypothesized to play a functional role in mineralization. Radiographic evaluation further demonstrated that the transformed cells formed mineralized tissue. The intensity of the matrix synthesized by the implanted cells increased with time compared with the control group (Fig. 6). von Kossa (Fig. 7 B) and Masson's trichrome blue (Fig. 7 C) stain confirmed the presence of calcium phosphate and collagen in the mineralized matrix. As a control, we implanted RPC-C2A dental pulp cells, while these cells also secreted matrix proteins the level of secretion was much lower and there were no obvious mineralized tissues after von Kossa staining. Further immunostaining for DMP1 and DMP3 was negative in the transplanted scaffold and cells (Fig. 7, F and G). In summary, the in vivo results demonstrated that T4-4 transformed cells could differentiate into odontoblast-like cells and exhibited the gene products and mineralization events characteristic of terminally differentiated, native odontoblasts. Odontogenic differentiation in culture has not been well characterized due to two major limitations: the limited life span of primary cells and the paucity of differentiation markers. Odontoblasts are terminally differentiated cells, thus they cannot be further induced for differentiation. Recent advancements in identification and cloning of dentin matrix proteins by other laboratories and ours have helped tremendously in the area of identifying markers for terminally differentiated odontoblasts (5George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 72: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The understanding of signaling mechanisms involved in dentin formation remains in its infancy even though substantial progress has been made in identifying the fundamental pathway required for tooth patterning. We anticipate that the development of an odontoblast cell line will not only be useful for identifying novel targets and signaling pathways for dentin formation but will also help in the field of gene therapy for regeneration of dentin. Various tissue-specific cell lines have been immortalized using telomerase (24O'Hare M.J. Bond J. Clarke C. Takeuchi Y. Atherton A.J. Berry C. Moody J. Silver A.R. Davies D.C. Alsop A.E. Neville A.M.

In our studies, we transformed cells from the developing tooth germ of rats, the primary repository for odontogenic cells, with a human gene encoding the reverse transcriptase subunit telomerase. Incorporation of the gene in rat odontoblasts resulted in a considerable extension of their life span and permitted the cells to proliferate without limitation. Morphological features of the transformed odontoblast-like cells were similar to in vivo odontoblasts: both show long cytoplasmic processes attached to one end of the cell body and a polarized distribution of the nucleus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi stack at the other (3Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Begue-Kim C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 51-68PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed that the transformed cells had the necessary biochemical program for differentiation and were capable of producing a mineralizing extracellular matrix both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we looked at a transcription factor known to be essential for tissue-specific gene expression. Researchers have identified CBFA1 as an essential transcription factor for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis (27Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar, 28Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) and showed that the gene product plays an essential role in osteoblast differentiation. Mutations of CBFA1 gene result in abnormal skeletal genesis and various dental disorders. The expression of Cbfa1 in our immortalized cells corroborates well with a recent report that demonstrates the high level of expression of this transcription factor in differentiated odontoblasts (29D'Souza R.N. Aberg T. Gaikwad J. Cavender A. Owen M. Karsenty G. Thesleff I. Development. 1999; 126: 2911-2920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having a cell line such as the telomerase-transformed rat odontoblasts will be a valuable asset for pinpointing additional transcription factors that control the differentiation of the ectomesenchymal neural crest cells into odontoblasts. The immortalized cells had the potential to synthesize principal extracellular matrix components that are necessary for the assembly of dentin matrix, namely type I collagen, which forms the scaffold for mineral deposition, and NCPs, which are responsible for nucleating and regulating the hydroxyapatite crystal size. The dentin matrix proteins have been proposed to function as regulatory molecules during the ordered deposition and organization of hydroxyapatite. Specifically DMP2 and DMP3 or DSPP defines the phenotypic characteristics of dentin.In situ hybridization studies during development have demonstrated that the extracellular matrix genes DMP1, DMP2, and DMP3 are synthesized and secreted by odontoblasts at the mineralization front only after they enter the secretory stage. Therefore, identification of these terminally differentiated odontoblast-specific markers would establish the presence of a true odontoblastic cell line. As T4-4 and T3-2 odontoblast-like cell lines have all the characteristics of an odontoblastic phenotype, they will likely provide an excellent reproducible in vitro system for studying odontoblast-specific gene expression. The biological potential for these cells to form a mineralized tissue was demonstrated by the in vivo implantation studies. The implanted cells were completely polarized and functional. We observed a distinct calcified tissue phenotype coinciding with the expression of the dentin matrix proteins within the microenvironment of the implanted site. We confirmed the presence of phosphate in the mineralized tissue with von Kossa staining. Phosphate is a major component of mineralized tissue matrix that functions to sequester increased calcium ions and helps cells maintain homeostasis (30Beck G.R., Jr. Zerler B. Moran E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8352-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recently Gronthos et al. (31Gronthos S. Mankani M. Brahim J. Robey P.G. Shi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13625-13630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar) showed that dental pulp stem cells, when transplanted into immunocompromised mice, generate a dentin-like mineralized structure. These results support our evidence that telomerase-transformed cells function as bona fide differentiated odontoblasts. The main advantage of developing an odontoblast cell line is that these cells maybe used to study the signaling mechanisms involved in terminal differentiation of odontoblasts, isolation and characterization of odontoblast-specific genes, and tissue engineering of these cells for the formation of reparative dentin. The molecular mechanisms during reparative dentin formation have not been systematically investigated. The transformed cells reported here could be efficiently propagated in culture with sufficient proliferative capacity to produce enough dentin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the T4-4 immortalized cells have unique odontogenic potential along with the capability to form mineralized matrix both in vitro and in vivo. The ultrastructural morphology of matrix mineralization and expression of odontoblast-specific differentiation markers are some of the salient features of the T4-4 odontoblast cell line. This cell line will be a valuable tool for identifying and characterizing the different signaling molecules and transcription factors responsible for the complete differentiation of the odontoblasts as the process of odontoblast differentiation in vitro recapitulates the in vivo situation. An important functional application would be the manipulation of these cells for tissue engineering of mineralized tissues especially in the reparative formation and regeneration of dentin.

https://openalex.org/W2052918960,"Three-dimensional models of thrombin complexed with large fragments of the fibrinogen Aα and Bβ chains are presented. The models are consistent with the results of recent mutagenesis studies of thrombin and with the information available on naturally occurring fibrinogen mutants. Thrombin recognizes fibrinogen with an extended binding surface, key elements of which are Tyr76 in exosite I, located about 20 Å away from the active site, and the aryl binding site located in close proximity to the catalytic triad. A highly conserved aromatic-Pro-aromatic triplet motif is identified in the primed site region of fibrinogen and other natural substrates of thrombin. The role of this triplet, based on the three-dimensional models, is to correctly orient the substrate for optimal bridge binding to exosite I and the active site. The three-dimensional models suggest a possible pattern of recognition by thrombin that applies generally to other natural substrates.

The three-dimensional models suggest a possible pattern of recognition by thrombin that applies generally to other natural substrates. Thrombin plays multiple functional roles in the blood by interacting with a variety of proteins. The procoagulant role of thrombin unfolds upon interaction with fibrinogen and culminates in the formation of fibrin intermediates that polymerize into a blood clot. The kinetic steps defining this interaction and the mechanism of fibrin polymerization have been characterized in great detail (1Mosesson M.W. Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 11-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The determinants of fibrinogen recognition by thrombin have also been elucidated by site-directed mutagenesis (2Tsiang M. Jain A.K.

Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and provide an important data base of information that complements clinical findings of naturally occurring fibrinogen variants that are associated with bleeding phenotypes. The thrombin-fibrinogen interaction has enjoyed renewed interest in recent years after the landmark solution of the crystal structure of fibrinogen derivatives (4Everse S.J. Spraggon G. Veerapandian L. Rilley M. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8637-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Brown J.H. Volkmann N. Jun G. Henschen-Edman A.H. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2001; 98: 11967-11972Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These structures have offered clues about the molecular events underlying the end-to-end assembly of fibrin monomers generated after the thrombin-induced release of FpA 1The abbreviations used are: FpAfibrinopeptide AFpBfibrinopeptide BPARprotease-activated receptorPPACKH-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl from the Aα chain, the subsequent formation of fibrin protofibrils, and the thrombin-induced release of FpB from the Bβ chain (4Everse S.J. Spraggon G. Veerapandian L. Rilley M. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8637-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Information about the structural epitopes of thrombin recognizing fibrinogen has also been obtained. Fragments of FpA covalently bound to the active site Ser195 of thrombin have been reported by x-ray crystallography (8Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Martin P.D. Robertson W. Turk D. Huber R. Bode W. Edwards B.F. J. Biol.

Proteins. 1999; 34: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies have delineated the interactions made by FpA with the active site moiety of thrombin. fibrinopeptide A fibrinopeptide B protease-activated receptor H-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl It has long been known, however, that regions of thrombin distant from the active site are involved in fibrinogen recognition (11Fenton J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 370: 468-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Specifically, exosite I, which is located about 20 Å away from the active site, contains residues that are critical for fibrinogen binding. Macromolecular bridge binding of fibrinogen to exosite I and the active site confers high specificity to the interaction and serves as a binding mode exploited by other natural substrates like the G-protein-coupled thrombin receptors (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent Ala-scanning mutagenesis studies of thrombin have identified a hot spot in exosite I, centered near Tyr76, which stores much of the energy responsible for the interaction with fibrinogen (2Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the available crystal structure of the thrombin-fibrinogen complex does not provide information about the contacts made by the natural substrate with exosite I. In the case of the interaction of thrombin with the Bβ chain of fibrinogen that is responsible for the release of FpB and protofibril polymerization, no structural information is currently available. This study fills an important structure-function gap in our understanding of the thrombin-fibrinogen interaction. Here we report about three-dimensional models of thrombin complexed with large fragments of the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen following a strategy recently used in the case of thrombin interaction with the G-protein-coupled receptors PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The models are highly consistent with available data on site-directed and naturally occurring mutants of thrombin and fibrinogen. The N-terminal fragments of the fibrinogen Aα-(20–62) and Bβ-(31–72) chains were built, capped, and completed for missing hydrogens (pH 7.0) with Biopolymer and InsightII (Accelerys, San Diego, CA) using the human sequences P02671, P02675, and P02679 from the SwissProt sequence data base (12Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). First, 500 models were produced with Modeler4 (13Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) by comparative modeling of every substrate on the surface of thrombin using several available crystal structures of peptide-thrombin complexes as templates. Substrate conformation was then optimized from the best model by simulated annealing during molecular dynamic processes with Discover (Accelerys). The fibrinogen fragment Aα-(26–35) was threaded over the Ac-DFLAEGGGVR peptide from the x-ray crystal structures 1BBR and 1UCY (9Martin P.D. Robertson W. Turk D. Huber R. Bode W. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7911-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Martin P.D. Malkowski M.G. Dimaio J. Konishi Y., Ni, F. Edwards B.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13030-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Residue Arg35 of the Aα chain was linked through its carbonyl oxygen to thrombin Ser195 Ογ to form a reaction intermediate analogous to the Arg of PPACK in 1PPB (15Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The conformation of fragment Aα-(35–49) was templated on the protein fragments KILDKVVERIKERMKDSNVKL from 1A0E and AFWRELVECFQKISKDSDCRA from 1DCI. These fragments were selected from our data base of 48 million conformers constructed by fragmenting the entire protein data bank into peptides from 3 to 18 residues in length. The conformers were screened for optimal shape, length, and fit to the thrombin surface. The conformation of fragment Aα-(46–57) was loosely threaded over the NGDFEEIPEEYL hirugen peptide from the structures 1HAH (16Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and 1NRS (17Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii N. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The fibrinogen fragment Bβ-(41–44) was threaded over the peptide LDPR from the structure 1NRS (17Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii N. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Residue Arg44 of the Aα chain was linked through its carbonyl oxygen to thrombin Ser195 Oγ as described previously. The conformation of fragment Bβ4-(49–61) was loosely threaded over the NGDFEEIPEEYL hirugen peptide from structures 1HAH and 1NRS and also over the proline-rich peptide APTMPPPLPP from the structure 1ABO of a tyrosine kinase Src homology domain 3 (18Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Peptides were docked over thrombin using 1PPB and 1HAH as templates and yielded 500 models that were ranked in terms of stereochemistry quality and lowest potential binding energies. Models containing a ligand with a root mean square deviation within 2 Å from one with a better rank were eliminated. We selected the best 10 models, extracted the ligand, and docked it over thrombin in 1PPB as a starting point. Water molecules and Na+ as defined in 1HAH and 1PPB were pooled and filtered for overlaps with thrombin or ligand atoms and added to the starting model. The backbone of thrombin secondary structures templated on 1PPB was kept frozen during simulated annealing applied by molecular dynamics in cartesian space (fast annealing from 50 to 600 K in 3 ps, slow cooling from 600 to 50 K over 10–30 ps with progressive constraint to bring back the thrombin backbone to the 1PPB reference). Models were sampled every 1 ps. About 300 models (10 starts and 30 samples per trajectory) were minimized (200 steepest descent, 1500 conjugate gradient cycles). All processes were performed with the force field CFF91 and Discover. Constraints were used to hold the Na+ coordination shell in place. The dielectric constant was set at 1 × r. Cutoffs were used to threshold noncovalent bonds at 14 Å during Monte Carlo processes and dynamics. Cutoffs were set to infinite during minimizations. Models of thrombin-substrate complexes with a root mean square deviation of less than 1.5 Å for the thrombin backbone and peptide residues less than 10 Å from the enzyme were considered acceptable. The stereochemistry of final conformations was systematically checked with Procheck 3.0 (19Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) to satisfy a quality expected for a 2.4-Å resolution model (the lowest resolution of the structures that we used as template). The solvent-accessible surface of thrombin was calculated according to the Connolly algorithm and rendered as a solid surface with InsightII using a 1.4-Å radius probe. Thrombin mutations were modeled with Biopolymer. Dihedral angles were explored with the Monte Carlo/Metropolis method for the main chains of the wild-type residue, its flanking residues, and the side chains of residues within 6 Å from the site of mutation. Minimizations were run in two steps with Discover using the force field CFF91 and keeping the constraints on the Na+ and its coordination shell. A steepest descent algorithm was applied over 300 cycles, followed by a conjugate gradient algorithm for as much as 1500 cycles. Thrombin sequences were selected from the nonredundant sequence data base (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) with the BLAST program (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and aligned with Clustal X (21Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar). Sequences of thrombin natural substrates were aligned according to the best model, threaded, and docked on the thrombin surface as described previously using one substrate fragment per orthologous group of sequences. Other orthologous sequences were aligned over the multialigned sequence core with Clustal X. The biggest fragment from fibrinogen crystallized with thrombin is the FpA (11Fenton J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 370: 468-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar, 13Sali A. Blundell T.L. J.

Lester C.C. DiBella E.E. Scheraga H.A. Proteins. 1999; 34: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hirugen peptides inhibit fibrinogen cleavage by binding to exosite I (16Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We used these peptides as templates to model Aα-(43–54). The three structures 1BBR, 1UCY, and 1HAH helped build the core27FLAEGGGVRGPRVVERHQSACKDSDWPF54 of the human Aα-(20–62) fragment. Equivalent positions of the human Aα-(20–62) residues are not visible in the crystal structure of the bovine fibrinogen Aα chain (5Brown J.H. Volkmann N. Jun G. Henschen-Edman A.H. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 8Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The first documented motif is a helix starting at position 63 according to the corresponding human chain numbering. The helix end is accessible to solvent, and we therefore assumed that the N-terminal fragment amino acids 1–62 folds in a way that is accessible to thrombin. The fragment is probably responsible for most of the interactions between fibrinogen and thrombin because Aα-(20–70), produced by the cyanogen bromide hydrolysis of fibrinogen, is as good a thrombin substrate as the entire fibrinogen (22Hageman T.C. Scheraga H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 164: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Hogg D.H. Blombäck B. Thromb. Res. 1974; 5: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We extended the templated peptide core to Aα-(20–62) and docked it on thrombin. The peptide is mainly in extended conformation with two short loops 28–33 (loop 1) and 39–48 (loop 2). The Aα chain fragment explores different portions of the thrombin surface (Fig. 1). Residues 20–25 interact with exosite II. Residues 26–38 fit into the active site. Residues 39–51 bind to the groove connecting the active site with exosite I, and residues 52–62 dock onto exosite I. The change in exposed surface area upon formation of the complex between thrombin and Aα-(20–62) is 3501 Å2 (25% of the thrombin surface), comparable to 3304 Å2 in the thrombin-hirudin interface (24Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Half of the contact area maps outside the region from the aryl binding site to the S3′ site framing the portion of substrate interacting with the active site. The relevant contacts of the Aα-(20–62)-thrombin complex are reported in Fig. 2 and are compared with those of the templates.Figure 2Bound fragments Aα-(20–57) (blue in A and B) and Bβ-(31–68) (magenta in C and D) displayed over the thrombin surface of the active site (A and C) and exosite I (B and D) and superimposed to the following peptides used as templates: DFLAEGGGVR from 1BBR (green in A), hirugen NGDFEELPEEYL from 1HAH (green in B and D), and LDPR from 1NRS (green in C). The root mean square deviations between the backbones of fragments Aα and Bβ relative to hirugen are 1.44 and 0.41 Å, respectively. Contacts with thrombin residues of less than 6 Å are listed in E for Aα-(20–57), Bβ-(31–68), and the templates LDPR and hirugen. Sequences in E are aligned according to the three-dimensional models of complexes. The positions of phosphate groups and disulfide bridges are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There is a site of phosphorylation in the human fibrinogen Aα chain at Aα-Ser22 that results in an intermediate showing higher specificity for thrombin (25Hanna L.S. Scheraga H.A. Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4681-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Analysis of the31P one-dimensional NMR spectral changes caused by the synthetic phosphorylated peptide Aα-(20–41) binding to thrombin suggests that this group contributed to binding (26Maurer M.C. Peng J.-L. An S.S. Trosset J.-Y. Henschen-Edman A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5888-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transferred nuclear Overhauser effect experiments locate the contact of this group to the vicinity of Arg175 of thrombin, in exosite II. The phosphate seems to stabilize the otherwise disordered residues Aα-(22–26) in their interaction with thrombin (26Maurer M.C. Peng J.-L. An S.S. Trosset J.-Y. Henschen-Edman A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5888-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The backbone structure of residues Aα-(22–35) of our model of the Aα-(20–62)-thrombin complex is superimposable to the bundle of NMR conformers proposed by Maurer et al. (26Maurer M.C. Peng J.-L. An S.S. Trosset J.-Y. Henschen-Edman A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5888-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our three-dimensional model suggests the interaction of the phosphate group within the pocket formed by the basic side chains of Arg165, Lys169, and Arg175. Aα-Asp21 interacts with Lys169, and Aα-Asp26 interacts with Arg97 to form ion pairs. The naturally occurring mutant fibrinogen Lille I (27Denninger M.H. Finlayson J.S. Reamer L.A. Parquet-Gernez A. Goudemand M. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 453-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) carries the substitution Aα-D26N and shows reduced clotting activity. The mutation should lead to breakage of this ion pair. Aα-Phe27 is framed by Trp215, Ile174, and Leu99 forming the aryl binding site (15Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and accounts for a major fraction of the binding specificity of fibrinogen toward thrombin. The Aα-F27Y mutant abrogates cleavage by thrombin in model peptides (28Lord S.T. Binnie C.G. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of thrombin complexed with the Aα chain carrying the F27Y mutation shows that the hydroxyl group of Aα-Tyr27 H-bonds to the nitrogen atom of Aα-Val34, fixing the aromatic ring of Aα-Tyr27 into a distorted position that pulls thrombin Trp215 1.4 Å higher and out of the aryl binding site (Fig. 3). This perturbation increases the solvent exposure of the hydrophobic surface of the entire aryl binding site. Similar perturbations of Trp215 have been shown to produce drastic (up to 500-fold) reductions in clotting activity (29Arosio D. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8095-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the steric hindrance introduced in the thrombin mutant L99Y skews the Aα-Phe27 side chain away from the Trp215 ring, explaining the 260-fold decrease in specificity for FpA release (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Aα-Val34 is in close contact with thrombin Y60a and W60d in the S2/S3 sites. Aα-Glu30 is ion-paired with Arg173, and the naturally occurring fibrinogen Mitaka II (30Niwa K. Yaginuma A. Nakanishi M. Wada Y. Sugo T. Asakura S. Watanabe N. Matsuda M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3658-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shows reduced clotting activity, presumably because of the loss of this ion pair. Aα-Arg35 is the P1 residue of fibrinogen and is engaged in the expected ion pair with Asp189 in the S1 pocket via its side chain and an H-bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser214 through its nitrogen atom (8Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Martin P.D. Robertson W. Turk D. Huber R. Bode W. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7911-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of this Arg to His (as in fibrinogen Petoskey I (31Higgins D.L. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12013-12017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or Cys (as in fibrinogen Metz I (32Soria J. Soria C. Samama M. Poirot E. Kling C. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1972; 27: 619-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) results in drastic or complete loss of clotting activity. Residues 31GGG33 are important for positioning Aα-Phe27 and Aα-Arg35 in their respective pockets. The mutation Aα-G31V in fibrinogen Rouen (33Menache D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) causes reduced clotting activity. The intervening Gly in this sequence makes a contact with the side chain of Glu217 through its carbonyl oxygen atom. Removal of this contact in the E217A mutant causes a significant loss of fibrinogen clotting (34Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M. Li W.X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Leung L.L.K. Nature. 1995; 378: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Removal of both this contact and the strong coupling with Trp215 in the aryl binding site in the double mutant W215A/E217A generates a thrombin mutant that has lost fibrinogen clotting, but retains activity toward the anticoagulant protein C (35Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The nitrogen atom of Aα-Gly33 H-bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly216. Residues Aα-Leu28 and Aα-Pro37 frame W60d. The Aα-P37L substitution in fibrinogen Kyoto II (36Yoshida N. Okuma M. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Blood. 1991; 78: 149-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has no effect on clotting. The model suggests that the Leu substitution can be accommodated well in the hydrophobic environment between Leu41 and W60d of thrombin. On the other hand, the W60dS mutant of thrombin shows a significant perturbation of fibrinogen clotting (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), consistent with a drastic disruption of the favorable hydrophobic interactions with Aα-Leu28 and Aα-Pro37 caused by the replacement of W60d with a polar side chain. Residue Aα-Arg38 makes a solvent-accessible ion pair with Glu39. The energetic contribution of this ion pair is modest because the E39A mutant of thrombin has clotting activity comparable to wild type (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the fibrinogen mutants Aα-R38S Detroit (38Blombäck M. Blombäck B. Mammen E.F. Prasad A.S. Nature. 1968; 218: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), Aα-R38G Aarhus (39Hessel B. Stenbjerg S. Dyr J. Kudryk B. Therkildsen L. Blombäck B. Thromb. Res. 1986; 42: 21-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and Aα-R38N Munich (40Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have normal or slightly reduced clotting activity. The Aα and Bβ chains have a loop segment between the anchor positioned into the S1 pocket and the region binding to exosite I. Within this loop, Aα-Cys47 is exposed to solvent in the Aα-(20–62)-thrombin complex and is available for a disulfide bridge with Aα-Cys47 from the second Aα chain of the fibrinogen dimer. Aα-Asp51 is ion-paired with Arg67 in exosite I. The mutation R67A equally affects FpA and FpB release (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although there is no residue in the Bβ chain available for an ion pair with Arg67. That suggests that the loss of thrombin activity toward the Aα and Bβ chains is due to perturbation of the buried ion-pair quartet involving Arg67, Lys70, Glu77, and Glu80, which holds the 70-loop and the all important residue Tyr76 in their correct conformation (15Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Indeed, the mutants R67A, K70A, E77A, and E80A alter the kinetics of FpA and FpB release drastically and to the same extent (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), even though Lys70 and Glu80 do not contact the Aα or Bβ chains. Furthermore, the effect of these mutations is practically identical to that caused by the Y76A mutation (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of the buried quartet is to orient Tyr76 on the surface of the 70-loop for optimal interaction with fibrinogen. The sequence 52WPF54 of the Aα chain frames residue Tyr76 making a hydrophobic cluster with Leu65 and Ile82. Aα-Pro53 kinks the Aα chain into exosite I and enables optimal clipping of Tyr76 by the flanking aromatic residues. Other contacts made by residues of the Aα chain in this region are energetically dispensable. The sequence 57DED59of the Aα chain, also present in PAR1 as 58DEE60 (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), makes ion pairs with Lys81 and Lys110 through Aα-Asp57, and with R77a through Aα-Glu58. However, the K81A, K110A, and R77aA mutations have little effect on the release of fibrinopeptides (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, the side chains of Aα-Cys55 and Aα-Cys65 are accessible to solvent and available for disulfide bridging. The peptide Bβ-(31–148) produced by cyanogen bromide hydrolysis is not as good a substrate as the entire Bβ chain (41Hageman T.C. Scheraga H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We templated the conformation of41FSAR44 of the Bβ chain by homology with the peptide LDPR complexed with thrombin in 1NRS (17Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii N. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The Bβ chain also shows a highly conserved proline-rich region in the range of contact with thrombin. The structures of LDPR-hirugen-thrombin 1NRS (17Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii N. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), hirugen-thrombin 1HAH (16Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and APTMPPPLPP bound to the SH3 domain 1ABO (18Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) were used to build the core41FSARGHRPLDKKREEAPSLRPAPPP65 of the human Bβ chain fragment. We extended the peptide over its two ends to make a three-dimensional model of the fragment Bβ-(31–72) bound to thrombin. This portion of the Bβ chain is not visible in the available crystal structures (5Brown J.H. Volkmann N. Jun G. Henschen-Edman A.H. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Madrazo J. Brown J.H. Litvinovich S. Dominguez R. Yakovlev S. Medved L. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11967-11972Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The first motif visible is a helix starting at position 77 in the corresponding human chain numbering. As for the Aα chain, the Bβ chain makes contact with an extended surface of thrombin (Fig. 1). Residues 31–39 contact exosite II. Residues 40–47 bind to the active site. Residues 47–55 dock into the groove connecting the active site to exosite I, and residues 56–72 interact with exosite I. The change in exposed surface area when fragment Bβ-(31–72) binds to thrombin is 3901 Å2 (28% of the thrombin surface), a value that exceeds that of the Aα-(20–62)-thrombin complex by 11%. As much as 60% of the contact surface is located outside of the subsites from the aryl binding site to S3′. The relevant contacts for the Bβ-(31–72)-thrombin complex are reported in Fig. 2 and compared with those of the templates. The terminal amine and Bβ-Gly32 amide hydrogen interact with the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp178. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of Bβ-Gln31 interact with the guanidinium group of Arg175. Bβ-Asp35 interacts with Lys169. Bβ-Glu37 superimposes with Aα-Glu30 and makes a water-accessible ion pair with Arg173, whereas Bβ-Glu38 forms a solvent-accessible ion pair with Arg97. As for the Aα chain, these interactions involve solvent-exposed residues and are expected to be energetically dispensable. In the active site region, Bβ-Phe41 superimposes well with Aα-Phe27 and fits in the aryl binding site formed by Trp215, Ile174, and Leu99. Mutations of Trp215 or Leu99 have a drastic impact on the release of FpB (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of this favorable hydrophobic interaction. The side chain of Bβ-Phe40 superimposes with Aα-Leu28 and is in close contact with Y60a and W60d in the hydrophobic cluster acting as a lid over the S1 pocket. Mutation of W60d greatly affects the release of FpB (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Bβ-Arg44 is embedded into the S1 pocket with its side chain ion-paired with Asp189 and its nitrogen atom H-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser214. Mutation of this Arg to Cys, as in fibrinogen Ijmuiden (42Koopman J. Haverkate F. Grimbergen J. Engesser L. Novakova I. Kerst A.F. Lord S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), abrogates FpB release as expected. The Gly residue in P1′ is conserved in all Aα and Bβ chains and comes into contact with Gly193. The P1′ Gly is replaced by Cys in fibrinogen Ise (36Yoshida N. Okuma M. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Blood. 1991; 78: 149-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leading to a reduction in clotting activity. The Bβ-His46 heterocycle at P2′ is staked against W60d as are residues Phe43 in PAR1, Phe40 in PAR3, and Tyr49 in PAR4 (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Residue Bβ-Arg47 at the P3′ position makes a solvent-exposed ion pair with Glu39, whose energetic contribution to recognition is dispensable in view of the properties of the E39A mutant (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unlike the Aα chain, the Bβ chain does not possess an exposed Cys available for disulfide bridging in the sequence upstream to the fragment that makes contact with exosite I. The carbonyl oxygen atom of Bβ-Pro60 interacts weakly with the nitrogen atom of Arg67 in exosite I. As for the Aα chain, the loss of the buried quartet involving Arg67, Lys70, Glu77, and Glu80 is responsible for the loss of specificity toward the Bβ chain in the R67A, K70A, or E80A mutations (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Bβ chain lacks aromatic groups around Bβ-Pro63, unlike the Aα chain. Bβ-Pro58and Bβ-Pro61 frame Phe34, and Bβ-Pro63, Bβ-Pro64, and Bβ-Pro65 cage Tyr76 in a face-to-face or face-to-edge orientation. Bβ-Leu59 points into the hydrophobic cluster formed by Leu65, Tyr76, and Ile82. The crucial involvement of Tyr76 in all of these interactions explains why the mutation Y76A has a drastic effect on the release of FpB, as seen for the release of FpA (3Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Residues of the Bβ chain further downstream do not make relevant contacts with the thrombin surface, except for the carbonyl oxygen atom of Bβ-Ile66 and the hydroxyl of Bβ-Ser67that H-bond to the charged amine of Lys81. The sequence66ISGGG70 is absolutely conserved in all Bβ chains among different species. Of these residues, Bβ-Tyr71 clusters with Phe114, and Bβ-Arg72 ion-pairs with Asp116. The three-dimensional models of thrombin bound to fragments of the human fibrinogen Aα and Bβ chains are consistent with available data on site-directed mutagenesis of thrombin and with the phenotype observed with several naturally occurring mutants of fibrinogen. These models also make it possible to align the sequences of fibrinogens from other species and other thrombin natural substrates around their cleavage site. The alignment (Fig. 4) suggests a pattern of recognition by thrombin that applies generally to other natural substrates. The loops 1 and 2 fix the docking into the active site and groove region. In the case of the fibrinogen Aα chain, loop 2 also provides room for the disulfide bridge with the homologous Aα chain via Aα-Cys47. Acidic residues are frequently found in the region of the unprimed sites that bind to exosite II. A hydrophobic/aromatic residue fills systematically the aryl binding site as documented in the crystal structures of thrombin bound to FpA (8Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Martin P.D. Robertson W. Turk D. Huber R. Bode W. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7911-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or PAR1 (17Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii N. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic side chain often precedes the residue bound to the aryl binding site (see for example the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen). The added hydrophobicity from this side chain provides optimal packing against the aromatic moiety of W60d. In the primed sites the P2′ position is often occupied by Phe, Tyr, His, or Pro (noted φ in Fig. 4) to frame the ring of W60d in sandwich with a Pro often found in the P2 position. Furthermore, a Pro residue is often located downstream of the site of cleavage in a position to contact exosite I and appears to be highly conserved among all thrombin substrates, with the exception of factor V, factor XIII, and TAFI. The role of this Pro (residue 53 in the case of the Aα chain) is to kink the substrate backbone into exosite I at the thrombin surface. Hydrophobic/aromatic residues often flank this Pro (e.g. Aα chain, PAR3, and factor XI), and the Aα-(20–60)-thrombin model indicates that the role of this aromatic-Pro-aromatic triplet is to cage Tyr76 for optimal bridge binding of exosite I and the active site. There are 838 examples of aromatic-Pro-aromatic triplets in the protein data bank. 20% of the examples show the aromatic residues pointing in the same direction, and caging another aromatic side chain in 5% of the cases. Interestingly, a screening of all sequences in the S1 family of serine proteases shows the presence of a Pro residue located 13 residues downstream from the activation cleavage site in 83% of the cases (the Pro is at position 27 with the standard chymotrypsin numbering). The origin of this conservation is unclear, although the analogy with thrombin substrates discussed above should draw attention to a possible “universal” role of this residue in optimizing the alignment of unprimed residues of substrate for cleavage by the target protease. Site-directed mutagenesis of this conserved Pro in different systems will be necessary to test this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985018756,"The fluorescein derivative phloxine B is a potent modulator of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Low micromolar concentrations of phloxine B stimulate CFTR Cl(-) currents, whereas higher concentrations of the drug inhibit CFTR. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of phloxine B. Phloxine B (1 microm) stimulated wild-type CFTR and the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, DeltaF508, by increasing the open probability of phosphorylated CFTR Cl(-) channels. At each concentration of ATP tested, the drug slowed the rate of channel closure without altering the opening rate. Based on the effects of fluorescein derivatives on transport ATPases, these data suggest that phloxine B might stimulate CFTR by binding to the ATP-binding site of the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2) to slow the dissociation of ATP from NBD1. Channel block by phloxine B (40 microm) was voltage-dependent, enhanced when external Cl(-) concentration was reduced and unaffected by ATP (5 mm), suggesting that phloxine B inhibits CFTR by occluding the pore. We conclude that phloxine B interacts directly with CFTR at multiple sites to modulate channel activity. It or related agents might be of value in the development of new treatments for diseases caused by the malfunction of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2092923100,"Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) is a broad-spectrum flavoprotein inhibitor commonly used to inhibit oxidant production by the NADPH oxidase of phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells. A previous study has shown that DPI can sensitize T24 bladder carcinoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. We observed DPI to deplete intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) in T24 cells and a range of other primary and transformed cell types. The effect was immediate, with 50% loss of intracellular GSH within 2 h of treatment with DPI. The glutathione was quantitatively recovered in the extracellular medium, indicating that efflux was occurring. The loss of GSH was blocked with bromosulfophthalein, an inhibitor of the canalicular GSH transporters. We conclude that DPI induces a dramatic efflux of cellular GSH from T24 cells via a specific transport channel. This provides a potential mechanism for its proapoptotic effect, and it also has important implications for the regulation of glutathione homeostasis in cells.

In tumor cells, down-regulation of signaling through Fas has been implicated in tumorigenesis by promoting cell survival and enabling evasion of cytotoxic T cells and in resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment (17Owen-Schaub L.B.

The ability of DPI to sensitize cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis argues for some form of redox regulation. The observations of persistent oxidative stress in tumor cells (26Toyokuni S. Okamoto K. Yodoi J. Hiai H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 27Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar), combined with the sensitivity of caspases to oxidative inactivation (29Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), raised the possibility of a DPI-sensitive NADPH oxidase blocking apoptosis in resistant cells. Reduced glutathione (GSH) is an important intracellular redox buffer that can be oxidized to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and protein mixed disulfides and is in part responsible for the maintenance of protein thiols in a reduced state (30Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 31Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Total intracellular glutathione levels are under dynamic control. There is a continual efflux of GSH from cells, followed by its extracellular degradation, uptake of cysteine-containing precursors, and subsequent resynthesis (32Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969s-1975sPubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of GSH synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine depletes cells of GSH over several hours (31Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). We measured GSH and GSSG levels before and after treatment with DPI and anti-Fas antibody to determine if the switch in sensitivity to Fas is associated with changes in the glutathione redox couple in T24 cells. To our surprise, we found that DPI triggered rapid GSH efflux, with >50% loss over 2 h. This provides a potential mechanism for its proapoptotic effect, and it also has important implications for the regulation of glutathione homeostasis in cells. Human anti-Fas IgM (clone CH-11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The glutathione transport inhibitor dibromosulfophthalein (DBSP) was purchased from Société d'Études et de Recherches Biologiques (Paris, France), and the caspase substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) was purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). l-Methionine, dansyl chloride, DPI, and bromosulfophthalein (BSP) were from Sigma Chemical Co. Cell culture materials were from Invitrogen New Zealand Ltd. The T24 bladder carcinoma and Jurkat T lymphocyte cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T24 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated from umbilical cords by collagenase digestion (33Jaffe E. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6011) Google Scholar) and cultured in Medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml heparin, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor, 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin on fibronectin-cultured plates (34Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were isolated from human infant foreskins and cultured in minimum essential medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (35Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All cell types were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Plasma membrane integrity was monitored using trypan blue staining. T24 cells were harvested from culture dishes using a trypsin/EDTA solution, and cells were resuspended in 0.2% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. Trypan blue-positive cells were expressed as a percentage of the total number of counted cells. The measurement of DEVD-AMC cleavage was modified from Nicholson et al. (36Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and stored as cell pellets at –80 °C. Immediately before assaying, the pellets were thawed by the addition of 100 μl of buffer (100 mmHEPES, 10% sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10−4% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% CHAPS at pH 7.25) containing 50 μm DEVD-AMC. The rate of release of fluorescent AMC was monitored at 37 °C (excitation, 370 nm; emission, 445 nm), and the amount of AMC liberated was calculated from a standard curve generated with the free compound. Cellular GSH and GSSG levels were measured by HPLC after derivatization with dansyl chloride as modified from Martin and White (37Martin J. White I.N.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 568: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In brief, the supernatant was removed, adherent cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysis buffer and iodoacetate were added. The cell samples were then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, the pH was corrected to pH 8–8.5 with lithium hydroxide, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. An equal volume of 4 mg/ml dansyl chloride was added, and the extracts were left in the dark for 60 min. Samples were then extracted in chloroform and kept at 4 °C until HPLC analysis. Cell supernatants were derivatized as described above, except that a 2× concentration of lysis buffer was used. To quantitatively measure GSH in the medium, the cell supernatant was incubated with 500 μm DTT for 10 min before the derivatization procedure. HPLC analysis was performed as described previously (37Martin J. White I.N.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 568: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). T24 cells are one of the many cell lines known to be resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis, despite surface expression of the receptor. As shown previously (9Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), pretreatment of T24 cells with the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI sensitized these cells to anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 1). Whereas the antibody or DPI alone had little effect on the cells, characteristic apoptotic changes were detectable within 6 h of a combination treatment. Cells were detaching from the plate, and extensive membrane blebbing was evident. Caspase-3-like activity was increased 6-fold above control levels, indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 1). By 24 h, >60% of these cells were unable to exclude trypan blue (Fig. 1). DPI was equally effective at causing cell death when added concurrently or 2 h after the addition of anti-Fas antibody and also when it was present for 1 h and then washed away before antibody addition (Fig. 1). To determine whether DPI affected the redox balance of the cells, we measured intracellular GSH and GSSG levels using the dansyl chloride HPLC assay. To our surprise, we observed a rapid depletion of intracellular GSH in the DPI-treated T24 cells (Fig. 2). The loss was apparent within 30 min of adding 10 μm DPI. After 2 h of treatment, GSH levels had dropped to 47 ± 10% (S.D.; n = 9) of the control value, and after 4 h only 29 ± 6% (S.D.; n = 5) of the GSH remained in the cells (Fig. 3). Concurrent with the loss in cellular GSH, GSSG levels also dropped after incubation with DPI (Fig. 2, inset). Two h of treatment decreased T24 GSSG levels to 42 ± 12% (S.D.; n = 11) of control, and 4 h of treatment with DPI decreased T24 GSSG levels to 27 ± 12% (S.D.; n = 5). Whereas the direct GSSG/GSH ratio remained constant, GSH levels are squared when calculating the glutathione redox couple; therefore, we would predict a more oxidizing intracellular environment. Determination of the absolute reduction potential is dependent on the cell volume, but by substituting the percentage losses in GSH and GSSG into the Nernst equation (38Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar), we calculated that DPI would cause a loss in reduction potential of 9 mV at 2 h and 16 mV at 4 h. 2At 2 h, GSH and GSSG levels were 47% and 42% of control, respectively. Substitution into the Nernst equation (−240 − (61.5/2) × log (0.472/0.42)) generates a loss in reduction potential of 9 mV. This calculation is independent of the initial reduction potential but dependent on the cell volume remaining constant.Figure 3Time course of GSH loss with DPI treatment. T24 cells were transferred to fresh media for 1 h and then incubated with DPI (10 μm) and anti-Fas antibody (0.25 μg/ml) for up to 4 h as indicated (control, ●; DPI, ▴; Fas, ▪; DPI and Fas added concurrently, ○) and 1 h with DPI, followed by 1 h in fresh media (▵). GSH levels are expressed in nanomoles/well, with each 15-mm well containing ∼140,000 cells and 40 μg of protein, and are duplicate determinations from one of three representative experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The anti-Fas antibody itself had a minimal effect on the GSH levels (Fig. 3). When DPI was present for 1 h and then washed away, and the cells were incubated for an additional hour in fresh media, GSH levels were almost identical to those in cells that had been exposed to DPI for the entire 2-h period (Fig. 3), indicating that GSH continued to decrease after DPI removal. This correlates with the ability of DPI pretreatment and removal to sensitize the cells to apoptosis (Fig. 1). Treatment with increasing concentrations of DPI caused a dose-dependent loss in cellular GSH, giving an IC50 of ∼3 μm (Fig. 4). This compares with the 0.5 μm DPI observed for inhibition of superoxide production by the neutrophil NADPH oxidase (39Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the DPI-induced GSH loss is specific to T24 cells, we measured GSH levels in Jurkat T lymphocytes and in primary cultures of endothelial cells and fibroblasts after exposure to DPI. All cell types suffered a progressive loss in intracellular GSH after DPI treatment, with untreated cells either maintaining or increasing their GSH levels over the 4-h period (Fig. 5). Thus, DPI induces a rapid depletion of the glutathione pool in both primary and transformed cells, suggesting a common target in these cell types. We collected the extracellular medium of DPI-treated T24 cells to determine whether glutathione had been exported from the cells. A marked increase in the area of a new peak with a retention time of ∼7 min was observed (Fig. 6A). Due to a large excess of cystine in the medium, any GSH present extracellularly is likely to react via thiol-disulfide exchange to form a GSH-cysteine mixed disulfide (40Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the unknown peak was the mixed disulfide, the products of the reaction between GSH and cystine were also analyzed by HPLC. The major peak of this reaction eluted at the same time as the unknown peak, and when the extracellular medium was incubated with DTT before the derivatization procedure, the disulfide peak disappeared, and GSH was detected (data not shown). Quantification of extracellular levels after reduction with DTT showed that almost all of the GSH lost from the DPI-treated cells was recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 7).Figure 7Intracellular and extracellular GSH levels in T24 cells. Cells were incubated in fresh media for 1 h, and then DPI (10 μm), acivicin (125 μm), buthionine sulfoximine (25 μm), or cystine-free medium was added, or the cells were left untreated. After 4 h, the media were removed, reduced with 500 μm DTT for 10 min, and both the intracellular fraction (▪) and the extracellular medium (■) were derivatized with dansyl chloride. Results are expressed as a percentage of the total GSH in control cells and are the mean ± S.D. of three to five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is possible that GSSG could be exported from the cells and react with any trace cysteine present to give the mixed disulfide. Addition of GSSG to DMEM produced some of the mixed disulfide, but a significant amount of the GSSG remained after 3 h (Fig. 6B). The absence of GSSG in the extracellular medium of DPI-treated cells (Fig. 6A) argues against the export of the oxidized species. The experiments were also repeated in cystine-free media to prevent conversion to the mixed disulfide, therefore trapping the exported glutathione in its original form. After 3 h of treatment with DPI, both GSH and GSSG were detected in the extracellular medium (Fig. 6C). However, the majority of the GSSG is likely to have come from oxidation of exported GSH because the addition of GSH to cystine-free medium resulted in a substantial conversion to GSSG over a similar incubation period (Fig. 6C). Therefore, although we cannot exclude some of the glutathione being exported from the cells as GSSG, the principal exported species appears to be GSH. Because cells export and recycle GSH, extracellular accumulation could occur as a result of impaired uptake and resynthesis rather than increased efflux. To differentiate between these possibilities, we measured both intracellular and extracellular GSH in the presence of various inhibitors of GSH metabolism and compared their effects with that of DPI. Buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of GSH synthesis, and acivicin, an inhibitor of the enzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase involved in recycling extracellular GSH, both decreased T24 GSH levels by ∼30% over a 4-h period (Fig. 7). This was considerably slower than DPI, whereas adding both together lowered GSH to a level approaching that of DPI. However, neither caused the accumulation of extracellular GSH. Incubation of T24 cells in cystine-free medium, which will impair both new synthesis and the recycling pathways, induced a rapid drop in intracellular GSH similar to that of DPI. However, there was again no corresponding increase in GSH in the cell supernatant, indicating a different mode of action than DPI (Fig. 7). Unlike DPI, incubation with buthionine sulfoximine, acivicin, and cystine-free medium all resulted in a loss in the total GSH levels (Fig. 7). We conclude that DPI decreases intracellular GSH levels by enhancing the rate of GSH efflux rather than by inhibiting precursor uptake or biosynthesis. GSH transport has been studied almost exclusively in hepatocytes, with GSH carrier systems described in both the sinusoidal and the canalicular membranes, mediating release of GSH into the blood and the bile, respectively (41Fernandez-Checa J.C. Takikawa H. Horie T. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1667-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol.

Kaplowitz N. Kempner E.S. Ookhtens M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that these same transporters exist in the plasma membrane of other mammalian cells (45Lu S.C. Sun W.M. Nagineni C.N. Hooks J.J. Kannan R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2523-2530PubMed Google Scholar,46Lu S.C. Sun W.M., Yi, J. Ookhtens M. Sze G. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When T24 cells were incubated with DPI andl-methionine, an inhibitor of the low affinity sinusoidal GSH transporter (47Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9355-9358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G354-G361PubMed Google Scholar), the extent of intracellular GSH loss was the same as that with DPI alone, suggesting that this carrier was not responsible for the observed efflux (Fig. 8). BSP prevents GSH efflux from the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, inhibiting both the high and low affinity transport components (42Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ballatori N. Clarkson T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G238-G245PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of BSP alone to T24 cells resulted in some loss of intracellular GSH, probably because BSP is a substrate for the glutathione S-transferases (50Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cells were treated with BSP together with DPI, a concentration-dependent reduction in the DPI-induced GSH loss was observed (Fig. 8). Notably, 1 mm BSP prevented the DPI-induced GSH loss completely, maintaining intracellular GSH at the same levels as BSP alone. An analogue, DBSP, also dose-dependently reduced the DPI-mediated GSH loss, with complete inhibition occurring at 4 mm. However, it also lowered T24 GSH levels (Fig. 8). These results strongly suggest that a BSP- and DBSP-sensitive carrier, probably one of the canalicular-like transporters, is mediating the DPI-induced efflux of GSH out of T24 cells. Because BSP and DBSP lower intracellular GSH levels themselves, and they also enhance Fas-mediated apoptosis (data not shown), we were unable to use them to test whether DPI still sensitizes T24 cells to apoptosis when GSH efflux is prevented. We have discovered that the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI causes a rapid loss of intracellular GSH from cultured cells, with the missing GSH recovered outside of the viable cell. This phenomenon was not cell type-specific because it was observed in all the primary and transformed cell types tested. The turnover of cellular glutathione is well characterized, and GSH efflux is an integral component of this pathway (Fig. 9) (32Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969s-1975sPubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the rate of GSH efflux is susceptible to modulation. Indeed, efflux can be increased to such an extent that it outpaces the capacity of the cell for resynthesis and leads to severe depletion of intracellular GSH within a few hours. The increased GSH efflux was prevented by inhibitors of the canalicular GSH transporters, indicating a specific efflux mechanism. GSH transporters involved in extrusion of the tripeptide are poorly characterized and remain difficult to clone, and there is a general reliance on inhibitor studies to distinguish their activity (43Mittur A.V. Kaplowitz N. Kempner E.S. Ookhtens M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G923-G930PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mittur A.V. Kaplowitz N. Kempner E.S. Ookhtens M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The concentration at which BSP inhibited efflux favors the low affinity canalicular transport component as being the transporter responsible for DPI-induced GSH loss. Higher concentrations are required to inhibit it compared with the high affinity form (42Ballatori N. Dutczak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not even definitive whether the two are different proteins. We do not know how DPI is triggering GSH efflux. A DPI-sensitive flavoprotein may directly regulate the activity of a GSH transporter or associated regulatory proteins. Alternatively, a cell might respond to general metabolic changes upon treatment with DPI, such as an accumulation of NAD(P)H, by increasing the rate of GSH efflux. We are able to exclude two alternate mechanisms. Firstly, increased amounts of DPI did not further increase the rate of GSH loss from the cells, indicating that a direct conjugation reaction was not responsible for GSH loss. Also, DPI could have acted by inhibiting glutathione reductase, leading to the formation of GSSG and its export. We could not detect evidence of significant GSSG formation inside or outside of the cells, and the glutathione reductase inhibitor bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea had no effect on GSH levels (data not shown). The ability of DPI to lower intracellular GSH levels provides a feasible but as yet unproven mechanism for its ability to sensitize T24 cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. A depletion of intracellular GSH has been described in a number of different apoptotic systems (51Fernandez A. Kiefer J. Fosdick L. McConkey D.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5133-5139PubMed Google Scholar, 52Macho A. Hirsch T. Marzo I. Marchetti P. Dallaporta B. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J.

Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), with several studies showing that GSH loss in cells undergoing apoptosis is the result of accelerated efflux rather than depletion by oxidation (54van den Dobbelsteen D.J.

Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody, GSH efflux occurred via a specific membrane channel, the low affinity canalicular-like transporter, and the efflux was a downstream event dependent on caspase activation (54van den Dobbelsteen D.J.

In contrast, others have shown that U937 cells and HepG2 cells induced to undergo apoptosis with puromycin efflux intracellular GSH, that the extrusion precedes other apoptotic changes, and that maintenance of GSH was able to delay apoptosis (55Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The results are not necessarily in direct conflict. It may be that efflux of GSH is a common process in apoptotic cells but that in some cell types, the loss of GSH is required early to allow successful induction of the apoptotic program. It is also of interest that the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is linked to changes in GSH metabolism in cells, in particular, a shift in the cellular redox state toward a more reduced environment (56Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Park S.M. Holleran A.L. Murphy A.N. Fiskum G. Kane D.J. Testa M.P. Kayalar C. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), increased intracellular GSH, altered compartmentalization, and even modulation of GSH efflux pathways (57Mirkovic N.

In our model, the time course of GSH efflux is consistent with sensitization, as is the ability to remove the DPI before activation of the Fas pathway and still see GSH efflux and sensitization. At this point, however, GSH efflux is associated with rather than responsible for the sensitization of T24 cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. A crucial test of this hypothesis is to prevent GSH efflux and see if DPI still sensitizes the cells to apoptosis. Unfortunately, the transport inhibitors also depleted intracellular GSH, and they enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis themselves. It will be important to identify the target of DPI and elucidate the pathways involved in controlling GSH efflux, so that more selective compounds and/or molecular approaches can be used to determine the role of DPI in sensitizing the tumor cells to apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2023607888,"Ribotoxins are a family of highly specific fungal ribonucleases that inactivate the ribosomes by hydrolysis of a single phosphodiester bond of the 28 S rRNA. α-Sarcin, the best characterized member of this family, is a potent cytotoxin that promotes apoptosis of human tumor cells after internalization via endocytosis. This latter ability is related to its interaction with phospholipid bilayers. These proteins share a common structural core with nontoxic ribonucleases of the RNase T1 family. However, significant structural differences between these two groups of proteins are related to the presence of a long amino-terminal β-hairpin in ribotoxins and to the different length of their unstructured loops. The amino-terminal deletion mutant Δ(7–22) of α-sarcin has been produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. It retains the same conformation as the wild-type protein as ascertained by complete spectroscopic characterization based on circular dichroism, fluorescence, and NMR techniques. This mutant exhibits ribonuclease activity against naked rRNA and synthetic substrates but lacks the specific ability of the wild-type protein to degrade rRNA in intact ribosomes. The results indicate that α-sarcin interacts with the ribosome at two regions, i.e. the well known sarcin-ricin loop of the rRNA and a different region recognized by the β-hairpin of the protein. In addition, this latter protein portion is involved in interaction with cell membranes. The mutant displays decreased interaction with lipid vesicles and shows behavior compatible with the absence of one vesicle-interacting region. In agreement with this conclusion, the deletion mutant exhibits a very low cytotoxicity on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Ribotoxins are a family of highly specific fungal ribonucleases that inactivate the ribosomes by hydrolysis of a single phosphodiester bond of the 28 S rRNA. α-Sarcin, the best characterized member of this family, is a potent cytotoxin that promotes apoptosis of human tumor cells after internalization via endocytosis. This latter ability is related to its interaction with phospholipid bilayers. These proteins share a common structural core with nontoxic ribonucleases of the RNase T1 family. However, significant structural differences between these two groups of proteins are related to the presence of a long amino-terminal β-hairpin in ribotoxins and to the different length of their unstructured loops. The amino-terminal deletion mutant Δ(7–22) of α-sarcin has been produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. It retains the same conformation as the wild-type protein as ascertained by complete spectroscopic characterization based on circular dichroism, fluorescence, and NMR techniques. This mutant exhibits ribonuclease activity against naked rRNA and synthetic substrates but lacks the specific ability of the wild-type protein to degrade rRNA in intact ribosomes. The results indicate that α-sarcin interacts with the ribosome at two regions, i.e. the well known sarcin-ricin loop of the rRNA and a different region recognized by the β-hairpin of the protein. In addition, this latter protein portion is involved in interaction with cell membranes. The mutant displays decreased interaction with lipid vesicles and shows behavior compatible with the absence of one vesicle-interacting region. In agreement with this conclusion, the deletion mutant exhibits a very low cytotoxicity on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Fungal extracellular ribonucleases are a diverse group of proteins, with RNase T1 being its best known representative (1Steyaert J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). They show different substrate specificity, but most of them degrade RNA in a nonspecific manner. However, among this group of RNases, there is a family displaying an exquisite specificity because they are capable of cleaving a single phosphodiester bond of those present in the ribosome. These enzymes are named ribotoxins (2Lamy B. Davies J. Schindler D. Genetically Engineered Toxins. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 237-257Google Scholar), and their target bond is located in the larger rRNA at a sequence known as the sarcin-ricin loop conserved in all prokaryota and eukaryota (3Correl C.C. Munishkin A. Chan Y.L. Ren Z. Wool I.G. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13436-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Correll C.C. Wool I.G. Munishkin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This cleavage releases a characteristic oligonucleotide, the α-fragment (the oligonucleotide released from the 3′ end of the 28 S rRNA in the large ribosomal subunit by the action of α-sarcin). As a result ribosomes are inactivated, and protein biosynthesis is inhibited (5Schindler D.G. Davies J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,6Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9054-9060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), placing ribotoxins among the most potent inhibitors of translation (2Lamy B. Davies J. Schindler D. Genetically Engineered Toxins. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 237-257Google Scholar, 7Kao R. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Crameri R. Davies J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, ribotoxins are cytotoxic proteins because they are able to gain entry into some cells (8Turnay J. Olmo N. Jiménez J. Lizarbe M.A. Gavilanes J.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 122: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Olmo N. Turnay J. González de Buitrago G. López de Silanes I. Gavilanes J.G. Lizarbe M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The best characterized member of this family of highly specific RNases is α-sarcin, which is a single polypeptide chain protein composed of 150 amino acid residues and secreted by the mold Aspergillus giganteus (10Olson B.H. Goerner G.L. Applied Microbiol. 1965; 13: 314-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sacco G. Drickamer K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5811-5818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ribotoxin has been shown to be cytotoxic for many human tumor cells (8Turnay J. Olmo N. Jiménez J. Lizarbe M.A. Gavilanes J.G. Mol. Cell.

López de Silanes I. Gavilanes J.G. Lizarbe M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Endocytosis is the mechanism responsible for the cell internalization of α-sarcin (9Olmo N. Turnay J. González de Buitrago G. López de Silanes I. Gavilanes J.G. Lizarbe M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which is probably related to its ability to interact with phospholipid bilayers (12Gasset M. Martı́nez del Pozo A.

Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), another member of the ribotoxin family, have been solved. This information has revealed that ribotoxins share a common structural core with the family of fungal extracellular nontoxic RNases, represented by RNase T1 (1Steyaert J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), composed of a central antiparallel β-sheet packed against a small α-helix and a conserved active site located on the other side (see Fig. 1). Although proteins from the RNase T1 family display a low degree of sequence similarity with ribotoxins, RNase U2 is the member more closely related to α-sarcin (11Sacco G. Drickamer K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5811-5818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mancheño J.M. Gasset M. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This RNase is a nontoxic protein secreted by the smut fungus Ustilago sphaerogena and composed of a single polypeptide chain of 104 amino acid residues (20Yoshida H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whereas α-sarcin, a basic protein (pI > 8) (11Sacco G. Drickamer K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5811-5818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hydrolyzes a single bond in ribosomal RNA and interacts with membranes, RNase U2, a highly acidic protein (pI = ∼3) (21Satto S. Uchida T. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Kanaya S. Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 681-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), causes extensive degradation of the RNA but does not interact with lipid bilayers and is not cytotoxic (23Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Garcı́a-Ortega L. Kao R. Lacadena J. Oñaderra M. Mancheño J.M. Davies J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both share a common three-dimensional structure pattern (17Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Santoro J. Campos-Olivas R. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. Bruix M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15583-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In vitro assays have revealed that nanomolar concentrations of α-sarcin result in the specific hydrolysis of the large rRNA or a synthetic oligoribonucleotide mimicking the SRL (25Endo Y. Glück A. Chan Y.-L. Tsurugi K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2216-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but micromolar concentrations result in a less specific cleavage of the substrates (25Endo Y. Glück A. Chan Y.-L. Tsurugi K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2216-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing only a preference for the 3′-side of purines. α-Sarcin can also cleave A/GpA dinucleotides, although with low specific activity (26Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Lacadena V. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A.

RNase U2 displays a low specificity beyond a strong preference for 3′-linked purine nucleotide phosphodiester bonds (A > G ≫ C > U) (29Rushizky G.W. Mozejko J.H. Rogerson D.J., Jr. Sober H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Uchida T. Egami F. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1971: 205-250Google Scholar). Both proteins, α-sarcin and RNase U2, are cyclizing RNases because they produce a 2′,3′-cyclic intermediate as a result of the cleavage reaction (26Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Lacadena V. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Uchida T. Egami F. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1971: 205-250Google Scholar). However, the catalytic efficiency of RNase U2 against naked RNA, homopolynucleotides, or dinucleotides is several orders of magnitude higher (26Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Lacadena V. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Uchida T. Egami F. The Enzymes.

Lett. 2000; 189: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, α-sarcin specifically cleaves a phosphodiester bond in ribosomes, whereas RNase U2 causes extensive digestion of the RNA and is a more efficient ribonucleolytic enzyme. It is therefore of interest to find out which portions of α-sarcin, absent in related fungal RNases, account for its ribonuclease specificity and cytotoxicity. Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of RNase U2 and α-sarcin (17Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Santoro J. Campos-Olivas R. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. Bruix M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Noguchi S. Satow Y. Uchida T. Sasaki C. Matsuzaki T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15583-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reveals that the greatest differences are present in both the unstructured loops and the amino-terminal region (see Fig. 1). In α-sarcin there is a NH2-terminal β-hairpin (residues 1–26) that forms a solvent exposed protuberance and shows a complex topology that can be considered as two consecutive minor β-sheets connected by a hinge region (17Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Santoro J. Campos-Olivas R. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. Bruix M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The second minor β-sheet of this amino-terminal hairpin is composed of two short strands (Asp9–Asn12 and Lys17–Thr20) connected by a type I β-turn (Pro13–Asn16). This structural component is absent in RNase U2 (see Fig. 1), although residues 7–14 constitute a shorter β-hairpin structure. The K11L mutant of α-sarcin shows both decreased ability to interact with lipid bilayers and reduced cytotoxicity (32Garcı́a-Ortega L. Lacadena J. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Kao R. Davies J. Olmo N. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1658-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that the absence of the second minor β-sheet at the NH2-terminal of RNases U2 or T1 could explain why they are not cytotoxic (32Garcı́a-Ortega L. Lacadena J. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Kao R. Davies J. Olmo N. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1658-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have prepared, isolated, and characterized α-sarcin Δ(7–22), a deletion mutant in which residues 7–22 were replaced by two Gly residues. Thus, the hinge region, the second minor β-sheet, and the turn in the amino-terminal hairpin of α-sarcin were replaced by the Gly-Gly turn connecting the first minor β-sheet present in RNase U2 (see Fig. 1). All of the materials and reagents were molecular biology grade. Cloning procedures and bacteria manipulations were carried out according to standard methods (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), as described previously (27Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A.

Absorbance measurements were carried out at room temperature in 1-cm optical path cells on a Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Milan, Italy) at 100 nm/min scanning speed. Extinction coefficients E(0.1%, 1 cm, 280 nm) were calculated from the absorbance spectra of the proteins and amino acid analyses to determine concentration. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) at 0.2 nm/s scanning speed; 0.1- and 1.0-cm optical path cells were used in the far and near UV, respectively. Mean residue weight ellipticities were expressed in units of degrees × cm2 × dmol−1. Thermal denaturation profiles were obtained by measuring the temperature dependence of the ellipticity at 220 nm in the range of 25–85 °C; the temperature was continuously changed at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. Tm values (temperature at the midpoint of the thermal transition) were calculated assuming a two-state unfolding mechanism. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on a SLM Aminco 8000 spectrofluorimeter (Urbana, IL) at 25 °C in 0.2-cm path cells. All of these determinations were made as described previously (27Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Bruix M. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G.

The activity of α-sarcin was also analyzed on naked rRNA extracted from E. coli with acid phenol-guanidinium thiocyanate-chloroform (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The culture was homogenized by sonication in a water bath after addition of the above denaturant solution. The integrity of the purified RNA was verified by electrophoresis, which confirmed the predominance of the 23 and 16 S rRNA species. The activity assay was performed with this RNA preparation under conditions identical to those described for the reticulocyte lysate. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The specific cleavage of a synthetic 35-mer RNA by α-sarcin was also studied. The synthesis of this synthetic 35-mer RNA was carried out as described (7Kao R. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Martı́nez del Pozo A.

The assay was performed with 2 μm synthetic 35-mer RNA and a protein concentration (wild-type α-sarcin or deletion mutant) in the 6 nm to 6 μm range, after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (7Kao R.

The reaction products were detected by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoretic separation on a denaturing 19% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The specific action of α-sarcin produces both 21- and 14-mer fragments.

The proteins exhibiting ribonuclease activity appear as colorless bands, because of degradation of the polynucleotide, after appropriate destaining. This assay, which was performed at two different pH values (4.5 and 7.0), is useful to detect the presence of other RNA degrading activities in the protein samples. Volumograms of these bands (based on integrating all of the pixel intensities composing the spot) were obtained with the photo documentation system UVI-Tec (Cambridge, UK) and the software facility UVIsoft UVI band Windows Application V97.04. These data were used to quantify the activity. The activity of the proteins against dinucleotides (ApA and ApG) was measured at pH 5.0 as described elsewhere (26Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A.

A comparison of chemical shifts for free CaM with those of the CaM·CaMKIp complex indicate large differences throughout the CaM sequence. Using NMR techniques optimized for large proteins, backbone resonance assignments were also determined for CaM bound to the intact CaMKI enzyme.

Chemical shifts of CaM bound to a peptide (smMLCKp) corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase are also compared with the CaM·CaMKI complexes. Chemical shifts can differentiate one complex from another, as well as bound versus free states of CaM. In this context, the observed similarity between CaM·CaMKI enzyme and peptide complexes is striking, indicating that the peptide is an excellent mimetic for interaction of calmodulin with the CaMKI enzyme.

Calmodulin is the prototypic transducer of the Ca2+ion second messenger, present in all eukaryotes where it modulates numerous intracellular proteins, including a number of Ser/Thr protein kinases (1.Crivici A.

An elevation of intracellular Ca2+concentrations results in saturation of calmodulin by calcium, inducing conformational changes in both N- and C-domains (3.Chou J.J. Li S. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat.

The Ca2+-dependent association is well studied, yet a mechanistic description of CaM function is confounded by the apparently diverse target sequences and numerous activities that are regulated by this protein (1.Crivici A.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar).The structural paradigm of CaM signal transduction has been formed from a number of crystallographic and NMR studies, typically in the context of CaM binding to biochemically inactive peptide fragments from larger proteins (1.Crivici A.

This has been necessitated by the fact that the smallest intact enzymes that are regulated in CaM-dependent pathways are generally too large for standard NMR experiments and have been apparently resistant to crystallization efforts, forcing reliance on studies of the interaction of CaM with peptide fragments of calmodulin-binding domains. Indeed, peptide models are often used in many different types of studies of calmodulin-target protein interactions (2.Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar).Commonly, CaM binds a single amphiphilic peptide, which forms an α-helix upon being sequestered from solvent via collapse of the two Ca2+-binding domains of CaM around the peptide (10.Roth S.M.

Recently, structures of several large CaM·protein complexes have been determined (16.Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P.

In a study of a small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (SK2 channel) by Schumacher et al. (16.Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), two molecules of CaM each span three helical segments in the tetrameric CaM·SK2 channel peptide complex. Similarly, Larsson et al. (17.Larsson G. Schleucher J. Onions J. Hermann S. Grundstrom T. Wijmenga S.S. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found a multimeric complex between CaM and the transcription factor SEF2-1/E2-2. CaM has also been crystallized in association with a domain of Edema factor (EF) exotoxin from Bacillus anthracis (18.Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, it is CaM that is engulfed by the EF domain in the ternary complex, with CaM bound as a new subdomain in the EF protein via “a molecular full nelson” (19.Liddington R.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 373-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These examples indicate that CaM may be capable of numerous modes of interaction, further supporting a model of a conformationally adaptive protein. These studies suggest that CaM may utilize substantially larger surfaces in activating target enzymes than is indicated by CaM·peptide complexes. Thus a means for verifying the relevance of using a CaM-peptide mimetic in studies of the interaction between CaM and intact enzymes is needed.CaM-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) is part of a CaM-dependent kinase signaling cascade, comprised of CaMKK, CaMKI, and CaMKIV (20.Soderling T.R.

A crystal structure of CaMKI(320) has provided insights into the structural basis for CaM-mediated activation of these and related enzymes (23.Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Many kinases are maintained in an autoinhibited state via interactions of the C-terminal regulatory domain with the catalytic core (24.Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25.Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In CaMKI, the core catalytic domain (1–298) is flanked by a regulatory domain (299–320) that is comprised of overlapping pseudosubstrate and CaM-binding sequences. The regulatory domain inhibits enzyme activity through contacts of the pseudosubstrate sequence and the substrate-binding site and through contacts between the CaM-binding sequence and ATP-binding sites, thus providing an autoinhibitory mechanism (24.Yokokura H.

The interaction between CaM and the CaM-binding domain sequesters the regulatory domain, releasing pseudosubstrate inhibition, and resulting in activation of the kinase.In this work, we assay to what extent complexes of CaM with CaMKI(320) and with CaMKIp are similar at the level of the backbone structure of CaM. Studies comparing interactions of CaM with intact CaMKIversus a synthetic CaMKIp peptide (residues 299–320) show largely similar spectroscopic changes, and a similar responsiveness to mutations (26.Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Vogel H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Chin D. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31235-31240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), providing support for the use of peptides as models of CaM interactions. Here, the extraordinary sensitivity of the NMR chemical shift is used to report on the subtle structural changes that occur throughout the entire calmodulin molecule upon interaction with a target peptide or protein. The observed chemical shifts show that CaM·CaMKIp and CaM·CaMKI(320) are virtually identical in terms of backbone structure. Calmodulin is the prototypic transducer of the Ca2+ion second messenger, present in all eukaryotes where it modulates numerous intracellular proteins, including a number of Ser/Thr protein kinases (1.Crivici A.

Remarkably, however, it is CaM that is engulfed by the EF domain in the ternary complex, with CaM bound as a new subdomain in the EF protein via “a molecular full nelson” (19.Liddington R.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 373-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These examples indicate that CaM may be capable of numerous modes of interaction, further supporting a model of a conformationally adaptive protein. These studies suggest that CaM may utilize substantially larger surfaces in activating target enzymes than is indicated by CaM·peptide complexes. Thus a means for verifying the relevance of using a CaM-peptide mimetic in studies of the interaction between CaM and intact enzymes is needed. CaM-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) is part of a CaM-dependent kinase signaling cascade, comprised of CaMKK, CaMKI, and CaMKIV (20.Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 21.Chin D. Means A.R.

A crystal structure of CaMKI(320) has provided insights into the structural basis for CaM-mediated activation of these and related enzymes (23.Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Many kinases are maintained in an autoinhibited state via interactions of the C-terminal regulatory domain with the catalytic core (24.Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25.Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In CaMKI, the core catalytic domain (1–298) is flanked by a regulatory domain (299–320) that is comprised of overlapping pseudosubstrate and CaM-binding sequences. The regulatory domain inhibits enzyme activity through contacts of the pseudosubstrate sequence and the substrate-binding site and through contacts between the CaM-binding sequence and ATP-binding sites, thus providing an autoinhibitory mechanism (24.Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25.Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The interaction between CaM and the CaM-binding domain sequesters the regulatory domain, releasing pseudosubstrate inhibition, and resulting in activation of the kinase. In this work, we assay to what extent complexes of CaM with CaMKI(320) and with CaMKIp are similar at the level of the backbone structure of CaM. Studies comparing interactions of CaM with intact CaMKIversus a synthetic CaMKIp peptide (residues 299–320) show largely similar spectroscopic changes, and a similar responsiveness to mutations (26.Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Vogel H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Chin D. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31235-31240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), providing support for the use of peptides as models of CaM interactions. Here, the extraordinary sensitivity of the NMR chemical shift is used to report on the subtle structural changes that occur throughout the entire calmodulin molecule upon interaction with a target peptide or protein. The observed chemical shifts show that CaM·CaMKIp and CaM·CaMKI(320) are virtually identical in terms of backbone structure. We thank Drs. Ronald L. Koder and Ronald W. Peterson for assistance with peptide synthesis."

The former and latter structures were refined to an R-factor of 18.8% at a 1.4-Å resolution and an R-factor of 15.0% at a 1.6-Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of the prokaryotic PLA2 exhibits a novel folding topology that demonstrates that it is completely distinct from those of eukaryotic PLA2s, which have been already determined by x-ray and NMR analyses. Furthermore, the coordination geometry of the calcium(II) ion apparently deviated from that of eukaryotic PLA2s. Regardless of the evolutionary divergence, the catalytic mechanism including the calcium(II) ion on secreted PLA2 seems to be conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Demonstrating that the overall structure determined by x-ray analysis is almost the same as that determined by NMR analysis is useful to discuss the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level of the bacterial PLA2.

Phospholipase A2(PLA2 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2phospholipase A2Watwater molecule1The abbreviations used are: PLA2phospholipase A2Watwater molecule ; EC 3.1.1.4) is an enzyme that liberates fatty acid together with lysophospholipid by hydrolyzing the 2-ester bond of 1,2-diacyl-3-sn-phosphoglycerides. The enzyme, which has been found only by eukaryotic cells, can be broadly divided into two categories, namely secreted and cytosolic types (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, a proposal for classification has been made after many types of PLA2 in each category were found. According to this classification, secreted PLA2s are grouped into classes I, II, III, V, IX, X, XI, and XII (2Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 3Gelb M.H. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). We have discovered a bacterial PLA2 of the secreted type and propose to establish a new class, which is described in the accompanying paper (41Sugiyama M. Ohtani K. Izuhara M. Koike T. Suzuki K.

Interestingly, the kinetic study of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 with respect to the dissociation constant for calcium(II) ion suggested that the binding affinity of the ion for the prokaryotic PLA2 is 1 order of magnitude lower than that for the eukaryotic enzyme (41Sugiyama M.

In addition, the bacterial PLA2 prefers phosphatidylcholine as a substrate to phosphatidylethanolamine. The primary structure of the prokaryotic PLA2, except for residues Cys61–Tyr68, is distinct from those of eukaryotic secreted PLA2s that have already been analyzed for the tertiary structure. As a striking difference, eukaryotic PLA2s have 6–8 disulfide bonds, whereas the bacterial enzyme has only two disulfide bonds. Over 150 primary structures of PLA2 have been already determined, and the crystal (4Dijkstra B.W. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol.

Here, we show the crystal structure of the calcium-free S. violaceoruber PLA2, which was determined by using the multiple isomorphous replacement methods and refined at a high resolution of 1.4 Å. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the calcium-bound form by the molecular replacement method and refined it at a 1.6-Å resolution. This is the first report disclosing the x-ray crystal structure of prokaryotic PLA2. The x-ray crystal structures of these two forms of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 were compared with those by the NMR technique and also with the tertiary structures of eukaryotic PLA2s. The x-ray crystal structure of the calcium-bound S. violaceoruber PLA2 is concrete evidence that the catalytic hydrogen-bonding network is essentially flexible even in the crystal structure. We believe that this observation will aid in understanding the molecular mechanism for the catalysis of the secreted PLA2s. The S. violaceoruber PLA2was purified to homogeneity and lyophilized as described previously (41Sugiyama M. Ohtani K. Izuhara M. Koike T. Suzuki K. Imamura S. Misaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Before crystallization, the lyophilized protein, dissolved in a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm CaCl2, was adjusted to 20 mg/ml as a final concentration. Initial crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method at 297 K using the hanging drop technique (14McPherson A. The Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar). Drops containing 5 μl of the protein solution and 5 μl of the reservoir solution were equilibrated against the reservoir solution. The reservoir solution contained 14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.2m Li2SO4, and 0.1 msodium cacodylate at pH 6.0. However, the crystals were heavily twinned and dissolved at 292 K. Therefore, after the crystals were completely dissolved, the drops were placed again at 297 K. The resulting single crystals, which grew in 2 weeks to a size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 1.2 mm, were suitable for the diffraction analysis. These crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 29.4 Å, b = 57.8 Å, c = 31.7 Å, and β = 111.5° with one molecule per asymmetric unit. After the structure determination, it was revealed that no calcium ion bound to the protein. All x-ray data were collected at room temperature. Initially, the native data to 2.0-Å resolution was collected using an R-AXIS IIc imaging plate with graphite monochromated Cu Kα radiation from the rotating anode generator RU-200 run at 40 kV and 100 mA. Each oscillation frame was taken using a rotation of 3° for 20 min at a crystal-to-detector distance of 80 mm. The diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled using the Process program (15Higashi T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 253-257Crossref Google Scholar). A nearly complete data set (94.6%) to a 2.0-Å resolution with high redundancy was collected from a single crystal. This native data set was used for the phase estimation at lower resolution and the preliminary refinement of the constructed model. Higher resolution data to 1.4 Å were later collected using the same detector and the same x-ray source. The detector 2θ angle was set to 35°, and the distance between its center and the crystal was set to 85 mm. Each oscillation frame was taken using a rotation of 1.5° for 15 min. In the highest resolution bin between 1.45 and 1.40 Å, this data set was 37.4% complete with a signal-to-noise ratio (I/ς(I)) of 4.52.

Open table in a new tab The phase problem was solved to 2.7-Å resolution using the PHASES program (16Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 276: 472-494Google Scholar). Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystal in the reservoir solution containing each heavy atom reagent. Three derivatives (Pt, Au, and Rh) were used for the phasing (middle of Table I). The position of the primary Pt site was easily found in a difference Patterson map. The resulting single isomorphous replacement phases were used to solve other sites of the derivatives. The heavy atom parameters were refined, and a phase set with a figure of merit of 0.74 was obtained. Anomalous scattering information of the Pt derivative was utilized in this process, and anisotropic temperature factors were used for each heavy atom. A density modification with an extension to a 2.0-Å resolution was performed by the solvent-flattening and histogram-matching method using the SQUASH program (17Zhang K.Y.J. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1990; 46: 377-381Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The molecular boundary was determined in the electron density map applying a value of the solvent content of 20%, which is smaller than the value calculated on the basis of one molecule per asymmetric unit (33%). The resulting Fourier map enabled us to trace the main chain easily, and the difference map calculated from the native anomalous differences and the obtained phases confirmed the location of two disulfide bonds and one sulfur atom of the Met residue. An initial model was built into this modified map using the program Xfit in the XtalView software package (18McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). This model gave an R-factor of 39.8% for the reflections from 10.0- to 3.0-Å resolution. Refinement of the model was performed by a combination of simulated annealing (19Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) and conventional restrained refinement methods (20Konnert J.H. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1980; 36: 344-350Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar) using the X-PLOR program (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A subset of 10% of the reflections was used to monitor the free R-factor (Rfree) (22Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar). The refinement began with data from 10.0- to 3.0-Å resolution, and the upper limit was raised to a 2.0-Å resolution. Each refinement cycle included the refinement of positional parameters and individual isotropic temperature factors, the revision of the model using the omit map, and the addition of the solvent molecules. When the R-factor for the reflections from 10.0- to 2.0-Å resolution fell below 20%, the native data was changed to the 1.4-Å resolution data. Further rebuilding, the addition of the solvent molecules, and the X-PLOR refinement yielded the current model (bottom of Table I). The root mean square deviations from the ideal geometry (23Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar) are 0.008 Å in bond length, 1.9° in bond angle, and 1.13° in improper angle. For crystallization, the protein solution was prepared as described previously. Initial crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion at 297 K using the hanging drop method (14McPherson A. The Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar). Drops containing 5 μl of the protein solution and 5 μl of the reservoir solution were equilibrated against 1.0 ml of reservoir solution. The typical reservoir solution contained 50–60% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. However, the obtained crystals were heavily twinned. To obtain single appropriate crystals, repeated seeding was performed using the crushed crystals as seeds. Single crystals suitable for the diffraction analysis (0.1 × 0.5 × 2.0 mm) grew in 1 week. They belong to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 38.3 Å, b = 54.3 Å,c = 30.6 Å, and β = 90.2° with one molecule per asymmetric unit. These preliminary crystallographic data have been published (24Matoba Y. Kumagai T. Sugiyama M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). X-ray analysis was performed at room temperature using an R-AXIS IIc imaging plate with mirror monochromated Cu Kα radiation from the RU-300 rotating anode generator run at 40 kV and 100 mA. The crystal was mounted with the crystallographic a* axis parallel to the crystal rotation axis. The crystal-to-detector distance was set to 60 mm. Each frame of 2.5° crystal oscillation was taken for 12 min. Diffraction spots in a rotation range of 142.5° were recorded on a total of 57 frames. The diffraction intensities to a 1.6-Å resolution were integrated and scaled by the Process program (15Higashi T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 253-257Crossref Google Scholar). In the highest resolution bin between 1.7- and 1.6-Å resolution, this data set is 48.0% complete with a signal/noise ratio (I/ς(I)) of 2.41 and an Rmerge of 28.3%. Details of the data collection statistics are shown in Table I (top). The crystal structure of the calcium-bound S. violaceoruberPLA2 was solved by the molecular replacement procedure using the programs in X-PLOR (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The calcium-free form structure was used as search probe in a cross-rotation function against the data in a resolution range of 10.0- to 4.0-Å. A single peak at Euler angles θ1 = 183.3°, θ2 = 72.5°, and θ3 = 30.8° was 8.0 ς above the mean. A translational search was carried out in two dimensions (x and z). A top peak (x = 0.214, z= 0.425 in fractions of the unit cell) was observed at 7.2 ς above the mean. Refinement was first performed using the X-PLOR program (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates, obtained by the molecular replacement method, were refined against the data between 10.0 and 4.0 Å for 20 cycles with the entire molecule as a rigid body, resulting in a crystallographic R-factor of 35.8%. Atomic refinement of the model was performed by using a combination of simulated annealing (19Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) and conventional restrained refinement methods (20Konnert J.H. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1980; 36: 344-350Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A subset of 10% of the reflections was used to monitor the Rfree(22Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar). The refinement began with data from 10.0- to 3.0-Å resolution, and the upper limit was raised to a 1.6-Å resolution. Each refinement cycle included the refinement of positional parameters and individual isotropic temperature factors. After each refinement step, 2 Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps were computed. The molecular modeling program Xfit in the XtalView program suit (18McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar) was used on the Silicon Graphics workstations for visualizing and rebuilding the model. Several cycles of the X-PLOR refinement resulted in decreasing both the R-factor and Rfree to 20.1 and 26.5%, respectively, for the reflections from 10.0 to 1.6-Å resolution with F > 2 ς. After the convergence on X-PLOR, further refinement was performed using the SHELXL-97 program (25Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) against all of the reflections from 5.0- to 1.6-Å resolution with F > 0. Refinement statistics are given at the bottom of Table I. The root mean square deviations from the ideal geometry (23Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar) are 0.008 Å in bond length, 1.9° in bond angle, and 1.13° in improper angle. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, the final 2 Fo − Fc maps of the hydrophobic core region in the calcium-free form and the calcium-binding site in the calcium-bound form structures exhibit very high quality. Almost all aromatic amino acid residues as well as Pro residues have a low density hole through the center of the rings, as expected from the high resolution maps. Mean coordinate errors were estimated by a Luzatti plot (26Luzzati V.

Although all side chain atoms in the calcium-free form are included in the final model, those of Gln7, Arg28, Gln47, Phe53, Lys103, and Trp112 have poorly defined electron density. In the calcium-bound form, together with the side chain atoms of these 6 residues, those of Asn29, Glu102, and Lys119 were poorly defined. The C-terminal main- and side-chain atoms in the calcium-bound form structure are flexible. Mainly, the difference of distribution of the flexible residues between calcium-free and calcium-bound forms seems to be caused by the differences of their crystal-packing effects, as described below.

The unusual backbone conformation of Leu44 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond formed between its backbone amide nitrogen and the Thr42 hydroxyl oxygen. On the geometry of class I/II PLA2s, an anti-parallel β-sheet composed of two strands is present together with α-helices accounting for 50% of the overall structure (4Dijkstra B.W. Kalk K.H.

Class III bee venom PLA2 consists of three kinds of long α-helices and a few β-strands (8Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the S. violaceoruber PLA2 only has an α-helical secondary structure consisting of five α-helices and two helical segments (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 a). The current crystal structure model of the bacterial PLA2 is almost the same as the NMR structure (41Sugiyama M. Ohtani K. Izuhara M. Koike T. Suzuki K. Imamura S. Misaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To clarify the tertiary structure of bacterial PLA2, we conveniently divided the structure into the N- and C-terminal domains; the former domain consists of two α-helices (α1 and α2) and two helical segments. The latter domain consists of three long α-helices (α3, α4, and α5) and forms a three-helix bundle. The three α-helices are tightly packed against each other with an unusual slightly right-handed twist. The angles among the three α-helices are 11° (α3–α4), 18° (α4–α5), and 19° (α3–α5), respectively. Both domains are linked to a long loop consisting of residues Glu37 to Phe57. The α3-helix contains a homologous segment consisting of the residues Cys61 to Tyr68, and its orientation is almost anti-parallel to the α4-helix. The nearly anti-parallel helices are also formed by α4- and α5-helices. These three α-helices are approximately perpendicular to the α2-helix.Figure 3a, amino acid sequence of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 and structurally homologous segments of typical eukaryotic PLA2s. i), S. violaceoruber; ii), N. naja atraPLA2 (class I/II); iii), bee venom PLA2 (class III).

The tertiary structural similarity of backbone is limited to two long anti-parallel α-helices containing the residues composing the catalytic site. A two-stranded β-sheet, commonly found in the class I/II PLA2s, is absent in the bacterial PLA2. Although the C-terminal α5-helix in the S. violaceoruber PLA2 corresponds to the N-terminal α-helix in the class I/II PLA2s, its orientation is opposite. Similarly, the α-carbon backbone of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 is superimposed on that of PLA2 from bee venom (8Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 b). The orientation of three long α-helices in the C-terminal domain of the bacterial PLA2 is similar to that of PLA2 from bee venom, whereas the overall structure of bacterial PLA2is obviously different from that of the bee venom PLA2. The overall structure of the S. violaceoruber PLA2can be expressed as a shape in which the N-terminal domain of the bacterial PLA2 is topologically added to a core region consisting of three α-helices of the bee venom PLA2. Despite the difference of the crystal lattice, the crystal structure of the calcium-free form is identical with that of the calcium-bound form. Fig. 4 a shows the superposition of the two forms using the main-chain atoms. The root mean square positional differences between the two structures are 0.93 and 1.10 Å for main-chain atoms and for all protein atoms, respectively. Marked structural deviations occur at the Cys45—Ala48 residues in the long loop (Fig. 4 b) and at the Lys119—Gly122residues in the C-terminal region (Fig. 4 c). The former conformational change may be caused by binding of the calcium(II) ion to the protein, and the latter may reflect the potential flexibility of this region, as described below. In the calcium-free S. violaceoruber PLA2structure, although calcium(II) ion is contained in a buffer to grow the crystal, the ion is absent in the model. This may be due to the fact that the crystal is grown in the presence of sulfate ion at near pH 6. Interestingly, even without calcium(II) ion, the current model maintains the conformational rigidity. The mean temperature factors are 11.0 Å2 for all protein atoms and 9.8 Å2 for the main-chain atoms. On the other hand, the mean temperature factors of the calcium-bound form structure increase to 30.1 Å2for all protein atoms and 28.0 Å2 for the main-chain atoms. Judging from the fact that VM (29Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7909) Google Scholar) values are extremely low (1.85 Å3 Da−1) for calcium-free crystal and moderate (2.35 Å3Da−1) for calcium-bound crystal, it can easily be speculated that the differences of mean temperature factors are mainly caused by the crystal packing effe"
https://openalex.org/W2000810642,"Abstract 12(R)-Hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid (HETrE) is a potent inflammatory and angiogenic eicosanoid in ocular and dermal tissues. Previous studies suggested that 12(R)-HETrE activates microvessel endothelial cells via a high affinity binding site; however, the cellular mechanisms underlying 12(R)-HETrE angiogenic activity are unexplored. Because the synthesis of 12(R)-HETrE is induced in response to hypoxic injury, we examined its interactions with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in rabbit limbal microvessel endothelial cells. Addition of 12(R)-HETrE (0.1 nm) to the cells increased VEGF mRNA levels with maximum 5-fold increase at 45 min. The increase in VEGF mRNA was followed by an increase in immunoreactive VEGF protein. 12(R)-HETrE (0.1 nm) rapidly activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) ERK1 and ERK2. Moreover, preincubation of cells with PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK-1, inhibited 12(R)-HETrE-induced VEGF mRNA. Addition of VEGF antibody to cells grown in Matrigel-coated culture plates inhibited 12(R)-HETrE-induced capillary tube-like formation, suggesting that VEGF mediates, at least in part, the angiogenic response to 12(R)-HETrE. The results indicate that in microvessel endothelial cells, 12(R)-HETrE induces VEGF expression via activation of ERK1/2 and that VEGF mediates, at least in part, the angiogenic activity of 12(R)-HETrE. Given the fact that both VEGF and 12(R)-HETrE are produced in the cornea after hypoxic injury, their interaction may be an important determinant in the development of neovascularized tissues."

The capacity for NO reduction is now recognized in a phylogenetically diverse range of bacteria, which includes soil denitrifying bacteria such as Paracoccus denitrificans and pathogenic bacteria such as Neiserria meningitidis (2Hendricks J.

Primary structure analysis, in combination with spectroscopic studies, has clearly established NORs as divergent members of the family of respiratory heme-copper oxidases. Characterization of P. denitrificans NorBC has established that the catalytic NorB subunit binds a bis-histidine-coordinated heme b that is functionally equivalent to heme a in cytochrome-c oxidase. It also binds a high spin heme b (termed b3) that is equivalent to heme a3 in cytochrome-c oxidase and heme o3 of Escherichia coli cytochrome-bo3 quinol oxidase. In cytochrome-c oxidase and quinol oxidases this heme is magnetically coupled to a copper ion (CuB) to form a dinuclear center, which is the site of oxygen binding and reduction. By contrast, in NOR this CuB is replaced with a non-heme iron, FeB (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Sukurai N.

A fourth metal center, a covalently bound low spin heme c with histidine and methionine axial ligands, is bound by the NorC subunit. This site has no structural counterpart in cytochrome-c oxidase but is functionally equivalent to CuA in that it serves as a site of electron input for the respiratory complex. Recent NOR studies have addressed the nature of the catalytic site through site-directed mutagenesis (9Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), redox potentiometry (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and ligand binding studies (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The redox potentiometry revealed that the high spin heme b3 of the dinuclear center had a surprisingly low midpoint redox potential (Em(pH 7.6) = +60 mV) (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which imposes a large thermodynamic barrier to reduction by the low spin electron transferring heme c (Em(pH 7.6) = +310 mV) and heme b (Em(pH 7.6) = +345 mV). This may be a means by which reduction of the heme b3 is avoided to prevent forming a potentially dead-end ferrous heme-nitrosyl species with NO (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that reduction of the FeB in the dinuclear center, which occurs when three electrons are introduced to the enzyme, results in a shift in the absorption maximum of the ligand to metal charge-transfer (CT) band associated with the high spin ferric heme b3 from ∼595 to 605 nm (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Taken together with recent resonance Raman studies of NOR (10Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O-M. H. Huang H-W. Wassser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this observation can be accounted for by a change in the ligation from a μ-oxo bridged dinuclear center in which there is no proximal ligand to the ferric heme b3, to a form of the ferric heme b3 with a proximal histidine ligand and an anionic distal ligand (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There is currently no agreement on a model for the catalytic cycle of NOR. However, it must involve the transfer of two protons and two electrons to the active site as these are required for the reduction of two NO molecules to N2O and H2O (Reaction 1). It is now generally agreed that these protons are moved to the active site from the periplasm (3Cramm R. Pohlmann A. Friedrich B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In membranes this overall process is non-electrogenic because the electrons are also derived from donors located in the periplasm. A possible proton-conducting pathway that involves one or more conserved glutamate residues has emerged from site-specific mutagenesis of NOR (9Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two recent NOR studies have reported that the spectroscopic properties of the fully oxidized enzyme are not significantly affected by pH (10Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O-M. H. Huang H-W. Wassser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar,11Shiniji K. Sakurai N. Sakurai T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These observations are perhaps surprising given the requirement of proton uptake to the dinuclear center for NO reduction. This work reports an electronic absorption and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopic study of NorCB from P. denitrificans at a range of pH and redox states. This has led to the identification of three spectrally distinct forms of the ferric heme b3, which may reflect μ-oxo bridged, hydroxide-bound, and water-bound species. The latter two species are only observed in the three electron-reduced enzyme and are pH-dependent. The results may help us to elucidate the catalytic cycle of NOR. The source of the NOR used in this study was P. denitrificans strain 93.11 (ΔctaDI, ΔctaDII qoxB::kan R) (12de Gier J.-W. L. Lübben M. Reijnders W.N.M. Tipker C.A. van Spanning R.J.M. Stouthamer A.H. van der Oost J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) grown in batch culture in minimal medium under anaerobic denitrifying conditions. The two-subunit form of the enzyme was purified essentially as described by Grönberg et al. (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Electronic absorbance spectra were recorded either on an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer or a Hitachi U3000 spectrophotometer. Room temperature magnetic circular dichroism (RT-MCD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500D circular dichrograph. An Oxford Instruments super-conducting solenoid with a 25-mm room temperature bore was used to generate magnetic fields of up to 6 tesla. MCD spectral intensities depend linearly on the magnetic field at room temperature and are expressed per unit magnetic field as Δε/H (m −1 cm−1tesla−1). Mediated equilibrium redox titrations of NOR were done at 20 °C in 20 mm bis-Tris propane (BTP) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 340 mm NaCl and adjusted to the required pH. The methodology was essentially as that described by Dutton (13Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Dithionite was used as the reductant and potassium ferricyanide as the oxidant. The redox mediators, each at a final concentration of 10 μm, were phenazine methosulfate (PMS), phenazine ethosulfate (PES), 5-anthraquinone 2-sulfonate, 6-anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate, and benzylviologen. A solution of saturated quinhydrone at pH 7 was used as a redox standard (E = +295 mV). All potentials quoted are with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. Preparation of three electron-reduced NOR under the control of a potentiostat was achieved using a three-electrode cell configuration with a closed sample compartment thermostated at 4 °C. All manipulations were performed in an anaerobic chamber (N2atmosphere with O2 at less than 2 ppm). A 200-μl sample of 25 μm NOR in 20 mm BTP, 0.05% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 0.34 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA at the desired pH and supplemented with a mixture of redox mediators, which included ferricyanide, PES, PMS, and 2,6-dimethylbenzaquinone, was placed in a glassy carbon pot that provided the working electrode. A Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum foil counter electrode contacted the solution through a Luggin tip and Vycor frit, respectively. The potential of the carbon pot was held at +150 mV with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode for 1 h, during which time the sample was stirred, and the current flowing from the cell fell to a negligible level. After this time the sample was withdrawn from the electrochemical cell and transferred to an anaerobic cell for MCD spectroscopy. Samples of P. denitrificans NOR were equilibrated at pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 in BTP buffer. Samples were poised at a range of potentials between +400 and 0 mV and absorbance spectra were collected in the range of 500 to 700 nm. At each pH value the oxidized (∼+400 mV) spectrum showed the characteristic α/β band absorption features of low spin ferric hemes in the region 520–570 nm (Fig. 1). These features have previously been assigned to the histidine/methionine-ligated c-heme of the NorC subunit and the bis-histidine-ligated b heme of the NorB subunit (14Cheesman M.R. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3994-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each sample also exhibited a clearly resolved absorption shoulder at ∼595 nm. The λmax and intensity of this band was not significantly affected by the pH of the bulk phase. This 595-nm feature arises from a CT band associated with ferric high spin heme b3, which has no proximal ligand but has a distal μ-oxo bridge to the FeB (10Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O-M. H. Huang H-W. Wassser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Cheesman M.R. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3994-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Complete reduction (E = ∼0 mV) of NOR at each pH led to the appearance of the intense absorption peaks at 550 and 560 nm that arise from reduction of the low spin heme c (550 nm) and heme b (560 nm) (Fig. 1). The heme b3 595 nm CT band disappears on reduction. Again, analysis of the reduced spectrum at each pH value revealed no substantial differences in the λmax and intensity of the absorption peaks. In an earlier study of NOR (8Grönberg K.L.C. Roldàn M.D. Prior L. Butland G.P. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) carried out in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.6, it was demonstrated that lowering the potential of the NOR sample buffer from approximately +400 to +150 mV results in the reduction of the low spin hemes (heme b and heme c) and the non-heme iron (FeB). In the resulting three electron-reduced species the λmax of the heme b3 CT band shifts from 595 to ∼605 nm, and the extinction coefficient decreases. Thus, reduction of the FeB in the dinuclear center resulted in a change in the coordination environment of the heme b3. On the basis of MCD analysis and taking into account recent resonance Raman studies (10Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O-M. H. Huang H-W. Wassser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem.

In the present study the three electron-reduced state of the enzyme has been investigated at a range of pH values in BTP buffer, which allows examination over a broad range of pH values and temperatures. Chemical poising of samples at +150 mV led to the reduction of the two low spin hemes and the FeB, whereas the high spin heme b3 remained oxidized. Analysis of these samples revealed that the absorption intensity of the red-shifted CT band is strongly affected by pH. The CT band is least intense at pH 6.5 and most intense at pH 8.5 (Fig. 1, A and D). This suggests that the form of the heme b3 present at pH 8.5 is different from that present at pH 6.5. Examination of (three electron-reduced) − (fully reduced) difference spectra (Fig. 2) shows that at pH 8.5 the CT band is positioned at 605 nm. At pH 7.5 the heme b3appears to in a mixed form, with one population exhibiting a 605-nm CT band and a second population exhibiting a 635-nm CT band. At pH 6.5 the 635-nm form dominates the spectrum. From these data, molar extinction coefficients of ε605–700 or ε700–635 as 3.66 mm −1 cm−1 and 1.18 mm −1 cm−1 were calculated for the 605 and 635-nm bands, respectively. These data suggest that at different pH values the ferric heme b3 in the three electron-reduced enzyme has a different distal ligand. High spin ferric hemes give two characteristic CT bands that produce derivative-shaped features in the MCD spectrum (15Brill A.S. Williams R.J.P. Biochem. J. 1961; 78: 246-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cheng J.C. Osborne G.A. Stephens P.J. Eton W.A. Nature. 1973; 241: 193-194Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The higher energy band is seen in the 600–700-nm region, and its precise wavelength is sensitive to the nature of the axial ligands (Table I). RT-MCD studies have been successfully used to assign the exogenous-bound distal ligand of histidine-ligated high spin ferric heme of E. coli cytochrome bo3 (30Watmough N.J. Cheesman M.R. Butler C.S. Little R.H. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, this approach was exploited to determine the likely nature of the distal ligand to NOR heme b3 samples buffered at pH 6.0 and 8.5. Samples were poised electrochemically at +150 mV and examined by electronic absorption and RT-MCD spectroscopy. Electrochemical poising allowed the preparation in a small volume of the concentrated samples required for MCD analysis. The electronic absorption spectra clearly show that at pH 6.0 the heme b3 is in a pure 635-nm form and at pH 8.5 in a pure 605-nm form (Fig. 3 A, inset). The RT-MCD spectra show peaks in the α, β, and Soret regions dominated by signals from low spin ferrous heme. CT bands associated with the high spin ferric heme b3 are seen in the 600–650-nm region of the RT-MCD spectrum. Analysis of this region shows a band at 620 nm in the pH 8.5 sample, which is characteristic of high spin heme with a proximal histidine and a distal hydroxide (His/OH−). In the pH 6.0 sample this band is red-shifted to 640 nm, a position characteristic of His/H2O-ligated high spin ferric heme (Table I). This analysis is in good agreement with the UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of the three electron-reduced NOR generated by chemical reduction and confirms that the ligand change is not an artifact of reduction with sodium dithionite. Moreover, these data suggest that direct ligation of the heme b3 is dependent on both the redox state of the dinuclear center and on pH. In the oxidized form the heme b3 and non-heme FeB are bridged by a μ-oxo group. As the non-heme FeB is reduced, the heme b3 becomes ligated by hydroxide at high pH levels (∼8.5) and by water at low pH levels (∼6). Recent evidence from a study of carbon monoxide binding to the fully reduced (four electron-reduced) NOR suggests that these coordination states are retained by ferrous heme b3 (31Hendichs J.H.M.

Open table in a new tab Quantitative analysis of the dependence of the 605- and 635-nm bands on the potential at pH 7 to obtain E°′ for each redox species is made difficult by the low intensities and overlapping nature of these bands. In the fully oxidized enzyme (Fig. 4, —) the CT band is clearly positioned at 595 nm. As the dinuclear center starts to become reduced, the 595-nm band begins to decrease in intensity. At +250 mV (Fig. 4, ---) it has decreased to approximately half its original intensity, and a new band has appeared centered at 635 nm. This movement in the CT band represents a change from a μ-oxo bridged species to one where the heme b3 is ligated by His/H2O. The next phase of reduction from +250 mV to +140 mV (Fig. 4, ····) causes the 595-nm band to further decrease in intensity. However, this further decrease does not correspond to a further increase in the 635-nm band but to the appearance of another new band at 605 nm. This represents the formation of a His/OH−-ligated heme b3 from the μ-oxo bridged species. During the remainder of the reduction of the dinuclear center the 605 and 635-nm bands titrate at similar potentials and have completely disappeared by +22 mV with the full reduction of the heme b3 (Fig. 4, ·−·−). This three-phase reduction of the dinuclear center can be clearly seen when fitting the change in absorbance of the 595-nm band against potential (Fig. 5 A). The data can be fitted to three n = 1 Nernst components. The first phase corresponds to the breaking of the μ-oxo bridge, between the FeB and the heme b3 and the associated shift of the 595-nm band to 635 nm, to form the His/H2O-ligated heme b3. This rearrangement of ligation within the dinuclear center has an E°′ of +325 mV. The second phase represents a change in the dinuclear center from the μ-oxo bridged species to one where the heme b3 is His/OH−-ligated and is associated with the shift in the 595-nm band to 605 nm. This phase has an E°′ of +240 mV. The final phase corresponds to the full reduction of both species from a ferric heme b3 to a ferrous heme b3 where the shoulder of the 605 and 635 bands detected at 595 nm disappear. Both processes occur at isopotentials where the E°′ is +50 mV (Fig6). By contrast, at pH 8.5, where only a single species is present (His/OH−) in the three electron-reduced form, a simple two-phase titer is seen (Fig. 5 B). The first phase represents the reduction of the FeB and breaking of the μ-oxo bridge and the second phase represents the full reduction of the high spin His/OH−-ligated heme b3.Figure 5Mediated redox titration of the dinuclear center of NOR.

At present there is no agreement on the mechanism of NO reduction by NOR. Arguments have been put forward for the two substrate NO molecules binding to FeB in the so-called cis model (2Hendricks J. Gohlke U. Saraste M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An alternative trans mechanism where one NO molecule binding to each of FeB and heme b3 has also been forwarded (2Hendricks J. Gohlke U. Saraste M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in both cases it is likely that at some point in the catalytic cycle a ferric heme b3 bound by a water molecule is formed. The identification of the 635-nm spectral form of heme b3 is the first time such a species has been identified. It can be supposed that this can be derived from the reduction of a μ-oxo bridged Fe(III)-Fe(III) dinuclear center, which would correlate to the 595-nm form of oxidized NOR. It then seems plausible that on reduction of the FeB of the dinuclear center with one electron a proton will also enter the catalytic site leading to a hydroxide-bound ferric heme b3(Fig. 6). MCD studies of this spectral form of the heme b3 are consistent with this assertion. There are many examples of high spin hemes that exhibit CT bands at ∼630 nm, and these characteristically arise from ferric hemes with His-H2O coordination (e.g. in E. coli cytochrome-bo3 oxidase (16Cheng J.C. Osborne G.A. Stephens P.J. Eton W.A. Nature. 1973; 241: 193-194Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Thus it seems most likely that the low pH 635-nm form of heme b3arises from a simple protonation of the putative hydroxide-bound high pH 605-nm form (Fig. 6). It is also important to note that experiments in our laboratory have shown that NOR activity in BTP buffer at pH 6.0 is 8-fold higher (∼70 s−1) than at pH 8.5 (∼8 s−1) (data not shown). The acidic nature of this optimal activity is in agreement with previously published data obtained in various buffers (32Heiss B. Frunke K. Zumft W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 171: 3288-3297Crossref Google Scholar, 33Dermashia M. Turk T. Hollocher T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10899-10905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this pH the His-H2O form of the enzyme dominates. The higher midpoint redox potential of this species than that of the His-hydroxide form may allow more rapid electron transfer from physiological electron donors such as cytochrome c and pseudoazurin. Having identified spectral signals that might correspond to distinct intermediates in the catalytic cycle of NOR, it is now necessary to try to trap these spectral forms in rapid-reaction experiments. Such experiments may in turn provide further insight into the N2O-generating half of the catalytic cycle.

In the present study, we show that a smaller construct that has the first 308 residues fused to the CT domain also binds insulin.

Martin-Martinez M. Mizuguchi K. Siddle K. Blundell T.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The consensus from these alignments is that the first 468 residues of the α-subunit contain two large homologous domains L1 and L2 separated by a cysteine-rich (CYS) region (4Bajaj M.

However, this construct does not bind ligand, whereas studies on minimized receptors show that, when fusing the L1-CYS-L2 domain to either of the C-terminal α-subunit sequences, IGFIR residues 691–706 or IR residues 704–719 (CT domains), 2Numbering of IR residues is according to Ullrich et al.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The affinity of the minimized insulin receptor (mIR) for insulin is ∼5–10 nm or similar to what is found for the soluble IR ectodomain (sIR) (8Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The solubilized holoreceptor (hIR) binds insulin with an affinity that is almost 1000-fold better than mIR and sIR (9Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that, when expressing a receptor construct in which 48 residues of the exon 9 region of the α-subunit were deleted, we obtained a dimeric α-α receptor fragment that bound insulin with full holoreceptor affinity. The data showed that the picomolar affinity was associated with the dimeric structure of the α-subunits, whereas monomers had nanomolar affinity for insulin (9Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover the dimeric construct (mIR.Fn0/Ex10) also displayed accelerated dissociation of labeled insulin in the presence of excess unlabeled insulin, which is another characteristic of the hIR. Accelerated dissociation can be explained by site-site interaction assuming that there are two insulin binding sites on the IR (10Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). One binding site on the receptor is proposed to interact with the classical binding site (site 1) on the insulin molecule, whereas the other receptor binding site is thought to interact with residues in the hexamer surface including the leucine residues in A13 and B17 (site 2) (10Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To obtain full picomolar affinity, it has been suggested that the insulin molecule cross-links the two α-subunits with the site 1 bound to receptor binding site 1 in one subunit and site 2 bound to receptor binding site 2 in the other subunit (10Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The nanomolar affinity obtained with mIR is believed to represent the interaction between the receptor binding site 1 located within mIR and the classical binding site of insulin, whereas higher affinity requires a dimeric construct that allows a cross-interaction with receptor binding site 2. This binding site 2 on IR may include ligand contact sites located within residues 469–703 of the α-subunit that are not present in mIR (9Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol.

Initially, we deleted the L2 domain from mIR and showed that this construct, consisting of the first 308 residues fused to the CT domain, also bound insulin with nanomolar affinity, whereas when we removed the CT domain from either mIR or IR308.CT, there was no measurable binding of insulin. Second, we found that insulin binding could be fully reconstituted from these non-binding receptor fragments by mixing them with a large excess of a free synthetic CT peptide. Finally, we used the strategy of reconstitution to demonstrate that a fragment corresponding to the first 255 residues of IR binds insulin with nanomolar apparent affinity when mixed with the CT peptide.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stably expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Cell transfection procedures and culture conditions were described in detail previously (7Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, samples of the receptor fragments were culture supernatants from BHK cells expressing the receptor construct. The construct IR468 consists of IR residues 1–468 fused to the FLAG epitope via the short peptide linker PRPS (716–719 of IR); all the constructs in the present study were equipped with this linker. The IR468 construct was made by PCR amplification using the IR sequence as template with the antisense primer 5′-TCAGATGGCCTAGGACAGCTAGCCTTGTC-3′ (AvrII site underlined) and the sense primer 5′-CCTCGGCCTCATTGAAGAAAT-3′ recognizing a sequence upstream from the Bsu36I site (corresponding to IR residues 407–408). The resulting fragment was digested with Bsu36I and AvrII and ligated into the corresponding sites of the plasmid encoding IR468.CT (7Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For making the constructs IR308.CT, IR308, IR255.CT, and IR255, the following oligonucleotides were made: 5′-GGAGATGGCCTAGGGACGAAAACCACGTTGTGCAGGTAATCCTCAAATGTACAGGGACCCAGGCATGG-3′, 5′-AAGATGGCCTAGGACAGGGACCCAGGCA-3′, 5′-GGAGGATGGCCTAGGGACGAAAACCACGTTGTGCAGGTAATCCTCAAATGTGTTCACACAGCGCCA-3′, and 5′-AAGATGGCCTAGGGTTCACACAGCGCCA-3′ (AvrII sites underlined). These oligonucleotides were used as antisense primers for PCR amplifications using the IR sequence as template, with the sense primer 5′-TATCCTGGATTCCGTGGAGG-3′ recognizing a sequence upstream from the Asp718 site (corresponding to IR residues 161–162). The resulting fragments were digested with Asp718 and AvrII and ligated into the corresponding sites of the plasmid encoding IR468.CT. Receptors with C-terminal FLAG epitope were purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized M2 FLAG antibody from Sigma. BHK culture supernatant was applied to a FLAG affinity gel column. The column was washed with TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), and the bound receptor proteins were eluted with 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS plus 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Purified receptors were stored in elution buffer at 4 °C and analyzed within 2 weeks. The receptor fragments were detected by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody F26 that was raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 39–75 near the N terminus of the IR α-subunit. For immunoblotting, samples were first affinity-purified using an anti-FLAG column and the eluate was mixed with 0.33 volumes of 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer (Novex) containing 400 mm dithiothreitol and heated at 70 °C for 10 min before loading on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Novex). After electrophoresis in MES running buffer (Novex) proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked by incubating with blocking buffer (2% defatted skim milk, 1% BSA in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The F26 antibody (diluted in TBS plus 1% BSA) was added to the membrane and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBS before incubating with peroxidase-conjugated antibody against mouse IgG (Dako, Denmark) diluted in TBS plus 1% BSA. Finally the blot was washed with TBS, and immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using a FujiFilm CCD camera and Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co.). For insulin binding studies, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation assay was used. For this assay, receptor samples were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 100 μl with 20–50 pm 125I-labeled Tyr-A14-substituted insulin together with unlabeled insulin and/or CT peptides at various concentrations in binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25% (w/v) BSA, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100). Bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 0.2% γ-globulin and 250 μl of 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and counted in a γ-counter. For competition experiments, the concentration of receptor was adjusted to yield less than 20% binding when no competing insulin was added. Binding data were fitted using nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Chemical cross-linking was performed essentially as described (13Waugh S.M. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Samples of anti-FLAG column purified receptor with or without CT peptide (10 μm) were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 125I-insulin (0.2–0.3 nm) in presence or absence of unlabeled insulin (1 μm). DSS in dimethyl sulfoxide was added from a 10 mm stock solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 15 min on ice, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.33 volume of 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer and samples were separated by SDS electrophoresis as described for immunoblotting above. The gel was dried and exposed to a Fuji imaging plate, and the image was captured using a Fuji FLA-300 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). For all experiments, except that shown in Fig. 4 B, the CT peptide used comprised residues 704–719 of IR (NH2-TFEDYLHNVVFVPRPS-COOH). For the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B, four additional modified CT peptides were used as explained in the figure legend. All peptides were made by standard Fmoc solid phase peptide chemistry. Peptide amides were synthesized on TentaGel RAM resin (Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany). Series of 100–200-mg resin portions were coupled with 8 eq of Fmoc-l-amino acids (Novabiochem) for 1–3 h, using 8 eq of diisopropylcarbodiimide and 8 eq of 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole in N-methylpyrrolidone as activation. Fmoc deprotection was done by treating the resin with 30% piperidine/N-methylpyrrolidone for 20 min. Peptide acids were synthesized on Wang resin (Novabiochem). The peptides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% phenol, 3% triisopropylsilane, and 2% thioanisole for 1–2 h, and the peptides were precipitated in diethylether and lyophilized after suspension in 10% AcOH or 1% NH4HCO3. We previously expressed mIR consisting of the first three domains of the human insulin receptor (L1-CYS-L2, residues 1–468) fused directly to residues 704–719 from the C terminus of the α-subunit and the Flag epitope (7Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study we made five new constructs based on this minimized receptor, mIR (called IR468.CT in the present study), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Including IR468.CT a total of six constructs were stably expressed in BHK cells, and the culture supernatants were used for the various assays. An overview of the constructs is shown in Fig. 1. To be able to detect receptor fragments that were poorly expressed, the constructs were initially purified by affinity chromatography using an anti-FLAG column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified proteins were then analyzed by immunoblotting using the receptor antibody, F26, which recognized all the receptor fragments. The immunoblot is shown in Fig. 2. The apparent molecular mass of IR468.CT and IR468 was ∼80 kDa (lanes 1 and 2), whereas masses of ∼50 kDa were found for the IR308.CT and IR308 constructs (lanes 3 and 4) and 35 kDa for the IR255.CT and IR255 fragments (lanes 5 and 6) consistent with the predicted molecular mass for the glycosylated polypeptides. The faint band seen for the IR255.CT construct (lane 5) reflects its very low level of expression as compared with the other fragments. The affinities of the recombinant receptors and mixtures of fragments and CT peptides were determined in a soluble competition assay where receptors were precipitated with PEG. Representative binding curves are shown in Fig. 3, and an overview of the binding affinities is presented in Table I. Moreover, Fig. 4 A shows an experiment illustrating the ability of this assay to detect insulin binding to each of the six fragments in the absence and presence of 10 μm CT peptide. The minimized receptor, IR468.CT (mIR), yielded an affinity of 11 ± 1 nm, which is similar to what has been found in previous studies (7Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Deleting the L2 domain from IR468.CT resulted in the IR308.CT construct. Although the binding capacity for this construct was clearly diminished (see Fig. 4 A), it gave an affinity of 45 ± 21 nm, which is only ∼4-fold less than for IR468.CT. For the corresponding constructs without the CT domain, IR468 and IR308 insulin binding was not detectable (i.e. these bound no more labeled insulin than the control without receptor; see Fig. 4 A). Thus, the presence of the CT domain is apparently critical for insulin binding. To further investigate the role of the CT domain, we synthesized a 16-amino acid peptide (CT peptide) corresponding to this domain (IR704–719), and investigated whether the free CT peptide affected insulin binding when mixed with various receptor fragments. Adding 10 μm CT peptide to IR468 reconstituted insulin binding, as we obtained approximately the same nanomolar affinity (9.3 ± 0.6 nm) as found for the IR468.CT (Fig. 3). The apparent affinity determined was dependent on the concentration of the CT peptide. The affinity increased from ∼100 nm to 10 nm when increasing the concentration of the CT peptide from 0.05 to 5 μm, whereas further increase to 10 μm did not improve the apparent affinity any further (Fig. 3). Functional reconstitution was also obtained when mixing IR308 with 10 μm CT peptide, resulting in an apparent affinity of 11 ± 2 nm. The addition of CT peptide to IR468.CT did not have any significant influence on its insulin affinity, whereas the apparent affinity of IR308.CT in the presence of 10 μm CT peptide increased by a factor of 2, yielding an IC50 of 21 ± 3 nm. Subsequently, we tested even smaller N-terminal fragments of the insulin receptor for their ability to bind insulin and found that the IR255.CT and IR255 constructs consisting of the 255 first residues of IR with or without CT domain both bound insulin with an apparent affinity of ∼10 nm in the presence of 10 μm CT peptide. None of these two constructs could be detected to bind insulin in the PEG precipitation assay in the absence of added CT peptide (Fig. 4 A), despite the fact that the IR255.CT constructs appeared to be able to cross-link insulin in the chemical cross-linking experiment shown below (Fig. 5). As can be seen from the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A (no receptor), addition of 10 μm CT peptide alone did not result in any increase in precipitation of labeled insulin in the PEG precipitation assay. In summary, the binding data indicate that residues 309–468 of IR, which include approximately one third of the CYS domain and the whole L2 domain, do not play a major role in the binding of insulin to IR468.CT (mIR) and that both the presence as well as the positioning of the CT domain are critical determinants for the ability of insulin to bind to the N-terminal part of the insulin receptor. We have shown previously that a chimeric IR468.CT containing the CT sequence from the corresponding domain of the IGFI receptor bound insulin, whereas its replacement with the CT domain from the IRRR completely abolished binding of insulin (7Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To see whether the comparable changes in the CT peptide sequence would have a similar effect on its ability to reconstitute insulin binding, we tested two new variants of the CT peptide in the PEG binding assay with IR468 (Fig. 4 B). The result clearly shows that the IGFIR-like CT peptide was able to reconstitute insulin binding, whereas binding was undetectable with the IRRR-like CT peptide. Only four of the residues in the IRRR-like peptide are different from corresponding positions in both the IR and IGFIR-like CT peptides (see sequences in Fig. 4 B). Of these four positions, the insulin receptor phenylalanine 714, which is conserved as phenylalanine 701 in the IGFIR, is particularly interesting, as it has been shown by alanine scanning mutagenesis that alanine in this position is disruptive for ligand binding in both receptors (15Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsbøll V.L. Whttaker L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we synthesized a new CT peptide comprising residues 703–719 of IR, in which the phenylalanine in position 714 had been replaced by alanine, and we tested this peptide for its ability to reconstitute binding in the PEG binding assay. As this peptide also had an extra N-terminal lysine corresponding to IR position 703, the corresponding wild type CT peptide was also included as a positive control. As shown in Fig5 B, binding was undetectable with the F714A mutated CT peptide, suggesting that the phenylalanine in position 714 plays a very important role in the establishment of a functional binding site for insulin within the IR. Labeled insulin was chemically cross-linked to anti-Flag tag-purified receptor fragments or mixtures using DSS and separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (Fig. 5). When no CT peptide was added, cross-linking could only be demonstrated by the IR468.CT construct (lanes A) and the IR255.CT constructs (lanes E), showing bands of 80–90 and 40 kDa, respectively. Cross-linking is also expected to have occurred with the IR308.CT construct (lanes C), but in this case detection seems to be obscured by co-migration of nonspecifically cross-linked albumin (55–65 kDa). Albumin originates from the insulin tracer preparation and gives rise to bands seen in all lanes, including the control with no receptor (lanes G). When 10 μm free CT peptide was added to the samples, cross-linking of insulin tracer could be seen for all six receptor fragments including the three constructs, IR468, IR308, and IR255, lacking the CT domain (lanes B, D, and F). The appearance of these three bands probably reflects the functional reconstitution of an insulin binding site involving residues within the first 255 amino acids of these fragments. In all cases the cross-linked tracer could be displaced with unlabeled insulin, demonstrating the specific cross-linking of insulin to the N-terminal insulin fragments. For the constructs IR308.CT (lanes C) and IR255.CT (lanes E), the intensity of the corresponding bands of approximately 55 and 40 kDa were seen to increase as a result of addition of CT peptide, probably reflecting the increase in insulin binding affinity also seen in the PEG precipitation assay (Fig. 4 A). The relative band intensities for the different receptor constructs in this cross-linking experiment are not only dependent on the binding affinity and receptor concentration, but also on the accessibility and proximity of amino groups on both the receptor and insulin. Thus, it appears that the cross-linking efficiency of IR468.CT with insulin (lanes A) is much greater than that of, for example, IR308 + CT peptide (lanes D). Previously, we identified a monomeric minimized IR α-subunit (mIR/IR468.CT) that binds insulin with the same nanomolar affinity as the soluble ectodomain, sIR (7Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study we have produced even smaller insulin receptor fragments trying to further delineate the minimum requirements for nanomolar binding affinity for insulin. The nanomolar binding affinity obtained with IR468.CT is believed to reflect the interaction between binding site 1 on the receptor and the classical binding site on the insulin molecule described in the binding models proposed by Schäffer (17Schäffer L. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 101 Suppl. 2: 7-9Google Scholar) and DeMeyts (11De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These models imply that, in addition to this site, there is another receptor binding site 2 on the other receptor monomer, which is required for the full holoreceptor affinity when insulin binds to both sites in a cross-linking mechanism. To further characterize the nanomolar binding site, we first made the IR308.CT construct, which is IR468.CT deleted of the L2 domain, and found that this construct also bound insulin but with an apparent affinity ∼4-fold lower than IR468.CT (Table I). In contrast, the corresponding constructs without the CT domain, IR468 and IR308, did not bind insulin. This supports previous findings that the presence of the CT domain is essential for insulin binding but tha"

Recombinant rat Lp82 (rLp82) was expressed using the baculovirus system, purified with Ni-NTA affinity and DEAE-ion exchange chromatographies, and characterized by SDS-PAGE, casein zymography, and immunoblotting.

Sequencing of the autolytic fragments showed loss of three amino acids from the N terminus and cleavage near the IS2 region. Also, Lp82 and calpain 2 were found to hydrolyze each other. Calpastatin inhibited calpain 2 activity, but not Lp82. Homology modeling suggested that the lack of inhibition of Lp82 by calpastatin was due to molecular clashes at the unique AX1 region of Lp82. Lp82 also hydrolyzed calpastatin. These results suggested that Lp82 might regulate other calpain activities and cause hydrolysis of substrates such as crystallins during lens cataract formation.

Calpains (EC 3.4.22.17) comprise a family of non-lysosomal, cysteine proteases with a neutral pH optimum and a requirement for calcium for activation (1Murachi T. Tanaka K. Hatanaka M. Murakami T. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1980; 19: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). They are widely distributed in animal tissues, where they are involved in a variety of cellular processes involving calcium (2Murachi T. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 263-294PubMed Google Scholar). Calpains consist of the ubiquitous calpains 1 (μ-calpain), 2 (m-calpain), and 10; and tissue-specific calpains such as 3 (muscle-specific p94), 8, and 9 (3Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J., Li, X.

Recently, splice variants of calpain 3 such as lens-specific Lp82 and Lp85, retina-specific Rt88, and cornea-specific Cn94 were found in the eye (7Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Invest.

For example, mutations in muscle-preferred p94 calpain cause muscular dystrophy type 2A in man (11Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C.

N-terminal sequence insert region van der Waals calpastatin Lens-specific calpain Lp82 belongs to a new subclass of calpains, termed AX1, because they replace the NS region in the N-terminal domain I by using alternative exon 1, a portion of the 3′ end of intron 1 from the p94 gene. Common promoter elements in the eye may cause the alternative transcription of AX1 from the p94 gene. Other p94 variants contain combinations of splice variations in or near the IS1 and IS2 insert regions. Lp82 activity in young rat lenses is abundant and stable, because the IS1 and IS2 regions are splice deleted (12Ma H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp.

These calpains may regulate each other by proteolysis, because they are substrates for each other. Thus, the purpose of the present experiment was to study calpain interactions by analyzing the activation and regulation of Lp82 in lens. Experiments were performed using male Sprague-Dawley rats at 12 days of age. Experimental animals were handled in accordance with The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Publication, NIH 80-23). The cDNA for Lp82 from rat was cloned into a pFASTBAC HTb vector (Invitrogen) containing a His tag and rTEV protease cleavage site in the N terminus. This plasmid was transformed into DH10BAC-competent cells (Invitrogen), which contain the bacmid and the helper plasmid. Recombinant bacmid DNA containing Lp82 cDNA was isolated and used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) insect cells. Transfection was performed with recombinant Lp82 (rLp82) baculovirus amplified to 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Sf9 cells were cultured for 3 days for rLp82 protein expression. Cultured cells were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithioerythritol. The soluble protein was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 30 min. Soluble Lp82 was purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) metal-affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol under native conditions. Further purification was performed by high performance liquid chromatography using a 7.5-mm inner diameter × 7.5-cm DEAE 5PW column (TOSOH, Japan) with a linear 0.0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in buffer A containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithioerythritol at 1 ml min−1 flow rate. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed by absorbing 50 μl of each column fraction in 0.1m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.3) overnight onto 96-well flat bottom plates (Corning Glass). The wells were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated with Lp82 (1:1000 dilution) antibody for 1 h (12Ma H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fractions containing Lp82 were visualized using goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). The peaks were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Microcon 10, Millipore). Purified rLp82 was incubated with 1.4 mm calcium in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 min. To inactivate calpains, purified rLp82 and recombinant calpain 2 (rcalpain 2) from rat (more than 98% purity, Calbiochem) were incubated with 5 mm iodoacetamide in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 2 h. After quenching excess iodoacetamide with 10 mm dithioerythritol, 1.2 units of rcalpain 2 or rLp82 were added and incubated with calcium for 1 h at 37 °C. Fragments were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 0.22 units of rcalpain 2 or rLp82 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5 μm calpastatin purified from human erythrocytes (Calbiochem) and 1.5 mm calcium. Hydrolyzed calpastatin fragments were detected by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting and casein zymography were used to detect calpain degradation and calpain activity, respectively. SDS-PAGE was performed on discontinuous, 8 or 12% gels (Invitrogen) using the glycine buffer system. Immunoblots for Lp82 and calpain 2 were performed by electrotransferring proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 30 V (constant) for 100 min at an ice-cold temperature using Tris-glycine buffer (12 mm Tris, 96 mm glycine, 20% methanol). The anti-Lp82 antibody and anti-calpain 2 antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution, and immunoreactivity was visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium and alkaline phosphatase conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). 8% (1-mm thick) gels, co-polymerized with 0.05% casein were pre-run with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were then loaded and run. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated with slow shaking overnight at room temperature in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm calcium. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bands of caseinolysis appeared white. rLp82 was autolyzed by incubating in 1.4 mm calcium for 10 and 90 min at 30 °C, and 12% SDS-PAGE (1 mm thick) gels were then run and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 30 V (constant) for 100 min. Membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol for 10 min and destained with 50% methanol. Destained membranes were dried, and bands were excised for Edman N-terminal sequencing. Proteins (or peptides) were sequenced by Deb McMillen in the Biotechnology Laboratory at the University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, on an Applied Biosystems model 492 Procise N-terminal protein sequencer using N-terminal Edman degradation chemistry. Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified with an Applied Biosytems model 140 PTH Analyzer and a model 785A detector set at wavelength 269 nm. Protein homology modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics OCTANE2 work station, using MOE (The Molecular Operating Environment, Version 2001.01, Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada, www.chemcomp.com). The Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) was used as the structural template for building homology models. The rat Lp82 and rat calpain 3 sequences were taken from the NCBI Protein Data Base (NCB accession numbers AAC04848 and AAA41790, respectively). Each sequence was aligned to the template sequence (human calpain 2, Protein Data Bank number 1KFU) using the protein alignment tools in MOE. The alignment conditions were tree-based using an initial pair-wise buildup followed by round robin and iterative refinement. The group-to-group calculation used the Gonnet substitution matrix and had a gap start penalty of 3 and a gap extend penalty of 1. The alignment was not biased by either actual or predicted secondary structure. The homology modeling procedure involved building three-dimensional models of both sequences using human calpain 2 as a template structure. Two types of models were considered. The first assumed that Lp82 co-existed with calpain 4, thus all atoms of calpain 4 were included during the modeling and minimization. The other type of model did not consider calpain 4 as part of the final structure. In addition, models were constructed so that the outgap residues (residues that extend beyond the terminals of the template chain) were either ignored or included in the modeling procedure. Homology modeling generated ten intermediate models, from which the best scoring model was chosen and minimized to produce the final model (Amber89 forcefield, root mean square distance = 0.01). To investigate the potential interaction of Lp82 with calpain 4, van der Waals (VDW) interaction energies were calculated and are reported on Fig. 7. The structure labeled Lp82* was constructed with the assumption that calpain 4 was present, with the outgap residues included. Calpain 3 models did not include the presence of calpain 4, since calpain 3 is well known not to associate with calpain 4 (16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To test if Lp82 is autolytic, rLp82 was incubated with calcium for 0–90 min. Unautolyzed, intact rLp82 migrated at 85 kDa instead of 82 kDa (Fig. 1, lane marked “0 min”). This is because rLp82 contains 26 additional amino acids in the N terminus from the His tag and vector protease cleavage site. Autolytic fragments at 82, 60, and 22 kDa appeared after incubation with calcium (Fig. 1 A, arrows). Production of these fragments was inhibited by addition of EGTA or cysteine protease inhibitor E64 (data not shown). The origin of the fragments from Lp82 autolysis was determined by immunoblotting using two different antibodies. One antibody recognized epitopes near the deleted IS2 region at the end of Lp82 domain III (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3), while the second antibody recognized the N terminus (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). The 82-kDa autolytic fragment reacted with both antibodies, the 60-kDa fragment reacted only with the N-terminal antibody, and 22 kDa was visualized only with the IS2 antibody. These results suggested that the 82- and 60-kDa fragments contained the N-terminal region, while the 22-kDa fragment was the C-terminal region. This was confirmed by direct N-terminal sequencing of the 82- and 22-kDa fragments (Fig. 2). The 82-kDa fragment showed loss of 29 amino acids from the N terminus. This included 3 amino acids from Lp82, the His tag region, and the protease cleavage site domain from the vector (Fig. 2 A). The autolytic cleavage producing the new N-terminal sequence on the 22-kDa fragment started at arginine (R) residue 524 near the deleted IS2 region (Fig. 2 B). The location of autolytic sites in intact Lp82 is showed in Fig. 2 C. Thus, the 82-kDa fragment was rLp82-truncated at leucine 30 in the N terminus, the 60-kDa fragment was comprised of residues from leucine (L) 30 to aspartic acid (D) 549, and the 22 kDa was from arginine (R) 550 near the IS2 region to the C-terminal alanine residue (A) 735. Since rodent lenses contain calpain 2 and calpastatin in addition to Lp82, we next investigated how these components of the calpain system interacted with each other. This was accomplished by inactivating rcalpain 2 and rLp82 by alkylation of the active site cysteine and then testing to see whether the proteins were proteolyzed by fresh, active rLp82 or rcalpain 2 (Fig. 3) as detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A), and immunoblotting with Lp82 (Fig. 3 B) and calpain 2 antibodies (Fig. 3 C). When active Lp82 was incubated with inactive calpain 2 protein in the presence of calcium, the calpain 2 protein at 80 kDa was decreased (lane 5 in Fig. 3, A–C). When calcium was omitted, Lp82 and calpain 2 were not degraded (lane 4). Of course, addition of active Lp82 to inactive Lp82 protein caused a decrease in the Lp82 band (lane 6), and this was a confirmation of autolysis described above. In the converse experiment, when active calpain 2 was added to inactive Lp82 substrate, Lp82 was totally hydrolyzed (lane 2). Calpain 2 also autolyzed itself (lane 3). Thus, Lp82 and calpain 2 hydrolyzed each other, although Lp82 seemed the more sensitive substrate for calpain 2. Calpastatin (CS) purified from human erythrocytes migrated to 65 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Incubation of this CS with calpain 2 activated by calcium did not cause breakdown of CS (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Immunoblotting revealed that the calpain 2 did not undergo autolysis when it was incubated with CS (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), and the CS completely inhibited calpain 2 activity (Fig. 4 C, lane 2). Thus, CS was not a substrate for calpain 2, because CS inhibited calpain 2. In contrast, incubation of calcium-activated Lp82 with CS caused total hydrolysis of CS (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). This was accompanied by a decrease in apparent molecular mass of the Lp82 band (Fig. 4 B, lane 4) by removal of the N-terminal 29 amino acids as shown in Fig. 2, indicative of activation of Lp82. This was confirmed on zymograms (Fig. 4 C, lane 4) showing a smear band of active Lp82 below the usual Lp82 band. This smear band has been noted previously during in vivo activation of Lp82 (15Nakamura Y. Fukiage C., Ma, H. Shih M. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These data suggested that even when CS is present, Lp82 is not inhibited and that CS is actually a substrate for hydrolysis by Lp82. To determine the mechanism for the lack of inhibition of Lp82 by CS, a three-dimensional model of Lp82 was first constructed using the crystal structure of calpain 2 as a template (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). This was appropriate because calpain 2 and Lp82 have 51% sequence identity (7Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 454-461PubMed Google Scholar) and because the Lp82/calpain 2 match provided the best fit compared with using other templates such as papain. No significant differences between the three-dimensional structure Lp82 and calpain 2 were observed when domains IIa and b, III, and IV from each calpain were compared against each other. Similar results were observed when homology models of each domain were independently compared (data not shown). However, the helical AX1 domain I of Lp82 (30.2 Å based on model) was longer than domain I of calpain 2 (21.6 Å based on crystal structure). Since the longer extension on domain I could influence association of Lp82 to regulatory proteins, we also constructed a model of the association between the traditional calpain regulatory subunit (calpain 4) and domain I in Lp82 (Fig. 6 A). We found that the longer N-terminal extension on domain I of Lp82 could interfere with the association of Lp82 with calpain 4. This was similar to the predicted lack of association between calpain 4 and calpain 3 (16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), possibly because of long domain I (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, because of a short domain I, calpain 2 was able to interact well with the calpain 4 regulatory subunit (17Takano E., Ma, H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 C). For more objective observations, VDW interaction energies were also calculated using MOE. The VDW interaction energy between Lp82 and calpain 4 was 44,079,557 kcal/mol, and VDW contacts showing potential clashes were observed between domain I of Lp82 and calpain 4 (Fig. 7 B). Even when the Lp82 model (Lp82*) was constructed taking into account surroundings with calpain 4, the VDW interaction energy was still high (132,181 kcal/mol), and clashes were observed between Lp82 and calpain 4 (Fig. 7 C). The VDW interaction energy was also high between calpain 3 and calpain 4 (12,897,436 kcal/mol), and the clashes were also observed (data not shown). This result was consistent with a previous report for calpain 3 (16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, the VDW interaction energy between calpain 2 and calpain 4 from the crystal data was only 36 kcal/mol, and no clash was observed (Fig. 7 A). These data suggested that the atoms in domain I of Lp82 and calpain 4 were too close together to allow association between Lp82 and calpain 4.Figure 6Docking of calpain 4 (magenta) to Lp82 (green) (A) or to calpain 3 (light blue) (B) and published co-crystal structure of human calpain 2 (red) with calpain 4 (magenta) (C) (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In the expanded region of calpain 4 (white square), the residues in domain I are shown in stick form without hydrogen (yellow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enormous energies (44,079,557 and 12,897,436 kcal/mol) were homology models built and minimized without considering calpain 4 as part of the environment. To obtain these energies, the model was left in the MOE window, the crystal structure for calpain 4 was opened, and there were many VDW clashes. When calpain 4 was considered part of the environment during the model building, the calpain 4 atoms were copied directly to the final model and included in the minimization. Thus, the VDW interaction for Lp82* was lower (132,181 kcal/mol), since the atoms of calpain 4 were considered present when the sequence was modeled and minimized. A major finding of the present report was the site for autolysis of Lp82. Our data showed that the major autolytic site was in the IS2 region. This is in contrast to the parent gene product, calpain 3, which autolyzed in the IS1 region (18Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The splice deletion of IS1 apparently eliminated this autolytic site in Lp82. This is probably the reason why Lp82 is so stable in rodent lens (12Ma H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Nakamura Y. Fukiage C., Ma, H. Shih M. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and why it retains activity for at least 18 h in vitro (19Ueda Y. McCormack A.L. Shearer T.R. David L.L. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that the N-terminal half retained activity as evidenced as the smear band on zymograms (15Nakamura Y. Fukiage C., Ma, H. Shih M. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the prolonged activity of Lp82 in vitro may be due to a combination of the intact and autolyzed active forms of Lp82. The present report also showed that Lp82 and calpain 2 were substrates for each other. This could function as a mechanism to down-regulate of their activities. However, in lens Lp82 may be escape from degradation by calpain 2, because Lp82 and calpain 2 are localized in different regions. Lp82 is concentrated in the nucleus, while calpain 2 is concentrated in the epithelium (20Shearer T.R., Ma, H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Nakamura Y. Azuma M. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, Lp82 may provide prolonged activity in lens, even though Lp82 was a good substrate for calpain 2 in vitro. These results partially explain why Lp82 is the dominant calpain activity in selenite nuclear cataract (21Nakamura Y. Fukiage C. Shih M., Ma, H. David L.L. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1460-1466PubMed Google Scholar). The second finding of the present report was the discovery of the major difference between Lp82 and calpain 2 interactions with endogenous calpain inhibitor, CS. In the presence of calcium, calpain 2 was inhibited by CS. In contrast, Lp82 hydrolyzed CS, and thus Lp82 was not inhibited by CS. Our previous report also showed that CS domain I (137-amino acid peptide) exhibited poor inhibitory activity against native rat Lp82 (15Nakamura Y. Fukiage C., Ma, H. Shih M. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This would again favor Lp82 activity in the young rodent lens. A similar lack of inhibition by CS occurred against calpain 3 (16Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 7217-7232Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Since Lp82 and calpain 3 are from the same gene, lack of CS inhibition could be due to similar mechanisms. CS contains four homologous inhibitory domains. Each domain contains three regions designated as A, B, and C (23Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Imajoh S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2364-2370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Maki M. Bagci H. Hamaguchi K. Ueda M. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18866-18869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Region B is essential for inhibition and binds near the catalytic site in calpains 1 and 2. Regions A and C potentiate inhibitory activity by binding to domain IV of calpains 1 and 2 and to domain VI of calpain 4 (17Takano E., Ma, H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our homology model suggested that the extra amino acids in the N terminus of domain I in calpain 3 extend into the pocket used for association of calpain 4 to calpain 2 (Fig. 6). This N-terminal extension may interfere with the association of calpain 4 to calpain 3. Likewise, Lp82 also has unique N-terminal sequence termed AX1, which also extends into calpain 4 binding pocket (Fig 6). This may also interfere with the association of calpain 4 to Lp82. This was also confirmed by calculation of the VDW interaction energies (Fig. 7). When the calpain 4 was included in the final minimization, the VDW interaction energy was calculated to be 132,181 kcal/mol. This shows that many of the VDW clashes can be alleviated in the course of the minimization; however, the interaction energy remains large. This suggests that even with energy minimization, there is not enough room to accommodate all of the atoms in the protein interface area without having some atoms violate the VDW radii of others. The lack of room is visually supported by the pictures of the interface in Fig. 6, which shows that the extension at the N terminus of both Lp82 and calpain 3 extends from the calpain 2 template into the region where calpain 4 would normally bind. Minimized homology models could not place the outgap residues such that their atoms do not clash with atoms of the calpain 4. This could explain the high VDW interaction energies observed when the outgap residues were placed. During the homology modeling procedure, when the outgap residues were being modeled, the scoring of the homology model incorporates a term that reflects the VDW interaction energy between atoms already placed and those that are currently being placed. When the outgap residues were not included, the interaction energy in the presence of calpain 4 was 287 kcal/mol (data not shown), which is in the order magnitude of the interaction energy between calpain 2 and calpain 4 from the crystal structure (36 kcal/mol). The increase in VDW interaction energy when the model includes the outgap residues (287 kcal/mol to 132,181 kcal/mol) again suggests that the presence of the additional atoms contributes to VDW clashes that cannot be resolved with minimization. The presence of these potential clashes near the protein interface suggests that the unique AX1 region of Lp82 is responsible for blocking the calpain 4 association. Thus, the minimization part of the homology modeling cannot relieve all of the VDW interactions, because not enough room is present to move the outgap residues around in the region occupied by calpain 4. All modeling can do is minimize the number of potential VDW clashes/contacts. These results from homology modeling are consistent with our previous result showing that Lp82 was only poorly inhibited by CS, even in the presence of calpain 4 (15Nakamura Y. Fukiage C., Ma, H. Shih M. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As described above, inhibition of calpain 2 is potentiated by binding of CS to calpain 4 (17Takano E., Ma, H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In fact, rcalpain 2 used in the present experiment contained calpain 4, since the chaperone-like effect of calpain 4 was used for producing recombinant calpain 2 (25Graham-Siegenthaler K. Gauthier S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30457-30460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of calpain 4 binding to Lp82 may explain why CS was not an effective inhibitor of Lp82, although the crystal structure of Lp82 will be needed to fully understand the inhibition mechanism. Lack of inhibition is important physiologically because it would allow Lp82 to be active in lens in the presence of CS. Furthermore, degradation of CS by Lp82 may help explain how calpain 2 escapes inhibition by CS to become active in lens. We also hypothesize that in young rodent cataracts, influx of calcium leads to Lp82 activation, since Lp82 has a lower calcium requirement for activation than calpain 2 (Fig. 8). 2Y. Ueda, C. Fukiage, M. Shih, T. R. Shearer, and L. L. David, unpublished data.Lp82 cleaves CS, which eliminates inhibition of calpain 2 by CS. Both active Lp82 and calpain 2 truncate crystallins, leading to insolubilization and precipitation of crystallins. Oxidation enhances precipitation of truncated crystallins (Fig. 8). Activated Lp82 may be the most active calpain in young rodent lenses. However, four deleted nucleotides in exon 1 produce a stop codon in the Lp82 transcripts in man. 3H. Ma, C. Fukiage, M. Azuma, and T. R. Shearer, unpublished data. However, an Lp82-like cleavage site was observed on human αA crystalline (26Takemoto L.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, another p94 splice variant may assume the function of Lp82 in human lens. We gratefully thank Dr. Debra A.

Aberrant β-catenin signaling has also been implicated in promoting human colorectal carcinomas as well as a variety of other cancers. To study the molecular and cellular biological functions of β-catenin in a controlled fashion, we created a regulatable form of activated β-catenin by fusion to a modified estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain (G525R). Transfection of tissue culture cells with expression vectors encoding this hybrid protein allows the signal transduction function of β-catenin to be induced by the synthetic estrogen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, leading to regulated activation of a β-catenin-lymphocyte enhancer-binding factor-dependent reporter gene as well as induction of endogenous cyclin D1 expression. The activation of ER-β-catenin signaling rescues RK3E cells from anoikis and correlates with an increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. The inhibition of anoikis by ER-β-catenin can be abolished by a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitor, PD98059. Evidence is also provided to show that ER-β-catenin down-regulates cadherin protein levels. These findings support a key role for activated β-catenin signaling in processes that contribute to tumor formation and progression. β-Catenin signaling plays a key role in a variety of cellular contexts during embryonic development and tissue differentiation.

The association with β-catenin is necessary for cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion, and β-catenin also serves a non-cadherin-dependent signal transduction function in a variety of cellular contexts (33Behrens J.

Another positive regulator of the β-catenin pathway, integrin-linked kinase, has also been found to promote nuclear translocation of β-catenin and transcriptional activation by the β-catenin-LEF complex (44Novak A.

Deregulated β-catenin signaling has been observed in human tumor cells and is thought to play a pivotal role in the genesis of a variety of malignancies (33Behrens J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Mutational inactivation of the APC protein contributes to the accumulation of β-catenin and deregulated expression of its downstream target genes (such as c-myc, WISP, and cyclin D1), some of which have also been implicated in human cancers (51Pennica D.

In many tumors expressing wild-type APC, constitutive activation of the β-catenin-LEF signaling pathway can be attributed to mutations of the N-terminal phosphorylation sites in β-catenin (Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45), which result in stabilization of the protein and consequent signal activation (56Ilyas M.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Although the pivotal role of β-catenin in malignant transformation is well substantiated, the cell biological consequences of β-catenin signaling are not clearly defined. To study the functions of β-catenin in a controlled fashion, we created a regulatable form of activated β-catenin by fusion of the entire protein (β-catenin S37A/S45A) to a modified estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain (G525R) (59Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of this protein in several cell lines by transfection allows the signal transduction function of β-catenin to be induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), leading to activation of a β-catenin-LEF-dependent reporter construct. Using this inducible system we demonstrate that β-catenin signaling correlates with diminished cell-substrate adhesion and can rescue RK3E cells from anoikis by a process that appears to involve MAP kinase activation. We also provide evidence that ER-β-catenin down-regulates cadherin protein levels. These findings support a key role for enhanced β-catenin signaling in processes that contribute to tumor formation and progression. Human β-catenin was first amplified from a cDNA library by PCR, and site-directed mutagenesis was then used to generate the activated mutant form of β-catenin (S37A/A45A). Restriction sites were engineered into PCR primers which allowed fusion of the modified hormone binding domain of the murine estrogen receptor (ER-HBD) in-frame with β-catenin S37A/A45A. To generate ER-β-catenin, ER-HBD G525R was amplified by PCR and cloned into an in-house mammalian expression vector under the control of the human cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter at the XbaI-BamHI sites. The human β-catenin S37A/A45A was also amplified by PCR and fused in-frame at the C terminus of ER-HBD using the restriction sites ClaI and BamHI. A similar strategy was used to generate β-catenin-ER. Both constructs were sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced into the constructs during PCR amplification. Both chimeras were expressed with an N-terminal epitope tag encoding a 16-amino acid portion of the Haemophilus influenzae hemagglutinin (HA) gene. A β-catenin-LEF-responsive reporter gene was constructed by linking the coding sequences for a firefly luciferase gene to the interleukin-2 minimal promoter following five copies of LEF binding sites. For the control vector used to normalize the transfections and reporter assays the Renilla luciferase gene is under the control of a constitutive thymidine kinase promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). 293T cells were obtained from GenHunter Corporation (Nashville, TN), and RK3E cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 105 cells were seeded into each well of a 12-well plate and transfected ∼18 h later. RK3E cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For generation of stable transfected cell lines, RK3E cells were transfected with the expression plasmid encoding ER-β-catenin along with a selection plasmid pcDNA3.1 (−) (Invitrogen) encoding a neomycin resistance gene at a ratio of either 10:1 or 50:1 (ER-β-catenin:pcDNA3.1). Two days later, the cells were split at a 1:10 dilution, and the following day, the standard culture medium was replaced with standard medium containing either 300 or 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). The selective medium was changed every 3–4 days, and 2 weeks later 60 clones were picked and expanded. To select for clones expressing ER-β-catenin, the clonal lines were transfected individually with the β-catenin-LEF reporter plasmid, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 1 μm 4-HT (Sigma) for 2 days and then analyzed using a dual luciferase assay to identify those with optimal basal and induced β-catenin activity. A dual luciferase assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Promega). RK3E and 293T cells were transfected with test plasmids of interest along with the β-catenin-LEF firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and the thymidine kinase-Rennila luciferase control plasmid. Two days post-transfection, the cells were harvested and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Stop and Glow assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Briefly, the cells were lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer, and 10 μl of each cell lysate sample was transferred to a 96-well plate. 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent II was first injected to each well to measure the firefly luciferase activity followed by injection of 100 μl of Stop and Glow reagent for the measurement of the Renilla luciferase activities using a MicroLumat LB96P (Wallac). RK3E cells expressing ER-β-catenin (clones 27 and 96) and a control clone with no expression of ER-β-catenin were grown with or without 1 μm 4-HT for 2 days. Cell extracts were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with appropriate amounts of complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche). Approximately 10 μg of each sample was resolved in a Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (Novex), transferred to nitrocellulose followed by Western blot analysis using antisera directed against phospho-specific MAP kinase (New England Biolab), MAP kinase (New England Biolab), E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories), β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories), HA tag (Covance), vimentin (Lab Vision Corporation), and keratin (Lab Vision Corporation) as described previously (60Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A. Brauer A.W. Seidel-Dugan C. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, RK3E cells expressing ER-β-catenin (clones 27 and 96) and a control clone with no expression of ER-β-catenin were grown with or without 1 μm 4-HT for 2 days. Cell extracts were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected as the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction. The pellet of each sample was then washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and solubilized in RIPA buffer and analyzed as the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. Approximately 250 μg of the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction was precipitated with 5 μg of anti-E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-α-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies in a total volume of 1.2 ml. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, 50 μl of γ-bind beads (AmershamBiosciences) was added to each sample. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer plus 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Western blot analysis was performed as described above. An RK3E cell line expressing ER-β-catenin (clone 27) and a control RK3E cell line (clone 152) with no expression of ER-β-catenin were first grown in eight-well Lab-Tek II chamberslides (Nalgen Nunc International) on coverslips to allow cell attachment overnight and then cultured in standard growth medium with or without 1 μm 4-HT for either 1 or 2 days. The cells were then fixed with ice-cold methanol:acetone (1:1) at –20 °C for 10 min. After incubation in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min, the cells were incubated with antiserum against β-catenin (1:500, Transduction Laboratories), E-cadherin (1:50, Transduction Laboratories) and HA (1:50, Covance) diluted in blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature. After washing, the coverslips were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Immune Research) at a dilution of 1:200 for 45 min at room temperature. After brief washing, the localization of β-catenin was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Control RK3E cells (clone 4) or ER-β-catenin-expressing RK3E cells (clone 27) were grown with or without 4-HT treatment for 1 or 2 days. RNA was prepared (RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment. The expression of cyclin D1, a gene known to be transcriptionally activated by β-catenin signaling (53Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar, 54Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), was measured in the various RNA samples by TaqMan quantitative PCR. Specific oligonucleotide primers and a fluorogenic probe were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression levels, normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene, were calculated using the standard curves method as described by the manufacturer of the TaqMan instrument (Applied Biosystems). 12-well tissue culture plates were coated with 200 μl (6 mg/ml in 95% ethanol) of poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEME; Sigma) by incubation overnight at 37 °C. To perform the anoikis assay, control or ER-β-catenin-expressing RK3E cells were trypsinized into a single cell suspension, and 2.5 ml was cultured in poly-HEME-coated plates at a density of ∼105 cells/ml (total of 2.5 × 105 cells) in the absence or presence of 1 μm4-HT in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. As a positive control, parental RK3E cells were infected with a retroviral construct coexpressing β-catenin S37A/A45A and a marker green fluorescence protein. Five days after infection the cells were harvested and plated as described above in poly-HEME-coated plates. Suspended cells were incubated at 37 °C for ∼18 h. Cells were then harvested, washed, and stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin antibodies (PharMingen) and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). Because the pool of positive control cells infected with the β-catenin S37A/A45A-expressing retrovirus contained both expressing and nonexpressing cells, the percentage of viable RK3E cells that expressed β-catenin S37A/A45A (green fluorescence protein-positive population) was compared with the percentage of viable RK3E cells that did not express β-catenin S37A/A45A (green fluorescence protein-negative population). To study the role of activated β-catenin in signal transduction and cellular transformation we developed a system in which the activity of β-catenin could be rapidly and conditionally regulated. For this purpose an ER fusion strategy was utilized where the HBD of ER is fused to a protein of interest, thereby creating an estrogen-regulated protein activity (61Mattioni T. Louvion J.F. Picard D. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 335-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These ER fusion proteins are generally inactive and can be induced by estrogen or synthetic steroids such as 4-HT. Although not applicable to all proteins, such a strategy has been successful in generating a variety of functionally hormone-dependent proteins including cytoplasmic enzymes (Src, Raf, and MAP kinase kinase) (62Aziz N. Cherwinski H. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 63Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transcription factors (Myc and LEF) (64Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Aoki M. Hecht A. Kruse U. Kemler R. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ER-β-catenin fusion constructs were made by designing expression vectors in which sequences encoding an activated form of β-catenin, with a serine to alanine substitution at positions 37 and 45 (β-catenin S37A/A45A), were linked in-frame to sequences encoding a modified ER HBD (ER-G525R), which is unresponsive to estrogen yet can still be specifically activated by a synthetic estrogen, 4-HT (59Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the altered specificity of ER-G525R can prevent constitutive activation of ER fusion proteins by estrogen and/or estrogen agonists present in culture media (59Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the functional effects of creating a hybrid protein between ER and β-catenin were unknown, two different chimeras were generated to place the ER sequences at either the N terminus (ER-β-catenin) or at the C terminus (β-catenin-ER) of β-catenin. Both versions were engineered to contain an N-terminal influenza HA epitope tag and were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector with a cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer (Fig. 1A). To verify protein expression from these constructs, 293T cells were transfected using standard methods, and 2 days later cell extracts were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. Both constructs expressed β-catenin fusion proteins of expected size (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the ER-β-catenin and β-catenin-ER fusion proteins still retained transcriptional activity that could now be regulated by 4-HT, these proteins were analyzed using a dual luciferase reporter assay. A β-catenin-LEF-responsive reporter gene, similar to those described by others (67Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar), was constructed which consists of a firefly luciferase gene under the control of an interleukin-2 minimal promoter following five copies of a consensus LEF binding site. A control reporter plasmid was employed which expresses a Renilla luciferase gene whose expression is driven by a constitutive thymidine kinase promoter for transfection normalization (Fig. 2A).

This “ecto-ADA” has been postulated to regulate extracellular Ado levels, and also the function of CD26 as a co-stimulator of activated T cells. The CD26-binding site of human ADA has been localized by homolog scanning to the peripheral α2-helix (amino acids 126–143). Among the 5 non-conserved residues within this segment, Arg-142 in human and Gln-142 in mouse ADA largely determined the capacity for stable binding to CD26 (Richard, E., Arredondo-Vega, F. X., Santisteban, I., Kelly, S. J., Patel, D. D., and Hershfield, M. S. (2000) J. Exp. Med. 192, 1223–1235). We have now mutagenized conserved α2-helix residues in human and mouse ADA and used surface plasmon resonance to evaluate binding kinetics to immobilized rabbit CD26. In addition to Arg-142, we found that Glu-139 and Asp-143 of human ADA are also important for CD26 binding. Mutating these residues to alanine increased dissociation rates 6–11-fold and the apparent dissociation constant KD for wild type human ADA from 17 to 112–160 nm, changing binding free energy by 1.1–1.3 kcal/mol. This cluster of 3 charged residues appears to be a “functional epitope” that accounts for about half of the difference between human and mouse ADA in free energy of binding to CD26.

The mouse enzyme structure consists of an 8-stranded β-barrel surrounded by 8 α-helixes, with the deep active site pocket and an essential Zn2+ ion located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the β-barrel (1Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In humans, ADA occurs as a soluble 41-kDa monomer in all tissues. An “ecto” form of ADA also occurs in some tissues of humans and cattle, but not mice, which consists of up to two ADA monomers bound to a homodimeric “ADA complexing protein” with subunit of 110 kDa (2Nishihara H.

The latter has been identified as CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), or simply CD26, a multifunctional membrane glycoprotein expressed on epithelia of liver, gut, kidney, and exocrine glands as well as on thymocytes and activated T lymphocytes (6Morrison M.E.

Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). CD26 has 6 NH2-terminal cytoplasmic and 22 transmembrane amino acids; the 738-residue extracellular portion has a proximal glycosylated segment, a cysteine-rich domain, and a COOH-terminal region that contains the DPPIV active site. Several mostly hydrophobic amino acids located in the cysteine-rich domain of human CD26 have been implicated in ADA binding (8Dong R.P. Tachibana K. Hegen M. Munakata Y. Cho D. Schlossman S.F.

Studies of rat strains and knockout mice lacking DPPIV suggest that it functions in the hydrolysis/absorption of prolyl dipeptides and in regulating the biologic activity of some hormones and chemokines (10Tiruppathi C.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6874-6879Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). CD26 has been shown to act as a “co-stimulator” of antigen receptor-mediated activation of thymocytes and T lymphocytes (13Vivier I. Marguet D. Naquet P. Bonicel J. Black D. Li C.X. Bernard A.

There is conflicting evidence about whether DPPIV activity influences the co-stimulatory function of CD26 (16Tanaka T. Kameoka J. Yaron A. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4586-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Steeg C. Hartwig U. Fleischer B. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 164: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The possible role of “ecto-ADA” bound to CD26 in the development and maintenance of immune function has also been a subject of interest. In humans, the highest levels of ADA occur in lymphoid cells, and inherited ADA deficiency causes profound lymphocyte depletion, resulting in the fatal disorder severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (18Giblett E.R. Anderson J.E. Cohen F. Pollara B. Meuwissen H.J. Lancet. 1972; 2: 1067-1069Abstract PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 19Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2585-2625Google Scholar). This condition has usually been attributed to toxic intracellular effects of Ado and dAdo. It has also been postulated that in the absence of ADA, elevated extracellular Ado might impair lymphocyte differentiation and function by causing aberrant signal transduction via G-protein-coupled Ado receptors (reviewed in Ref. 19Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2585-2625Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ADA bound to CD26 controls levels of extracellular Ado and thus modulates Ado receptor signaling, presumed to be involved in T cell activation (7Kameoka J. Tanaka T. Nojima Y. Schlossman S. Morimoto C. Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 15Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. Immunol.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that ADA binding to CD26, unrelated to ADA catalytic activity, may be necessary for the co-stimulatory function of CD26 (21Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C. Blanco J. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,22Martin M. Huguet J. Centelles J.J. Franco R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4630-4643PubMed Google Scholar). Speculation that defective ADA-CD26 binding contributes to the pathogenesis of ADA-deficient SCID in humans prompted us to characterize the CD26-binding site of human ADA and to examine the effects of patient-derived ADA mutations on CD26 binding (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For these studies, we exploited the observation that mouse ADA, although 83% identical in sequence to the human enzyme, is unable to form a stable complex with CD26 (5Schrader W.P. West C.A. Miczek A.D. Norton E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19312-19318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Trotta P.P. Ahland M.P. Brown G.F. Balis M.E. Mol.

By using a panel of recombinant human-mouse ADA hybrids, we localized the CD26-binding site of human ADA to the carboxyl-terminal end of an 18-amino acid segment, residues 126–143 (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In mouse ADA this segment forms the peripheral α2-helix, located on the face opposite to the entrance to the active site pocket (1Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Arg-142 in human ADA and Gln-142 in mouse ADA largely determined the capacity to bind CD26. ADA from a healthy adult whose only expressed ADA allele carries the R142Q mutation (26Santisteban I. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Kelly S. Loubser M. Meydan N. Roifman C. Howell P.L. Bowen T. Weinberg K.I. Schroeder M.L. Hershfield M.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2081-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed markedly reduced binding to CD26 (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that, as in the mouse, ADA binding to CD26 is not essential for normal immune function. Our previous “homolog scanning” strategy focused on the 5 of 18 residues in the α2-helix at which the human and mouse ADA sequences have diverged. The methods used (gel filtration, nondenaturing PAGE, and immunoassay of cell-associated ADA) could detect only stable ADA-CD26 complexes. In the present study we have used alanine scanning mutagenesis (27Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) to evaluate the role in binding of conserved amino acids found in both human and mouse ADA, and we have used the more sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique to evaluate kinetic and equilibrium binding constants. CD26/DPPIV was purified from rabbit kidneys, and DPPIV activity was assayed, as described (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The two purified preparations used had DPPIV-specific activity of 7,667 or 7,883 μmol/min/mg and were essentially free of contaminating ADA activity. Purified recombinant human CD4 protein was obtained from Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tarrytown, NY). The 1C5 mouse mAb to purified human T lymphoblast ADA was prepared in this laboratory 2M. S. Hershfield, unpublished data.; its binding specificity has been reported (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp.

Wild type human and mouse ADA cDNAs and several mutant ADA cDNAs involving amino acids 126–143 (Fig. 1) were available from a previous study (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions were introduced into the wild type human ADA cDNA by PCR mutagenesis essentially as described (28Arredondo-Vega F.X. Kurtzberg J. Chaffee S. Santisteban I. Reisner E. Povey M.S.

All final ADA cDNA PCR products were cloned into pBluescript II KS and fully sequenced using the ABI 377 PRISM DNA Sequencing Instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). [35S]Methionine-labeled ADA was generated in vitro from ADA cDNAs in pBluescript, using the TNT Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega, Madison, WI). Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography, and they were also electrophoresed on cellulose acetate and stained for ADA activity in situ as described previously (28Arredondo-Vega F.X.

ADA cDNAs were ligated into the NcoI site of pZ plasmid (derived from pZC11 from which wild type human ADA cDNA had been excised (30Chang Z.Y. Nygaard P. Chinault A.C. Kellems R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). pZ/ADA plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli SØ3834, which has a deletion of the bacterial ADA gene (30Chang Z.Y. Nygaard P. Chinault A.C. Kellems R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The conditions used for expression are as reported previously (23Richard E.

ADA activity in these extracts was assayed, and ADA protein was analyzed by Western blotting using goat anti-human ADA antiserum and also the 1C5 mouse mAb to human ADA, as described previously (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The concentration of ADA proteins in E. coli SØ3834 lysates is based on assay of ADA activity and a specific activity of 436.1 μmol/min/mg determined for human ADA from human T lymphoblasts, which was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and adenosine-Sepharose affinity chromatography.2 Our previous studies indicate that recombinant human and mouse ADA have the same catalytic activity per molecule (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Binding of [35S]Met-labeled ADA in vitro translation products to rabbit CD26/DPPIV (2 nmol/min DPPIV activity) during a 2-h incubation at 37 °C was analyzed by non-denaturing PAGE as reported previously (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Binding of recombinant ADA in lysates of E. coli SØ3834 to the CD26-expressing, ADA-deficient, HTLV-1-transformed AlNe human T lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) was assessed by flow cytometry with the 1C5 mAb to human ADA as reported previously (23Richard E.

SPR analysis of ADA binding to purified rabbit kidney CD26/DPPIV was performed with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). For these studies, rabbit kidney CD26 and recombinant human CD4 glycoprotein (a nonspecific control) were coupled to the CM-dextran surface of separate flow cells of the same Research Grade CM5 Sensor Chip, using amine coupling reagents provided by the manufacturer. PBS was used as running buffer at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. Immediately prior to immobilization, rabbit CD26/DPPIV (140 μg/ml in PBS) was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.7, and CD4 (1 mg/ml) was diluted with 3 volumes of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Then 20 μl of the CD26 and 30 μl of CD4 solutions were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min to immobilize ∼4000–6000 response units (RU) of these proteins, after which residual coupling sites were blocked with ethanolamine. A third flow cell of the CM5 Chip underwent activation and blocking, but without protein, and served as a blank surface for subtracting bulk, nonspecific signal. Interaction kinetics were determined at 25 °C by injecting 45 μl of lysates of E. coli SØ3834-expressing wild type or mutant ADA proteins at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. The dissociation phase was examined for 5 min. At the end of each cycle, bound ADA was removed, and the chip was regenerated by injecting 5 μl of 10 mmglycine HCl, pH 3, at 100 μl/min. (CD26 was sensitive to the pH of the regeneration buffer. Buffers with pH >3 did not remove bound ADA, and pH <3 destabilized the CD26 surface. Under the conditions used, CD26 immobilized on the flow cell was stable for 24–28 cycles.) ADA-containing lysates were diluted 2-, 4-, and 8-fold with PBS containing BSA (1 mg/ml), and 4 concentrations of each ADA protein were examined for each binding analysis. Typically, 150–600 RU of ADA protein were bound to the immobilized CD26/DPPIV. Specific signal due to ADA binding was derived by subtracting the RU obtained with the CD4 or no-protein blank flow cells from the response obtained with the CD26 flow cell. Due to the number of ADA mutants, experiments were performed with several CM5 chips. Results were confirmed by testing several different preparations of individual recombinant ADA proteins; in all experiments wild type human ADA was also run as a reference. The kinetic parameters of the binding reactions were determined using BIAevaluation 3.1 software, using the 1:1 interaction model. For determining the equilibrium dissociation (Keq) constant for wild type human ADA, CD26 was immobilized at 1200 RU. ADA at concentrations of 0.35, 0.14, 0.07, 0.035, and 0.0175 μm was injected at 45 μl/min.Keq was calculated from the slope of a Scatchard plot of the data corrected for nonspecific binding. We showed previously that replacing the entire α2-helix (residues 126–143) of human ADA with the corresponding murine segment abolished stable binding of human ADA to purified rabbit kidney CD26, as assessed by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). No human-to-mouse replacements outside this segment diminished CD26 binding. Among the single human-to-mouse substitutions at the 5 non-conserved positions within the α2-helix, replacing Arg-142 of human ADA with mouse Gln caused the largest reduction in stable binding to rabbit CD26 (23Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have now evaluated the effects of these mutations, as well as mutations of conserved residues within the α2-helix, on CD26 binding using SPR. The human ADA mutants studied include alanine substitutions for Gln-135, Gln-138, Glu-139, Gly-140, Glu-141, Arg-142, and Asp-143 (Fig. 1). In the mouse ADA structure, residues at all of these positions (except Gly-140) have surface-exposed side chains (1Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We also substituted Lys and Glu for Arg-142 to evaluate the importance of charge. When expressed in E. coli SØ3834 under standardized conditions, all of these mutants had substantial ADA activity, ranging from 35 to 96% that obtained with wild type human cDNA (Table I). Western blots of equal amounts of ADA activity indicated that the ADA mutants all have essentially the same activity per molecule as wild type human ADA (Fig. 2). Thus, none of these mutations appears to cause a major conformational change.Table IADA activity expressed in E. coli Sø3834ADA constructADA activity1-aMean ± S.D.% wt human ADAμmol/min/mg proteinHum wt5.2 ± 1.2100.0Hum E128D3.1 ± 1.560.0Hum A131D4.1 ± 1.578.8Hum G134N4.6 ± 2.888.5Hum Q135A4.9 ± 0.394.2Hum Q138A5.0 ± 0.696.1Hum E139A4.3 ± 1.582.7Hum G140A2.1 ± 0.440.4Hum E141A1.8 ± 1.234.6Hum R142Q2.2 ± 0.842.3Hum R142A3.6 ± 0.669.2Hum R142K4.0 ± 0.377.0Hum R142E1.8 ± 0.334.6Hum D143A2.9 ± 0.655.8Hum E128D/R142Q1.6 ± 0.030.8Hum R142Q/D143A2.1 ± 0.440.4Hum E128D/R142Q/D143A1.2 ± 0.223.1Hum E128D/A131D/R142Q/D143A1.7 ± 0.232.7H1–125/M126–143/H144–3631.9 ± 0.636.5Mouse wt1-bAs noted (23), mouse ADA cDNA and certain mouse-human ADA hybrids expressed 3–8-fold higher ADA activity than did human ADA cDNA.

We used a Biacore 3000 instrument to assess the kinetics of ADA/CD26 binding by SPR measurements. In these studies, we monitored simultaneously the binding of ADA in lysates of E. coli SØ3834 to immobilized rabbit CD26, human CD4 glycoprotein (nonspecific control), and to a control flow cell with no immobilized protein (Fig. 3 A). None of the ADA-containing lysates studied showed significant binding to CD4 or to the no-protein control flow cell, and lysate prepared from untransformed E. coli SØ3834 did not show binding to CD26 (not shown), indicating that interaction of ADA with CD26 was specific. A sensorgram obtained with wild type human ADA over the range 0.15–1.3 μm (Fig. 3 B) demonstrates high affinity binding to rabbit CD26, characterized by a rapid association rate (kon) of 2.2 ± 0.2 × 104 m −1 s−1, and a slower dissociation rate (koff) of 3.8 ± 0.4 × 10−4 s−1. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD, based on koff/kon) was 17 ± 3 nm (mean ± S.D. of 3 separate experiments) (Table II). Very similar rates were obtained in experiments performed with two different preparations of purified rabbit CD26 and with human ADA from several different E. coli SØ3834 lysates. The dissociation constant determined under equilibrium conditions (Keq) was 20 nm (Fig. 3 C). These values for Keq and apparent KD determined by SPR are similar to previous estimates of 6–11 nm determined for the binding of 125I-labeled human and bovine ADA to glutaraldehyde-fixed membranes prepared from rabbit kidney cortex (5Schrader W.P.

The C-terminal 50 amino acids are necessary for this binding (3Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31979-31985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NuMA is a constituent of the nuclear matrix prepared by DNase I and high salt treatment of interphase nuclei (4Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and it binds specifically to matrix attachment regions in vitro (5Luderus M.E. den Blaauwen J.L. de Smit O.J. Compton D.A. van Driel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, NuMA is associated with the spindle poles (4Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E.

Immunofluorescence microscopic studies revealed a punctate distribution of GAS41 restricted to the nucleus in interphase cells, suggesting that the protein is associated with the nuclear matrix. In mitotic cells, however, GAS41 is found throughout the cell, in apparent contrast to NuMA located at the spindle poles (3Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31979-31985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Sequence comparison revealed high homology of GAS41 to AF-9 and ENL in the proline-rich N-terminal region (2Fischer U.

These nuclear proteins containing a transcriptional activation domain at the C-terminal 90 amino acids are believed to represent a new class of transcription factors (6Nakamura T. Alder H., Gu, Y.

GAS41 has been predicted to exhibit α-helical structures containing a significantly above average percentage (27%) of acidic amino acids in the 60-amino acid C-terminal region (2Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Negatively charged α-helical structures are present in transcriptional activation domain of several eukaryotic transcription factors (8Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). In contrast to AF-9 and ENL, GAS41 lacks a typical DNA-binding domain (2Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). It may be that the protein activates transcription by interacting with components of transcription complexes.Although GAS41 has been well characterized by in vitro studies, less is known about the role of this protein in vivo. In this study, we therefore tried to understand its role in the chicken B-cell line DT40. In this cell line, targeted integration by homologous recombination has been shown to occur at high frequency (9Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Using this gene targeting technique, we attempted to disrupt both GAS41 alleles in DT40 cells. We show that the gene encoding GAS41 is essential for cell viability. Targeted disruption of both alleles of GAS41 could be only achieved following substitution by GAS41 cDNA under control of a tetracycline (tet)-regulated CMV promoter. Inactivation of this promoter by tet withdrawal caused depletion of GAS41, which was accompanied by a decrease in cellular RNA synthesis and subsequent cell death. Thus, the data indicate that GAS41 is required for RNA transcription.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used a gene targeting technique by homologous recombination to investigate the role of the GAS41 gene in the chicken pre-B-cell line DT40. This cell line has been shown to exhibit homologous recombination at very high frequency. Depending on the vector used, targeted integration at frequencies as high as 80–100% have been reported (9Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast to these data, using the targeting vectors neo-gas and puro-gas, we obtained homologous recombination at the GAS41 gene locus at lower frequencies of 1/12 and 1/26, respectively. A possible explanation is that our vectors were constructed for targeted deletion of a great part of the GAS41 gene and are thus less efficient in achieving homologous recombination. We provide several lines of evidence indicating that the gene encoding GAS41 is essential for cell viability. Targeted disruption of both alleles of GAS41 was made possible only by prior stable integration of a GAS41-encoding cDNA under control of a CMV promoter to substitute for the endogenous gene. Furthermore, the CMV promoter containing two tetO2 is trans-repressible by tet repressor, whereas de-repression occurs in the presence of tet. Indeed, transfection with a tet repressor expression vector leads to a total depletion of GAS41 after 24 h of tet withdrawal. This agrees with the short half-life of ∼30 min of GAS41 as determined by Western blotting following treatment with cycloheximide (data not shown). Successively, depletion of GAS41 causes cell death after 48 h of tet withdrawal. We note, however, that heterozygous cells containing only one GAS41 allele (#12 and #27), which express GAS mRNA at ∼50% reduced level, did not show any decrease in growth rate compared with wt DT40 cells. This suggests that the amount of GAS41 in DT40 cells is not limited, and that the cells can tolerate a moderate reduction of GAS41 level.In addition to establishing the essential role of GAS41 in cell viability, our results demonstrated that GAS41 is involved in RNA transcription. The suggestion that GAS41 is a transcription factor is based on the facts (i) that the protein displays high sequence homology to two putative transcription factors, AF-9 and ENL (26Cairns B.R.

In this study, we provide evidence for the first time that GAS41 is required for RNA transcription that in turn is essential for cell viability. Our data demonstrate that depletion of GAS41 causes a general decrease in RNA synthesis in vivo and thus seem to agree with the suggestion that GAS41 is involved in basal cellular transcription. Interestingly, GAS41 contains a tf2f domain originally described in a yeast transcription factor, TFG3/ANC1, which, like GAS41, shows significant similarities to AF-9 and ENL, two proteins involved in human acute leukemia (25Munnia A.

Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). In contrast to AF-9 and ENL, GAS41 lacks a typical DNA-binding domain (2Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). It may be that the protein activates transcription by interacting with components of transcription complexes. Although GAS41 has been well characterized by in vitro studies, less is known about the role of this protein in vivo. In this study, we therefore tried to understand its role in the chicken B-cell line DT40. In this cell line, targeted integration by homologous recombination has been shown to occur at high frequency (9Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Using this gene targeting technique, we attempted to disrupt both GAS41 alleles in DT40 cells. We show that the gene encoding GAS41 is essential for cell viability. Targeted disruption of both alleles of GAS41 could be only achieved following substitution by GAS41 cDNA under control of a tetracycline (tet)-regulated CMV promoter. Inactivation of this promoter by tet withdrawal caused depletion of GAS41, which was accompanied by a decrease in cellular RNA synthesis and subsequent cell death. Thus, the data indicate that GAS41 is required for RNA transcription. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used a gene targeting technique by homologous recombination to investigate the role of the GAS41 gene in the chicken pre-B-cell line DT40. This cell line has been shown to exhibit homologous recombination at very high frequency. Depending on the vector used, targeted integration at frequencies as high as 80–100% have been reported (9Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast to these data, using the targeting vectors neo-gas and puro-gas, we obtained homologous recombination at the GAS41 gene locus at lower frequencies of 1/12 and 1/26, respectively. A possible explanation is that our vectors were constructed for targeted deletion of a great part of the GAS41 gene and are thus less efficient in achieving homologous recombination. We provide several lines of evidence indicating that the gene encoding GAS41 is essential for cell viability. Targeted disruption of both alleles of GAS41 was made possible only by prior stable integration of a GAS41-encoding cDNA under control of a CMV promoter to substitute for the endogenous gene. Furthermore, the CMV promoter containing two tetO2 is trans-repressible by tet repressor, whereas de-repression occurs in the presence of tet. Indeed, transfection with a tet repressor expression vector leads to a total depletion of GAS41 after 24 h of tet withdrawal. This agrees with the short half-life of ∼30 min of GAS41 as determined by Western blotting following treatment with cycloheximide (data not shown). Successively, depletion of GAS41 causes cell death after 48 h of tet withdrawal. We note, however, that heterozygous cells containing only one GAS41 allele (#12 and #27), which express GAS mRNA at ∼50% reduced level, did not show any decrease in growth rate compared with wt DT40 cells. This suggests that the amount of GAS41 in DT40 cells is not limited, and that the cells can tolerate a moderate reduction of GAS41 level.In addition to establishing the essential role of GAS41 in cell viability, our results demonstrated that GAS41 is involved in RNA transcription. The suggestion that GAS41 is a transcription factor is based on the facts (i) that the protein displays high sequence homology to two putative transcription factors, AF-9 and ENL (26Cairns B.R.

In this study, we provide evidence for the first time that GAS41 is required for RNA transcription that in turn is essential for cell viability.

No PKC-βII complexes with lamin B1 and/or active caspases were immunoprecipitable from the NM of proliferating untreated cells, but large complexes of PKC-βII holoprotein and its catalytic fragments with lamin B1, active caspase-3 and -6, and inactive phospho-CDK-1, but not PKC-βI or PKC-δ, could be immunoprecipitated from the NM of VP-16-treated cells, suggesting that PKC-βII is an apoptotic lamin kinase. By 30 min after normal nuclei were mixed with cytoplasms from VP-16-treated, but not untreated, cells, PKC-βII holoprotein had moved from the apoptotic cytoplasm to the normal NM, and lamin B1 was phosphorylated before cleavage by caspase-6. Lamin B1 phosphorylation was partly reduced, but its cleavage was completely prevented, despite the presence of active caspase-6, by adding a selective PKC-βs inhibitor, hispidin, to the apoptotic cytoplasms. Thus, a PKC-βII response to VP-16 seems necessary for lamin B1 cleavage by caspase-6 and nuclear lamina dissolution in apoptosing pyF111 fibroblasts. The possibility of PKC-βII being an apoptotic lamin kinase in these cells was further suggested by lamin B1-bound PKC-δ being inactive or only slightly active and by PKC-α not combining with the lamin.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We chose this fibroblast, since it is prone to apoptosis because it cannot make the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins but can make the proapoptotic Bax protein (10Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have shown that whereas a surge of the activity of PKC-δ holoprotein anchored in the cytoplasmic particulate fraction is a common component of the signal given by diverse apoptogenic drugs to pyF111 cells, only the DNA-damaging topoisomerase-II inhibitors cause a prompt, large, and irreversible fall of PKC-δ's specific activity at the nuclear envelope, despite the accumulation and proteolysis of PKC-δ holoproteins at the envelope (10Dal Pra I.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, according to the apoptogen used, a PKC isoform can be activated, inactivated, or unaffected at the same time in different parts of the pyF111 cell. The present experiments focused on the behavior and activities of other PKC isoforms at the nuclear envelope of apoptosing VP-16-treated pyF111 cells. The results of these experiments indicate that during the execution phase of apoptosis, catalytically competent PKC-βII holoproteins move onto the nuclear envelope, where they target specific substrates and are cleaved into CFs. In our search for the nuclear substrates of PKC-βII and PKC-δ, we focused on the lamins. The nuclear lamina is a network of lamins attached to the inner nuclear membrane (16Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Cell.

Lamins are type V intermediate filaments with a conserved, central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-α-helical N- and C-terminal domains (16Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Cell. Mol.

Overexpression of mutant, caspase-resistant lamin A or B1 slows the onset of DNA fragmentation, indicating that lamin proteolysis is part of the execution phase of apoptosis (34Rao L. Perez D.

Thus, the mitotic lamin kinase, CDK-1·cyclin B, is not also, as might be expected, the apoptotic lamin kinase in thymocytes (38Norbury C. MacFarlane M. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1400-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), PKC-α may be the apoptotic lamin kinase in camptothecin-treated human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (26Shimizu T.

Here we report the results of experiments indicating that PKC-βIIis an apoptotic lamin kinase in VP-16-treated pyF111 rat fibroblasts. Polyomavirus-infected/transformed pyF111 Fischer rat embryo fibroblasts, a gift from Dr. L. Raptis (Department of Microbiology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada), were cultured and handled as previously detailed (10Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Experiments were started by planting 1.2 × 106 cells in each of 20–25 F-160 flasks. Twenty-four hours later (i.e. at the experimental 0 h), the cells in some flasks were sampled (zero time controls), the medium in some other flasks was replaced with the same, but fresh, medium (parallel or proliferation control group), and the medium in the remaining flasks was replaced by fresh medium containing 1.0 μg ml− 1 of VP-16 (etoposide or 4 N-dimethylepipodophyllotoxin 4-[4,6-O-ethylidene-β-d-glucopyranoside]; Sigma), a topoisomerase-II inhibitor (30Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was not changed again during observation periods ranging from 6 to 48–72 h. We considered as “viable” only those cells that excluded trypan blue or ethidium bromide (EB) and whose nucleic acids were stained normally with SYTO-10™ or acridine orange (AO) (all from Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Morphological signs of apoptosis were looked for according to the procedure of Spector et al. in AO-EB doubly stained samples (40Spector, D. L., Goldman, D. D., and Leinwald, L. A. (eds) (1998) in Cell: A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 1, pp. 15.6–15.7. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Loss of high molecular weight DNA and the generation of oligonucleosomal ladder-type DNA fragments were detected by gel electrophoresis according to Pellicciari et al. (41Pellicciari C. Manfredi A.A. Bottone M.G. Schaak V. Barni S. Eur. J. Histochem. 1993; 37: 381-390PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the mitotic cell cycle fractions and the fractions with hypodiploid DNA contents, the sub-G1 fractions, cellular DNA contents were measured with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACStar Plus™; Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) as previously described (11Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping them into cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuging the suspension at 200 × g for 10 min. The sedimented cells were carefully resuspended in a solution containing 10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were then chilled on ice for 15 min and gently lysed by adding 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The lysate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to produce the whole nuclei fraction pellet, containing whole nuclei, and the SN1 supernatant. The whole nuclei fraction was suspended in an excess volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing DNase I and heparin (0.2 and 5.0 mg/mg of nuclear protein, respectively)). This suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 45 min and then centrifuged at 9500 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was the nuclear membrane-enriched NM fraction, and the supernatant was the nucleoplasmic (NP) fraction. The SN1 supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield the SN2 supernatant or cytosolic fraction (CS) and the P2 pellet or cytoplasmic particulate fraction. The purities of these fractions were assessed from their contents of the cytosolic marker lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) measured by the method of McIntosh and Plummer (42McIntosh C.H.S. Plummer D.T. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) assayed by the method of Ipata as modified by McIntosh and Plummer (42McIntosh C.H.S. Plummer D.T. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the nuclear marker lamin B1 evaluated by Western immunoblotting (43Rosenberger U. Shakibaei M. Buchner K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the nuclear fractions (the NM and NP fractions), but cytoplasmic fractions (e.g.CS) were also used whenever required. The protein contents of the subcellular fractions were assayed according to Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts (10 or 20 μg) of proteins from each NM sample were boiled in sample buffer (0.0625m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed in 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm; Bio-Rad) (10Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To immunodetect PKC-α, PKC-βI, PKC-βII, and PKC-δ, the blots were probed with isotype-specific rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (final dilution 1.0 μg ml− 1), which recognized the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences of each isoform (Sigma (PKC-α) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The staining of the particular band pertaining to each PKC isoform could be suppressed by preincubating each antibody with the peptide against which it had been raised (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were also probed with antibodies (final dilution 1.0 μg ml− 1) to detect cytochrome c, lamin B1, tyrosine 15-phosphorylated (Tyr(P)15, i.e. inactive) CDK-1 kinase or total (“pan,” i.e. both active and Tyr(P)15-inactive) CDK-1 kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and serine-phosphorylated (Ser(P)) proteins (Calbiochem). Blots were next incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium liquid substrate reagent (Sigma). The developed blots were photographed with an Olympus 3300™ digital camera, and the determination of the Mr and the densitometric analysis of each specific band were carried out with Sigmagel™ software (Jandel Corp., Erkrath, Germany). The same amount of protein (300 μg) from each NM sample was used for the immunoprecipitation experiments. Protein samples were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with antibodies directed against PKC-α, PKC-βII, and PKC-δ (anti-PKC-α from Sigma and anti-PKC-βII and anti-PKC-δ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), lamin B1 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), or Ser(P)-proteins (Calbiochem) conjugated to Immunopure-immobilized protein A (Pierce). The immunocomplex-bearing beads were collected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed five times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl), 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemistry). After a final wash, the immunocomplex-bearing beads were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline to measure PKC activity or in sample buffer for Western immunoblotting. A colorimetric PKC activity assay kit, the Spinzyme Format™ (Pierce) was used (10Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This kit includes as a PKC-specific substrate, the ε-peptide (i.e. XERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV, where X is lissamine rhodamine B). To measure the specific activity per μg of protein of an immunoprecipitated PKC isoform, the assay mixture (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA (or alternatively 0.5 mm calcium), 2.0 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.002% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.36 mmdye-labeled ε-peptide) without any cofactor was added to the immunocomplex-bearing beads. All of the assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the amounts of phosphorylated ε peptide were determined as recommended by the supplier. The results were expressed in arbitrary units calculated for each sample as the ratios between optical density values and μg of the corresponding immunoprecipitated protein. We basically followed the procedure of Shimizu et al. (26Shimizu T. Cao C.X. Shao R.G. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Untreated or VP-16-treated (1.0 μg ml− 1 for 6, 18, or 24 h) pyF111 cells were harvested by scraping them into cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice by centrifugation/resuspension cycles in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and next incubated on ice for 10 min at a density of 1.0 × 107 cells ml− 1 in a lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 5.0 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, and 0.3% Triton X-100). Lysates were next centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and their supernatants were the control cytoplasmic fractions from untreated cells or apoptotic cytoplasmic fractions from cells incubated with VP-16 for 6, 18, and 24 h. Nuclei isolated from the untreated cells were next washed twice by centrifugation/resuspension in the lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and finally suspended at a density of 1.0–2.0 × 107nuclei ml− 1. Control or apoptotic cytoplasms (4 volumes) were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with nuclei (1 volume) from untreated cells either with or without hispidin (5.0 μm) (Calbiochem), a PKC-β, but not PKC-δ, inhibitor (45Gonindart C.

Equal amounts of protein (i.e. 300 μg) from the NM fractions of these reconstituted nucleus-cytoplasm (N-C) mixtures were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Ser(P) antibody, and such precipitates were blotted and challenged with anti-PKC-βII or anti-lamin B1 antibody. The activities of caspase-3 and -6 were measured in various subcellular fractions and in immunoprecipitates from the NM fractions with the specific fluorometric substrates Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) and Ac-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-7-Amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-VEID-AMC), respectively (both from Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA). Base-line activities were determined in samples from untreated pyF111 cultures at 0 h (48Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Tung J.S. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. Takahashi A.

The results pertaining to immunoprecipitates were expressed in arbitrary units calculated for each sample as the ratios between fluorescence values and μg of the corresponding immunoprecipitated protein. Statistical significance was assessed with Student's t test for unpaired samples; only differences with p < 0.05 were regarded as significant. The number of substrate-adhering cells in untreated pyF111 cultures increased by 9.8-fold on the average between 0 h (i.e. 24 h after planting in F-160 flasks and a fresh medium change) and 72 h, when more than 99.7% of the cells were viable as indicated by their exclusion of trypan blue or EB fluorochrome (Fig. 1 A; see also Refs. 10Dal Pra I.

Both at 0 and 48 h later (i.e. when they were exponentially growing), the fractions of untreated pyF111 cells in the G1, S, and G2-M phases of the cell cycle did not significantly change, and the apoptotic hypodiploid (sub-G1) cell population remained negligible (Fig. 1 B). As expected and as previously shown (10Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F. Chiarini A. Armato U. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Dal Pra I. Whitfield J.F.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), VP-16 (1.0 μg ml− 1 of culture medium) caused cells to stop and accumulate in the G2-M phase (i.e. from around 15–50% by 48 h) with a corresponding drop in the G1 and S fractions (Fig. 1 B) and triggered apoptosis, the execution of which started 24 h after the drug was added to the cultures and had killed 50% of the cells by 48 h and 75% by 72 h (Fig. 1 A; see also Refs. 10Dal Pra I.

TAL1 also has a critical role in embryonic vascular remodeling and is expressed in endothelial cells postnatally, although little is known about its function or regulation in this cell type. We report here that the important proangiogenic stimulus hypoxia stimulates phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal breakdown of TAL1 in endothelial cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and chemical inhibitor studies showed that hypoxia induced the mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue, Ser122, in the protein, and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser122 phosphorylation was necessary for hypoxic acceleration of TAL1 turnover in an immortalized murine endothelial cell line. Finally, whereas TAL1 expression was detected in endothelial cells from both large and small vessels, hypoxia-induced TAL1 turnover was observed only in microvascular endothelial cells. Besides their implications for TAL1 function in angiogenic processes, these results demonstrate that a protein kinase(s) important for mitogenic signaling is also utilized in hypoxic endothelial cells to target a transcription factor for destruction.

We report here that the important proangiogenic stimulus hypoxia stimulates phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal breakdown of TAL1 in endothelial cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and chemical inhibitor studies showed that hypoxia induced the mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue, Ser122, in the protein, and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser122 phosphorylation was necessary for hypoxic acceleration of TAL1 turnover in an immortalized murine endothelial cell line. Finally, whereas TAL1 expression was detected in endothelial cells from both large and small vessels, hypoxia-induced TAL1 turnover was observed only in microvascular endothelial cells. Besides their implications for TAL1 function in angiogenic processes, these results demonstrate that a protein kinase(s) important for mitogenic signaling is also utilized in hypoxic endothelial cells to target a transcription factor for destruction. The TAL1 (or SCL) gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor originally identified from its involvement by a chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Denning S.M. Haynes B.F. Waldmann T.A. Kirsch I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10128-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Chen Q. Cheng J.-T. Tsai L.-H.

TAL1 coding sequences have also been found fused to the promoter of an adjacent gene,SIL (for SCL i nterrupting l ocus), as the result of interstitial deletions (3Aplan P.D. Lombardi D.P.

Hall S. Timmons C.F. Crist W.M. Amylon M. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1995; 86: 666-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three related genes have also been found to be activated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6Mellentin J.D. Smith S.D. Cleary M.L.

In aggregate, overexpression of this subclass of basic helix-loop-helix genes is the most common gain of function mutation in this form of leukemia (reviewed in Ref. 9Brandt S.J. Ravid K. Licht J. Transcription Factors: Normal and Malignant Development of Blood Cells. Wiley-Liss, New York2000: 51-70Crossref Google Scholar). TAL1 binds DNA with any of the more widely expressed basic helix-loop-helix proteins known as E proteins, including the E12, E47, and E2-5 splice isoforms of the E2A gene, the related E2-2 protein, and the HEB/HTF4 gene products (10Hsu H.-L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), however, TAL1's target genes remain unidentified. TAL1 is a critical regulator of hematopoietic differentiation.Tal1 gene inactivation by homologous recombination resulted in midgestational lethality with the complete absence of yolk sac erythropoiesis (20Shivdasani R.A.

From analysis of chimeric animals derived from mixtures of Tal1−/− and Tal1+/+embryonic stem cells, the gene also appears to be required for generation of lympho-hematopoietic cells of the adult (22Porcher C.

Barnett L.D. Begley C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition, TAL1 promotes the terminal differentiation of specific hematopoietic lineages (24Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Valtieri M. Tocci A. Gabbianelli M. Luchetti L. Masella B. Vitelli L. Botta R. Testa U. Condorelli G.L. Peschle C.

Although less well characterized, TAL1 also has a role in blood vessel formation or maturation. Tal1 protein has been observed in endothelial progenitor cells, or angioblasts, and in endothelial and hematopoietic cells of the blood islands of the embryonic yolk sac (27Drake C.J. Brandt S.J. Trusk T.C. Little C.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, enforced expression of TAL1 in zebrafish embryos resulted in overproduction of both hematopoietic and endothelial precursors (29Gering M. Rodaway A.R. Göttgens B. Patient R.K. Green A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4029-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and studies of Tal1−/− embryos in which hematopoiesis was partially rescued by a Gata-1 promoter-driven Tal1 transgene revealed the gene is also required for vascular remodeling (30Visvader J.E. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Finally, Tal1 expression characterizes vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells of the adult (31Hwang L.-Y. Siegelman M. Davis L. Oppenheimer-Marks N. Baer R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3043-3046PubMed Google Scholar). 1T. Tang, S. R. Opalenik, J. M. Davidson, D. M. Brantley, J. Chen, and S. J. Brandt, manuscript in preparation. 1T. Tang, S. R. Opalenik, J. M.

However, its specific actions in this cell type and the extent to which its expression can be modulated by angiogenic molecules are not known. We used an immortalized murine endothelial cell line to investigate the effects of an important proangiogenic stimulus on Tal1 protein dynamics.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA), and COS-7 and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The immortalized human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cell line BMEC-1 (33Candal F.J. Rafii S. Parker J.T. Ades E.W. Ferris B. Nachman R.L. Kellar K.L. Microvasc.

MS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM; Clonetics), and HMVECs were grown in microvascular endothelial growth medium (EGM-MV; Clonetics). COS-7, HeLa, and murine erythroleukemia cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and BMEC-1 cells were grown in Medium 199 with 15% FBS, 40 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), 1 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 16 units/ml heparin, and 25 mm sodium bicarbonate. To induce hypoxia, tissue culture dishes were transferred to a Billups-Rothenberg chamber, which was flushed with a defined gas mixture, sealed, and returned to a 37 °C incubator (34Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). These mixtures contained 10% CO2and either 0%, 0.5%, or 1.0% O2. An expression plasmid (pT123) for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ubiquitin (35Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was provided by Dirk Bohmann (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). Construction of pcDNA1-Tal1 and pcDNA1-Tal1S122Aplasmids has been described previously (36Tang T. Prasad K.S.S. Koury M.J. Brandt S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 615-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express Myc epitope-tagged Tal1 and Tal1S122A proteins, the appropriate cDNA was subcloned into vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide sequence encoding a human c-Myc epitope was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis immediately before the stop codon (GeneEditor In Vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System, Promega, Madison, WI). Protease inhibitors MG132 (N-carbobenzyloxy-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal; Sigma), LLM (N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-methioninal; Sigma), LLnL (N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal; Sigma), and E64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane; Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO before addition to culture. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse Tal1 has been described previously (28Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human TAL1 was provided by Richard Baer (Columbia University, New York, NY). Purified mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (16B12) was purchased from BAbCO (now Covance Research Products, Richmond, CA), mouse monoclonal antibody to HIF-1α (NB 100–123) was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the human c-Myc epitope was purchased from Sigma. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) and denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in Laemmli buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), which was incubated in blocking buffer (5% milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 4 h and then incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight. Binding of the primary antibody was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). For pulse-chase analysis, MS1 cells were grown in 10-cm-diameter dishes, washed once with methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in this medium plus 5% dialyzed FBS. After labeling with 200 μCi/ml [35 S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-Label; ICN, Irvine, CA) at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% FBS under hypoxic or normoxic conditions at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml/dish radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (9.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin. The resulting lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and radiolabeled Tal1 was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody. Immune precipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and band intensities were quantitated from phosphorimaging of dried gels (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein half-life was also determined by Western blot analysis after treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Following a medium change, cycloheximide was added at a concentration of 100 μm, and the cells were incubated under hypoxic or normoxic conditions at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. COS-7 and HeLa cell cultures of ∼80% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (39Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar), whereas subconfluent MS1 cells were transfected with 8 μg of liposome-complexed DNA (LipofectAMINE; Invitrogen). Using a β-galactosidase expression vector under identical conditions, a transfection efficiency of 60% was achieved for COS-7 cells, 80% for HeLa cells, and 10% for MS1 cells. HeLa cells cultured in 10-cm-diameter dishes were transiently transfected with 4 μg of the HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vector, 4 μg of Tal1 expression vector, or both. MS1 cells were transfected with 8 μg of the HA-ubiquitin expression vector and split 24 h after transfection. After an additional 48 h, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 4 h and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with Tal1 antibody at 4 °C overnight. The resulting immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h. These complexes were washed four times with ice-cold RIPA buffer, heated in Laemmli sample buffer to 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above using a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used to detect binding of the HA antibody. MS1 cells were metabolically labeled as described by Tang et al. (36Tang T. Prasad K.S.S. Koury M.J. Brandt S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 615-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in phosphate-free minimum essential medium with 5% dialyzed FBS at 37 °C for 1 h and radiolabeled with 0.9 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 1.5 h in the presence of 10 μm MG132. After treatment with 50 μmPD98059 or vehicle for 30 min, cells were subjected to severe hypoxia (0% O2) or continued normoxia for 2 h. Nuclei were extracted with ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A. Radiolabeled Tal1 was then immunoprecipitated from the resulting extracts with Tal1 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immune precipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed four times with RIPA buffer, boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiographic analysis. After immunoprecipitation and fractionation by SDS-PAGE, radiolabeled Tal1 protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, eluted, and digested exhaustively with trypsin. Proteolytic fragments were then separated by two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis by the method of Boyle et al. (40Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Briefly, tryptic digests were applied to a cellulose thin layer electrophoresis plate (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) and fractionated by electrophoresis for 20 min in pH 1.9 buffer at 1000 V and by ascending thin layer chromatography in the second dimension in a solvent containing 39% butanol, 30% pyridine, and 6% glacial acetic acid. Phosphorimaging was used to visualize radioactive digestion products and assess phosphorylation of specific fragments. MS1 cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 12 h and lysed as described above. MAPK protein was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts by the method of Chen and Blenis (41Chen R.H. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3204-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using an antibody reactive with both ERK1 and ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and protein kinase activity was assayed as described by Robbins et al. (42Robbins D.J. Cheng M. Zhen E. Vanderbilt C.A. Feig L.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with myelin basic protein as substrate. Briefly, immunoprecipitated protein was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/reaction) in 75 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel. Myelin basic protein phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and quantitated from phosphorimaging of the dried gel. Hypoxia's effect on TAL1 expression was investigated using an immortalized murine pancreatic endothelial cell line, MS1 (32Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that Tal1 protein abundance declined significantly in MS1 cells exposed to 1.0% (Fig. 1 A), 0.5% (Fig. 1 B), or 0% O2 (Fig. 1 C) or incubated with 100 μm CoCl2 (Fig. 1 D), a mimetic of hypoxia. This was not the result of cytotoxicity, however, because no reduction in cellular viability was observed by trypan blue analysis even after 24 h of severe hypoxia (data not shown), and no evidence of apoptosis was noted in flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-labeled cells (data not shown). Moreover, Tal1 levels recovered in hypoxic cells with restoration of a normal ambient oxygen concentration (Fig. 1 C). The decline in Tal1 expression was also associated with accumulation of the HIF-1α transcription factor (Fig. 1 E), excluding a general increase in protein turnover. Pulse-chase analysis showed that the decline in Tal1 protein in hypoxic MS1 cells was the result of its increased turnover (Fig. 2). Whereas Tal1 had a half-life (t1/2) of 8 h under ambient oxygen tensions, a biphasic decay curve with a t1/2 (initial) of 2 h was observed after cells were exposed to severe hypoxia. Similar results were obtained from Western blot analysis of cycloheximide-treated cells (data not shown). In contrast to its effects on protein stability, hypoxia effected a slight stabilization of Tal1 mRNA, increasing its t1/2 from 3 to 4 h (data not shown). Thus, hypoxia decreased Tal1 expression in MS1 cells by accelerating its turnover. To identify the pathway responsible for Tal1 destruction, cells were treated with different protease inhibitors before being made hypoxic, and Tal1 protein levels were then quantitated by Western blot analysis. The potent proteasomal inhibitor MG132 was tested first in Tal1-transfected HeLa cells, and, whereas hypoxia was without effect on its expression in these cells (Fig. 3 A), MG132 did increase Tal1 steady-state levels. In contrast, hypoxia effected a decline in Tal1 expression in MS1 cells that was prevented by MG132 (Figs.3 B and 4) and attenuated by the less potent proteasomal inhibitor ALLN (Fig. 3 B) but unaltered by the lysosomal protease inhibitor E64 and the calpain inhibitor LLM (Fig. 3 B). These results thus implicate the 26 S proteasome in the increased turnover of Tal1 in hypoxic microvascular endothelial cells.Figure 4MG132 inhibits Tal1 protein turnover in hypoxic MS1 cells. MS1 cells were incubated for 16 h with 10 μm MG132 or vehicle, treated with 100 μmcycloheximide to inhibit further protein synthesis, and subjected to severe hypoxia (0% O2) or continued normoxia for 3, 6, or 9 h. Nuclear extracts were then fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a membrane. Tal1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis and quantitated from densitometry of the x-ray film. The mean percentage ± S.E. of Tal1 remaining is expressed relative to the time following the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor. Data represent the results of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With rare exception (43Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M.

Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), proteins destined for proteasomal degradation are first marked by conjugation with ubiquitin. To investigate whether TAL1 undergoes ubiquitination, HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for Tal1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin, Tal1 protein was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, and the presence of ubiquitin-conjugated Tal1 was determined by Western blot analysis using antibody to the HA epitope. As shown in Fig. 3 C, a smear of HA-labeled Tal1 was noted only in cells transfected with HA-ubiquitin and Tal1, thus demonstrating that this transcription factor is subject to polyubiquitination in vivo. To determine whether endogenously expressed Tal1 also was ubiquitinated and the effect hypoxia had on this process, analogous immunoprecipitation/immunoblot studies were carried out 2 (data not shown) and 4 h (Fig. 3 D) after exposure of HA-ubiquitin-expressing MS1 cells to severe hypoxia. Whereas Tal1 ubiquitination was detectable even under normal oxygen tensions, the abundance of ubiquitinated Tal1, and in particular the highest molecular weight forms (Fig. 3 D), increased in cells made hypoxic. Thus, TAL1 ubiquitination is stimulated by hypoxia in microvascular endothelial cells. Phosphorylation induces the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of a number of proteins, including transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 44Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M61-M70PubMed Google Scholar and discussed below).

Hyperosmotic stress causes growth arrest possibly via proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin D1. We studied the effect of hyposmotic conditions on three colonic (Caco2, HRT18, HT29) and two pancreatic (AsPC-1 and PaCa-2) cell lines. Hyposmosis caused reversible cell growth arrest of the five cell lines in a cell cycle-independent fashion, although some cell lines accumulated at the G1/S interface. Growth arrest was followed by apoptosis or by formation of multinucleated giant cells, which is consistent with cell cycle catastrophe. Hyposmosis dramatically decreased Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk4, cyclin B1, and cyclin D3 expression in a time-dependent fashion, in association with an overall decrease in cellular protein synthesis. However, some protein levels remained unaltered, including cyclin E and keratin 8. Selective proteasome inhibition prevented Cdk and cyclin degradation and reversed hyposmotic stress-induced growth arrest, whereas calpain and lysosome enzyme inhibitors had no measurable effect on cell cycle protein degradation. Therefore, hyposmotic stress inhibits cell growth and, depending on the cell type, causes cell cycle catastrophe with or without apoptosis.

We have used a reconstituted concerted human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), integration system to analyze the role of integrase (IN) recognition sequences in formation of the IN-viral DNA complex capable of concerted integration. HIV-1 integrase was presented with substrates that contained all 4 bases at 8 mismatched positions that define the inverted repeat relationship between U3 and U5 long terminal repeats (LTR) termini and at positions 17–19, which are conserved in the termini. Evidence presented indicates that positions 17–20 of the IN recognition sequences are needed for a concerted DNA integration mechanism. All 4 bases were found at each randomized position in sequenced concerted DNA integrants, although in some instances there were preferences for specific bases. These results indicate that integrase tolerates a significant amount of plasticity as to what constitutes an IN recognition sequence. By having several positions randomized, the concerted integrants were examined for statistically significant relationships between selections of bases at different positions. The results of this analysis show not only relationships between different positions within the same LTR end but also between different positions belonging to opposite DNA termini. Successful integration of viral genome into a host chromosome depends on interaction between viral integrase and its recognition sequences.

Integration of viral genome into the host chromosome is essential for stable infection of the retrovirus and occurs in a concerted reaction in which the ends of the viral DNA are brought together and inserted into the acceptor in a coordinated manner (1Murphy J.E.

IN forms a homodimer or a higher order multimer structure, which recognizes the terminal sequences in the U3 and U5 LTRs. In most retroviruses these sequences are related to one another in that they are nearly perfect inverted repeats. The number of bases required for specific IN recognition varies with the virus and ranges between 10 and 20 bp (7Hindmarsh P. Leis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

To analyze the integration reaction in detail, we have used an in vitro integration system that employs a mini donor DNA containing U3 and U5 IN recognition sequences at each end and demonstrates concerted DNA integration reactions as determined by direct sequencing of integrants (3Aiyar A. Hindmarsh P. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3571-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J.

To examine sequence preferences by HIV-1 IN, we randomized the “mismatched” positions or the conserved positions 17–19 nucleotides from the ends of unprocessed viral DNA in U5 and/or U3 LTR IN recognition sequences. We then allowed IN to “choose” sequences in the mini donor DNAs that constitute a functional recognition sequence. Results from analysis of enzymatic activity and sequences selected from the population of substrates indicate that in addition to sequences in and around the conserved CA dinucleotide, positions 17–20 are also important for reconstitution of concerted integration in vitro. Moreover, there were statistically significant relationships among the bases selected at different positions such that the selection of a base at one position was found in combination with the selection of a base at another. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Proteinase K (30 units/mg) and glycogen were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HMG-I(Y) was purified as described by Nissen and Reeves (17Nissen M.S. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4355-4360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). IN was purified as described by Yi et al. (18Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Vent DNA polymerase (2 units/μl) was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and purified by PAGE under denaturing conditions. The following oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used in this study: U5(WT), 5′ ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG 3′; U5 N8, 5′ ACTGNN AGN GN TNN TN CACN CTGGGCGGAGCCTATG 3′; U5 N3GTG, 5′ ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCNNN ACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG 3′; U5 18GA19, 5′ ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCCTACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG 3′; U5 17AAT19, 5′ ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCTTAACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG 3′; U3(WT), 5′ ACTGGAAGGGCTAATTCACTCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG 3′; U3 N8, 5′ ACTGNN AGN GN TNN TN CACN CGTTGCCCGGATCCGG 3′; U3 N3GTG, 5′ ACTGGAAGGGCTAATTNNN TCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG 3′; U5seq, 5′ AGAATTCGGCGTTGCTGGCGTTTTTCCATA 3′; and U3seq, 5′ CTGCCGTCATCGACTTCGAAGGTTCGAATC 3′. The U5 N8 and U5 N3GTG oligodeoxyribonucleotides along with U3(WT) were used to prepare HIV-1 donor-concerted DNA integration substrates with randomization in the U5 terminus sequence. The U5 18GA19 and U5 17AAT19 together with U3(WT) oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used to prepare HIV-1-concerted DNA integration substrates with mutations at positions 17–19. In each case, the sequence refers to the 3′-cleaved strand of the U5 LTR IN recognition sequence The U3 N8 and U3 N3GTG oligodeoxyribonucleotides along with U5(WT) were used to prepare comparable donor DNAs with randomization in the U3 IN recognition sequence. The U5seq and U3seq oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used as sequencing primers. The U3seq primer is complementary to plasmid πvx nucleotides 180 to 151, and the U5seq primer is complementary to plasmid πvx nucleotides 312–341. Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and MC1061/P3 (Invitrogen) strains were used for these studies. MC1061/P3 is a derivative of MC1061 containing the male episome, P3, which can be selected for the presence of an encoded Kanr gene. In addition, P3 possesses amp (Am) and tet (Am) genes, the expression of which can be rescued by the supF amber suppressor tRNA. Under these conditions, MC1061/P3 can be selected for ampicillin, tetracycline, and kanamycin resistance. Plasmid pHHIV2 was used in this study as a template to amplify donor DNA and is a variation of pBCSK+ in which a wild type HIV-1 donor DNA PCR product was inserted into pBCSK+ catalyzed by IN, resulting in the loss of 2 bp from the LTR ends. This plasmid was propagated in E. coli MC1061/P3 under the conditions described above. The integration acceptor was plasmid pBCSK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was propagated in E. coli DH5α. Plasmids were purified with Qiaprep columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The growth of DH5α containing pBCSK+ was selected by addition of chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). Integration donors were amplified by using thermostable Vent DNA polymerase and the primers listed above. Twenty five pmol of each primer and 50 ng of pHHIV2 DNA, as the template, were used for each PCR. Vent DNA polymerase was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 20 rounds of amplification was performed in each reaction. The amplification conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for three rounds. This was followed by amplification conditions that used 94 °C for 2 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s for 17 additional rounds. The resultant product donor DNA was isolated after electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels equilibrated with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (5Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified DNA (600 ng) was recovered using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The integration donors were ∼300 bp in length and were internally labeled during the PCR by the inclusion of [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). The final concentrations of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates during amplification reactions were 0.25 mm each of unlabeled dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. The final dCTP concentration was 0.0502 mm (12 Ci/mmol, 0.6 mCi/ml). The concerted integration reaction conditions were similar to those described previously (5Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brin E. Leis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10938-10948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 ng (0.15 pmol of ends) of donor DNA was mixed with 50 ng of acceptor DNA (0.02 pmol) and 80 ng of HIV-1 IN (1.25 pmol) in an 8.5-μl preincubation reaction mixture containing, at final concentrations, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 23 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 1.6 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), and 3.3 mmEDTA. The IN was diluted in a buffer containing 30% glycerol, 0.5m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Where specified 100 ng of HMG-I(Y) was added to the reaction mixtures. The preincubation reaction mixtures were placed on ice overnight. The volume of each preincubation mixture was then increased to 10 μl with the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 7.5 mm, and the integration assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by increasing the volume to 150 μl by the addition of EDTA (final concentration of 4.25 mm), SDS (final concentration of 0.44%), and proteinase K (final concentration of 0.06 mg/ml). After digestion for 60 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol followed by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 mixture). Fifteen μl of 3m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added along with 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock solution). The reaction products were precipitated by the addition of 450 μl of 100% ethanol and washed twice with 70% ethanol prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography. The reaction products were separated on a 1% agarose gel run in 0.5× Tris borate, EDTA, and ethidium bromide at 10 V/cm for 2 h. Following electrophoresis, gels were submerged in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min or until the bromphenol blue dye turned bright yellow. After washing with water, the gels were dried on DE81 paper (Whatman) in a Bio-Rad slab gel dryer at 80 °C for ∼2 h under vacuum. Quantitation of reaction products was carried out using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 5.0 software. Experiment with WT donor integrants always accompanied experiment with mutant donor integrants as controls. All experiments were repeated at least 2 times. In all experiments, integration products were used directly for transformation of bacteria. The integration products were introduced into E. coliMCI061/P3 by electroporation, using a Bio-Rad electroporator with 0.1-cm electroporation cuvettes, 1.8-kV voltage, 25-microfarad capacitance, and 200-ohm resistance. The P3 episome is maintained at a low copy number. Therefore, only 40 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, or 10 μg/ml tetracycline were required for selection. Under these conditions, we detected no colonies after supF selection when the donor, acceptor, or donor and acceptor were electroporated into cells in the absence of IN. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from individual clones, and integration junctions were sequenced by using primers U3seq (for sequencing the U3 junction) and U5seq (for sequencing the U5 junction). Sequencing was performed using the Thermo-Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). We used the χ2 test to examine the statistical significance of the influence of base composition at one position on the sequence selection at the other. HIV-1 sequences with the following GenBankTM accession numbers were analyzed for sequence conservation/variability and relationship between bases (Table VIII): AB023804, AB032740, AB032741,AB049811, AB052867, AB052995, AF003887, AF003888, AF004394, AF004885,AF033819, AF042100, AF042101, AF042106, AF049494, AF049495, AF064699,AF069140, AF070521, AF075719, AF084936, AF086817, AF110959, AF110962,AF110963, AF110964, AF110965, AF110966, AF110967, AF110968, AF110969,AF110970, AF110971, AF110972, AF110973, AF110974, AF110975, AF110976,AF110977, AF110978, AF133821, AF164485, AF197338, AF197339, AF197340,AF197341, AF119819, AF119820, AF256205, AF256206, AF256207, AF256208,AF256210, AF256211, AF259954, AF259955, AF286236, AF286365, AF290030,AF321523, AF385934, AF385935, AF385936, AJ006287, AJ237565, AJ245481,AJ271370, AJ271445, AJ288981, AJ288982, AJ291719, AJ302646, AJ302647,D10112, D86068, K02007, K02013, K02083, K03454, K03455, L02317, L20571,L20587, L31963, L39106, M17449, M17451, M19921, M26727, M38429, M62320,M93258, M93259, NC_001802, U12055, U21135, U23487, U34603, U34604,U37270, U43096, U43141, U51189, U54771, U69584, U69585, U39362, U69586,U69587, U69588, U69589, U69592, U88822, X01762, X04415, and Z11530.Table VIIIFrequency of each base at positions 1–20 of U5 and U3 LTRs2019181716151413121110987654321U5 LTR8-aNumbers shown in boldface correspond to the wild type sequence.G28902386770100000000114001150A31111934116115116116000001160011610T85157921500001161116011600100116C00300000001140116002115000U3 LTRG0960230000076000000001160A116529311511610116310003800011600T00990009111609100781160000116C015150102400011511611600116116000Data derived from 116 sequences of HIV-1 published in GenBank™that contain both U3 and U5 LTRs.8-a Numbers shown in boldface correspond to the wild type sequence. Open table in a new tab Data derived from 116 sequences of HIV-1 published in GenBank™that contain both U3 and U5 LTRs. To examine sequence requirements by HIV-1 IN for the U3 and U5 IN recognition sequences, we constructed a library of mini donor DNA substrates that contained randomized nucleotides at different positions in the IN recognition sequences. These substrates were then used to reconstitute concerted DNA integration in vitro in which IN was allowed to select those sequences from the library that supported concerted DNA integration. The conditions for reconstitution of integration are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first mini donor DNA library analyzed contained randomization deoxyribonucleotides at positions 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 20 (see Fig. 1) of U5 while leaving the U3 IN recognition sequence as wild type. These positions represent the mismatched bases in the nearly perfect inverted repeat in the HIV-1 U3 and U5 RNA termini. Integration products from reactions with labeled donor DNA were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by PhosphorImaging. The yield of integrants obtained with the library of U5 randomized donors was 10% that observed with the wild type donor DNA (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). This decrease was also reflected in the numbers of colonies recovered after the integration reactions were introduced into bacteria (Fig. 2B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These colonies are derived from integrants arising from two-ended insertions of the donor into an acceptor. When individual integrants were sequenced, we found that 80% arose by a concerted mechanism, exhibiting all of the characteristics associated with integration in vivo (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table I in Supplemental Material). The remainder arose by a non-concerted mechanism, which introduced deletions into the acceptor DNA (Table I in Supplemental Material). In examining the bases selected in the different randomized positions of the recovered and sequenced concerted DNA integrants, we found all 4 bases at each randomized position (Table I). The fact that these integrants arose by a concerted DNA integration mechanism indicates that there is considerable plasticity as to what constitutes an IN recognition sequence, especially considering that we have effectively mutated 40% of the U5 IN recognition sequence. However, upon a closer analysis, selection preferences for and against different bases were detected. For instance, only two concerted DNA integrants contained T at position 5. Also G was almost completely excluded from positions 6, 9, and 20 (Table I). In contrast, A was preferred at position 6, whereas T was most often selected at position 9 as found in the U5 wild type viral sequence. At position 16, A and C were preferred even though G is found at this position in the wild type U5 viral sequence. T and C were selected at position 20 where T is the wild type base (Table I). The data presented in Table I were derived from two separate experiments. The distribution of selected bases at each position is presented in Table I, see the numbers in parentheses.Table ISelection of bases in the HIV-1 U5 IN recognition sequence in vitro from donor DNAs with eight non-conserved base positions randomized5691113141620G17 (8, 9)2 (0, 2)4 (2, 2)7 (4, 3)8 (3, 5)12 (1, 11)5 (2, 3)2 (1, 1)A16 (10, 6)24 (11, 13)8 (5, 3)13 (7, 6)9 (3, 6)10 (7, 3)17 (9, 8)8 (1, 7)T2 (1, 1)10 (6, 4)22 (12, 10)15 (7, 8)15 (7, 8)18 (11, 7)7 (4, 3)19 (10, 9)C13 (5, 8)12 (7, 5)14 (5, 9)13 (6, 7)16 (11, 5)8 (5, 3)19 (9, 10)19 (12, 7)Number of each base selected at each randomized position of U5 N8 donor in the sequenced pool of concerted integrants is shown.

The numbers in parentheses are derived from the two separate experiments. The sum is shown outside of the parentheses. Individual sequences may be found in the Supplemental Material. A further analysis of the sequence of the concerted integrants revealed that the bases at certain positions were found in combination with bases at other positions (Fig. 3A). For instance, the strongest statistically significant relationship occurs between positions 13 and 16. The probability (p) of position 13 as a specific base in combination with position 16 is 0.000022. The probability was calculated using χ2 analysis. A p value of less than 0.1 was considered significant. For example, when G is found in position 13, one finds T at position 16; when A is found at position 13, one now finds C at position 16; when T is found at position 13, one finds A at position 16 (Fig. 4). Other examples of preferred combination of bases were at positions 6 and 13, at positions 6 and 16, at positions 14 and 9, and at positions 20 and 6. The presence of the wild type T (as opposed to C) at position 20 resulted in selection of a wild type base A at position 6. Also, even though a wild type A was not a preferred base at position 13, 5 of 9 A nucleotides selected at this position were in donors containing wild type A at position 6. Only five donors were selected with wild type G at position 16. Interestingly, four of five were in donors containing wild type base A at position 6. The presence of wild type base A at position 14 resulted in selection of wild type T at position 9. Other combinations of interactions were not considered statistically significant.Figure 4Example of relationship between positions in U5 LTR end.A, relationship of base content at position 13 with base selection at position 16.

DNA integration reactions were carried out with IN, HMG-(I/Y), acceptor DNA, and a mini donor DNA containing randomized bases at mismatched positions in U5 LTR end, whereas U3 LTR end contained wild type terminal U3 sequence.

In this instance, the number of integrants from the library as analyzed by agarose gel was 75% that of wild type donor level (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). As expected, there was a further decrease in the percentage of colonies recovered compared with wild type when introduced into bacteria (Fig. 2B). Previous analysis of specific mutant substrates indicated that a wild type U5 promotes one-ended insertion events when the U3 IN recognition sequence is mutated (14Brin E. Leis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10938-10948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Of the two-ended donor insertion integrants sequenced, only 56% arose by a concerted integration mechanism (Fig. 2C and Table II in the Supplemental Material). An analysis of concerted integrants indicated that all bases were found in all mutated positions (Table II), similar to what was observed with the randomized U5 substrates. There was a preference for selection of the wild type T at position 6, the U5 G at position 5, and U5 T at position 20. As with the previous data set, sequences were derived from two independent experiments (Table II, see the numbers in parentheses).Table IISelection of bases in the HIV-1 U3 IN recognition sequence in vitro from donor DNAs with eight non-conserved base positions randomized5691113141620G16 (9, 7)4 (2, 2)11 (6, 5)12 (7, 5)9 (6, 3)5 (3, 2)9 (5, 4)4 (1, 3)A8 (4, 4)9 (5, 4)6 (2, 4)5 (2, 3)7 (5, 2)11 (4, 7)5 (3, 2)8 (4, 4)T4 (3, 1)15 (9, 6)10 (4, 6)6 (2, 4)8 (2, 6)10 (5, 5)10 (7, 3)14 (8, 6)C5 (1, 4)5 (1, 4)6 (5, 1)10 (6, 4)9 (4, 5)7 (5, 2)9 (2, 7)7 (4, 3)Number of each base selected at each randomized position of U3 N8 donor in the sequenced pool of concerted integrants is shown.

The numbers in parentheses are derived from the two separate experiments. The sum is shown outside of the parentheses. Individual sequences may be found in the Supplemental Material. We further analyzed the data for statistically significant biases in selection of bases at the different positions (Fig. 3B). The selection of specific bases at positions 6 and 16 deviated significantly from random. Four of five sequences containing A at position 16 as in wild type U3 also had T at position 6 as in wild type U3. Combination of specific bases at position 13 with positions 5, 6, 11, 14, and 20 were also detected. Choice of base at position 20 affected base selection at position 13. Only the presence of viral base T at position 13 resulted in selection of A at position 20 which is present in wild type U3 LTR and only the presence of an A at position 20 induced selection of T at position 13. The presence of T at position 13 led to selection of G or A at position 5, whereas a wild type C was excluded; C was preferred at position 11 where G is found in viral U3 LTR; at position 14 the wild type base T was also not preferred. Four of the five C nucleotides at position 6 were found in donors containing T at position 13. T was almost exclusively found at position 6 when G was present at position 13. Specific combinations of bases were found at positions 9 and 20, at positions 11 and at positions 13 and 14, and positions 14 and 6. Other combinations were considered not statistically significant. IN was presented with a library of donor DNAs containing all 4 bases at positions 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 20 in both IN recognition sequences. Thus a total of 16 of the 40 specific base pair positions of the IN recognition sequences were randomized in these substrates. The integration reaction with these donor molecules, as analyzed by gel electrophoresis, was similar to that observed when using a donor DNA in which only the U5 IN recognition sequence was mutated (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4, and Fig. 2B). Of the two-ended integrants sequenced, 51% was derived by a concerted DNA integration mechanism (Fig. 2C and Table III in the Supplemental Material). This was similar to what was observed with the substrates containing only randomizations in U3 IN recognition sequence. The pattern of base selection by HIV-1 IN was analyzed from the pool of sequenced concerted integrants. Overall, T was selected predominantl"

Although previous structure and mutagenesis studies indicated the importance of lysine 56 in cyclohydrolase catalysis, the role of several surrounding residues had not been explored. In addition to further defining the role of lysine 56, the work presented in this study explores the functions of glutamine 100 and aspartate 125 through the use of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. Mutants at position 100 are inactive with respect to cyclohydrolase activity while preserving significant dehydrogenase levels. We succeeded in producing a K56Q/Q100K double mutant, which has no cyclohydrolase yet retains more than two-thirds of wild type dehydrogenase activity. Neither activity is detectable in aspartate 125 mutants with the exception of D125E. The results indicate that the function of glutamine 100 is to activate lysine 56 for cyclohydrolase catalysis and that aspartate 125 is involved in the binding of the H4folate substrates. In highlighting the importance of these residues, catalytic mechanisms are proposed for both activities as well as an explanation for the differences in channeling efficiency in the forward and reverse directions.

The interconversion of 5,10-methylene-H4folate with 5,10-methenyl-H4folate is accomplished through the NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity, whereas 5,10-methenyl-H4folate and 10-formyl-H4folate are interconverted by the cyclohydrolase activity. A significant amount of the labile methenyl-H4folate intermediate is channeled between the two activities in the forward direction (50–60%), whereas in the reverse direction, channeling is complete (1Pawelek P.D. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because 5,10-methylene-H4folate and 10-formyl-H4folate are important contributors to methionine, serine, thymidylate, and purine syntheses (reviewed in Ref. 2MacKenzie R.E. Blakley R. Benkovic S.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 255-306Google Scholar), their interconversion within eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is crucial to maintain a proper balance of one-carbon precursors.Several lines of evidence have pointed to the fact that both these activities share a common active site. Proteolysis experiments that isolated the bifunctional domain from the trifunctional enzyme failed to resolve the dehydrogenase from the cyclohydrolase activities (3Tan L.U.L. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim.

The relative positions of the two domains is different in each subunit of the dimer, indicating that these domains can move around two well defined hinge regions and adapt the size of the cleft to accommodate substrates (9Allaire M., Li, Y. MacKenzie R.E. Cygler M. Structure. 1998; 6: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NADP+ binds to the C-terminal domain on one side of the active site cleft through interactions of the 2′-phosphate with Arg173 and Ser197 (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis studies confirmed the importance of these two residues in dinucleotide cofactor binding (10Pawelek P.D. Allaire M. Cygler M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The structure of DC301 with bound folate analogs localized the folate binding site to the other side of the cleft (11Schmidt A., Wu, H. MacKenzie R.E. Chen V.J. Bewly J.R. Ray J.E. Toth J.E.

Tyr52 was found to only contribute to substrate positioning through hydrophobic stacking interactions, whereas Lys56 mutants completely lost cyclohydrolase activity and retained residual dehydrogenase activity. From these structures and existing mutagenesis data, a preliminary mechanism was proposed for DC301 catalysis in the forward direction (11Schmidt A., Wu, H. MacKenzie R.E. Chen V.J. Bewly J.R.

A Ser49-Gln100-Pro102 motif was suggested to be important in catalysis, because the three residues apparently coordinate the binding of a water molecule and Gln100 makes a hydrogen bond contact with the catalytic lysine. Moreover, the structure of DC301 with the bound Ly345899 inhibitor suggests a role for Asp125 in folate binding (Fig. 1b). A flexible loop spanning positions 241–250 positioned at roughly 10 Å from the active site may be involved in closing over the active site upon substrate binding and protecting the labile methenyl-H4folate intermediate from release to the solvent.

https://openalex.org/W2026737025,"This study presents the molecular structure of the extracellular domain of vaccinia virus envelope protein, A27L, determined by NMR and CD spectroscopy. A recombinant protein, eA27L-aa, containing this domain in which cysteines 71 and 72 were replaced with alanine, was constructed to prevent self-assembly due to intermolecular disulfide bonds between these two cysteines. The soluble eA27L-aa protein forms an oligomer resembling that of A27L on vaccinia virions. Heteronuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy was carried out on eA27L-aa in the presence or absence of urea to determine backbone resonance assignments. Chemical shift index (CSI) propensity analysis showed that eA27L-aa has two distinct structural domains, a relatively flexible 22-amino acid random coil in the N-terminal region and a fairly rigid α-helix structure in the remainder of the structure. Binding interaction studies using isothermal titration calorimetry suggest that a 12-amino acid lysine/arginine-rich segment in the N-terminal region is responsible for glycosaminoglycan binding. The rigid α-helix portion of eA27L-aa is probably involved in the intrinsic self-assembly, and CSI propensity analysis suggests that region N37-E49, with a residual α-helix tendency, is probably the self-assembly core. Self-assembly was ascribed to three hydrophobic leucine residues (Leu41, Leu45, and Leu48) in this segment. The folding mechanism of eA27L-aa was analyzed by CD spectroscopy, which revealed a two-step transition with a Gibbs free energy of 2.5 kcal/mol in the absence of urea. Based on these NMR and CD studies, a residue-specific molecular model of the extracellular domain of A27L is proposed. These studies on the molecular structure of eA27L-aa will help in understanding how vaccinia virus enters cells."

Using a recombinant probe derived from influenza C virus hemagglutinin, we discovered 9-O-acetylated protein in the Golgi complex of various cell lines, most of which did not display 9-O-acetylated sialic acid on the cell surface. All cell lines expressed a sulfated glycoprotein of 50 kDa (sgp50) carrying 9-O- acetylated sialic acids, which was used as a model substrate. Like gp40, the major receptor for influenza C virus of Madin-Darby canine kidney I cells, sgp50 is 9-O-acetylated on O-linked glycans. However, gp40 was not 9-O-acetylated when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney II or COS-7 cells. The results demonstrate the existence of two 9-O-acetylation machineries for O-glycosylated proteins with distinct substrate specificities. The widespread occurrence of 9-O-acetylated protein in the Golgi furthermore suggests an additional intracellular role for this modification. 9-O-Acetylation of sialic acid is known as a cell type-specific modification of secretory and plasma membrane glycoconjugates of higher vertebrates with important functions in modulating cell-cell recognition.

The widespread occurrence of 9-O-acetylated protein in the Golgi furthermore suggests an additional intracellular role for this modification. Sialic acids constitute a family of acidic monosaccharides typically found at terminal positions of glycoconjugates. Their diversity is mainly the result of enzymatic acetylation of hydroxyl groups at carbons 4, 7, 8, and 9 (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). 9-O-Acetylation is the most prevalent modification of sialic acids of glycoproteins and gangliosides in higher vertebrates. It is a tissue-specific and tightly regulated modification involved in various important processes such as cell-cell interaction and development (2Schauer R. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For example, binding of the B-cell adhesion molecule Siglec-2 (CD22β) to sialylated ligands on the surface of thymocytes is inhibited by 9-O-acetylation (5Sjoberg E.R. Powell L.D. Klein A. Varki A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 9-O-acetylation was found to be crucial at the two-cell stage of murine development and later in the organization of the retina (6Varki A. Hooshmand F. Diaz S. Varki N.M. Hedrick S.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 65-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 9-O-Acetyl sialic acid also serves as the receptor for influenza C virus (7Rogers G.N. Herrler G. Paulson J.C. Klenk H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5947-5951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a group of corona viruses (8Schultze B. Herrler G. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (9Schultze B. Herrler G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 342: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and thus appears to be a major determinant of their cell tropism (10Herrler G. Klenk H.D. Virology. 1987; 159: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). O-Acetyl transferases for sialic acids have resisted purification or cloning thus far. However, their activity was localized to the trans side of the Golgi apparatus (11Chammas R. McCaffery J.M. Klein A. Ito Y. Saucan L. Palade G. Farquhar M.G. Varki A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1691-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By “freeze-frame” analysis with isolated membranes of rat hepatocytes, 9-O-acetylation was shown to occur in a compartment of the trans-Golgi network separate from that of sialylation and galactosylation (11Chammas R. McCaffery J.M. Klein A. Ito Y. Saucan L. Palade G. Farquhar M.G. Varki A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1691-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this system, 9-O-acetylation was enriched on membrane-bound but not soluble cargo proteins leaving the trans-Golgi network. 9-O-Acetylation is specific for only a subset of sialoglycoproteins expressed in a given cell type, indicating that substrate recognition by 9-O-acetyl transferase(s) extends beyond the sialic acid itself. The 9-O-acetylation patterns of different cell types are thus likely to be the result of differential expression of substrates and/or transferase(s). Very few protein substrates for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids have been identified at the molecular level, and all of them are sialomucins: bovine submaxillary mucin, CD43 and CD45RB of T lymphocytes (12Krishna M.

Madin-Darby canine kidney phosphate-buffered saline Sambucus nigra agglutinin Chinese hamster ovary nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Maackia amurensis hemagglutinin N-acetylglucosamine Influenza C virus was found to be extremely useful in detecting and characterizing 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins and gangliosides. The viral 9-O-acetyl sialic acid binding activity (the hemagglutinin, H) is part of a multifunctional spike protein, HEF, which also contains a receptor destroying acetylesterase activity (E) and a fusion function (F) (15Herrler G. Durkop I. Becht H. Klenk H.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The entire virus has been used to detect 9-O-acetyl sialic acid in tissues and cell lines and on Western blots (13Zimmer G. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. J. Biol.

In addition, a chimeric protein, CHE-Fc, consisting of the influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase domains fused to the Fc region of human IgG1, was constructed as a specific tool for the detection of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates in histochemistry, Western blots, thin-layer chromatography overlays (20Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry (12Krishna M. Varki A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1997-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and even immunogold electron microscopy (11Chammas R. McCaffery J.M. Klein A. Ito Y. Saucan L. Palade G. Farquhar M.G. Varki A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1691-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we have used CHE-Fc as a probe to analyze the subcellular distribution of 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins in a variety of cell lines by fluorescence microscopy. We discovered that all cell lines tested, including some that were previously shown to be resistant to infection by influenza C virus and considered to lack 9-O- acetyl sialic acid, stained positive intracellularly in the Golgi apparatus. A sulfated glycoprotein of 50 kDa could be precipitated by CHE-Fc in all cases and was useful as a model substrate of this ubiquitous, intracellular 9-O-acetylation. Our results indicate that differential 9-O-acetylation patterns in various cell types depend on differences in both the substrates and the acetylation machineries. MDCK I cells were obtained from G. Herrler (Tierärztliche Hochschule, Hannover, Germany), and calf primary aortic endothelial cells were obtained from K. Fiedler (Biozentrum, Universität Basel, Basel, Switzerland). These cell lines, as well as MDCK II, COS-1, CaCo2, HepG2, HEK-293, HeLa, NIH-3T3, BHK-21, CHO-K1, and CHO-Lec1 cells, were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium or Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 7.5% CO2. The media were supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHE-Fc, the chimera of influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase and the Fc region of human IgG, was produced by stably transfected HEK-293 cells provided by A. Varki (University of California, San Diego, CA). The cells were adapted to the protein-free medium CHO-S-SFM II (Invitrogen) and grown in a CELLine CL 350 device (Integra Bioscience). Conditioned medium was collected twice a week and kept at 4 °C until purification. CHE-Fc was isolated using protein A-Sepharose as described previously (20Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The probe was concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon-50 filter device (Amicon). To inactivate the esterase activity, CHE-Fc was incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, producing CHE-FcD. To improve the binding efficiency of the probe, inactivation was repeated, followed by dialysis against PBS. CHE-FcD was stable at 4 °C for several months. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on 14-mm glass coverslips, fixed with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. To permeabilize the cells, the cells were then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Alternatively, cells were fixed with methanol and acetone according to Schwarz and Futerman (21Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar),i.e. using conditions shown to extract glycolipids. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum (PBSB). The fixed cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CHE-FcD in PBSB for 1 h, washed with PBSB, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-human immunoglobulin secondary antibody diluted 1:400 in PBSB for 30 min. After additional washes with PBSB, PBS, and water, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Hoechst) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo- (2,2,2)-octane and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. For double immunofluorescence, the fixed cells were also incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies against giantin (a gift from H.-P. Hauri, Biozentrum) followed by incubation with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies. Cell lysates were split in two halves, one of which was incubated with 0.1 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C and neutralized with HCl. Both samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated at 4 °C with 3 μg/ml CHE-FcD in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin. After several washes in PBS/0.05% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG was added in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin. The blot was developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Biosciences. To aid characterization, gp40 (provided by G. Herrler) was fused to the tag sequence HMY, which is composed of a His6 sequence for Ni2+-NTA-agarose purification, a c-myc epitope, and a nonapeptide consensus sequence for tyrosine sulfation (22Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence encoding the signal peptide of gp40 was exchanged by the sequence encoding the signal and the HMY tag from MPR46HMY (23Itin C. Rancano C. Nakajima Y. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27737-27744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (provided by C. Itin, Stanford University). For this purpose, an in-frame KpnI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the triple tag sequence and at the 5′ end of the sequence encoding the mature sequence of gp40 by PCR. The two segments were ligated at the KpnI site and introduced into the expression plasmid pCB6 and the retroviral shuttle vector pMX-IRES (24Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (from J. Bogan and H. F. Lodish, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). MDCK I cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Clonal cell lines resistant to 0.8 mg/ml G418-sulfate (Geneticin; Invitrogen) were isolated and screened for expression of gp40HMY by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine followed by Ni2+-NTA-agarose purification according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen), SDS-gel electrophoresis, and fluorography or phosphorimaging. For expression in MDCK II cells, we took advantage of a MDCK II cell line (MDCK IIeco) stably expressing the murine ecotropic receptor for Moloney murine leukemia virus particles, which was prepared by transfecting MDCK II cells with pIRESeco-neo (from J. Bogan) and selecting for resistance to G418-sulfate (Invitrogen). Virus particles were produced by transfection of ΦNX-Eco cells, virus-free helper cells obtained form J. Nolan (Stanford University), with pMX-gp40HMY. Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate was performed as described previously (22Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C, lysed, and subjected to precipitation with Ni2+-NTA-agarose, lectin-agarose, or CHE-FcD on protein A-Sepharose. Five μg of CHE-FcD prebound to 20 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads were added per sample. The suspensions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in PBS and finally boiled in gel loading buffer containing reducing agent. The eluate was separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and analyzed by fluorography. The biotinylated lectins Maackia amurensis hemagglutinin (MAH, sold as MAL-II by Vector Laboratories; 5 μg/sample) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA; Vector Laboratories; 10 μg/sample) were coupled to avidin-agarose (Pierce; 10 μl packed beads/sample) for lectin precipitation. As a control, the 9-O-acetyl modification was hydrolyzed by mild base treatment by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH to the samples, incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, and neutralization with HCl. To test for membrane integration of sgp50, [35S]sulfate-labeled cells were subjected to saponin or alkaline extraction (25Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) before precipitation with CHE-FcD. To block N-glycosylation, cells were preincubated for 4 h and [35S]sulfate-labeled in the presence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma). Complete inhibition of N-glycosylation was confirmed in a parallel analysis of MDCK II cells expressing the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 (data not shown). To remove N-glycans, CHE-FcD precipitates were suspended in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. After the addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%, samples were incubated with 0.25 unit of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Roche Biochemicals) for 3 h at 37 °C. Samples were then analyzed directly or after a second precipitation with CHE-FcD. To test for O-glycosylation of sgp50, CHE-FcD precipitates were incubated with 5 milliunits of neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafasciens for 4 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, followed by incubation with 1.25 milliunits of O-glycosidase (both from Roche Biochemicals) after the addition of 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, overnight at 37 °C. To test for the presence of chondroitin sulfate chains, [35S]sulfate-labeled gp40HMY isolated from a 35-mm well of gpHMY expressing MDCK I cells was purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose and incubated on the beads with or without 0.2 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Fluka) in 100 μl of 33 mm Tris acetate, 66 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9, for 3 h at 37 °C. The samples were then boiled with SDS-gel sample buffer and analyzed. To suppress glycosaminoglycan synthesis or sialylation of O-linked glycans, cells were incubated for 18 h with 2 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-xyloside or 10 mm benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (benzyl-GalNAc; both from Sigma), respectively (27Lohmander L.S.

Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were then labeled with [35S]sulfate for 1 h and analyzed by precipitation with Ni2+-NTA-agarose or CHE-FcD gel electrophoresis and fluorography. To analyze sgp50, the cells were incubated with tunicamycin before and during labeling as described above to inhibit N-glycosylation. CHE-Fc, the fusion protein of influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase with the constant region of human IgG, efficiently binds to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid if the esterase is inactivated by diisopropyl fluorophosphate treatment (20Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have used the resulting CHE-FcD as a probe for fluorescence microscopy in combination with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-human IgG antibody on MDCK I and II cells (Fig. 1). Previous studies using whole influenza C virions have shown that MDCK I cells contain abundant 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates on their surface, mediating efficient infection, whereas the closely related MDCK II cells do not (13Zimmer G. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17815-17822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, unpermeabilized MDCK I cells were strongly labeled by CHE-FcD on the cell surface. Upon permeabilization, additional perinuclear staining became apparent (Fig. 1B), most likely corresponding to the trans-Golgi, where 9-O-acetylation takes place. The specificity of staining for 9-O-acetyl sialic acids was demonstrated using CHE-Fc with the active esterase (Fig. 1C): as the esterase hydrolyzed the 9-O-acetyl esters, staining was eliminated. Consistent with the experiments using viral infection, MDCK II cells were completely negative for CHE-FcD staining at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1E). In permeabilized cells, however, a strong perinuclear signal was discovered (Fig. 1F), which was specific for 9-O-acetylation because it was eliminated when untreated CHE-Fc was used (Fig. 1G). Even when the cells were fixed with methanol and acetone under conditions that have been shown to extract glycolipids (21Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the labeling pattern was retained, indicating that the molecules detected by CHE-FcD are primarily glycoproteins. A similar staining pattern was observed in a variety of different cell lines derived from different tissues and species (Table I and Fig. 2). None of these cell lines showed any detectable CHE-FcD labeling at the cell surface, yet all of them showed perinuclear staining. Intracellular 9-O-acetylation of sialoglycoconjugates is thus a very common, if not ubiquitous, modification.Table IExpression of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid in different cell linesCell line (origin)Cell surface 9-O-AcSia1-a9-O-Acetylated sialic acid (9-O-AcSia) detected at the cell surface or in the Golgi by fluorescence microscopy of nonpermeabilized or permeabilized cells, respectively, using CHE-FcD as a probe visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated protein A as in Fig. 1.Golgi 9-O-AcSia1-a9-O-Acetylated sialic acid (9-O-AcSia) detected at the cell surface or in the Golgi by fluorescence microscopy of nonpermeabilized or permeabilized cells, respectively, using CHE-FcD as a probe visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated protein A as in Fig. 1.9-O-Acetylated sgp501-bExpression of a sulfated, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoprotein (sgp50) as determined by precipitation from lysed, [35S]sulfate-labeled cells using CHE-FcD and protein A-Sepharose as in the experiments shown in Fig. 5.MDCK I (kidney, dog)+++MDCK II (kidney, dog)−++BHK-21 (kidney, hamster)−+n.d.1-cn.d., not determined.CaCo2 (intestine, human)−++CHO-K1 (ovary, hamster)−++CHO-Lec1 (ovary, hamster)−++COS-7 (kidney, monkey)−++CPAE (endothelia, bovine)−++HEK-293 (kidney, human)−++HeLa (cervix, human)−++HepG2 (liver, human)−++NIH-3T3 (fibroblast, mouse)−++1-a 9-O-Acetylated sialic acid (9-O-AcSia) detected at the cell surface or in the Golgi by fluorescence microscopy of nonpermeabilized or permeabilized cells, respectively, using CHE-FcD as a probe visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated protein A as in Fig. 1.1-b Expression of a sulfated, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoprotein (sgp50) as determined by precipitation from lysed, [35S]sulfate-labeled cells using CHE-FcD and protein A-Sepharose as in the experiments shown in Fig. 5.1-c n.d., not determined. Open table in a new tab The intracellular staining pattern is reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. To test this directly, calf primary aortic endothelial cells were colabeled with CHE-FcD and an antibody against the Golgi marker giantin (29Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Both probes stained the same structures (Fig. 3, A and B). Even upon incubation with brefeldin A, which causes a dramatic redistribution of Golgi elements (30Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), the labeling pattern of both probes was affected in an identical manner (Fig. 3, C and D). To visualize 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins, proteins in cell lysates were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with CHE-FcD (Fig. 4). As a control for specificity, half the samples were treated with mild base (0.1m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C) before analysis, which is sufficient to hydrolyze the O- acetyl groups on sialic acid. Accordingly, bovine submaxillary mucin, an established 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoprotein, was recognized by CHE-FcD before but not after mild base treatment (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). In MDCK I cells (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8), the major 9-O-acetylated protein has a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa, corresponding to gp40, the major influenza C virus receptor at the cell surface (13Zimmer G. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17815-17822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Zimmer G. Lottspeich F. Maisner A. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, a second specific band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa could be detected. Proteins with the same electrophoretic mobility were also observed in MDCK II and HEK-293 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 3–6), where they constitute the predominant 9-O-acetylated protein. Additional weak bands were not sensitive to mild base treatment and thus constitute unspecific signals. As an alternative detection method, CHE-FcD coupled to protein A-Sepharose was used to directly precipitate 9-O-acetylated proteins from metabolically labeled cells. Using [35S]methionine for labeling led to considerable nonspecific background (data not shown). However, when cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate, the pattern of radioactive proteins specifically precipitated with CHE-FcD was strikingly simple (Fig. 5). In all cell lines tested, a single major sulfated protein of ∼50 kDa was detected (Fig. 5,lanes 1–12; Table I), which may correspond to the major 50-kDa protein detected by CHE-FcD on Western blots (Fig. 4). This protein was called sgp50 (for sulfated glycoprotein of 50 kDa). To test whether sgp50 is a membrane protein, [35S]sulfate-labeled HEK-293 cells were extracted with 0.1% saponin (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 16), which allows soluble polypeptides to be released into the medium, whereas the membranes remain sufficiently intact to retain integrated proteins (26Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the labeled cells were subjected to alkaline extraction, which solublilizes even peripheral proteins, whereas integral membrane proteins remain pelletable with the membranes (Fig. 5, lanes 13 and 14). With both procedures, sgp50 remained with the membranes and was not released into the supernatant, indicating that it is an integral membrane protein. MDCK II cells and other cell lines may lack 9-O- acetyl sialic acids in the plasma membrane because they do not express plasma membrane substrates for 9-O- acetyl transferase. To test this possibility, gp40, the major 9-O-acetylated glycoprotein of MDCK I cells, was expressed in some of these cell lines. To allow simultaneous analysis of gp40 and endogenous sgp50 by 35S sulfation, we modified the amino terminus of gp40 on the DNA level by adding a triple tag sequence consisting of a His6 sequence for Ni2+-NTA-agarose purification, a c-myc epitope, and a nonapeptide consensus sequence for tyrosine sulfation (22Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Itin C. Rancano C. Nakajima Y. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27737-27744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The tagged protein, gp40HMY, was expressed in MDCK I and MDCK II cells. The cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate and subjected to different isolation procedures followed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 6A). gp40HMY was expressed in both cell lines to a similar extent as shown by Ni2+-NTA-agarose precipitation (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, 35S-sulfated gp40HMY was 9-O-acetylated in MDCK I cells and thus isolated with CHE-FcD like sgp50 (Fig. 6A, lane 3). In MDCK II cells, however, only sgp50, and not gp40HMY, was recognized by CHE-FcD (Fig. 6A, lane 4). The machinery for 9-O-acetylation of sgp50 therefore does not recognize gp40. The same negative result was also obtained in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig 6A, lanes 5 and 6), where gp40HMY runs with slightly lower mobility, probably due to different glycosylation. Does differential 9-O-acetylation of gp40 and sgp50 correlate with a major difference in glycosylation of the two substrates? To answer this question, we analyzed the two model substrates with respect to the presence of N- or O-glycosylation and the linkages of their sialic acids. gp40 is a mucin-like protein with extensive O-linked glycosylation, but without N-linked glycans (13Zimmer G. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17815-17822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Zimmer G. Lottspeich F. Maisner A. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On our gels, we always observed a diffuse signal around 70–120 kDa (arrow in Fig. 6, A and B) in addition to the compact band of 40 kDa when gp40 or gp40HMY was isolated. When gp40HMY expressed in MDCK I cells was labeled with [35S]sulfate, purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose, and incubated with chondroitinase, the diffuse band collapsed into the 40-kDa band (Fig. 6B, lane 2), indicating that a fraction of the proteins carried chondroitin sulfate chains. However, 9-O-acetylation of gp40HMY was obviously independent of glycosaminoglycan addition (Fig. 6A, lane 3). To test sgp50 for O-linked glycans, sgp50 was"
https://openalex.org/W2099576871,"The interactions between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Ras/MAPK kinase pathways have been the subject of considerable interest. In the current studies, we find that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) lead to rapid phosphorylation of Shc (maximum at 1–2 min), whereas insulin-mediated Shc phosphorylation is relatively delayed (maximum at 5–10 min), suggesting that an intermediary step may be necessary for insulin stimulation of Shc phosphorylation. The Src homology-2 (SH2) domain of Shc is necessary for PDGF- and EGF-mediated Shc phosphorylation, whereas the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain is critical for the actions of insulin. Because the Shc PTB domain can interact with phospholipids, we postulated that PI 3-kinase might be a necessary intermediary step facilitating insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Shc. In support of this, we found that the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, blocked insulin-stimulated but not EGF- or PDGF-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative PI 3-kinase construct (p85N-SH2) blocked insulin, but not EGF- or PDGF-induced Shc phosphorylation. All three growth factors cause localization of Shc to the plasma membrane, but only the effect of insulin was inhibited by wortmannin, supporting the view that PI 3-kinase-generated phospholipids mediate insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. Consistent with this, expression of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) increased membrane localization of Shc, and this was completely blocked by wortmannin. A mutant Shc with a disrupted PTB domain (Shc S154) did not localize to the membrane in p110CAAX-expressing cells or after insulin stimulation and was not phosphorylated by insulin. In summary, 1) PI 3-kinase is a necessary early step in insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation, whereas the effects of EGF and PDGF on Shc phosphorylation are independent of PI 3-kinase. 2) PI 3-kinase-stimulated generation of membrane phospholipids can localize Shc to the plasma membrane through the Shc PTB domain facilitating phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. The interactions between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Ras/MAPK kinase pathways have been the subject of considerable interest. In the current studies, we find that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) lead to rapid phosphorylation of Shc (maximum at 1–2 min), whereas insulin-mediated Shc phosphorylation is relatively delayed (maximum at 5–10 min), suggesting that an intermediary step may be necessary for insulin stimulation of Shc phosphorylation.

Because the Shc PTB domain can interact with phospholipids, we postulated that PI 3-kinase might be a necessary intermediary step facilitating insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Shc. In support of this, we found that the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, blocked insulin-stimulated but not EGF- or PDGF-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative PI 3-kinase construct (p85N-SH2) blocked insulin, but not EGF- or PDGF-induced Shc phosphorylation. All three growth factors cause localization of Shc to the plasma membrane, but only the effect of insulin was inhibited by wortmannin, supporting the view that PI 3-kinase-generated phospholipids mediate insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. Consistent with this, expression of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) increased membrane localization of Shc, and this was completely blocked by wortmannin. A mutant Shc with a disrupted PTB domain (Shc S154) did not localize to the membrane in p110CAAX-expressing cells or after insulin stimulation and was not phosphorylated by insulin. In summary, 1) PI 3-kinase is a necessary early step in insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation, whereas the effects of EGF and PDGF on Shc phosphorylation are independent of PI 3-kinase. 2) PI 3-kinase-stimulated generation of membrane phospholipids can localize Shc to the plasma membrane through the Shc PTB domain facilitating phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Growth factor signaling initiates a variety of biologic responses, many of which are mediated through the PI 3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinasePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2ARTKreceptor tyrosine kinasePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorSH2Src homology 2PTBphosphotyrosine bindingPIP2phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphatePIP3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphateDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumm.o.i.multiplicity of infection and the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. PI 3-kinase is a dual protein and lipid kinase composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3′-position of the inositol ring to generate phosphorylated lipid products and can also phosphorylate proteins on serine/threonine residues (1Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. et al.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Lam K. Carpenter C.L.

PI 3-kinase plays a central role in a diverse range of cellular responses, including cell growth, differentiation, protein synthesis, glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and membrane trafficking (3Shepherd P.R.

Activation of the insulin receptor or other growth factor receptors results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, which then interacts with the adapter protein Grb2, which is pre-associated with SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (4Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 5Downward J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). SOS stimulates formation of active GTP-bound Ras, which then initiates a sequence of phosphorylation events, activating a cascade of protein serine/threonine kinases. Ras activates Raf-1 kinase leading to phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase (6Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, in this pathway, Ras functions as a molecular switch converting tyrosine kinase signals into a serine/threonine kinase cascade (7Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several investigators have demonstrated an interaction between the PI3-kinase and Ras/MAP kinase pathways; however, the results have been somewhat conflicting. PI 3-kinase has been shown to stimulate Ras by some groups (8Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 9Egawa K.

To date, most of the attention has been focused on potential direct interactions between PI 3-kinase and Ras, but in this study, we have concentrated on an upstream activator of Ras, and we have explored potential interactions between PI 3-kinase signaling and Shc activation. These studies have shown that PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, whereas other growth factors, such as PDGF and EGF, can efficiently signal to Shc in the absence of the PI 3-kinase requirement. As such, these experiments demonstrate a novel mechanism of cross-talk between the PI 3-kinase and Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathways and demonstrate the specificity of this mechanism for the insulin action cascade.

Growth factor stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, with downstream activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (6Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We conducted time course experiments of Shc phosphorylation after stimulation by insulin, EGF, or PGDF. As shown in Fig. 1, although all three ligands cause phosphorylation of Shc, the time courses are decidedly different. Thus, the effects of EGF and PDGF are maximal by 1–2 min and begin to decline thereafter, while phosphorylation of Shc after insulin treatment is slower, reaching a maximal effect by 10 min. These results raise the possibility that an intermediate step exists between the insulin receptor and Shc phosphorylation, whereas the effects of the EGF and PDGF receptors on Shc phosphorylation are more direct. To assess this possibility, we examined the effects of PI 3-kinase inhibition on insulin-, EGF-, and PDGF-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2, the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation as well as insulin-stimulated association of Shc with Grb2, whereas the effects of EGF and PDGF are unchanged. Clearly, these results are consistent with a role for PI 3-kinase in insulin stimulation of Shc. To explore further the role of PI 3-kinase activation in growth factor-stimulated Shc phosphorylation, we utilized an adenoviral vector containing the p85N-SH2 domain (16Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Huang Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18528-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When expressed in cells, the p85N-SH2 domain behaves as a dominant negative inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity. Cells expressing this dominant negative PI 3-kinase construct were then stimulated with insulin, EGF, or PDGF followed by measurements of Shc phosphorylation and its association with Grb2. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of p85N-SH2 inhibits insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation, as well as Shc-Grb2 association, but did not influence the effects of EGF or PDGF. The level of expression of p85N-SH2 was the same in all conditions (data not shown), and as a control, the effectiveness of this dominant negative construct is demonstrated in Fig. 3B, which shows decreased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in p85N-SH2 domain-expressing cells. We have shown recently that Shc proteins associate with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the basal state and that after growth factor-mediated Shc phosphorylation, Shc dissociates from PP2A (23Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 demonstrates this effect showing that Shc is associated with PP2A in untreated cells and that insulin and EGF lead to Shc phosphorylation and dissociation of Shc from PP2A. In the presence of wortmannin, the effect of insulin is inhibited, whereas the actions of EGF on Shc phosphorylation are unimpaired. Because the dissociation of Shc from PP2A is dependent on Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (23Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), these experiments further support the importance of PI 3-kinase in the process of insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. Although insulin, EGF, and PDGF receptors all phosphorylate Shc, the mechanisms differ. The Shc PTB domain is responsible for binding to phosphorylated insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (24Isakoff S.J. Yu Y.P. Su Y.C. Blaikie P. Yajnik V. Rose E. Weidner K.M. Sachs M.

Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the EGF receptor requires both (25Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the Shc PTB domain can associate with phospholipids phosphorylated in the 3′-position (i.e. phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)) (29Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that PI 3-kinase stimulation of membrane phospholipid content serves to localize Shc to the plasma membrane through the Shc PTB domain, facilitating phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. In contrast, because the Shc SH2 domain binds directly to the EGF and PDGF receptors, such an intermediate step is not necessary for signaling by these growth factors. To explore this further, we expressed constitutively active PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) in cells using adenovirus gene transfer and then measured activation of Shc. Insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and its association with Grb2 were inhibited by 44 and 40%, respectively, by p110CAAX expression (Fig. 5). PDGF and EGF-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and its association with Grb2 were not inhibited by p110CAAX. Shc protein expression was not altered by p110CAAX expression (Fig. 5A, lower panel), and p110CAAX did not affect tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (data not shown). Taken together, p110CAAX inhibits insulin but not PDGF- or EGF-stimulated Shc phosphorylation, and this inhibition is distal to the insulin receptor. The above results suggest that the lipid products generated by insulin or membrane-targeted p110CAAX expression may localize Shc to the membrane. To examine this idea, we determined the effect of insulin, EGF, PDGF, and p110CAAX on membrane localization of Shc. In control cells, a small amount of Shc was localized to the plasma membrane compartment; this increased markedly after insulin stimulation and was completely blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 6). Consistent with our hypothesis, basal plasma membrane localization of Shc was increased substantially in p110CAAX-expressing cells, and this was also blocked by wortmannin. These results indicate that the membrane phospholipids generated by PI 3-kinase recruit Shc to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, EGF- or PDGF-induced Shc membrane localization was not blocked by wortmannin. These findings support our hypothesis that the Shc SH2 domain binds directly to the EGF and PDGF receptors (causing membrane localization), and an intermediate step is not necessary for signaling by these growth factors. To assess more specifically the role of the PTB domain on plasma membrane localization of Shc, we constructed FLAG-tagged wild-type Shc (Shc WT) and a mutant Shc containing a serine to proline substitution at residue 154 in the PTB domain (Shc S154P), which prevents phosphotyrosine binding (19Ricketts W.A. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1988-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These constructs were transiently expressed in uninfected and p110CAAX-infected HIRcB cells, followed by insulin stimulation. The plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions were then prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 7A, membrane localization of Shc WT was stimulated by insulin treatment and by p110CAAX expression. However, Shc S154P failed to localize to the plasma membrane in the absence or presence of insulin treatment or upon p110CAAX expression, indicating the importance of a functional Shc PTB domain for these interactions. We next determined whether Shc S154P was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation. As expected, Shc WT was phosphorylated and associated with Grb2 after insulin, EGF, and PDGF stimulation (Fig. 7B, top two panels). On the other hand, Shc S154P was not phosphorylated after insulin stimulation but was phosphorylated and associated with Grb2 in response to EGF and PDGF (Fig. 7B, top two panels). Furthermore, Shc S154P did not associate with the insulin receptor after insulin stimulation but did associate with the EGF and PDGF receptors (Fig. 7B, bottom panel). The receptors for insulin, EGF, and PDGF were phosphorylated normally after ligand stimulation (Fig. 7B, 4th panel), and the expression levels of both Shc WT and Shc S154P were comparable (Fig. 7B, 3rd panel). These results show that the PTB domain of Shc is required for phosphorylation, Grb2 association, and plasma membrane localization in response to stimulation by insulin but not by EGF or PDGF. Because the Shc PTB domain binds to PI 3-kinase-generated lipid products, which are abundant in p110CAAX cells, it seems reasonable to propose that in p110CAAX-expressing cells, Shc is targeted to membranes through its PTB domain, preventing association of Shc with the activated insulin receptor. However, because the Shc SH2 domain primarily mediates interactions with the PDGF and EGF receptors, the association between these receptors and Shc is not impaired in p110CAAX-expressing cells. Growth factors, such as EGF, PDGF, and insulin bind to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) leading to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc with subsequent activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (6Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

Because Shc contains an SH2 and a PTB domain, current thinking is that following ligand-directed tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs, these receptors directly bind to Shc leading to tyrosine phosphorylation (24Isakoff S.J.

The PI 3-kinase and Ras/MAP kinase pathways are clearly interconnected, but there is considerable debate and controversy as to sites and mechanisms of convergence (8Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J.

In the current studies, we provide evidence for a novel interaction pathway between PI 3-kinase and the Shc/Ras/MAP kinase cascade, with respect to insulin signaling. We find that PI 3-kinase stimulation is a necessary step mediating Shc phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Our data indicate that PI 3-kinase stimulation leads to generation of plasma membrane lipid products that mediate localization of Shc to the plasma membrane through the Shc PTB domain. This PI 3-kinase-dependent step is necessary for insulin receptor phosphorylation of Shc but not for interactions with the EGF or PDGF receptors. RTK activation causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, but the structural basis for Shc tyrosine phosphorylation is different for different growth factors (24Isakoff S.J. Yu Y.P. Su Y.C. Blaikie P.

With respect to the insulin receptor, it is well established that the PTB domain is necessary for interaction and tyrosine phosphorylation (24Isakoff S.J. Yu Y.P. Su Y.C. Blaikie P. Yajnik V. Rose E.

For example, a mutant Shc with a disrupted PTB domain failed to bind to insulin receptors in the two-hybrid system and was not phosphorylated in vivo (24Isakoff S.J. Yu Y.P. Su Y.C. Blaikie P.

Conversely, mutant insulin receptors with a disabled PTB domain-binding motif (NP XY domain) cannot bind to or phosphorylate Shc (26Gustafson T.A., He, W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In contrast to the insulin receptor, Shc associates with PDGF receptors via its SH2 domain (27Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas both the PTB and the SH2 domain of Shc can bind to EGF receptors (25Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M.

We found that EGF and PDGF treatment leads to very rapid phosphorylation of Shc, consistent with direct association of the Shc SH2 domain with these RTKs, which then phosphorylate Shc on tyrosine residues (27Yokote K.

Matsumura Y. Inushima K. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the time course of insulin-induced Shc phosphorylation is relatively delayed compared with EGF and PDGF, raising the possibility of an intermediary step. This step can be explained by the idea that insulin leads to activation of PI 3-kinase with generation of plasma membrane phospholipids (3Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 32Yang C. Watson R.T. Elmendorf J.S. Sacks D.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the Shc PTB can bind to PIP2 and PIP3 (29Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), bringing Shc to the plasma membrane, where the Shc PTB can then associate through equilibration to the phosphorylated insulin receptor. In this event, PI 3-kinase activation would facilitate Shc phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, creating a two-step mechanism. Consistent with this concept, we have found that treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 impairs insulin but not EGF- or PDGF-induced Shc phosphorylation. We also show that wortmannin interrupts insulin, but not EGF or PDGF, -mediated plasma membrane localization of Shc, as well as Shc association with Grb2. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative form of PI 3-kinase (p85N-SH2) also inhibits insulin but not EGF- or PDGF-stimulated Shc phosphorylation. Although the suppression of Shc phosphorylation by the dominant negative p85 construct was not 100%, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was also not complete and was comparable with the magnitude of the inhibition of Shc phosphorylation. Because the inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by this construct ranges from 70 to 100%, as we reported previously (16Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Huang Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18528-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit PI 3-kinase activity to undetectable levels, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that there is a small component of PI 3-kinase-independent insulin signaling to Shc phosphorylation. p110CAAX is a constitutively active, membrane-targeted form of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (9Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and our results show that adenoviral mediated expression of this protein results in membrane localization of Shc, consistent with the idea that phospholipids generated by PI 3-kinase recruit Shc to the membrane. Interestingly, insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation is reduced in p110CAAX-expressing cells, and we speculate that the large amount of phospholipids generated by p110CAAX can localize Shc to cellular membrane fractions, including the plasma membrane, interfering with Shc-insulin receptor association, and inhibiting insulin mediated Shc phosphorylation. In this way, the excess PI 3-kinase-generated membrane phospholipids effectively compete with the insulin receptor for binding to the Shc PTB domain. The S154P Shc contains a disrupted PTB domain (19Ricketts W.A. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1988-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and this mutation ablated p110CAAX and insulin-stimulated membrane localization, consistent with the idea that the PTB domain is necessary for this process (30Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Pratt J.C. Harlan J.E. Walk S.F. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that insulin failed to phosphorylate this S154P Shc, whereas EGF and PDGF did. Because the Shc SH2 domain can interact with PDGF and EGF receptors (25Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Pawson T. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results are consistent with the view that the intact SH2 domain of S154P Shc is sufficient to allow phosphorylation by the EGF and PDGF receptors. In summary, these data demonstrate a new insulin-specific mechanism whereby PI 3-kinase stimulation interacts with the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Thus, PI 3-kinase stimulation is necessary for insulin-induced Shc phosphorylation which then facilitates downstream signaling to Ras. In contrast, the effects of PDGF and EGF on Shc phosphorylation are independent of PI 3-kinase. Our data indicate that the mechanism for this interaction involves PI 3-kinase-induced generation of plasma membrane phospholipid products, which allow targeting of the Shc PTB domain to the cell surface where the Shc PTB domain can then interact with the insulin receptor leading to Shc phosphorylation. In contrast, the Shc SH2 domain is sufficient for interaction with the EGF and PDGF receptors. Taken together, these new data provide a novel mechanism for insulin stimulation of Shc and activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, and point out that the sites of interaction between these two different signaling cascades can be multiple and specific for a particular hormonal input.

The absence of higher stoichiometry complexes, even in the limit of high [protein], suggests that the 2:2 species represents binding saturation for this system.

However, these interactions take place when CAP and its protein partners are DNA-bound and, although CAP has been shown to interact with polymerase holoenzyme in free solution (14Blazy B.

The E. coli RNA polymerase occurs in two forms, a core enzyme with subunit composition (α)2ββ′ (Mr ∼ 385,000) and a holoenzyme with subunit composition (α)2ββ′ς (Mr ∼ 455,000; reviewed in Refs. 17Chamberlin M.

The ς subunit is required for sequence-specific promoter binding and thus for high fidelity transcription initiation (20Chamberlin M.J. Losick R. Chamberlin M.J. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.1976: 159-191Google Scholar). It also contains a surface motif that can interact with CAP when the proteins are bound at class II promoters (3Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 21Jin R. Sharif K.A. Krakow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19213-19216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two additional motifs that can interact with CAP are located within the α subunit. The best characterized of these is the “287 determinant” within the COOH-terminal domain of α (3Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Mutations of the residues that comprise this structure interfere with CAP-dependent transcription activation at class I promoters (22Zou C. Fujita N. Igarishi K. Ishihama A. Mol.

Ebright R. Gourse R. Busby S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A second motif, located within the NH2-terminal domain of the α subunit, has been implicated in CAP interactions at class II and some class III promoters (3Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 25Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G. Heyduk T. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of CAP-binding motifs indicates single RNA polymerase molecules have the potential to interact with two or more CAP dimers; evidence for such interactions at some class III promoters has been reviewed by Busby and Ebright (3Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). At present, it is not known whether similar interactions take place in the absence of DNA. In addition to directing promoter binding and providing a CAP interaction motif, the ς subunit exerts a significant influence on the self-association pattern of RNA polymerase. The holoenzyme exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomers and dimers at low salt ([KCl] ≤ 300 mm), whereas at higher [salt] the monomer form prevails (Refs. 26Pilz I. Kratky O. Rabussay D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 27Shaner S.L. Piatt D.M. Wensley C.G., Yu, H. Burgess R.R. Record M.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5539-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; this study). In contrast, the core enzyme associates to form complexes at least as large as tetramer, although the exact mechanism of core enzyme self-association remains controversial (27Shaner S.L. Piatt D.M. Wensley C.G., Yu, H. Burgess R.R. Record M.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5539-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Harris S.J. Williams R.C., Jr. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8752-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the biological role of RNA polymerase self-association is unknown, the observations that the holoenzyme binds to the lacUV5 promoter as a monomer and to the tyrT promoter as a dimer have prompted the suggestion that dimerization might influence the distribution of polymerase between available promoters (29Travers A.A. Lamond A.I. Mace H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5043-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, it is possible that dimerization controls the availability of the holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase, because dimers form preferentially when the ς subunit is present (see above). Because CAP interacts with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, it seems plausible that it might modulate the self-association and functions of RNA polymerase that take place when it is not DNA-bound. The data presented below represent a first test of this notion. E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme was the kind gift of Dr. T. Heyduk. The holoenzyme was prepared by incubating core enzyme (30Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) with a 2-fold molar excess of ς70 (31Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and purifying the reconstituted holoenzyme by MonoQ chromatography (32Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). By SDS-PAGE and sedimentation equilibrium criteria, these holoenzyme preparations were fully saturated with ς70 (results not shown). The E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein was isolated from strain pp47 containing plasmid pHA5 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Aiba). The purification followed the protocol of Fried (33Fried M. On the Interactions of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor and lac Repressor with DNA.Ph.D. dissertation.

The preparation used in this study bound 10 nmol of cAMP/mg of protein in the cAMP binding assay of Anderson et al. (34Anderson W.B. Schneider A.B. Emmer M. Perlman R.L. Pastan I. J. Biol.

Association constants were estimated by simultaneous least squares fitting of Equation 2 to multiple data sets (“global analysis”) using the program NONLIN, 3NONLIN for the Macintosh was obtained from the software archive located in the Reversible Associations in Structural and Molecular Biology web site (www.bbri.org/RASMB/rasmb.html). running on a Macintosh computer (38Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Typical analyses used nine data sets corresponding to three samples differing in nominal protein concentration, centrifuged at three rotor speeds. Our current implementation of the global analysis program NONLIN allows the modeling of self-association reactions but not hetero-associations like that of CAP with RNA polymerase. To circumvent this limitation, we fit single data sets to hetero-association models, testing several fixed values of the molecular weights of the CAP-polymerase complex. The molecular weight value that minimizes the χ2 parameter (Equation 3; Ref. 39Bevington P.R. Robinson D.K. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar) is the “best” estimate, by the least-squares criterion. χ2=∑r1ςr2[Ar−A(r) ]2Equation 3 Here the summation is over radial positions r, the observed absorbance is Ar, the standard deviation in Ar is ςr, and the absorbance predicted by the fit is A(r). A valuable feature of the χ2 parameter is that it is additive. Thus, the sum of χ2 values obtained from fitting different individual data sets (with the same binding equation) is itself a χ2 parameter (40Bailey N.T.J. Statistical Methods in Biology. 2nd Ed. Hodder and Stoughton, London1981Google Scholar). The molecular weight that minimizes this sum of χ2 parameters is the value most consistent with the data by this “global” criterion. Both holoenzyme and core RNA polymerases are known to undergo [salt]-dependent self-association reactions (26Pilz I. Kratky O. Rabussay D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Shaner S.L. Piatt D.M. Wensley C.G., Yu, H. Burgess R.R.

Thus, a characterization of the assembly states of our samples of RNA polymerase is a prerequisite to the studies of CAP-polymerase interaction described below. Representative sedimentation profiles for the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, at 4 °C, are shown in Fig. 1. Curve A is a profile obtained at 300 mm KCl; the solid line through the data is a global least squares fit of the expression for a single species (Equation 1 with ςn corresponding to RNA polymerase monomer) to nine data sets (three concentrations, three rotor speeds). The small, symmetrically distributed curve-fitting residuals demonstrate the compatibility of the single-species model with the data. The value of Mr (± 67% confidence interval) returned by this analysis was 454,000 ± 6,000, in good agreement with the value of the monomer molecular weight (4.55 × 105) predicted on the basis of the subunit composition (α2ββ′ς) of the holoenzyme (18Burgess R. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 69-100Google Scholar, 27Shaner S.L. Piatt D.M. Wensley C.G., Yu, H. Burgess R.R. Record M.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5539-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This molecular weight and the small confidence interval demonstrate that the enzyme is ς-saturated. In addition, these values are incompatible with significant self-association or degradation in our samples under these experimental conditions. Curve B is a profile obtained at 100 mm KCl; the solid line through the data is a global least squares fit of the expression for a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Equation 2) to nine data sets as described above. The molecular weight of the monomer was set at 454,000; this analysis returned an estimate of the association constant Ka = 7.37 (± 3.55) × 105m−1. The small values of the residuals and lack of obvious systematic dependence on radial position indicate that the monomer-dimer model is consistent with the data from these samples and argue strongly against the presence of higher molecular weight assemblies under these solution conditions. These results are in excellent agreement with those of Record and co-workers (27Shaner S.L. Piatt D.M. Wensley C.G., Yu, H. Burgess R.R. Record M.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5539-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), who found a monomer-dimer association with an apparent association constant of ∼106m−1 under similar ionic conditions. Representative sedimentation profiles of CAP, obtained at 4 °C and 19,000 rpm, are shown in Fig. 2. The solid curves through the data are global least squares fits of the expression for a single species (Equation 1 with ςncorresponding to CAP) to six data sets (two concentrations, three rotor speeds). The small, symmetrically distributed residuals demonstrate the compatibility of the single-species model with the data. The molecular weights returned by these analyses were 48,400 ± 1,400 for CAP in buffer containing 300 mm KCl (curve A) and 47,800 ± 1,400 for CAP in buffer containing 100 mm KCl (curve B). The agreement with the molecular weight derived from sequence (Mr(CAP dimer) = 47,238) indicates that this protein is neither degraded nor aggregated under our experimental conditions. Solutions in which CAP and RNA polymerase were combined contained an additional species with a weight-average molecular weight (∼1.1 × 106) significantly greater than that observed for the RNA polymerase dimer, in the experiments described above (908,000 ± 12,000). Shown in Fig. 3 are sedimentation equilibrium profiles acquired from mixtures containing RNA polymerase in slight molar excess (curve A) and CAP in slight molar excess (curve B). The data were fit by sedimentation models with two species (Equation 1 with two terms). When RNA polymerase was in excess (curve A), the model used contained terms for polymerase monomer(Mr set at 454,000) plus an additional species (for which Mr was a parameter of the fit). The molecular weight returned by this analysis was 1,090,000 ± 43,000, consistent with the presence of two equivalents of RNA polymerase monomer in the assembly. The small, uniformly distributed residuals (upper panel) attest to the compatibility of this model to the data. The three-species model (with terms for free CAP, RNA polymerase monomer, and a complex) fit the data as well as the two-species (polymerase + complex) model, but returned values for the concentration of free CAP that were within error equal to zero (result not shown). 4As discussed below, this result suggests that the formation constant for the CAP-RNA polymerase complex may be quite large. Other models tested, including that corresponding to the RNA polymerase monomer-dimer equilibrium, RNA polymerase dimer plus a complex, and one including terms for free CAP plus a polymerase complex, fit the data less well, as judged by significantly larger χ2 values and evidence of systematic dependence of residuals on radial position (results not shown). In contrast, when CAP was in slight molar excess over RNA polymerase (Fig. 3, curve B), the model most consistent with the data was one that included a term for free CAP and one for an additional species. The molecular weight of the additional component obtained by model fitting to this data set was 1,020,000 ± 57,400, suggesting the presence of two equivalents of RNA polymerase monomer in the assembly. As before, the small, symmetrical residuals demonstrate the compatibility of this model with the data. In this case, three-species models, with terms for CAP, RNA polymerase (either monomer or dimer), plus a complex fit the data as well as the two-term (CAP + complex) model, but returned values for the concentration of free RNA polymerase that were within error equal to zero. Other models tested (one with terms for RNA polymerase monomer and dimer only, one with terms for free polymerase monomer plus a complex and one with terms for free polymerase dimer plus a complex), fit the data significantly less well, as judged by large χ2 values and evidence of systematic dependence of residuals on radial position (results not shown). The molecular weights of the CAP-RNA polymerase complex that are returned by fitting individual data sets suggest that the complex contains two monomer equivalents of RNA polymerase, but the values lack the precision needed to specify a unique CAP:RNA polymerase stoichiometry. Global analysis with NONLIN could not be done, because the current implementation of that program does not allow modeling of hetero-associations like that of CAP with RNA polymerase. Analysis of the dependence of the sum of χ2 values on molecular weight of the complex for ensembles of data sets (nine in which CAP was in molar excess and nine with RNA polymerase in excess) revealed broad minima centered at Mr(complex) = 1 × 106 (Fig. 4). Although this value is most consistent with a 2:2 stoichiometry, the broad distributions do not rule out 2:1 and 2:3 molar ratios. To narrow the range of possible stoichiometries, the continuous variation (Job) method (43Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) was used to measure the optimal combining ratio of CAP and RNA polymerase. Seven samples prepared with total protein fixed ([CAP] + [RNA polymerase] = 7.2 × 10−7m), but ranging in mole fraction of CAP from 0 to 1, gave values of Mr (complex) compatible with a 2:2 molar ratio (mean ± S.D. = 1,060,000 ± 52,000; Fig. 5). In addition, the amount of complex observed depended on the mole fraction of CAP, giving a maximum when the mole fraction of CAP = 0.5 (equivalent to a molar ratio of 1 CAP/RNA polymerase). Together, these results support the notion that the complex has a 2:2 stoichiometry. The preferential formation of 2:2 complex and the absence of complexes of other stoichiometries (e.g. CAP:polymerase = 1:2 under conditions of polymerase excess, or CAP:polymerase = 2:1 under conditions of CAP excess) strongly suggests that the binding of CAP to RNA polymerase is cooperative. Further, the absence of detectable amounts of complex of higher molecular weight indicates that association does not proceed beyond the 2:2 ratio. Our data suggest that an overall association mechanism of the type shown by Reaction 1 and Equation 4 operates at 4 °C under our solution conditions (40 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol). 2CAP+2RNAP⇆CAP2·RNAP2 REACTION 1 Ka=[CAP2·RNAP2[CAP ]2 [RNAP ]2Equation 4 This pattern is valid over a wide range of protein concentrations. For a typical experiment in which RNA polymerase binds half of the available CAP, we estimate 5This is based on data obtained at 7,000 rpm and 4°C, in our standard buffer, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol. that the free CAP concentrations range from the detection limit (A280 ∼ 0.002 = 5 × 10−8m) near the meniscus to ∼6 × 10−6m near the bottom of the centrifuge cell. Similarly, in an RNA polymerase-excess experiment in which CAP is half-saturating, we estimate that 6 × 10−9m ≤ [RNA polymerase] ≤ 1.5 × 10−6m. Because no free CAP can be detected in a polymerase-excess experiment, [CAP]free must be <5 × 10−8m under these conditions. Taken together, the lower limit of [CAP]free and the upper limit of [RNA polymerase]free provide us with a lower-limit estimate for the formation constant,Ka ≥ 2 × 1020m−3. With several caveats (discussed below), this formation constant is compatible with previous in vitro estimates of the apparent association constant for CAP with RNA polymerase holoenzyme, in the absence of DNA. To ensure that the 2:2 pattern of interaction described above was not an artifact of our choice of solution conditions, we performed a series of experiments in which buffer composition, salt concentration, temperature, and [cAMP] were varied. Shown in Fig. 6 are sedimentation profiles of CAP-RNA polymerase mixtures brought to equilibrium in buffers containing 300 mm KCl (curve A) and 300 mm potassium glutamate (curve B). The data shown in curve A were obtained under conditions of CAP excess; the difference in molecular weights of CAP dimer (47,238) and 2:2 CAP-polymerase complex (1.0 × 106) accounts for the biphasic character of the curve. The formation of a complex containing two equivalents of RNA polymerase under conditions in which the free holoenzyme is monomeric (c.f. Fig. 1) raises the possibility that CAP binding might stabilize the dimeric form of polymerase. The data shown in curve B were obtained under conditions of slight RNA polymerase excess, and the model fit to the data is that of RNA polymerase monomer (Mr = 455,000) plus a CAP-polymerase complex. The molecular weight of the complex returned by this analysis is 1,030,000 ± 26,000; this value is most consistent with a 2:2 CAP:polymerase stoichiometry. The formation of similar 2:2 complexes in chloride- and glutamate-containing buffers suggests that the CAP-polymerase association pattern is not highly sensitive to the identity of the dominant solution anion. CAP is a cAMP-dependent transcription activator (1Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44deCrombrugghe B. Busby S. Buc H. Science. 1984; 224: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar,45Adhya S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10797-10800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it was of interest to determine whether cAMP binding affects its interaction with the polymerase holoenzyme. Shown in Fig. 7 (curve A) are data obtained at 4 °C in buffer supplemented with 20 μm cAMP. This concentration of cAMP is sufficient to form the complex containing 1cAMP/CAP dimer that is active in sequence-specific DNA binding, under conditions of pH and salt concentration comparable with those used here (35Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 46Hudson J.M. Crowe M. Fried M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As shown by the high quality of the fit, the data are compatible with a two-species model (RNA polymerase monomer plus a CAP-polymerase complex). The quality of the fit is not significantly improved by the inclusion of terms for additional species (result not shown), indicating that the binding is not weakened by cAMP to the point that free CAP has become detectable. 6Although this prevents any conclusion about whether cAMP alters the stability of the CAP-polymerase interaction, it is also incompatible with a large destabilization of the complex. Analysis using the two-species model returns a molecular weight estimate for the complex of 1,070,000 ± 48,000. This is in good agreement with values obtained in the absence of cAMP and is consistent with the notion that the association pattern is independent of [cAMP] over the range 0 < [cAMP] < 20 μm. Kinetic and enzymatic protection studies show that RNA polymerase-promoter complexes undergo a substantial temperature-dependent isomerization, corresponding to the formation of one or more “open” complexes (c.f. Refs.47Roe J.H. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4271-4276Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 48Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1985; 43: 449-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 49Spassky A. Kirkegaard K. Buc H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2723-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CAP-RNA polymerase complex undergoes a parallel temperature-dependent change in association, samples were brought to sedimentation equilibrium at 4 (Fig. 3), 10, 20, and 37 °C. Curve B of Fig. 7 shows representative data obtained at 20 °C. The sample contained a molar excess of RNA polymerase, so the data were initially analyzed according to the two-species model that includes RNA polymerase monomer plus a CAP-polymerase complex. The high quality of the fit indicates that this model is consistent with the data. The inclusion of terms for additional species did not significantly improve the fit (result not shown), supporting the notion that additional species are not present in substantial concentration at 20 °C. This analysis gave a molecular weight for the CAP-polymerase complex of 1,100,000 ± 37,000, compatible with that predicted for a 2:2 complex. Closely similar results were obtained at 10 °C. At 37 °C a qualitatively similar species distribution is found, but ∼30% of the optical density of samples is lost early in the centrifuge run, most likely as a consequence of precipitation 7SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of recovered samples confirm that this apparent precipitation was not accompanied by proteolytic degradation. (results not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the 2:2 CAP:polymerase association pattern is maintained over the range 4 °C ≤ T ≤ 20 °C and that it may extend to somewhat higher temperatures. The results presented above indicate that CAP and RNA polymerase holoenzyme form a 2:2 complex under quasi-physiological conditions of [salt], [cAMP], and temperature. The interaction is robust in that modest changes in these variables do not alter the qualitative pattern of association. The 2:2 complex is the only CAP-polymerase complex detected over a wide range (∼1000-fold) of protein concentrations and does not depend on the input CAP:RNA polymerase ratio. The absence of detectable concentrations of species of lower stoichiometry (e.g. 1:1, 1:2 or 2:1) implies that complex formation is a cooperative reaction. This notion is reinforced by the observation that only 2:2 (and not 1:1) complexes are found under solution conditions (300 mm KCl) in which RNA polymerase is monomeric when sedimented alone. In addition, the absence of higher order complexes, even under conditions of high [protein], suggests that the 2:2 species represents binding saturation. Together, these results place stringent limits on possible mechanisms of association. Both CAP and RNA polymerase have pairs of binding determinants that interact during the formation of transcription-activation complexes at class I and II promoters (see above). These determinants are logical candidates for the sites of protein-protein interaction in the absence of DNA. However, open polymerization reactions, which are theoretically possible on the basis of this polyvalence (Fig. 8A), are not compatible with the absence of 1:1 and 2:1 complexes or the limiting 2:2 stoichiometry that is observed. Alternative models that use pairs of binding surfaces and are compatible with a 2:2 limiting stoichiometry are shown schematically in Fig. 8B. In these models, surfaces on each CAP monomer (possibly activating region 1 or 2 (Refs. 25Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G. Heyduk T. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and 50Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)) interact with complementary surfaces on the α subunit of RNA polymerase. 8These models are offered as a working hypothesis with the acknowledgement that other patterns of interaction, including ones that use the ς subunit CAP determinant and/or monovalent CAP-polymerase interactions, are also compatible with the data. We envision two arrangements, one in which each CAP dimer binds the pair of α subunits on a single polymerase monomer (a cis configuration) and one in which each CAP dimer bridges between α subunits on two polymerase monomers (a “trans ” configuration). We currently favor the trans configuration because cross-bridging between polymerase monomers has the potential to stabilize a polymerase dimer, and dimer stabilization by the first CAP molecule has the potential to account for the cooperative binding of a second CAP molecule. These effects are not available in the cis configuration. Our data allow us to obtain a lower limit estimate of the formation constant for the CAP-polymerase complex,Ka ≥ 2 × 1020m−3. Several attempts to measure the stability of CAP-polymerase complexes predate this report, but all have depended on the assumption of a 1:1 stoichiometry and thus yield estimates of a “monomer-equivalent” association constant (Kapparent,1:1). In 1980, Blazy and co-workers (14Blazy B. Takahashi M. Baudras A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1980; 6: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) used non-equilibrium sucrose-gradient centrifugation to obtain Kapparent,1:1 ∼ 3.3 × 105m−1 in the presence of cAMP. Parallel experiments carried out in the absence of cAMP failed to detect binding, although this may be ascribable to the non-equilibrium nature of their assay. Later, Pinkney and Hoggett (15Pinkney M. Hoggett J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) used fluorescence polarization measurements with fluorescein-labeled CAP to obtain a monomer-equivalent estimate Kapparent,1:1 ∼ 3.3 × 105m−1 in the presence of cAMP. Most recently, Heyduk and colleagues (16Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Ebright Y.W. Blatter E.E. Zhou Y. Ebright R.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 548-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) used the fluorescence polarization of a fluorescein-labeled 42-bp CAP binding site DNA to monitor the formation of a DNA-CAP-RNA polymerase ternary complex, from which they obtained the estimate Kapparent,1:1:1 ∼ 3.5 × 106m−1 in the presence of cAMP. Because of the presence of DNA, it is not clear that the latter interaction follows the same mechanism as the one described here. However, assuming that all studies characterized the same interaction, and assuming equal CAP and RNA polymerase concentrations, the previously reported Kapparent,1:1 values predict formation constants for the 2:2 complex in the range 3.6 × 1016m−3 ≤ Ka ≤ 4.3 × 1019m−3. Given the differences in solution conditions and possible differences in the activities of protein preparations, these values are in reasonable agreement with our lower-limit estimate of the formation constant. The in vitro self-association of RNA polymerase has been studied intermittently since 1966 (26Pilz I. Kratky O. Rabussay D. Eur. J.

A. 1966; 55: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), with later studies gaining impetus from the suggestion (29Travers A.A. Lamond A.I. Mace H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5043-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that dimerization might play a transcription-regulatory role by influencing the distribution of RNA polymerase between competing promoters. Here we have shown that CAP binds preferentially to the dimeric form of polymerase holoenzyme. This implies that CAP stabilizes the polymerase dimer, although this conclusion comes with a caveat, because the sedimentation equilibrium data provide no information about the arrangement of molecules within the CAP-polymerase complex. Thus, we cannot yet say whether the polymerase-interactions that form the dimer in free solution are identical to those present when CAP is bound. Similarly, we are not yet in a position to say whether CAP-polymerase complexes of the kind investigated here form in vivo. Nonetheless, these results open to future investigation the intriguing possibility that CAP might regulate functions of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme that take place prior to promoter binding. We are grateful to Dr. Tomasz Heyduk for providing the RNA polymerase used in these studies."
