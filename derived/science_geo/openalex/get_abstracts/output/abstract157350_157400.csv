https://openalex.org/W1987763890,"The development of optical gain in chemically synthesized semiconductor nanoparticles (nanocrystal quantum dots) has been intensely studied as the first step toward nanocrystal quantum dot lasers. We examined the competing dynamical processes involved in optical amplification and lasing in nanocrystal quantum dots and found that, despite a highly efficient intrinsic nonradiative Auger recombination, large optical gain can be developed at the wavelength of the emitting transition for close-packed solids of these dots. Narrowband stimulated emission with a pronounced gain threshold at wavelengths tunable with the size of the nanocrystal was observed, as expected from quantum confinement effects. These results unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of nanocrystal quantum dot lasers."

In situ hybridization revealed that Pax7 was also expressed in satellite cells residing in adult muscle. Cell culture and electron microscopic analysis revealed a complete absence of satellite cells in Pax7−/− skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that the proportion of muscle-derived stem cells was unaffected. Importantly, stem cells from Pax7−/− muscle displayed almost a 10-fold increase in their ability to form hematopoietic colonies. These results demonstrate that satellite cells and muscle-derived stem cells represent distinct cell populations. Together these studies suggest that induction of Pax7 in muscle-derived stem cells induces satellite cell specification by restricting alternate developmental programs."
https://openalex.org/W2051040521,"Mice lacking the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR/BAR developed normally and were outwardly identical to wild-type littermates. FXR/BAR null mice were distinguished from wild-type mice by elevated serum bile acid, cholesterol, and triglycerides, increased hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides, and a proatherogenic serum lipoprotein profile. FXR/BAR null mice also had reduced bile acid pools and reduced fecal bile acid excretion due to decreased expression of the major hepatic canalicular bile acid transport protein. Bile acid repression and induction of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and the ileal bile acid binding protein, respectively, did not occur in FXR/BAR null mice, establishing the regulatory role of FXR/BAR for the expression of these genes in vivo. These data demonstrate that FXR/BAR is critical for bile acid and lipid homeostasis by virtue of its role as an intracellular bile acid sensor."
https://openalex.org/W1995741673,"Through direct cloning of p53 binding sequences from human genomic DNA, we have isolated a novel gene, designated p53AIP1 (p53-regulated Apoptosis-Inducing Protein 1), whose expression is inducible by wild-type p53. Ectopically expressed p53AIP1, which is localized within mitochondria, leads to apoptotic cell death through dissipation of mitochondrial A(psi)m. We have found that upon severe DNA damage, Ser-46 on p53 is phosphorylated and apoptosis is induced. In addition, substitution of Ser-46 inhibits the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis and selectively blocks expression of p53AIP1. Our results suggest that p53AIP1 is likely to play an important role in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, and phosphorylation of Ser-46 regulates the transcriptional activation of this apoptosis-inducing gene."
https://openalex.org/W2066672169,"Vernalization, the acceleration of flowering by a long period of cold temperature, ensures that many plants overwinter vegetatively and flower in spring. In Arabidopsis, allelic variation at the FRIGIDA (FRI) locus is a major determinant of natural variation in flowering time. Dominant alleles of FRI confer late flowering, which is reversed to earliness by vernalization. We cloned FRI and analyzed the molecular basis of the allelic variation. Most of the early-flowering ecotypes analyzed carry FRI alleles containing one of two different deletions that disrupt the open reading frame. Loss-of-function mutations at FRI have thus provided the basis for the evolution of many early-flowering ecotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1600103888,"Stromal cells are thought to generate specific regulatory microenviroments or “niches” that control stem cell behavior. Characterizing stem cell niches in vivo remains an important goal that has been difficult to achieve. The individual ovarioles of the Drosophila ovary each contain about two germ line stem cells that maintain oocyte production. Here we show that anterior ovariolar somatic cells comprising three cell types act as a germ line stem cell niche. Germ line stem cells lost by normal or induced differentiation are efficiently replaced, and the ability to repopulate the niche increases the functional lifetime of ovarioles in vivo. Our studies implicate one of the somatic cell types, the cap cells, as a key niche component."
https://openalex.org/W1984387240,"Signaling proteins are thought to be tightly regulated spatially and temporally in order to generate specific and localized effects. For Rac and other small guanosine triphosphatases, binding to guanosine triphosphate leads to interaction with downstream targets and regulates subcellular localization. A method called FLAIR (fluorescence activation indicator for Rho proteins) was developed to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Rac1 nucleotide state in living cells. FLAIR revealed precise spatial control of growth factor–induced Rac activation, in membrane ruffles and in a gradient of activation at the leading edge of motile cells. FLAIR exemplifies a generally applicable approach for examining spatio-temporal control of protein activity."
https://openalex.org/W2050515087,"Many bacterial pathogens encode a multisubunit toxin, termed cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), that induces cell cycle arrest, cytoplasm distention, and, eventually, chromatin fragmentation and cell death. In one such pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni, one of the subunits of this toxin, CdtB, was shown to exhibit features of type I deoxyribonucleases. Transient expression of this subunit in cultured cells caused marked chromatin disruption. Microinjection of low amounts of CdtB induced cytoplasmic distention and cell cycle arrest. CdtB mutants with substitutions in residues equivalent to those required for catalysis or magnesium binding in type I deoxyribonucleases did not cause chromatin disruption. CDT holotoxin containing these mutant forms of CdtB did not induce morphological changes or cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2136879986,"Transcriptional repression plays crucial roles in diverse aspects of metazoan development, implying critical regulatory roles for corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT. Altered patterns of transcription in tissues and cells derived from N-CoR gene-deleted mice and the resulting block at specific points in CNS, erythrocyte, and thymocyte development indicated that N-CoR was a required component of short-term active repression by nuclear receptors and MAD and of a subset of long-term repression events mediated by REST/NRSF. Unexpectedly, N-CoR and a specific deacetylase were also required for transcriptional activation of one class of retinoic acid response element. Together, these findings suggest that specific combinations of corepressors and histone deacetylases mediate the gene-specific actions of DNA-bound repressors in development of multiple organ systems."
https://openalex.org/W2075787930,"Asymmetric localization of proteins plays a key role in many cellular processes, including cell polarity and cell fate determination. Using DNA microarray analysis, we identified a plasma membrane protein-encoding mRNA (IST2) that is transported to the bud tip by an actomyosin-based process. mRNA localization created a higher concentration of IST2 protein in the bud compared with that of the mother cell, and this asymmetry was maintained by a septin-mediated membrane diffusion barrier at the mother-bud neck. These results indicate that yeast creates distinct plasma membrane compartments, as has been described in neurons and epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005741947,"The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity against microbial infection by transporting polymeric immunoglobulins (pIg) across the mucosal epithelium. We report here that the human pIgR (hpIgR) can bind to a major pneumococcal adhesin, CbpA. Expression of hpIgR in human nasopharyngeal cells and MDCK cells greatly enhanced pneumococcal adherence and invasion. The hpIgR-mediated bacterial adherence and invasion were abolished by either insertional knockout of cbpA or antibodies against either hpIgR or CbpA. In contrast, rabbit pIgR (rpIgR) did not bind to CbpA and its expression in MDCK cells did not enhance pneumococcal adherence and invasion. These results suggest that pneumococci are a novel example of a pathogen co-opting the pIg transcytosis machinery to promote translocation across a mucosal barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2090850551,"We have identified a nuclear pathway that rapidly degrades unspliced pre-mRNAs in yeast. This involves 3'-->5' degradation by the exosome complex and 5'-->3' degradation by the exonuclease Rat1p. 3'-->5' degradation is normally the major pathway and is regulated in response to carbon source. Inhibition of pre-mRNA degradation resulted in increased levels of pre-mRNAs and spliced mRNAs. When splicing was inhibited by mutation of a splicing factor, inhibition of turnover resulted in 20- to 50-fold accumulation of pre-mRNAs, accompanied by increased mRNA production. Splicing of a reporter construct with a 3' splice site mutation was also increased on inhibition of turnover, showing competition between degradation and splicing. We propose that nuclear pre-mRNA turnover represents a novel step in the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2104787166,"The preatmospheric mass of the Tagish Lake meteoroid was about 200,000 kilograms. Its calculated orbit indicates affinity to the Apollo asteroids with a semimajor axis in the middle of the asteroid belt, consistent with a linkage to low-albedo C, D, and P type asteroids. The mineralogy, oxygen isotope, and bulk chemical composition of recovered samples of the Tagish Lake meteorite are intermediate between CM and CI meteorites. These data suggest that the Tagish Lake meteorite may be one of the most primitive solar system materials yet studied."
https://openalex.org/W2171546216,"Phosphoproteins of the stathmin family interact with the αβ tubulin heterodimer (tubulin) and hence interfere with microtubule dynamics. The structure of the complex of GDP-tubulin with the stathmin-like domain of the neural protein RB3 reveals a head-to-tail assembly of two tubulins with a 91-residue RB3 α helix in which each copy of an internal duplicated sequence interacts with a different tubulin. As a result of the relative orientations adopted by tubulins and by their α and β subunits, the tubulin:RB3 complex forms a curved structure. The RB3 helix thus most likely prevents incorporation of tubulin into microtubules by holding it in an assembly with a curvature very similar to that of the depolymerization products of microtubules."

https://openalex.org/W2080419891,"In mammalian cells, double-strand breaks in DNA can be repaired by n on h omologous e nd -j oinin g (NHEJ), a process dependent upon Ku70/80, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV. Starting with HeLa cell-free extracts, which promote NHEJ in a reaction dependent upon all of these proteins, we have purified a novel factor that stimulates DNA end-joining in vitro. Using a combination of phosphorus NMR, mass spectroscopy, and strong anion exchange chromatography, we identify this factor as inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Purified IP6 is bound by DNA-PK and specifically stimulates DNA-PK-dependent end-joining in vitro. The involvement of inositol phosphate in DNA-PK-dependent NHEJ is of particular interest since the catalytic domain of DNA-PKcs is similar to that found in the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3)-kinase family."
https://openalex.org/W2030608150,"Whether embryonic and adult blood derive from a single (yolk sac) or dual (yolk sac plus intraembryonic) origin is controversial. Here, we show, in Xenopus, that the yolk sac (VBI) and intraembryonic (DLP) blood compartments derive from distinct blastomeres in the 32-cell embryo. The first adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to form in association with the floor of the dorsal aorta, and we have detected such aortic clusters in Xenopus using hematopoietic markers. Lineage tracing shows that the aortic clusters derive from the blastomere that gives rise to the DLP. These observations indicate that the first adult HSCs arise independently of the embryonic lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1983473532,A nuclear isoform of myosin I beta that contains a unique 16-amino acid amino-terminal extension has been identified. An affinity-purified antibody to the 16-amino acid peptide demonstrated nuclear staining. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that nuclear myosin I beta colocalized with RNA polymerase II in an alpha-amanitin- and actinomycin D-sensitive manner. The antibody coimmunoprecipitated RNA polymerase II and blocked in vitro RNA synthesis. This isoform of myosin I beta appears to be in a complex with RNA polymerase II and may affect transcription.
https://openalex.org/W2007969738,"Accurate chromatid separation is monitored by a checkpoint mechanism that delays anaphase onset until all centromeres are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. Using Xenopus egg extracts, the kinetochore-associated microtubule motor protein CENP-E is now found to be required for establishing and maintaining this checkpoint. When CENP-E function is disrupted by immunodepletion or antibody addition, extracts fail to arrest in response to spindle damage. Mitotic arrest can be restored by addition of high levels of soluble MAD2, demonstrating that the absence of CENP-E eliminates kinetochore-dependent signaling but not the downstream steps in checkpoint signal transduction. Because it directly binds both to spindle microtubules and to the kinetochore-associated checkpoint kinase BUBR1, CENP-E is a central component in the vertebrate checkpoint that modulates signaling activity in a microtubule-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2014356708,"Like other types of pre-malignant lesions and carcinoma, angiogenesis is associated with high-grade cervical dysplasia and with invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is known to be one of the most important inducers of angiogenesis and is upregulated in carcinoma of the cervix. Human Papilloma Virus 16 (HPV-16) has been etiologically linked to human cervical cancer, and the major oncogenic proteins encoded by the viral genome, E6 and E7, are involved in the immortalization of target cells. Because several oncogenes including mutant ras, EGF receptor, ErbB2/Her2, c-myc and v-src upregulate VEGF expression, we asked whether HVP-16 E6 oncoprotein could act in a similar fashion. We found that HPV-16 E6-positive cells generally express high levels of VEGF message. Furthermore, co-expression of the VEGF promoter-Luc (luciferase) reporter gene with E6 in both human keratinocytes and mouse fibroblast showed that E6 oncoprotein upregulates VEGF promoter activity, and does so in a p53 independent manner. An E6 responsive region which comprises four Sp-1 sites, between −194 and −50 bp of the VEGF promoter, is also necessary for constitutive VEGF transcription. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that the HPV oncoprotein E6 may contribute to tumor angiogenesis by direct stimulation of the VEGF gene."
https://openalex.org/W2079320605,"Polyhedral nano- and microstructures with shapes of faceted needles, rods, rings, barrels, and double-tipped pyramids, which we call graphite polyhedral crystals (GPCs), have been discovered. They were found in pores of glassy carbon. They have nanotube cores and graphite faces, and they can exhibit unusual sevenfold, ninefold, or more complex axial symmetry. Although some are giant radially extended nanotubes, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy suggest GPCs have a degree of perfection higher than in multiwall nanotubes of similar size. The crystals are up to 1 micrometer in cross section and 5 micrometers in length, and they can probably be grown in much larger sizes. Preliminary results suggest a high electrical conductivity, strength, and chemical stability of GPC."
https://openalex.org/W2048041327,"Low oxygen and nutrient depletion play critical roles in tumorigenesis, but little is known about how they interact to produce tumor survival and tumor malignancy. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying hypoxia-modulated apoptosis of serum-deprived HepG2 cells. Our results showed that hypoxia blocked the apoptosis, which was accompanied with decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, inhibited cytochrome c release, and reduced caspase-3 activity. More importantly, increased expressions of VEGF and its receptor-2 (KDR) under hypoxic/serum-deprived condition suggest that VEGF may act as a survival factor in a self-promoting manner. Data were further supported by results that recombinant human VEGF (rhVEGF) suppressed the serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, and anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody block anti-apoptotic activity of hypoxia. In addition, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase blocked antiapoptosis of hypoxia. Our study further showed that rhVEGF or hypoxia induced ERK phosphorylation in serum-deprived cells, and that a specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK, PD98059 eliminated the anti-apoptotic activity of rhVEGF or hypoxia by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity. Our data led us to conclude that induction of ERK phosphorylation and decrease of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio by rhVEGF implies that hypoxia-induced VEGF prevents apoptosis of serum-deprived cells by activating the MAPK/ERK pathway. Taken together, we propose that hypoxia enhances survival of nutrient-depleted tumor cells by reducing susceptibility to apoptosis, which consequently leads to tumor malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2024784673,"Warming at the last glacial termination in the North Atlantic region was interrupted by a period of renewed glacial activity during the Younger Dryas chronozone (YDC). The underlying mechanism of this cooling remains elusive, but hypotheses turn on whether it was a global or a North Atlantic phenomenon. Chronological, sedimentological, and palaeoecological records from sediments of small lakes in oceanic southern Chile demonstrate that there was no YDC cooling in southern Chile. It is therefore likely that there was little or no cooling in southern Pacific surface waters and hence that YDC cooling in the North Atlantic was a regional, rather than global, phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1999225281,"We have investigated the functional impact of a naturally occurring mutation of the human glutamate transporter GLT1 (EAAT2), which had been detected in a patient with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The mutation involves a substitution of the putative N-linked glycosylation site asparagine 206 by a serine residue (N206S) and results in reduced glycosylation of the transporter and decreased uptake activity. Electrophysiological analysis of N206S revealed a pronounced reduction in transport rate compared with wild-type, but there was no alteration in the apparent affinities for glutamate and sodium. In addition, no change in the sensitivity for the specific transport inhibitor dihydrokainate was observed. However, the decreased rate of transport was associated with a reduction of the N206S transporter in the plasma membrane. Under ionic conditions, which favor the reverse operation mode of the transporter, N206S exhibited an increased reverse transport capacity. Furthermore, if coexpressed in the same cell, N206S manifested a dominant negative effect on the wild-type GLT1 activity, whereas it did not affect wild-type EAAC1. These findings provide evidence for a role of the N-linked glycosylation in both cellular trafficking and transport function. The resulting alteration in glutamate clearance capacity likely contributes to excitotoxicity that participates in motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2021924340,The developmental program of cell-type switching of S. pombe requires a strand-specific imprinting event at the mating-type locus (mat1). Imprinting occurs only when mat1 is replicated in a specific direction and requires several trans-acting factors. This work shows (1) that the factors swi1p and swi3p act by pausing the replication fork at the imprinting site; and (2) that swi1p and swi3p are involved in termination at the mat1-proximal polar-terminator of replication (RTS1). A genetic screen to identify termination factors identified an allele that separated pausing/imprinting and termination functions of swip. These results suggest that swi1p and swi3p promote imprinting in novel ways both by pausing replication at mat1 and by terminating replication at RTS1.

We report the cloning, recombinant expression, and kinetic properties of a novel human sPLA2 that defines a new structural class of sPLA2s called group XII. The human group XII (hGXII) cDNA contains a putative signal peptide of 22 residues followed by a mature protein of 167 amino acids that displays homology to all known sPLA2s only over a short stretch of amino acids in the active site region. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses show that the tissue distribution of hGXII is distinct from the other human sPLA2s with strong expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas and weaker expression in brain, liver, small intestine, lung, placenta, ovaries, testis, and prostate. Catalytically active hGXII was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to be Ca2+-dependent despite the fact that it is predicted to have an unusual Ca2+-binding loop. Similar to the previously characterized mouse group IIE sPLA2s, the specific activity of hGXII is low in comparison to that of other mammalian sPLA2, suggesting that hGXII could have novel functions that are independent of its phospholipase A2activity.

Very recently, the cell surface proteoglycan glypican was also identified as a sPLA2-binding protein able to facilitate arachidonic acid release by GIIA and GV sPLA2s in fibroblastic cells (26Murakami M.

Because of the presence of a large collection of sPLA2s in both mammals and many reptile and invertebrate venoms, we have been searching nucleic acid databases for the presence of novel mammalian sPLA2s with homology to all known types of these enzymes, including structurally distinct ones like the group IX sPLA2 (Conodipine-M) from the venom of the cone snailConus magus (27McIntosh J.M.

In this work, we report the cloning, recombinant expression, tissue distribution, and enzymatic properties of a novel human sPLA2. Because this sPLA2clearly belongs to a new structural class, we propose to name it human group XII sPLA2 (hGXII) to follow the recently identified group XI plant sPLA2s (21Valentin, E., and Lambeau, G.

None of the ESTs were found to contain the full-length cDNA coding for the new sPLA2 candidate, but a putative complete open reading frame could be constructed from the alignment of the different ESTs and the appropriately spliced genomic sequence. A forward primer (5′-TTTGCGGCCGCATATGGAGCTGGCTGCTGCCAAGT) and a reverse primer (5′-TTTAAGCTTCTAGAATCTGTCACTAGCTGTCGGCATC) flanking the above open reading frame and containing appropriate restriction sites were used to amplify by RT-PCR the cDNA fragment coding for hGXII sPLA2. The expected 717-nucleotide hGXII cDNA fragment could be amplified from human fetal lung, pancreas, and testis cDNAs (CLONTECH) using a Taq Pwopolymerase mixture (Hybaid, United Kingdom). The PCR fragments were digested with NotI and XbaI, ligated into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMVneo (Invitrogen), and sequenced in its entirety. Several clones were found to be identical to the consensus sequence described above. The pRc/CMVneo-hGXII construct was used as template in a PCR reaction with a forward primer (5′-TTTGGATCCATCGAAGGTCGTCAGGAGCAGGCCCAGACCGAC), which contains aBamHI site and a factor Xa protease site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) adjacent to the predicted N-terminal Gln residue of mature hGXII sPLA2 (see Fig. 1) and the reverse primer given above. The purified PCR product was digested with BamHI andHindIII and was subcloned in frame with the truncated glutathione S-transferase (∼10 kDa) encoded by the modified pGEX-2T vector (pAB3), which had been previously used to express several sPLA2s in Escherichia coli (17Valentin E.

Protein production in E. coli BL21, purification of inclusion bodies, and refolding and cleavage of the fusion protein with factor Xa were carried out as described previously (17Valentin E.

Cleaved hGXII was purified by HPLC on a Spherogel TSK SP-5PW column (10 μm, 0.75 × 7.5 cm, Altex) using a gradient of 1% acetic acid to 1 m ammonium acetate over 50 min (elution at 28 min) and was further purified on a reverse phase column (Waters RP8 Symmetry Shield, 5 μm, 100 Å, 0.46 × 25 cm) using a gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 50 min (elution at 36 min). The hGXII preparation appeared 100% pure when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems DE-Pro) was carried out in the linear mode using sinapinic acid. The presence of mRNA for hGXII sPLA2 in different human tissues was explored by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. A human Northern blot (CLONTECH catalog no. 7780-1) was probed as described previously (18Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled riboprobe corresponding to the hGXII coding sequence. For RT-PCR, reactions were performed with an internal forward primer (5′-GCCTTTCCCACGTTATGGTT) and the reverse primer described above (200 ng each), Taq polymerase, and 1 μl of human cDNA as template (Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels I and II,CLONTECH catalog nos. K1420-1 and K1421-1). PCR was carried out at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 60 °C/30 s, and 72 °C/1 min, which was followed by 72 °C for 5 min. PCR reactions were analyzed by Southern blotting using a32P-labeled hGXII oligonucleotide probe (5′-GGATGTGGCTCTCCACTGTT). Large unilamellar vesicles (0.1 μm) of POPC, POPG, and POPS (31Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were used to measure the initial rates of hydrolysis by hGXII in Hank's balanced salt solution with 1.2 mm CaCl2 and 0.9 mmMgCl2 using the fatty acid-binding protein assay (17Valentin E.

The pH-rate profile and Ca2+ dependence for the action of hGXII on POPG and POPC vesicles, respectively, were obtained as described previously (17Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G.

Screening of nucleic acid databases with all known types of mammalian and venom sPLA2s (groups I, II, III, V, IX, and X) led us to identify various human ESTs and a large human BAC clone of 161,326 nucleotides coding for a putative novel sPLA2 (hGXII) that displays homology with other sPLA2s only in the active site region. A cDNA sequence containing a possible complete open reading frame was deduced from the alignment of the various ESTs and the genomic sequence and was then used to design primers for RT-PCR experiments with cDNA from various human tissues. The expected 717-nucleotide cDNA fragment containing an open reading frame of 567 nucleotides was amplified at a high level from human fetal lung cDNA and at lower levels from pancreas and testis cDNAs (not shown). The open reading frame was found to display some of the expected features for a sPLA2(Fig. 1 A). The initiator methionine is followed by a 22-amino acid sequence presenting the features of a signal peptide (32Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) and a mature protein sequence of 167 residues. The calculated molecular mass and pI values for the mature protein are 18,702.1 Da and 6.26, respectively, and no consensus site for N-glycosylation was found. Like several other sPLA2s, the mature hGXII sequence contains 14 cysteines and a central catalytic domain with a HD catalytic diad (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the 717-nucleotide cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence indicates that the hGXIIsPLA2 gene is composed of at least 4 exons and 3 introns spanning about 15 kilobases in length. The human BAC clone containing the hGXII gene was also found to contain different sequence-tagged sites positioned at the 4q25 locus, thus assigning thehGXII gene to this location on chromosome 4. Further screening of the EST databases with the hGXII cDNA sequence led to the identification of several other ESTs partially coding for mouse (GenBank™/EBI AA020156 and AA204520), rat (GenBank™/EBI AW918074), and bovine (GenBank™ /EBI AW353546) GXII sPLA2s (Fig. 1 A). A full-length amino acid sequence coding forXenopus laevis GXII sPLA2 was deduced from the alignment of two ESTs (GenBank™/EBI AW641606 and AW639634). Interestingly, the level of identity of this novel GXII sPLA2 among species is very high (Fig. 1 A) as compared with those of other sPLA2s (18Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Valentin, E., and Lambeau, G. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). A BLASTp search with the amino acid sequence of hGXII sPLA2against the protein databases stored at the National Center for Biotechnology reveals matches to a variety of sPLA2s from mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, and animal venoms, suggesting that this protein belongs to the sPLA2 family. The homology however appears to be weak (<35% identity with BLAST scores lower than 35) and restricted to a short stretch of less than 60 amino acid residues containing the active site domain and the HD catalytic diad. This indicates that the hGXII sPLA2 is unique among all known sPLA2s (Fig. 1 B). The histidine of HD is thought to function as a general base to deprotonate a water molecule as it attacks the substrate ester carbonyl carbon, and the β-carboxyl group of the adjacent aspartate coordinates directly to the catalytic Ca2+ cofactor (6Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. De Haas G.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 91: 91-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 33Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Except for 3 cysteines in the active site consensus sequence CCXXHDXC, which match those of other groups of sPLA2s, the location of the other 11 cysteines residues in hGXII is distinct from that of other sPLA2s (Fig. 1 B). Because the structural arrangement of disulfides has been the main basis for designating the different sPLA2group numbers, the naming of the new sPLA2 as hGXII seems appropriate. The homology between hGXII and all known sPLA2s is so low that it is difficult to find the Ca2+-binding loop, which is usually highly conserved and provides three of the four amino acid ligands for the catalytic Ca2+ (34Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 53-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All mammalian group I, II, V, and X sPLA2s contain 19 amino acid residues between the most N-terminal residue that serves as a ligand to the active site Ca2+ (i.e. His-27 of hGIIA) and the catalytic histidine (i.e. His-47 of hGIIA). In contrast, the corresponding distances for hGIII and plant GXI sPLA2s are 25 and 23 residues, respectively. hGXII contains a potential Ca2+-binding segment GCGSP with 23 residues between the N-terminal glycine and the putative catalytic histidine as shown in Fig. 1. This segment is perfectly conserved among all of the GXII proteins found in genomic databases. The x-ray structures of groups I, II, and III sPLA2s reveal that the Ca2+ loop contains the consensus segmentX-Cys-Gly-X-Gly with the amino acids designated asX1CG1 X2G2, respectively. The backbone carbonyl oxygens of residuesX1, G1, and G2coordinate to Ca2+, and the backbone NH of G1is proposed to donate a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of the enzyme-susceptible substrate ester (33Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 35Bekkers A.C. Franken P.A. Toxopeus E. Verheij H.M. de Haas G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The fact that this residue is glycine in catalytically active sPLA2s and that mutating this residue to serine lowers catalytic activity by about 10- to 20-fold (35Bekkers A.C. Franken P.A. Toxopeus E. Verheij H.M. de Haas G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) argues that steric bulk is poorly tolerated at this position. The putative Ca2+-coordinating segment of hGXII shown in Fig. 1 B fits the consensus sequence of other sPLA2s with the exception that G2 is a proline in hGXII. The prediction based on examination of the x-ray structures of sPLA2s is that the hGXII Ca2+-binding segment should be functional. It contains G1, and the backbone carbonyl of the C-terminal proline can coordinate to Ca2+ because its three extra methylenes, compared with glycine, are sterically allowed because of the location of this residue on the enzyme surface away from the substrate-binding cavity. Interestingly, sPLA2 isozymes with relatively low sPLA2 activity from the venom of the banded krait also contain proline in place of G2 (36Liu C.-S. Chen J.-M. Chang C.-H. Chen S.-W. Tsai I.-H. Lu H.-S. Lo T.-B. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 1457-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of hGXII was first analyzed by hybridization at high stringency to a human Northern blot (Fig. 2). hGXII is expressed as several transcripts including a major one of ∼1.4 kilobase, which is abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. hGXII transcripts are also present at lower levels in brain, liver, small intestine, lung, and placenta, and expressed poorly, if at all, in colon, thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Furthermore, analysis by RT-PCR with commercial human tissue cDNA panels indicates a pattern of hGXII expression that is consistent with the Northern blot data and additionally shows that this sPLA2 is strongly expressed in pancreas and weakly in ovaries, testis, and prostate (not shown). The pattern of expression of hGXII thus appears distinct from that of other known human sPLA2s (16Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

A mammalian expression vector containing the full-length hGXII cDNA was first used to transiently transfect HEK293 cells. The amount of sPLA2 activity (as measured with an assay using radiolabeled E. coli membranes, Ref. 16Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) secreted into the culture medium 1–5 days after transfection was barely above that measured in medium from cells transfected with vector lacking the hGXII insert, suggesting that hGXII may have a low specific activity. To further analyze if hGXII is a catalytically active sPLA2, we expressed hGXII as a fusion protein in E. coli, and the inclusion body fraction was submitted to a refolding strategy previously used to produce catalytically active mGIID sPLA2(17Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19152-19160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After digesting the fusion protein with factor Xa protease, hGXII was purified to homogeneity by HPLC and was found to migrate as a pure protein of about 18 kDa on a Laemmli SDS gel (not shown). Mass spectrometry analysis gave an experimental mass of 18,702.6 ± 0.5 Da, which agrees well with the mass of 18,702.1 Da calculated from the sequence of mature hGXII shown in Fig. 1 A. This result indicates that all 14 cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds, and thus it is assumed that recombinant hGXII is properly folded. Recombinant hGXII was found to be a catalytically active sPLA2 when assayed with the radiolabeled E. colimembrane assay (16Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and with POPG, POPS, and POPC vesicles using the fatty acid-binding protein assay (17Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19152-19160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, sPLA2 activity toward POPC vesicles was strictly Ca2+-dependent (Kcalcium= 30 ± 10 μm). hGXII activity is maximal near pH 8.0 and decreases at higher and lower pH values (Fig. 3 B). The decrease as the pH is lowered presumably reflects, in part, the protonation of the active site histidine. As for all mammalian sPLA2s examined so far, the enzymatic activity of hGXII on phosphatidylglycerol vesicles is highest (Fig. 3 C), which probably reflects the tighter binding of hGXII to anionic vesicles (37Jain M.K. Ranadive G., Yu, B.-Z. Verheij H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7330-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although hGXII hydrolyzes POPC at only ∼7% of the rate of POPG, this difference is small compared with the >105-fold preference of hGIIA for POPG versus POPC (18Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). POPS is also a good substrate for hGXII (Fig. 3 C). In summary, we cloned a novel catalytically active human sPLA2, hGXII, which belongs to a new structural class with homologs in other mammalian species and inXenopus laevis. Because hGXII is expressed in a limited number of human tissues and has an expression pattern distinct from those of other human sPLA2s, it is not expected to carry out “housekeeping” functions in cells, but rather to have physiological function(s) distinct from those of other human sPLA2s. A sPLA2 gene cluster for the structurally similar hGIIA, hGIIC, hGIID, hGIIE, hGIIF, and hGV sPLA2s is present on human chromosome 1,3whereas structurally more distant hGIB, hGX, and hGIII sPLA2s lie on different chromosomes (chromosomes 12, 16, and 22, respectively), as is also shown in this study for hGXII sPLA2 (chromosome 4). Recombinant expression of hGXII shows that it is a catalytically active, Ca2+-dependent sPLA2. However, the specific enzymatic activity of hGXII appears very low compared with those of other mammalian sPLA2s (for example hGIB, hGIIA, hGV, and hGX) and is comparable with the low specific activity reported for mGIIE sPLA2 (18Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This may be the reason why hGXII sPLA2 was not detected in earlier biochemical studies despite the fact that this protein may be expressed at significant levels and the transcripts coding for this later are present in fairly high amounts in several human tissues (Fig. 2). It is also interesting to note that the putative GXII sPLA2 from zebrafish (Danio rerio) is represented in genomic databases by several ESTs that all contain a leucine in place of histidine in the catalytic HD segment. This type of mutation suggests that the zebrafish GXII sPLA2 has very little or no catalytic activity, probably lower than that of hGXII sPLA2. This in turn suggests that the catalytic activity of group XII sPLA2s may not be critical for their physiological function. Rather, they may act by serving as ligands for sPLA2-binding proteins instead of acting as lipolytic enzymes (13Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).

Overexpression in RPMI-SE cells of either a kinase-negative form of MEK1 or wild-type MAP kinase phosphatase-3 also induced up-regulation of p27Kip1. The up-regulation of p27Kip1 correlated with increased association of p27Kip1 with cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 complexes, a concomitant inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity, and a consequent decrease in the phosphorylation state of retinoblastoma protein, which would culminate in the marked G1 cell cycle arrest observed in these tumor cells.

Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Activation of the ERK pathway involves the activation of Ras at the plasma membrane, and the sequential activation of a series of protein kinases. Initially, Ras interacts with and activates Raf-1, which in turn activates MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-1 and -2 by serine phosphorylation. MEK-1/2 then catalyze the phosphorylation of 41- and 43-kDa MAP kinases (ERK2 and ERK1, respectively) on tyrosine and threonine residues, and these activated MAP kinases can phosphorylate cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. The ERK pathway participates in a wide range of cellular programs including proliferation, differentiation, and movement (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

Activation of the ERKs is also associated with prostate cancer progression (9Gioeli D. Mandell J.W. Petroni G.R. Frierson Jr., H.F. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). The precise cause of constitutive activation of the ERK pathway in many of these tumor cells remains unclear. However, such high frequencies of ERK/MEK activation in human tumors indicate that specific inhibitors might be developed against these protein kinases for cancer therapy, especially for treatment of tumors showing constitutive activation of the ERK pathway. In the present study, we have examined the effect of blockade of the ERK pathway on the proliferation of human tumor cells. We utilized small molecule inhibitors of this pathway, PD98059 (10Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our results demonstrate that these MEK inhibitors induce a remarkable G1 cell cycle arrest, followed by a modest apoptotic response, in tumor cells in which the ERK pathway is constitutively activated.

For monolayer growth, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells per 35-mm dish and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then mock-treated or treated with 50 μm PD98059 or 20 μmU0126 for up to 5 days. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and viable cells which excluded trypan blue were counted using a hemocytometer. For anchorage-independent growth, 1 × 104 cells were suspended in 3 ml of 0.33% Difco agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 50 μm PD98059, overlaid on a 5-ml layer of 0.5% agar in the respective medium in a 60-mm dish, and cultured for 14 days.

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp), and probed with the appropriate primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.

Briefly, cell lysates prepared as described above (10 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated by incubating for 3 h at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-ERK antibody preadsorbed to protein-A Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing twice with kinase buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEGTA, and 10% glycerol), each immunoprecipitate was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 7.5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) in 30 μl of kinase buffer A. Radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A (DNase-free; Sigma), and stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (16Darzynkiewicz Z. Gong J. Traganos F. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At least 1 × 104 cells from each sample were analyzed for DNA content using a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics). Percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases were determined using Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with 50 μm PD98059 for 96 h. After fixing with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, apoptotic cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining (0.4 mg/ml, 30 min). Cells were lysed in TET lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were treated with 100 μg/ml of RNase A for 60 min. DNA was extracted and resolved by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels as described (17Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. J.

Cells were lysed in IP cell lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 60 min. Cell lysates (400 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 μg of anti-CDK2 antibody (SC-163, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 3 μg of anti-cyclin E antibody (14761A, PharMingen) for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed twice with kinase buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer B supplemented with 2 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 25 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the extent of histone H1 phosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The expression vector for MKP-3 (pMT-SM-Myc-MKP-3) (19Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Transfection of these plasmids (1 μg) into RPMI-SE cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well of 24-well plate) was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty hours after transfection, cells were immunostained as described (20Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (SC-789, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-p27Kip1 antibody (K25020, Transduction Laboratories), or monoclonal anti-phospho-ERKs antibody (M8159, Sigma) as the primary antibody, and AlexaTM 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (A-11034, Molecular Probes) or AlexaTM 546 goat anti-mouse conjugate (A-11030, Molecular Probes) as the secondary antibody. For BrdUrd incorporation assay, 20 μm BrdUrd was added to the culture 30 h after transfection, and then cells were incubated for 24 h. To detect BrdUrd-positive cells, cells were fixed, treated with 2.5n HCl to denature DNA, and then immunostained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (BU5.1, Progen Biotechnik). We have recently proposed that human tumor cells can be classified into four groups with regard to the activation of the ERK pathway (7Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Tumor cells in which constitutive activation of the ERK pathway is detected are classified as type III or type II; type III tumor cells are those in which the degree of activation of the ERK pathway is especially high. Tumor cells in which constitutive activation of the ERK pathway is not detected are classified as type I or type 0. Type I tumor cells are those in which the ERK pathway is markedly activated when serum-starved cells are growth-stimulated with 10% serum; this response is identical to that observed in normal diploid fibroblasts. Type 0 tumor cells are abnormal with respect to activation of the ERK pathway, i.e. significant activation of the pathway is undetectable even when serum-starved cells are growth-stimulated with 10% serum. We first examined the inhibitory effect of two MEK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, on the activation of ERKs in exponentially growing tumor cells. Activation of ERKs was determined by two different assay procedures as follows: by performing a direct in vitrokinase assay of the immunoprecipitates using myelin basic protein as the substrate, and by measuring the appearance of the phosphorylated/activated forms of ERKs, which show reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE. As described previously (7Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), type III (RPMI-SE and HT1080) and type II (A-172) tumor cells exhibited a significantly high degree of ERK activation under exponentially growing conditions. Treatment of these tumor cells with U0126 or PD98059 suppressed the activation of ERKs in a dose-dependent manner; U0126 inhibited ERK activation more efficiently than PD98059, with virtually complete suppression being observed at 20 or 50 μm, respectively. Although only a limited degree of ERK activation was detected in exponentially growing type I (TGW) and type 0 (Colo320 and GOTO) tumor cells, treatment with PD98059 or U0126 also reduced the degree of ERK activation in these cells. Fig.1 C shows the PD98059/U0126-mediated inhibition of ERK activation in RPMI-SE and Colo320 cells. Treatment with PD98059 or U0126 inhibited the growth of all of the tumor cells examined (Fig. 1 A). These results seemed reasonable, because the ERK pathway is the major cytoplasmic kinase pathway and is activated commonly by numerous mitogenic stimuli that interact with a diversity of structurally distinct receptors. In addition, activation of the ERK pathway has been shown to be necessary for fibroblast proliferation (5Mansour S.J. Mattern W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 21Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). However, susceptibility to these MEK inhibitors showed distinct differences among cell types. The growth of tumor cells in which the ERK pathway was constitutively activated was totally abolished (type III tumor cells) or almost completely inhibited (type II tumor cells) by 50 μmPD98059 or 20 μm U0126. PD98059/U0126 inhibited the growth of TGW type I tumor cells and TIG-3 diploid fibroblasts (data not shown) to a similar extent; the inhibition was considerable but not complete. Although proliferation of type 0 tumor cells appeared not to depend on the activation of the ERK pathway, PD98059/U0126 slightly inhibited the growth of these cells. Basal ERK activity (Fig. 1 C) may be partially responsible for the proliferation of type 0 tumor cells; inhibition of the basal ERK activity by PD98059/U0126 treatment might have resulted in the slight growth inhibition observed in these cells. Consistent with its antiproliferative effect on monolayer growth, PD98059 completely inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of RPMI-SE type III tumor cells but did not significantly affect Colo320 type 0 tumor cells (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effect of MEK inhibitors, cells were treated with 50 μm PD98059 for 0–96 h, stained with propidium iodide, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution. Consistent with the marked inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, PD98059 induced remarkable G1 cell cycle arrest in type III tumor cells (Fig. 2). The onset of G1 phase-arrest was apparent as early as 12 h after PD98059 treatment of RPMI-SE and HT1080 cells, and almost complete G1 cell cycle arrest was observed by 24 h, at which time the proportion of cells in G1 phase had increased from 57.5 to 93.2% or 45.1 to 77.4%, and the proportion of cells in S phase had declined from 27.8 to 2.4% or 34.8 to 2.9% in RPMI-SE or HT1080 cells, respectively. Furthermore, PD98059 treatment induced in these tumor cells a significant increase in the proportion of dead cells with fractional DNA content, which is a characteristic feature of apoptosis (22Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The proportion of such dead cells 96 h after PD98059 treatment was 10.7% in RPMI-SE cells and 26.1% in HT1080 cells; the proportions in mock-treated control cells were 2.3 and 3.5%, respectively. PD98059 also induced prominent G1 cell cycle arrest in A-172 type II tumor cells. However, the accumulation of PD98059-treated A-172 cells in G1 phase was slower than that observed in type III tumor cells; the proportion of A-172 cells in G1 phase had increased from 38.4 to 87.4% by 96 h, at which time the proportion of cells in S phase had decreased from 40.3 to 7.6%. In contrast, MEK inhibition affected the cell cycle distribution of TGW type I tumor cells and TIG-3 diploid fibroblasts (data not shown) to only a small extent. PD98059 induced a slight increase (at most 5–7%) in the proportion of these cells in G1 phase and a slight decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. This modest effect of PD98059 treatment on the cell cycle distribution of these cells appeared to result in the considerable growth suppression described above (Fig. 1 A). PD98059 did not significantly affect the cell cycle distribution of Colo320 or GOTO type 0 tumor cells. To characterize the cell death caused by PD98059, we examined the nuclear morphology of dying RPMI-SE and HT1080 cells with a fluorescent DNA-binding agent, DAPI. After treatment with 50 μm PD98059 for 120 h, ∼10% of the RPMI-SE cell population and ∼15% of the HT1080 cell population clearly exhibited condensed and fragmented nuclei, indicative of apoptotic cell death (Fig.3). No such nuclear morphology was detected in mock-treated control cells. PD98059 treatment also induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HT1080 cells; this was most evident after 120 h. PD98059 induced degradation of RPMI-SE DNA not into internucleosomal fragments but into fragments of high molecular weight. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of 10–40-kbp DNA fragments in PD98059-treated RPMI-SE cells after 120 h. It has recently been proposed, however, that the appearance of large DNA fragments (20–300 kbp) occurs prior to the appearance of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and that such large DNA fragments serve as precursors for the smaller DNA fragments (18Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,23Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C. Morris I.D. Hickman J.A. Wakeling A.E. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Thus, apoptosis appeared to be the major mechanism of PD98059-induced cell death in RPMI-SE and HT1080 tumor cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism of the G1 cell cycle arrest observed in PD98059-treated RPMI-SE and HT1080 cells, we examined whether changes in G1-associated regulatory proteins had occurred in these cells, focusing on the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (24Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, PD98059 treatment decreased the phosphorylation state of Rb; the hypophosphorylated (pRb) species began to increase by 6 h, and virtually complete loss of the hyperphosphorylated (ppRb) species was observed 24–48 h after PD98059 treatment of RPMI-SE and HT1080 cells. In addition, PD98059 treatment markedly reduced the levels of cyclin A and B1. This is consistent with PD98059-induced inhibition of entry into S and G2/M phases, where peak expression of these cyclins is known to occur. Although the ERK pathway has been shown to regulate positively the expression of cyclin D1 (25Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), PD98059 inhibition of the pathway did not significantly affect the level of either cyclin D1 or cyclin E in these tumor cells. We next explored possible reasons for Rb hypophosphorylation, focusing on the CDK inhibitors p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2, p16INK4a, and p19INK4d(26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing RPMI-SE and HT1080 cells expressed only limited levels of these CDK inhibitors. PD98059 treatment induced a marked increase in p27Kip1 in these tumor cells, which began at 12–24 h and reached a maximum by 48 h. Immunostaining clearly revealed the up-regulation of p27Kip1 in the nuclei of PD98059-treated RPMI-SE cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, PD98059 did not induce any significant increase in p21Cip1, p57Kip2, p16INK4a, or p19INK4d in either of the tumor cell lines (data not shown). Up-regulation of p27Kip1 has been shown to favor its association with G1-specific cyclin-CDK complexes such as cyclin E-CDK2, resulting in kinase inhibition and contributing to Rb hypophosphorylation (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional significance of p27Kip1 up-regulation in PD98059-treated RPMI-SE cells, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against CDK2 or cyclin E, and CDK2 kinase activity and cyclin E-associated kinase activity were measured using histone H1 as a substrate. PD98059 treatment of the cells inhibited both CDK2 kinase activity and cyclin E-associated kinase activity, with complete inhibition being apparent by 48 h (Fig. 5). Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins revealed an increase in p27Kip1 in both the CDK2 complexes and the cyclin E complexes after PD98059 treatment, indicating increased binding of p27Kip1 to cyclin E/CDK2 in response to PD98059. PD98059 treatment did not significantly affect the amount of either CDK2 or cyclin E in the immunoprecipitates. In Colo320 and GOTO type 0 tumor cells, PD98059 treatment did not induce a significant change in the phosphorylation state of Rb or in the levels of G1-associated regulatory proteins such as p27Kip1, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, or cyclin E; this was also the case in TGW type I tumor cells (Fig. 4 and data not shown). These results were in consistent with the slight inhibitory effect of PD98059 on the growth of these tumor cells (Fig. 1). To confirm further that specific blockade of the ERK pathway induced up-regulation of p27Kip1, RPMI-SE cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding either Myc-tagged MEK1(AA) (a kinase-negative form of MEK1) or Myc-tagged MKP-3. MKP-3 is a member of the dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatase family and is unique in that it is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and specifically inactivates ERKs, in contrast to c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or p38 MAP kinase (19Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Double immunofluorescence using anti-Myc and anti-phospho (activated)-ERKs antibodies revealed that overexpressed MEK1(AA) and MKP-3 were localized in the cytoplasm and completely prevented the activation of ERKs. Importantly, up-regulation of p27Kip1 was clearly observed in the nuclei of MEK1(AA)-/MKP-3-overexpressing RPMI-SE cells in the absence of PD98059 treatment (Fig.6). Furthermore, overexpression of MEK1(AA) or MKP-3 (data not shown) appeared to prevent DNA synthesis in the cells, as determined by the incorporation of BrdUrd into the nucleus. In contrast, RPMI-SE cells that did not express the kinase-negative form of MEK1 or exogenous MKP-3 exhibited ERK activation throughout the cells as well as BrdUrd incorporation into the nucleus; up-regulation of p27Kip1 was observed in these cells only after treatment with PD98059 for more than 24 h. In the present study, we examined the effect of a specific blockade of the ERK pathway on the growth of human tumor cells in vitro, using the specific MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 (10Dudley D.T.

This essentially complete inhibition of the ERK pathway suppressed the growth of all tumor cells examined. However, the susceptibility of cells to the blockade of the ERK pathway showed distinct differences among cell types and appeared to depend on the activation state of ERKs (7Hoshino R. Chatani Y.

The growth of tumor cells with constitutively high levels of ERK activation (type III tumor cells) was totally suppressed by PD98059/U0126, whereas the growth of tumor cells with barely detectable levels of ERK activation (type 0 tumor cells) was only slightly suppressed by the MEK inhibitors (Fig. 1 A). The different effects of PD98059 on the anchorage-independent growth of type III and type 0 tumor cells are clearly shown in Fig. 1 B. These results reinforce our previous observation that the requirement for the ERK pathway in proliferation differs markedly among human tumor cells; type III tumor cells depend absolutely on the activation of the ERK pathway for proliferation, whereas proliferation of type 0 tumor cells appears not to depend on the ERK pathway (7Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Consistent with its prominent antiproliferative effect, PD98059 induced striking G1 cell cycle arrest in tumor cells in which the ERK pathway is constitutively activated (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the idea that activation of the ERK pathway is essential for cells to pass the G1 restriction point (21Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported, however, that the ERK pathway functions not only in the G1/S transition but also in the transition from G2 to M phase in mammalian fibroblasts (27Wright J.H. Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this respect, populations of HT1080 cells treated with 50 μmPD98059 for more than 24 h remained at G2/M; essentially complete depletion of the PD98059-treated cells in S phase was confirmed by pulsing the cells with BrdUrd and then double-staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody and propidium iodide for flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). Cells remaining at G2/M phase were not observed in PD98059-treated RPMI-SE or A-172 cell populations. Requirements for the ERK pathway in G2/M transition may differ significantly among tumor cells. Orderly progression through the cell cycle is cooperatively regulated by several classes of CDKs, whose activities are in turn constrained by CDK inhibitors (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that PD98059 induced selective up-regulation of p27Kip1 in RPMI-SE and HT1080 cells. PD98059 did not induce a significant increase in p27Kip1 in tumor cells in which constitutive activation of the ERK pathway is undetectable (Fig. 4). Furthermore, overexpression in RPMI-SE cells of either a kinase-negative form of MEK1 or wild-type MKP-3 clearly induced up-regulation of p27Kip1 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that specific blockade of the ERK pathway induces marked up-regulation of p27Kip1 only in tumor cells in which the pathway is constitutively activated. The pivotal role of p27Kip1 in controlling CDK function and thus cell cycle progression is well established (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). p27Kip1 mediates cell cycle arrest in response to various anti-mitogenic signals such as transforming growth factor-β, serum withdrawal, and cell-cell contact. p27Kip1 associates with and inhibits the catalytic activities of G1-specific cyclin-CDK complexes such as cyclin E-CDK2, whose activity is essential for entry of cells into S phase. One major target of cyclin E-CDK2 is Rb, which upon hyperphosphorylation dissociates from bound transcription factors such as E2F, enabling them to activate genes required for DNA replication. We demonstrated that the up-regulation of p27Kip1 observed in PD98059-treated RPMI-SE cells correlated with an increase in p27Kip1 associated with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, a concomitant inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity, and a consequent decrease in the phosphorylation of Rb, which would culminate in the G1 cell cycle arrest of these cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the complete growth suppression that follows specific blockade of the ERK pathway in tumor cells in which the pathway is constitutively activated is mediated by up-regulation of p27Kip1. Regulation of p27Kip1 is mediated by transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms. We did not observe any significant increase in p27Kip1 mRNA levels in RPMI-SE cells treated with PD98059 for up to 48 h (data not shown), 2K. Ozaki, R. Hoshino, and M. Kohno, unpublished observations. by which time p27Kip1 reaches a maximum level (Fig. 4). Given the recent demonstration that cyclin E-CDK2 directly phosphorylates p27Kip1 and promotes its destruction by the ubiquitin pathway (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar, 28Sheaff R. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J. Clurman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the accumulation of p27Kip1 induced by inhibiting the ERK pathway is a result of stabilization of p27Kip1 at the protein level. PD98059 treatment induced a significant increase in the proportion of cells with condensed and fragmented nuclei in tumor cells in which the ERK pathway is markedly activated (Fig. 3). PD98059 induced the degradation of chromosomal DNA into internucleosomal DNA fragments in HT1080 cells or into 10–40-kbp DNA fragments in RPMI-SE cells. This fragmentation was not observed if the cells were preincubated with 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), a general caspase inhibitor (data not shown). 3R. Hoshino and M. Kohno, unpublished observations. Furthermore, PD98059 treatment induced a significant increase in the caspase-3-like protease activity in these tumor cells, which was determined usingN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide as a substrate.3 These results suggest that specific blockade of the ERK pathway by PD98059 induces apoptosis in HT1080 and RPMI-SE cells. In this respect, recent reports have demonstrated that overexpression of p27Kip1 leads to apoptosis in various cancer cells (29Katayose Y. Kim M. Rakkar A.N.S. Li Z. Cowan K.H. Seth P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5441-5445PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang X. Gorospe M. Huang Y. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2991-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, the accumulation of p27Kip1observed in PD98059-treated HT1080/RPMI-SE cells could play a role, at least in part, in the induction of apoptosis in these tumor cells. Moreover, blockade of the ERK pathway would cause serious metabolic disorders in HT1080 and RPMI-SE cells, which could culminate in the induction of apoptosis; these type III tumor cells appear to depend absolutely on the ERK pathway for growth, and probably for survival (31Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism(s) responsible for the induction of apoptosis and of up-regulation of p27Kip1 following specific blockade of the ERK pathway in tumor cells in which the pathway is constitutively activated remains to be determined. Induction of apoptosis is considered a possible therapy for human cancers (32Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that specific blockade of the ERK pathway induces apoptosis in tumor cells in which the pathway is constitutively activated. PD98059 and U0126 inhibited the proliferation of human diploid fibroblasts to a considerable degree but not completely. Importantly, PD98059/U0126 caused no increase in the proportion of diploid fibroblasts with fractional DNA content even after 10 days. Moreover, growth-inhibited diploid fibroblasts reinitiated proliferation soon after removal of the inhibitors (data not shown). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the ERK pathway is a potential therapeutic target in a group of tumor cells in which the pathway is constitutively activated. This possibility is further supported by a recent report showing that a new MEK inhibitor, PD184352, inhibited the growth of human colon tumor xenografts in vivo (33Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Dudley D.T. Herrera R. Van Becelaere K. Wiland A. Gowan R.C. Tecle H. Barrett S.D. Bridges A. Przybranowski S. Leopold W.R. Saltiel A.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this report that specific blockade of the ERK pathway completely suppresses the growth of tumor cells in which the pathway is constitutively activated, and we presented evidence suggesting that this prominent growth inhibition is mediated by the up-regulation of p27Kip1. We thank Drs. Steve Arkinstall and Emmanuel Van Obberghen for supplying plasmids, Dr. Kei-ichi Ozaki for the analysis of p27Kip1 mRNA, and Dr. Patrick Hughes for critical reading of the manuscript."

It promotes Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation, but its interactions with cellular components of the nucleation machinery are not well understood. Here we show that two domains of ActA (residues 85–104 and 121–138) with sequence similarity to WASP homology 2 domains bind two actin monomers with submicromolar affinity. ActA binds Arp2/3 with a K dof 0.6 μm and competes for binding with the WASP family proteins N-WASP and Scar1.

Interestingly, profilin competes with ActA for binding of Arp2/3, but actophorin (cofilin) does not. The minimal Arp2/3-binding site of ActA (residues 144–170) is C-terminal to both actin-binding sites and shares sequence homology with Arp2/3-binding regions of WASP family proteins. The maximal activity at saturating concentrations of ActA is identical to the most active domains of the WASP family proteins.

WASP homology 2 dithiothreitol 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride N-hydroxysuccinimide The actin cytoskeleton participates in many essential functions in eukaryotic cells including motility, endocytosis, and cytokinesis. These processes rely on the rapid and localized assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. Cellular signals, such as activated Rho family G-proteins, direct construction of new actin filaments de novo by localizing and activating the nucleation machinery. The actin nucleation machinery consists of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that nucleates and cross-links actin filaments into orthogonal arrays, and a nucleation promoting factor that activates or enhances the activity of the Arp2/3 complex. Both the mechanism of Arp2/3-mediated nucleation and its enhancement by nucleation promoting factors are poorly understood. Cellular nucleation promoting factors identified to date are all members of the WASP family of proteins, which includes isoforms of WASP, N-WASP, and Scar. Other proteins, including fungal myosin I (1Lechler T. Shevchenko A. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Evangelista M. Klebl B.M. Tong A.H.

The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes recruits the host cell cytoskeleton to power its own motility and migrate from cell to cell to avoid the humoral immune system. The only bacterial protein required for this activity is ActA (4Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Cell. 1992; 68: 521-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 5Smith G.A. Portnoy D.A. Theriot J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a nucleation promoting factor that recruits and activates Arp2/3. Although ActA was the first protein found to stimulate Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation (6Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we know much less about how actin and Arp2/3 interact with ActA than with the WASP family proteins. WASP family proteins contain an acidic C-terminal domain that binds Arp2/3 (7Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and one or two WASP homology 2 (WH2)1 domains that bind actin (8Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 9Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of truncation mutants suggests that both the acidic and WH2 domains are required to promote Arp2/3-dependent nucleation (10Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The nucleation promoting activity of ActA has been shown to reside in the N-terminal 262 amino acids of the molecule (6Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), but the location, number, and activity of actin- and Arp2/3-binding sites have not been determined. Understanding the structure and function of ActA provides insight into the mechanism of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. In addition, comparison of ActA with endogenous nucleation promoting factors shows us how relevant conclusions based on studying Listeria motility are to normal cellular motility. In the present study we find that ActA binds two actin monomers with submicromolar affinity using domains with some sequence similarity to WH2 domains from endogenous nucleation promoting factors. The binding site for Arp2/3 is located C-terminal to the actin-binding sites, and although it does not contain the characteristic cluster of acidic residues, it shares limited sequence homology with the Arp2/3-binding domains found in WASP family proteins. By chemical cross-linking and polarization anisotropy, we show that ActA and the WASP family proteins hScar1 and N-WASP contact the same subunits on Arp2/3 and compete for the same binding site. This binding site is much more extensive than previously thought and includes both of the actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3. In vitro the maximal activity of full-length ActA is nearly identical to the endogenous nucleation promoting factor N-WASP. L. monocytogenes 4035 genomic DNA was a generous gift from A. K. Benson, University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Oligonucleotide primers were designed that correspond to the following: FACTA30N, GATCGAATTCTCCAGTCTGAACACAGATGAATGGG; FACTA120N, GATCGGATCCATGGCTTCAGGAGCCGACCGACC; FACTA152N, GATCGGATCCATGATAGCATCATCGGATAGTGAGC; FACT180N, GGATCCATGTCAGTTGCGGATGCTTCTGAA; RACTA170N, GATCGAATTCTTAACATTTTGTTGGTTTATCCGGATAAGTAAGGC; and RACTA612, GAATTCTTAACACGTCGTATGGTTCCCTGGTTCTTCCTTCGC. Polymerase chain reactions were performed with proofreading polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under standard conditions. DNA fragments were subcloned into the pET-5a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). ActA-(30–120) and ActA-(121–170) were constructed either by dropout and/or Eco RI partial digestion of the ActA-(30–170) construct. All ActA proteins were expressed and purified as follows. Fresh transformations of BL-21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C in TPM (20 g of tryptone, 15 g of yeast extract, 8 g of NaCl, 2 g of Na2HPO4, 0.2% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin) to A 650 of ∼0.6, then induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), and grown an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested at 5000 rpm and pellets stored −80 °C. Cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.2 m sucrose, 1000 units of DNase, 1000 units of RNase, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by three passes in a microfluidizer (Microfluidics International Corp., Newton, MA). The extract was spun at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was fractionated by gel filtration on a 500-ml Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). ActA-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against DEAE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT). Protein was then purified by anion exchange chromatography using DE52 resin. Proteins were concentrated either by dialysis against solid sucrose or with a Centriprep spin column. Purified proteins were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. The WA constructs of hSCAR1 and N-WASP were expressed with C-terminal His tags and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cell growth conditions, buffers, and lysis conditions were identical to those used for ActA mutants. Arp2/3 was purified as described previously (12Kelleher J.F. Mullins R.D. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) but with a few modifications. Poly-l-proline flow-through was passed over a C-200 cation exchange column. The flow-through was adsorbed onto a C-500 anion exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.2 m KCl in column buffer. Protein-containing fractions were concentrated by dialysis against solid sucrose and run on an S-300 column equilibrated in high salt complex buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 750 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP). Purified Arp2/3 was stored in complex buffer supplemented with 35–50% sucrose. Acanthamoeba actin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin were purified according to Refs. 13Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 14MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar. Plasma gelsolin was purified as described previously (15Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 16Bryan J. Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, and incubated with a 4–7-fold molar excess of rhodamine maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C. Samples were spun at 65,000 rpm, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 column to remove unreacted dye. In Arp2/3-mediated polymerization assays, the activity of the rhodamine-labeled ActA was indistinguishable from that of unlabeled ActA. Freshly purified Arp2/3 was dialyzed into labeling buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm TCEP) overnight and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was concentrated to 1–2 mg/ml with a microcon concentrator and mixed with an equimolar amount of rhodamine maleimide for 1.5 h at 24 °C under cover of darkness. The reaction was quenched with excess DTT, and the sample was spun at 70,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated dye. The supernatant was chromatographed on a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 column to remove unreacted dye. This labeling protocol results in ∼15% labeling of Arp2/3, almost exclusively on the Arp3 subunit. Higher concentrations of rhodamine maleimide produce elevated percentages of labeling, and the complex becomes labeled on both the Arp3 and p18 subunits. To determine the effect of labeling on Arp2/3 activity, we tested 60% rhodamine-labeled Arp2/3 and found no effect on either nucleation or pointed end capping. Acanthamoeba and Rabbit skeletal muscle actin were labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide as described (17Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We mixed unlabeledAcanthamoeba actin with pyrene-labeled amoeba or rabbit skeletal muscle actin to 10–15% of final actin concentration. Polymerization reactions contained 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7. Ca2+-actin was converted to Mg2+-actin prior to each polymerization reaction by a 2-min incubation with 50 μm MgCl2, 200 μm EGTA. Gelsolin-actin dimers were prepared according to Ref. 15Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar. Pyrene fluorescence was measured by a K2 Multifrequency Fluorometer (ISS, Champagne, IL). Data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Rhodamine-labeled ActA-(30–170) (500 nm) or Arp2/3 (750 nm) was mixed with the appropriate unlabeled proteins to the indicated concentrations. Samples were degassed under vacuum at room temperature before data collection. Data were collected with a K2 Multifrequency Fluorometer and analyzed using KaleidaGraph. Under the conditions used in our study, anisotropy is a measure of the rotational mobility of the fluorescently labeled protein. We excited the fluorophore with plane polarized light at 543 nm, and measured emission at 575 nm at polarizations both parallel (I ∥) and perpendicular (I ⊥) to the excitation source. We then calculated anisotropy (r) as shown in Equation 1, r=I∥−I⊥I∥+2I⊥Equation 1 We determined dissociation equilibrium constants by fitting anisotropy data to the function shown in Equation 2,r=rf+(rb−rf)(Kd+[R]+[A])−(Kd+[R]+[A])2−4[R][A]2[R]Equation 2 where r f and r b are the anisotropies of free and bound rhodamine ActA; [A] and [R] are the total concentrations of ActA and Arp2/3, andK d is the dissociation equilibrium constant. Fitting with this function makes no assumptions about the relative concentrations of ActA and Arp2/3. In experiments where nonfluorescent ligands compete with rhodamine-labeled ActA (Fig. 4), we determined dissociation constants by fitting anisotropy data to the function (18Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) shown in Equation3,r=rf+(rb−rf)Kd[C]+Kd2Kd,2[Ro]+1Equation 3 where K d,2 is the dissociation constant of the nonfluorescent competitor; [C] is the total concentration of the competitor, and [R o] is the concentration of free Arp2/3 when [C] = 0. For this analysis [R o] and K d are determined from the anisotropy in the absence of competitor andK d,2 is determined from fitting Equation3 to experimental data. This function is an approximation and only valid when Arp2/3 and the competitor are in excess over labeled ActA. These conditions were met in all our competition binding experiments. The indicated concentrations of ActA-(121–170) and Arp2/3 were dialyzed into 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, to facilitate cross-linking. Stock solutions of 100 mm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) andN-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Pierce) were prepared in Me2SO. Cross-linking reactions were carried out at room temperature at the indicated concentrations of proteins and cross-linkers for 45 min. The reaction was quenched with 10 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine. Reaction products were precipitated with methanol and chloroform and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The atomic model for actin was taken from Schutt et al. (19Schutt C. Myslik J.C. Rozychi M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and the model of Arp2 was constructed by Joe Kelleher based on homology with conventional actin combined with molecular dynamics simulations (20Kelleher J.F. Atkinson S.J. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Visualization and rendering were performed with Molscript (21Kraulis P.K. J. Appl.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Full-length ActA (amino acids 30–612) and several smaller truncation mutants inhibit spontaneous actin polymerization and elongation from the pointed end of existing actin filaments but have no effect on elongation from the barbed end (Fig. 1,A and B, inset). This activity is similar to that reported for fragments of N-WASP (23Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Carlier M.F. J.

Unlike Scar and N-WASP, which almost completely inhibit pointed end elongation, saturating concentrations of ActA inhibit pointed end elongation by 80%.Figure 1ActA binds two actin monomers. A, inhibition of spontaneous actin polymerization by ActA-(30–612). 5 μm actin monomers were polymerized by addition of KCl and MgCl2 in the presence of the following concentrations of ActA-(30–612): ○, 0.0 μm; ●, 3 μm; ■, 5 μm; ▪, 10 μm(conditions, actin was 15% pyrene-labeled; buffer, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, temperature, 24 °C). B, ActA-(30–612) blocks addition of actin monomers to the pointed ends of existing filaments. We polymerized 3 μm actin (10% pyrene-labeled) from the pointed ends of gelsolin-capped actin seeds in the presence of various concentrations of ActA-(30–612).Inset, time courses of polymerization in the presence of 0.0, 0.8, 1.6, 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 μm ActA-(30–612) (conditions, buffer, and temperature same as A).Straight lines represent infinitely tight binding to either one (right) or two (left) binding sites. The heavy curve is the best fit to a two binding site model with equal dissociation equilibrium constants of 0.7 ± 0.2 μm. C, domain organization of ActA. ActA truncation mutants used in this study and their relative activities in inhibiting spontaneous actin polymerization and promoting Arp2/3-dependent nucleation activity. D, actin and Arp2/3-binding sites in the N-terminal portion of ActA. Theheavy dark lines indicate the minimal fragment of ActA capable of promoting Arp2/3-dependent nucleation (top) and the putative actin and Arp2/3-binding sites identified by homology with domains from WASP family proteins (bottom). The domains from WASP family proteins begin at the following amino acids: Bee1p, 547, 570, and 613; human N-WASP, 345, 372, and 413; Rat N-WASP, 401, 428, and 469; Mouse WASP, 447 and 490; Human Scar1, 495 and 533; and Dicty Scar, 380 and 418.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used the effect on pointed end elongation to quantitate actin monomer binding by ActA-(30–612) (Fig. 1 B). The decrease in elongation rate as a function of ActA concentration is not well fit by a model in which an individual ActA molecule binds a single actin monomer (right line). The data fit much better to a model in which one ActA binds two actin monomers, each with aK d of 0.7 ± 0.2 μm suggesting that ActA contains at least two actin monomer-binding sites. Previous studies identified a putative actin-binding site (24Cicchetti G. Maurer P. Wagener P. Kocks C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33616-33626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Lasa I. Gouin E. Goethals M. Vancompernolle K. David V. Vandekerckhove J. Cossart P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) between amino acids 60 and 90. To extend this work we used truncation mutants to perform a systematic search for actin-binding sites throughout the entire molecule. We expressed truncation mutants spanning the entire molecule (Fig. 1 C) and assayed the monomer binding activity of each by its effect in three assays as follows: spontaneous actin polymerization, elongation from the barbed end, and elongation from the pointed end of existing filaments. The construct spanning amino acids 30–120 weakly inhibited spontaneous polymerization (data not shown), consistent with previous reports of an actin-binding site between amino acids 60 and 100 (24Cicchetti G. Maurer P. Wagener P. Kocks C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33616-33626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, the construct spanning amino acids 120–612 inhibited spontaneous polymerization and elongation from both the pointed and barbed ends of existing filaments. We further localized this second actin-binding site to a region of the protein between amino acids 121 and 152. We estimated a dissociation constant of 2.1 ± 0.5 μmfor the actin-binding site on ActA-(120–612) from barbed end elongation assays (data not shown). The lower affinity of this binding site compared with that predicted from ActA-(30–612) and the fact that it blocks barbed as well as pointed end elongations are probably artifacts caused by some degree of misfolding of the ActA-(120–612) construct. Cicchetti et al. (24Cicchetti G. Maurer P. Wagener P. Kocks C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33616-33626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that deletions in the N-terminal region of ActA perturb the secondary structure and decrease the stability of the protein. We conclude that full-length ActA contains two actin monomer-binding sites. We further localized them based on sequence similarity to the actin-binding WH2 domains from WASP family proteins (Fig.1 D). Amino acids 143–169 of ActA constitute a minimal Arp2/3-binding site. Full-length ActA and truncations spanning residues 30–170, 120–612, and 121–170 all stimulated Arp2/3-dependent nucleation (Figs. 1 C and 2 A). Therefore, residues 121–170 contain the minimal requirements to promote nucleation - actin monomer binding activity and an Arp2/3-binding site. Within this region we identified residues 143–169 as the Arp2/3-binding site by sequence similarity to the C-terminal portions of WASP, Scar, and N-WASP (Fig. 1 D). This domain contains very few acidic residues compared with the Arp2/3-binding sites of most WASP family proteins but is most similar to the yeast protein Las17p/Bee1p. At saturating concentrations the ActA-(120–612) truncation is less efficient at stimulating actin polymerization than proteins containing amino acids 30–120. Under our assay conditions (2 μm actin, 50 nm Arp2/3), the time to half-maximal polymerization stimulated by saturating concentrations of ActA-(30–612) and ActA-(30–170) is ∼75 s compared with t 12 of ∼500 s for ActA-(120–612) (Fig.2 A). We determined the affinity of the 30–612 and 30–170 ActA proteins for Arp2/3 by polarization anisotropy (Fig. 2 B). To characterize the interaction with ActA-(30–612) we labeled Arp2/3 with rhodamine maleimide. Our labeling conditions produced 5–15% labeling, almost exclusively on the Arp3 subunit. From preparation to preparation, free Arp2/3 had an anisotropy that varied between 0.215 and 0.26. Addition of saturating concentrations of ActA-(30–612) consistently increased the steady-state anisotropy by 0.015. From this change we measured aK d of 0.5 ± 0.2 μm. To measure Arp2/3 binding to the smaller truncation mutants, we labeled ActA with rhodamine maleimide. We designed all our ActA proteins with a cysteine at the extreme C terminus for efficient labeling with sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophores. We labeled each construct with rhodamine maleimide and measured its anisotropy alone and in the presence of Arp2/3. ActA-(30–612) had a very low anisotropy (0.05) similar to that of free dye, which did not change upon addition of Arp2/3 suggesting that the C terminus of the protein is flexible and possibly disordered. ActA-(30–170) was much more well behaved, and in the absence of Arp2/3 it had an anisotropy of 0.095 and in the presence of saturating Arp2/3 concentrations of 0.21. From this anisotropy change, we measured a K d of 4.8 ± 0.3 μm. The lower affinity of ActA-(30–170) suggests that residues C-terminal to 170 may also interact with Arp2/3. To localize the binding sites for nucleation promoting factors on Arp2/3, we carried out identical cross-linking experiments with the active fragment of hScar1 and the smallest fragment of ActA capable of stimulating Arp2/3-dependent nucleation, ActA-(121–170). We identified three Arp2/3 subunits that directly contact both ActA and hScar1 by cross-linking each protein to Arp2/3 with the zero-length cross-linker EDC together with NHS. After cross-linking, antibodies that recognize the T7 tag on ActA-(121–170) or the His6 tag on hScar1 react with three prominent new bands (Fig. 3, A andB). The new bands are also recognized by monospecific antibodies against the p40, Arp2, and Arp3 subunits of Arp2/3. We next investigated whether the binding site for ActA overlapped that of endogenous WASP family proteins by performing competition binding assays. Addition of the active C-terminal domain of N-WASP to a mixture of Arp2/3 and rhodamine ActA-(30–170) decreases the anisotropy of labeled ActA down to the level of free ActA (Fig.4), suggesting that the two proteins bind in a mutually exclusive manner. From these competition experiments we estimate a K d of 1.9 ± 0.3 μmfor N-WASP binding to Arp2/3. Similar results were obtained with hScar1 (Kd = 2.0 ± 0.4 μm, data not shown). Our results suggest that Arp2 interacts directly with ActA and WASP family proteins. To further localize the binding site for nucleation promoting factors, we tested the effects of two proteins known to bind Arp2, profilin and actophorin, on the binding of ActA to Arp2/3. Interestingly, profilin decreases the fraction of ActA bound to Arp2/3 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that its binding site overlaps that of ActA. Fitting the data with a competitive binding model yields a K d of 3.4 ± 0.3 for profilin binding, somewhat lower than our previous estimate of 7 μm from analytical ultracentrifugation (26Mullins R.D. Kelleher J.F. Xu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 841-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Profilin, however, is not as effective as N-WASP at displacing ActA from Arp2/3. In the presence of Arp2/3, saturating concentrations of profilin do not decrease the anisotropy of rhodamine ActA-(30–170) down to the levels of free protein suggesting that the binding sites do not completely overlap. The data are consistent with an increase in theK d for ActA binding from 4.8 to ∼30 μm. Although actophorin binds Arp2/3 with approximately the same affinity as profilin, actophorin does not displace rhodamine ActA even at high concentrations (Fig. 4). Although we do not understand the molecular details of Arp2/3-dependent nucleation, several characteristics of the process have been well described. Addition of WASP family proteins to Arp2/3 accelerates filament formation but, even at high concentrations, does not completely abolish the initial lag phase of polymerization (10Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 27Rohatgi R. Ma L.

This suggests that nucleation promoting factors do not convert Arp2/3 into a bona fide actin nucleus but promote nucleation via a multistep mechanism. In addition, pre-existing filaments accelerate the nucleation reaction so that the majority of new actin filaments grow from the sides of pre-existing filaments in a characteristic branching pattern (7Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 11Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D.

https://openalex.org/W1993171928,"On the basis of extensive structure-function studies of protein kinase C-α (PKC-α), we have proposed an activation mechanism for conventional PKCs in which the C2 domain and the C1 domain interact sequentially with membranes (Medkova, M., and Cho, W. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 19852–19861). To further elucidate the interactions between the C1 and C2 domains during PKC activation and the origin of phosphatidylserine specificity, we mutated several charged residues in two C1 domains (C1a and C1b) of PKC-α. We then measured the membrane binding affinities, activities, and monolayer penetration of these mutants. Results indicate that cationic residues of the C1a domain, most notably Arg77, interact nonspecifically with anionic phospholipids prior to the membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues. The mutation of a single aspartate (Asp55) in the C1a domain to Ala or Lys resulted in dramatically reduced phosphatidylserine specificity in vesicle binding, activity, and monolayer penetration. In particular, D55A showed much higher vesicle affinity, activity, and monolayer penetration power than wild type under nonactivating conditions,i.e. with phosphatidylglycerol and in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that Asp55 is involved in the tethering of the C1a domain to another part of PKC-α, which keeps it in an inactive conformation at the resting state. Based on these results, we propose a refined model for the activation of conventional PKC, in which phosphatidylserine specifically disrupts the C1a domain tethering by competing with Asp55, which then leads to membrane penetration and diacylglycerol binding of the C1a domain and PKC activation.

At least 10 isoforms of mammalian PKCs have been identified to date and they all contain an amino-terminal regulatory domain linked to a COOH-terminal kinase domain. Based on structural differences in the regulatory domain, PKC isoforms have been generally subdivided into three classes; conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms), novel PKC (δ, ε, η, and θ isoforms), and atypical PKC (ζ and λ/ι isoforms). Conventional PKCs are activated by the Ca2+-dependent translocation of proteins to the membrane containing anionic phospholipids, preferably phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The membrane translocation is mediated by two types of membrane-targeting domains (C1 and C2 domains) in the regulatory region of conventional PKC (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of conventional PKC is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent binding of protein to anionic membranes (4Edwards A.S.

Based on extensive structure-function studies on PKC-α, we have recently proposed a mechanism for thein vitro membrane binding and activation of PKC-α (14Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, PKC-α initially binds to the membrane surface via the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of the C2 domain. Once membrane-bound, PS specifically induces the insertion of the hydrophobic residues of the C1a domain into the membrane. The membrane penetration allows optimal DAG binding and drives the release of pseudo-substrate region from the active site, hence the PKC activation. Although this mechanism accounts for much of the temporal and spatial sequences of in vitro activation of conventional PKC, questions still remain as to how the C1 and C2 domains of PKC-α interact with each other during PKC activation and how PS specifically induces the membrane penetration of the C1a domain. To address these questions, we performed further structure-function studies on the C1a and C1b domains of PKC-α, with an emphasis on surface ionic residues. Results from these studies provide an important new clue to the understanding of the origin of PS specificity. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and 1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol (DOG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Tritiated POPC ([3H]POPC) was prepared from 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and [9,10-3H]oleic acid (American Radiochemical Co.) using rat liver microsomes as described (15Lands W.E.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 114-115Google Scholar). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Bayer Inc. (Kankakee, IL). [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/μmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and cold ATP was from Sigma. Triton X-100 was obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). Restriction endonucleases and enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from either Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Baculovirus transfer vectors encoding the cDNA of PKC-α with appropriate C1 domain mutations were generated by the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using pVL1392-PKC-α plasmid as a template (18Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, four primers, including two complementary oligonucleotides introducing a desired mutation and two additional oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-end and 3′-end of the PKC-α gene, respectively, were used for polymerase chain reaction performed in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Two DNA fragments overlapping at the mutation site were first generated and purified on an agarose gel. These two fragments were then annealed and extended to generate an entire PKC-α gene containing a desired mutation, which was further amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The product was subsequently purified on an agarose gel, digested withNot I and Eco RI, and subcloned into the pVL1392 plasmid digested with the same restriction enzymes. The mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type PKC-α and mutants were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) and purified as described previously (5Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The transfection of Sf9 cells with mutant pVL1392-PKC-α constructs was performed using a BaculoGoldTM transfection kit from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared by using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to avoid potential endotoxin contamination. Activity of PKC was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm, 0.6 μCi/tube) into the histone III-SS (400 μg/ml) (Sigma). The reaction mixture contained large unilamellar vesicles (0.1 mm), 5 mm MgCl2, 12 nm PKC, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Protamine sulfate (200 μg/ml) was used to determine the free enzyme concentration in vesicle binding measurements (see below). Free calcium concentration was adjusted using a mixture of EGTA and CaCl2 according to the method of Bers (19Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding MgCl2 to the mixture and quenched by adding 50 μl of 5% aqueous phosphoric acid solution after a given period of incubation (e.g. 10 min for histone) at room temperature. Seventy-five microliters of quenched reaction mixtures were spotted on P-81 ion-exchange papers (Whatman) and papers were washed 4 times with 5% aqueous phosphoric acid solution and washed once with 95% aqueous ethanol. Papers were then transferred into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Sigma) and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The linearity of the time course of the reaction was checked by monitoring the degree of phosphorylation at regular intervals (e.g. 5 min). The binding of PKC to phospholipid vesicles was measured by a centrifugation assay using large sucrose-loaded unilamellar vesicles (100 nm diameter) (20Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Sucrose-loaded vesicles were prepared as described previously (18Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The final concentration of vesicle solution was determined by measuring the radioactivity of a trace of [3H]POPC (typically 0.1 mol %) included in all phospholipid mixtures. For binding experiments, PKC (∼12 nm) was incubated for 15 min with sucrose-loaded vesicles (0.1 mm), 1 μm BSA, and varying concentrations of Ca2+ in 150 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl. BSA was added to minimize the loss of protein due to nonspecific adsorption to tube walls. Vesicles were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min using Sorvall RC-M120EX Microultracentrifuge. Aliquots of supernatants were used for protein determination by PKC activity assay using protamine sulfate as a substrate. The fraction of bound enzyme was plotted against the anionic lipid composition (mol %) of mixed vesicles. Mol % values of PS and PG giving rise to half-maximal vesicle binding and activity ([PS]12 and [PG]12) were estimated graphically from individual plots. Surface pressure (π) of solution in a circular Teflon trough (4 cm diameter × 1 cm deep) was measured using a Wilhelmy plate attached to a computer-controlled Cahn electrobalance (Model C-32) as described previously (18Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Five to ten microliters of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) or chloroform was spread onto 10 ml of subphase (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.1 mm free Ca2+) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (π0). The subphase was continuously stirred at 60 rpm with a magnetic stir bar. Once the surface pressure reading of monolayer had been stabilized (after about 5 min), the protein solution (typically 40 μl) was injected into the subphase through a small hole drilled at an angle through the wall of the trough and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 30 min. The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (e.g. at [PKC-α] ≥ 1 μg/ml). Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The critical surface pressure (πc) was determined by extrapolating the Δπversus π0 plot to the x axis (21Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 400 μg/ml vesicle solutions were prepared in an appropriate flow buffer solution (typically 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl and varying concentrations of Ca2+). Before SPR measurements, the Biacore X (Biacore AB) instrument was allowed to equilibrate with the buffer until the drift in signal was less than 0.3 resonance units/min. The Pioneer L1 sensor chip was then coated with the vesicles at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The immobilized lipid vesicles were washed with 10 μl of 10 mm NaOH at 100 μl/min flow rate to remove unattached vesicles. In control experiments, the fluorescence intensity of the flow buffer after rinsing the sensor chip coated with vesicles incorporating 10 mm 5-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes) was monitored. Lack of detectable fluorescence signal indicated that the vesicles remained intact on the chip. Next, 25 μl of 0.1 mg/ml BSA was injected at 5 μl/min to block exposed sites on the chip surface, which was once again washed with 10 mm NaOH. All experiments were performed with a control cell in which a second sensor surface was coated with 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 5 μl/min and then washed with 10 mm NaOH. The drift in signal for both sample and control flow cells was allowed to stabilize below 0.3 resonance unit/min before any kinetic experiments were performed. All kinetic experiments were performed at 24 °C and a flow rate of 60 μl/min. A high flow rate was used to circumvent mass transport effects. The association was monitored for 90 s (90 μl) and dissociation for 4 min. The immobilized vesicle surface was then regenerated for subsequent measurements using 10 μl of 10–50 mm NaOH or 3 m NaCl. The regeneration solution was passed over the immobilized vesicle surface until the SPR signal reached the initial background value before protein injection. For data acquisition, 5 or more different concentrations (typically within a 10-fold range around the K d) of each protein were used. After each set of measurements, the entire immobilized vesicles were removed by injection of 25 μl of 40 mm CHAPS, followed by 25 μl of octyl glucoside at 5 μl/min, and the sensor chip was re-coated with a fresh vesicle solution for the next set of measurements. All data were evaluated using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore). For each trial, the control surface response was subtracted out to eliminate any nonspecific binding and refractive index changes due to buffer change. Furthermore, the derivative plot was used to monitor potential mass transport effects. Once these factors were checked for each set of data, the association and dissociation phases of data were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: [protein·vesicle] ↔ protein + vesicle. The dissociation phase was fit to the integrated rate equation, R =R 0 e k d(t−t 0, where k d is the dissociation rate constant,R 0 is the response at the start of fit data, andt 0 is the time at start of fit data. The association phase is fit to the integrated rate equation:R = R eq(1 −e −(k aC+k d)(t0)) + RI, where R eq = [k aC/(k aC +k d)] Rmax, RI = refractive index change, R max is the theoretical binding capacity, C is analyte concentration, andk a is the association rate constant. The curve fitting efficiency was checked by residual plots and χ2. The dissociation constant (K d) was then calculated from the equation, K d =k d/k a. Figs. 1 and 2illustrate amino acid sequences and model structures of C1a and C1b domains of PKC-α, respectively. In particular, Fig. 2 shows that the C1 domains of PKC-α have a polarized distribution of hydrophobic and ionic residues. The upper part of the molecule, where the DAG/phorbol ester binding pocket is located, contains a few aliphatic and aromatic residues whereas the middle part has a number of cationic residues. We have recently performed an extensive structure-function study on the hydrophobic residues of the C1a and C1b domains of PKC-α, which revealed their distinct roles in PKC activation (14Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues in the C1a domain are essential for the membrane penetration and DAG-dependent activation of PKC-α, whereas those in the C1b domain are not directly involved in these processes. To assess the role of cationic residues of the C1 domains in the membrane binding and activation of PKC-α, we mutated several cationic residues in the C1a and C1b domains. Specifically, Lys62, Lys76, and Arg77 in the C1a domain and His127, Lys131, and Lys141 in the C1b domain were replaced by alanine (Fig. 1). Since all mutated residues are surface exposed (Fig. 2), these mutations were not expected to cause deleterious conformational changes. Indeed, all six mutants were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as efficiently as wild type, suggesting comparable thermodynamic stability and lack of gross conformational changes.Figure 2A proposed membrane binding mode of C1a and C1b motifs of PKC -α. The model structures of C1a and C1b domains shown in a ribbon diagram are built on the backbone of the C1b motif of PKC-δ with side chain replacements using a program Biopolymer (Molecular Simulation). The side chains of mutated cationic and anionic residues are highlighted inblue and red, respectively, andnumbered. The upper part of C1a domain that partially penetrates into the membrane contains hydrophobic and aromatic side chains (shown in white).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We systematically analyzed the effects of the above mutations by measuring the anionic phospholipid dependence of vesicle binding and enzyme activity for wild type and mutants. First, we measured the PS dependence of binding to POPC/POPS mixed vesicles containing 1 mol % of DOG. As shown in Fig. 3, two C1a domain mutants, K62A and R77A, required significantly higher mol % of PS for vesicle binding ([PS]12 = 20 and 30 mol %, respectively) whereas another C1a mutant K76A and all C1b mutants behaved essentially the same as wild type ([PS]12 = 16 to 18 mol %). We then measured the kinase activity of wild type and mutants toward histone under the same conditions (i.e. in the presence of POPC/POPS/DOG mixed vesicles). In general, C1a domain mutants exhibited lower activity than did C1b domain mutants at a given PS concentration (Fig. 4). For instance, at 40 mol % PS wild type PKC-α and C1b domain mutants showed full activity. Under the same conditions, however, K62A and K76A showed only 44 and 55% of the wild type activity, respectively, although they are fully vesicle-bound (see Fig. 3). Most notably, R77A showed no detectable activity with up to 80 mol % PS although the protein should be fully vesicle-bound with 80 mol % PS (see Fig. 3). R77A exhibited full vesicle-binding affinity and enzymatic activity in the presence of 1 mol % of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the vesicles (data not shown), indicating that the extremely low activity of R77A is not due to deleterious conformational changes.Figure 4Dependence of enzymatic activity of PKC -α and C1 domain mutants on the POPS composition in POPC/POPS/DOG vesicles. Proteins include wild type (○), K62A (▴), K76A (▪), R77A (♦), H127A (Δ), K131A (■), and K141A (⋄). Total lipid concentration of POPC/POPS/DOG (99-x:x:1 in mol %) vesicles and PKC concentration were 0.1 mm and 12 nm, respectively, in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, histone III-SS (400 μg/ml), and 0.1 mm Ca2+. Each data point represents an average of duplicate measurements. The absolute value of maximal activity is 0.20 ± 0.04 μmol/(mg/min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that the isolated C1 domain (i.e. C1a + C1b) has essentially the same affinity for PS and phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-containing vesicles, indicating lack of a specific PS-binding site in the domain (14Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This, in turn, suggests that the role of cationic residues in the C1 domains is to interactnonspecifically with anionic phospholipids. If this is the case, the mutations of the cationic residues of the C1 domains of PKC-α should not affect its PS specificity for vesicle binding affinity and enzyme activity. To test this notion, we measured the PG dependence of the binding of wild type and mutants to POPC/POPG/DOG mixed vesicles and compared it with the PS dependence shown in Fig. 3. As reported previously (18Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), PKC-α and all mutants required higher mol % of PG than PS for the same degree of vesicle binding (Fig.5). As with the PS dependence of vesicle binding, only two C1a domain mutants, K62A and R77A, showed reduced binding affinity for PG-containing vesicles, while other mutants behaved like wild type. We then measured the PG dependence of kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 6, the PG dependence of activity compared well with the PS dependence (Fig. 4). In general, wild type and all mutants had much lower kinase activity in the presence of PG vesicles, and displayed significant activity only at high mol % of PG. Even at high mol % of PG, however, K62A and R77A exhibited much lower activity than wild type. For instance, R77A exhibited no detectable activity and K62A showed about 50% of wild type activity at 80 mol % PG. Thus, the PG dependence was qualitatively similar to corresponding PS dependence, indicating that the mutations of C1 domain residues affect the PS- and PG-dependent vesicle binding and activation of PKC-α to similar extents. Taken together, these results indicate that the cationic residues in the C1a domain, most notably Arg77, make important contributions to the membrane binding and activation of PKC-α by nonspecifically interacting with anionic membrane surfaces.Figure 6Dependence of enzymatic activity of PKC -α and C1 domain mutants toward histone on the POPG composition in POPC/POPG/DOG vesicles. Proteins include wild type (○), K62A (▴), K76A (▪), R77A (♦), H127A (Δ), K131A (■), and K141A (⋄). Experimental conditions are the same as described for Fig. 4. The absolute value of maximal activity is 0.20 ± 0.04 was μmol/(mg/min), as described for Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our model structures of C1a and C1b domains of PKC-α reveal the presence of single surface-exposed anionic residues, Asp55 (C1a) and Asp116 (C1b), located near the cationic patches (Fig. 2). Residues 55 and 116 are not perfectly matched in the sequence alignment but their relative location in the molecule should be similar based on our modeling (see Fig. 1). Conventional and novel PKCs invariably contain an anionic residue, predominantly Asp, in these positions. To determine the role of these unique aspartates, we replaced Asp55 in the C1a domain and Asp116 in the C1b domain with alanine and lysine, respectively. We then measured the vesicle binding and kinase activity of the mutants as a function of PS composition in POPC/POPS/DOG (99-x:x:1) mixed vesicles and also as a function of Ca2+. As shown in Fig.7, D55A showed higher membrane affinity than wild type at a given PS composition in the range of 0 to 20 mol %. As a result, [PS]12 (≈10 mol %) for D55A was significantly lower than that of wild type (≈17 mol %). In contrast, D116A behaved similarly to wild type. A similar trend was seen with relative activity. In this case, the maximal activity of D55A was ≈35% higher than that of wild type even when both enzymes were fully activated. Fig. 8 shows the calcium dependence of PKC activity of the three proteins in the presence of POPC/POPS/DOG (69:30:1) vesicles. Again, D55A required less Ca2+ than wild type and D116A for activation and showed ≈40% higher maximal activity. Since our previous studies showed that Ca2+ and PS are required for triggering the membrane penetration and DAG binding of the C1a domain (14Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), lower Ca2+ and PS requirements for D55A activation suggest that this mutant might have higher intrinsic activity to penetrate the membrane and bind DAG (see the monolayer penetration data below). This, in turn, implies that Asp55 might be involved in the specific tethering of C1a domain, which is relieved upon Ca2+-dependent binding to PS-containing membranes. The observed properties of D55A were not due to stronger nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the C1a domain and the anionic membrane caused by the removal of negative charge on the C1a domain, because D55K behaved essentially the same as D55A. On the basis of simple electrostatic effect, the former would have higher affinity and activity than the latter. To further test the notion that D55A exists in a more or less preactivated conformation, we measured the activity of wild type, D55A, and D116A in the presence of POPC/POPG/DAG (99-x:x:1) vesicles and 0.1 mm EGTA, which represents a highly nonproductive condition for PKC activation. As shown in Fig. 9, wild type and D116A exhibited extremely low PKC activity with POPG composition up to 80 mol % under these circumstances. In sharp contrast, D55A showed considerable residual activity: D55A was >10 times more active than wild type in a wide range of POPG concentration (i.e. 40–80 mol %). These data renders more credence to the notion that Asp55 is involved in the tethering of C1a domain, which keeps PKC-α in an inactive conformation.Figure 8Dependence of enzyme activity of PKC -α and the C1 domain aspartate mutants on calcium concentration. Wild type (○), D55A (Δ), and D116A (■) (all 12 nm) were incubated with 0.1 mmPOPC/POPS/DOG (69:30:1) vesicles in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, histone III-SS (400 μg/ml), and varying concentrations of Ca2+.

Following stimulation with microbial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 monocytes secrete and/or express several inflammatory factors such as TNFα, IL-12, IL-1, IL-6, nitric oxide, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, chemokines such as IL-8, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), macrophage chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α/β, the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, and the stimulatory complex for T cells, i.e. B7 and MHC class II molecules. The pleiotropic transcription factor NF-κB plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of all these genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). NF-κB occurs in both homo- and heterodimeric forms. The most common transcriptionally active form is a p50/p65 heterodimer (reviewed in Ref. 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is localized in the cytosol bound to inhibitor proteins, collectively termed IκB. Stimulation results in IκB phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteosomal degradation, followed by the rapid translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it binds to specific κB elements within promoters (1Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar,2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the transactivating activity of NF-κB requires DNA binding and interaction with coactivators that bridge various transcriptional activators and components of the basal transcriptional machinery. The CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear coactivator present in limiting amounts (reviewed in Ref. 3Golman P.S. Tran V.K. Goldman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar). A diverse and increasing number of transcription factors and some elements of the basal transcriptional machinery are able to form stable physical complexes with and respond to CBP (reviewed in Refs. 4Janknecht R.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). CBP functions as an integrator linking various transcription factors to the basal transcriptional apparatus, by binding to the basal transcription factor TFIIB, which in turn contacts the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) of the TFIID complex in the basal apparatus (6Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 7Lee J.-S. See R.H.

In fact, we have previously demonstrated that VIP and PACAP inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding to several promoters in both murine macrophages and T cells (18Delgado M.

However, the effect of VIP and PACAP on NF-κB activation in human monocytes has not been investigated to date. In addition, although we showed that VIP and PACAP inhibit NF-κB DNA binding, a direct effect on NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity has not yet been addressed. Furthermore, we also asked whether VIP and PACAP could regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity through the regulation of coactivators. Our data show that VIP and PACAP decrease NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity in the LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line THP-1. This effect is exerted at multiple levels. The neuropeptides inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding by inhibiting the IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated IκB phosphorylation/degradation. In addition, VIP and PACAP selectively inhibit the interaction of p65 with CBP, while increasing interactions between CBP and CREB. Furthermore, by inhibiting the LPS-induced MEKK1/MEK3/MEK6/p38 MAPK pathway, the two neuropeptides inhibit TBP activation and its subsequent DNA binding and interaction with p65. The differential involvement of specific VIP/PACAP receptors and intracellular pathways was also addressed. The specific receptor VPAC1 mediates the effects of VIP/PACAP on p65 nuclear translocation, formation of p65·CBP complexes and TBP activation and formation of p65·TBP complexes. However, whereas a cAMP-independent pathway is primarily responsible for the effects on p65 translocation, the cAMP/PKA pathway mediates the effects on the availability and/or activation of the coactivators CBP and TBP.

THP-1, a human leukemic monocytic cell line, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS (0.5 μg/ml) or TNFα (20 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of VIP or PACAP-(38) (10−8m unless mentioned otherwise). NF-κB-dependent gene expression was evaluated using a luciferase reporter gene driven by four tandem copies of the κ enhancer (κB4) in a pUC vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). CRE-dependent gene expression was evaluated using a luciferase reporter gene (CLONTECH). The plasmid pRc/RSV-p65 containing the entire cDNA of p65 was kindly provided Drs. G. J. Nabel and J. Stein through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The expression plasmid, pRc/RSV-mCBP.HA.RK containing the full-length mouse CBP cDNA with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (6Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. R. Goodman. IκB degradation was assayed by transiently transfecting an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged IκB signaling probe (CLONTECH) followed by flow cytometry analysis following the manufacturer's recommendations. Empty vectors pRc/RSV and pUC-18 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to maintain a constant total DNA concentration in each experiment. To assess variations in transfection efficiencies, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of the control plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that expresses the lacZ gene. Levels of β-galactosidase were determined using the Galacto-Light assay system (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) and exhibited <15% variation between samples. THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a total of 10–30 μg of plasmid DNA using DEAE-dextran. Forty eight hours later, the cells were stimulated with LPS (500 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of VIP or PACAP, and 6 h later luciferase assays were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Luciferase activity, expressed in arbitrary light units, was corrected for protein concentration or normalized to coexpressed β-galactosidase levels. Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard methods. The probe for human TNFα was generated by RT-PCR as described previously using the following primers: TNFα, 5′-GTTCCTCAGCCTCTTCTCCT-3′ and 5′-ATCTATCTGGGAGGGGTCTT-3′ (28De Saint-Vis B. Fugier-Vivier I. Massacrier C. Gaillard C. Vandervliet B. Ait-Yahir S. Banchereau J. Liu Y.J. Lebecque S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1666-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Signal quantitation was performed in a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the mini-extraction procedure of Schreiber et al. (29Schreiber E. Metthias P. Muller M.M. Shaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6420-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (50 ng) corresponding to the human consensus NF-κB site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGATTTTCCCAGGC-3′, Promega), TFIID (TBP) (5′-GCAGAGCATATAAAA TGAGGTAGGA-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the consensus CRE motif (5′-AGAGATT GCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were end-labeled with [γ-32P[ATP. For EMSAs with THP-1 nuclear extracts, 20,000–50,000 cpm of double-stranded oligonucleotides, corresponding to ∼0.5 ng, were used. The reaction mixtures (15 μl) were set up containing 0.5–1 ng of DNA probe, 5 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and binding buffer (50 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min before adding the probe, followed by another 20 min at room temperature. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. In competition and antibody supershift experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with specific antibodies (1 μg) or competing cold oligonucleotides (50-fold excess) before the addition of the labeled probe. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates, cytoplasmic fraction, or nuclear extract (see above) containing 20–30 μg of protein were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE (12.5%). After electrophoresis and electroblotting the membranes were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphorylated MEK3 and MEK6 were detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-MEK3 or anti-MEK6 Abs, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an Ab against phosphorylated MEK3/6. Interaction of CBP or TBP with p65 and/or CREB was assessed by immunoprecipitation of cell extracts (200 μg) with 1–2 μg of anti-p65 or anti-CREB antibodies, followed by treatment with 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). After extensive washing and boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer, the complexes were subjected to Western blotting with anti-CBP or anti-TBP antibodies. For transient transfections with the CBP vector, we used an anti-hemagglutinin Ab (anti-HA; 12CA5 murine monoclonal antibody against influenza HA peptide; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to detect transfected HA-tagged CBP. After detection with an appropriate secondary antibody-conjugated peroxidase, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously with some modifications (30Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenco A. Bennet B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Endogenous IKKα and p38 MAPK were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (150–250 μg/sample) by incubation with 0.5 μg of anti-IKKα or anti-p38 MAPK antibodies, for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were harvested with protein A/G-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer with 15 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), containing 5 μg of recombinant IκBα (for IKKα) or TBP (for p38 MAPK). The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Following boiling for 5 min, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (9%), electroblotting, and autoradiography. A double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the proximal region of the human TNFα promoter (−661 to −1), generated from THP-1 genomic DNA by PCR (primers used, 5′-TCAGAATGAAA GAAGAGGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGGTGTGCCAACAACT-3′) and biotinylated in our molecular biology facility, was coupled to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The TNFα promoter-coupled matrix (250 μg) was incubated with 25 μl of THP-1 nuclear extract in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 μg/ml poly(dI)·poly(dC), and 5% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature while mixing every 5 min to keep the Dynabeads in suspension. The flow-through fractions were collected; the Dynabeads were washed four times with binding buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI)·poly(dC), and the bound proteins were solubilized in sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membranes were probed with antibodies against p65, p50, CREB, c-Jun, TBP, HMG-I(Y), CBP, or NF-Y at dilutions ranging from 1:2,500 to 1:10,000 followed by chemiluminescent detection. Confluent monolayers of THP-1 cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were labeled with 200 mCi of 32PO4/ml (400–800 mCi/ml; Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) in phosphate-free RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with LPS in the absence or presence of VIP or PACAP for 1 h, washed, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmNa3PO4 (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm okadaic acid, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin), and sonicated. The p65 or TFIID (TBP) were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-p65 or anti-TFIID (TBP) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and bound to Gammabind (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2–12 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed twice with high salt, followed by electrophoresis on 8–10% SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiography. TNFα levels in culture supernatants were determined using a human-specific sandwich ELISA (PharMingen) following the manufacturer's instructions. THP-1 cells were cultured at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and stimulated with LPS (0.5 μg/ml) for up to 12 h. Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and cDNA was amplified with specific primers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (Stratagene) were used as control. The primers for VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 receptors have been described before (25Delgado M. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kan Y. Gozes I. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. Gomariz R.P. Ganea D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31427-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that VIP and PACAP inhibit TNFα production in murine peritoneal macrophages and the macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 (19Delgado M. Pozo D. Martinez C. Leceta J. Calvo J.R. Ganea D. Gomariz R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2358-2367PubMed Google Scholar, 25Delgado M. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kan Y. Gozes I. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. Gomariz R.P. Ganea D. J. Biol.

To investigate the effects of VIP/PACAP on human monocytes, THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of VIP or PACAP, and the amounts of secreted TNFα were determined by ELISA. VIP and PACAP inhibit TNFα production in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum effect in the concentration range of 10−8–10−6m (Fig. 1 A). Both neuropeptides inhibit in a time-dependent manner TNFα steady-state mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). MG132, a newly described NF-κB inhibitor, shows a similar inhibitory effect on TNFα mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Since LPS up-regulates TNFα transcription through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism (31Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we determined whether VIP and PACAP inhibit NF-κB transcriptional activity. THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with the (κB)4-luciferase reporter plasmid, containing four copies of the NF-κB consensus site. Forty eight hours later, the cells were stimulated with LPS or TNFα in either the presence or absence of VIP or PACAP and were assayed for NF-κB-dependent transcription 5 h later. Both LPS and TNFα led to an ∼18-fold increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 A). Treatment with VIP or PACAP strongly inhibits LPS- or TNFα-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 2 A). The inhibitory effect is dose-dependent (Fig. 2 B). To assess whether VIP and PACAP inhibit NF-κB DNA binding, EMSAs were performed. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with LPS led to strong NF-κB binding showing a maximum increase at 2 h after stimulation, and VIP and PACAP inhibit binding at all time points (Fig.3 A). The binding specificity was ascertained by the displacement with 50-fold excess of unlabeled homologous (NF-κB) but not nonhomologous oligonucleotide (CRE) (Fig.3 A). Antibody supershift experiments indicate the presence of both p50 and p65, with no supershift for an irrelevant Ab (anti-CREB) (Fig. 3 A). The primary level of control for NF-κB is mediated through its interaction with the inhibitor IκB. VIP and PACAP could inhibit NF-κB activity by blocking LPS-induced IκB degradation and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation. We measured the levels of p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus. As expected, p65 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells, and LPS induced a decrease in the level of cytoplasmic p65, and an increase in nuclear p65 levels (Fig. 3 B). VIP and PACAP abolished the LPS-induced change in p65 levels (Fig. 3 B), which indicates an inhibition of p65 nuclear translocation. Similar levels of p50 indicate equal protein loading. To determine whether VIP/PACAP interfere with the LPS-induced degradation of IκB, we examined cytoplasmic IκBα levels. As expected, we observed a time-dependent IκBα degradation, paralleled by an increase in IκBα phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 3 C). VIP and PACAP block the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα (Fig.3 C). In addition, we determined the effect of VIP and PACAP on IκB degradation by transiently transfecting an EGFP-tagged IκB construct in THP-1 cells and assaying the percentage of fluorescent IκB+ cells at different time points by flow cytometry. LPS led to a rapid decrease in IκB+ cells, whereas VIP significantly increased IκB half-life in LPS-treated cells (Fig.3 C, right panel). Since the LPS activation of NF-κB requires IKK-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα (1Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar), we determined if VIP and PACAP inhibit IKK activity by using an in vitro kinase assay. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with LPS resulted in a time-dependent increase in IKKα activity, which was inhibited by VIP and PACAP (Fig. 3 D). No differences in IKKα expression were observed (Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrate that VIP and PACAP inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation and subsequent DNA binding in LPS-stimulated cells by blocking the IKK-mediated IκB phosphorylation/degradation. If the inhibitory effect of VIP and PACAP on NF-κB transcriptional activity is mediated entirely through the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation, overexpression of p65 should reverse this effect. Therefore, THP-1 cells were transiently cotransfected with the (κB)4-luciferase reporter plasmid and increasing concentrations of a vector expressing p65. Increasing concentrations of p65 only partially reversed the inhibitory effect of VIP and PACAP, suggesting that the neuropeptides affect more than NF-κB nuclear translocation. Several studies have demonstrated that p65 is phosphorylated during in vivo NF-κB activation, leading to increased transcriptional activity (10Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 33Naumann M. Schidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of VIP and PACAP on the phosphorylation of transiently transfected p65. VIP and PACAP had no effect on LPS-induced p65 phosphorylation (Fig.4, upper panel). Similar levels of p65 were detected by Western blotting in THP-1 cells transfected with p65 in the presence or absence of LPS, VIP, or PACAP (Fig. 4, lower panel). In addition to DNA binding, the interaction of p65 with CBP is essential for optimal NF-κB transcriptional activity (9Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 2927-2932Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In addition to p65, CBP interacts with other factors including CREB (6Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C.

Here we characterize a novel actin binding protein, Ciboulot (Cib), which plays a major role in axonal growth during Drosophila brain metamorphosis. Loss of Cib function leads to axonal growth defects in the central brain, while overexpression of the gene during development leads to overgrown projections. The Cib protein displays strong sequence similarity to β-thymosins but has biochemical properties like profilin: the Cib-actin complex participates in actin filament assembly exclusively at the barbed end, and Cib enhances actin-based motility in vitro. Genetic experiments show that Cib and the Drosophila profilin protein Chickadee (Chic) cooperate in central brain metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2135950191,"The forte of catalytic antibodies has resided in the control of the ground-state reaction coordinate. A principle and method are now described in which antibodies can direct the outcome of photophysical and photochemical events that take place on excited-state potential energy surfaces. The key component is a chemically reactive optical sensor that provides a direct report of the dynamic interplay between protein and ligand at the active site. To illustrate the concept, we used a trans -stilbene hapten to elicit a panel of monoclonal antibodies that displayed a range of fluorescent spectral behavior when bound to a trans -stilbene substrate. Several antibodies yielded a blue fluorescence indicative of an excited-state complex or “exciplex” between trans -stilbene and the antibody. The antibodies controlled the isomerization coordinate of trans -stilbene and dynamically coupled this manifold with an active-site residue. A step was taken toward the use of antibody-based photochemical sensors for diagnostic and clinical applications."

SYT sequences constitute the N-terminal segment of a fusion oncogene product, SYT-SSX, routinely detected in synovial sarcoma, an aggressive human tumor. SYT/p300 complex formation promotes cell adhesion to a fibronectin matrix, as reflected by compromise of this process in cells expressing SYT dl mutants that retain p300 binding activity and in the primary fibroblasts of p300 but not CBP heterozygous null mice. The mechanism linking the action of SYT/p300 complexes to adhesion function is, at least in part, transcription activation-independent and results in proper activation of beta1 integrin, a major adhesion receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2007559737,"MAPK pathways play important roles in regulating the key cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. There are multiple MAPK pathways, which are subject to different regulatory cues. It is important that these pathways maintain specificity in signaling to elicit the activation of a specific program of gene expression. MAPK-docking domains in several transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in determining the specificity and efficiency of their phosphorylation by MAPKs. Here we investigate the mechanisms by which MAPKs are targeted to the ETS domain transcription factor SAP-1. We demonstrate that SAP-1 contains two different domains that are required for its efficient phosphorylation in vitro and activation in vivoby ERK2 and a subset of p38 MAPKs. The D-domain is closely related to other MAPK-docking domains, but exhibits a novel specificity and serves to promote selective targeting of ERK2, p38α, and p38β2to SAP-1. A second important region, the F XF motif, also plays an important role in directing MAPKs to phosphorylate SAP-1. The F XF motif promotes targeting by ERK2 and, to a lesser extent, p38α, but not p38β2. Our data therefore demonstrate that a modular system of motifs is responsible for directing specific MAPK subtypes to SAP-1, but also point to important distinctions in the mechanism of action of the D-domain and F XF motif.

Within these scaffolds, defined protein-protein interactions play key roles in specifying the interaction of individual components. Similarly, in the nucleus, the interactions of the kinases with their substrates are regulated by specific docking sites on transcription factors (14Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Docking domains do, however, exist in other proteins such as MEF2A and MEF2C, which specify targeting by p38 MAPKs (19Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The ETS domain transcription factor SAP-1 belongs to the ternary complex subfamily and is highly related to Elk-1 (reviewed in Ref. 22Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Mo Y. Sharrocks A.D. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 3: 355-371Google Scholar). SAP-1 contains a domain that exhibits strong sequence similarity to the Elk-1 D-domain. However, it is not known whether this domain functions in an analogous manner as a MAPK-docking domain. SAP-1 has been shown to be able to act as a target of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK families (23Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216PubMed Google Scholar, 24Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25Janknecht R. Hunter T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4219-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A direct comparison of Elk-1 and SAP-1 demonstrated that SAP-1 is preferentially phosphorylated by p38α (25Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that specificity determinants exist. As the Elk-1 docking domain does not appear to target p38 MAPKs (20Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), this difference in kinase selectivity might be determined by the SAP-1 D-domain. More recently, a second type of MAPK-binding site was identified conforming to the consensus sequence F XF, which plays an important role in ERK-mediated substrate phosphorylation (27Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 28MacKenzie S.J. Baillie G.S. McPhee I. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16609-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This motif is conserved between SAP-1 and Elk-1 and might also play a role in determining the proficiency of SAP-1 as a MAPK substrate. To further probe the mechanisms that establish specificity in MAPK signaling, we have analyzed the specificity determinants in SAP-1 that control its proficiency as a MAPK substrate. We demonstrate that the D-domain of SAP-1 acts as a classical docking domain that recruits ERK2 and a subset of p38 MAPKs. This domain constitutes part of a MAPK recognition module that also contains an F XF motif. This second binding motif promotes SAP-1 phosphorylation by both the ERK and p38α MAPKs. Our data therefore demonstrate that a complex modular system, consisting of the D-domain and F XF motif, directs specific MAPK subtypes to SAP-1. The following plasmids were constructed for expressing MBP and GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. pAS777 (encoding MBP-SAP-1ΔD, SAP-1 amino acids 339–431), pAS785 (encoding MBP-SAP-1, SAP-1 amino acids 303–431), pAS1056 (encoding MBP-Elk-1, Elk-1 amino acids 310–428), and pAS1057 (encoding MBP-Elk-1ΔD, Elk-1 amino acids 330–428) were constructed by inserting a BamHI-HindIII-cleaved polymerase chain reaction-derived fragment into the same sites of pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). pAS1080 (encoding MBP-SAP-1-mF) and pAS1081 (encoding MBP-SAP-1ΔD-mF) were derived from pAS785 and pAS777, respectively, with site-directed mutations Q399A/F400A. pAS1096 (encoding MBP-Elk-1-mF) and pAS1097 (encoding MBP-Elk-1ΔD-mF) were derived from pAS1056 and pAS1057, respectively, with site-directed mutations Q396A/F397A.

Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

The following plasmids were constructed for use in mammalian cell transfections. pG5E1b-luc contains five GAL4 DNA-binding sites cloned upstream of a minimal E1b promoter element and the firefly luciferase gene (29Seth A.

All plasmid constructs made by polymerase chain reaction were verified by automated dideoxy sequencing. The following procedure was used to isolate MBP fusion proteins from 50-ml cultures. Inoculation was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs Inc.). Cells were harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of column buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) including 200 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Then, the sample was sonicated (3 × 10-s bursts at 14 μ) and spun down at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing 400 μl of 50% reduced amylose resin beads (New England Biolabs Inc.). The sample was gently mixed for 30 min at 4 °C and then pelleted briefly at 1000 × g. The pelleted beads were washed three times with 10 ml of column buffer and resuspended in an equal amount of column buffer (200 μl). The MBP fusion protein was eluted by adding 10 mm maltose (Sigma) to the purified protein, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C and removal of the beads by brief centrifugation at 1000 × g. This process was repeated to elute more protein, and the samples were pooled with 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The concentrations of proteins were determined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue (Sigma) and by comparison with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purification of GST fusion proteins was performed as described previously (21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained and transfection experiments were carried out using Superfect reagent as described previously (21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Active p38 MAPKs were isolated from COS-7 cells, cotransfected with vectors encoding the constitutively active form of MKK6 (MKK6(E)) and epitope-tagged p38 kinases as described previously (19Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, a luciferase reporter construct controlled by a GAL4-driven promoter (pG5E1b-luc) was cotransfected with cytomegalovirus promoter-driven vectors encoding various GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins as described previously (21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The activities of the GAL4 fusion proteins were measured in cotransfection assays in COS-7 cells using 1 μg of the reporter plasmid pG5E1b-luc and, where indicated, 250 ng of vectors encoding MAPK and constitutively activated MAPK. Luciferase assays were carried using the Tropix dual light system, and transfection efficiencies were monitored as described previously (19Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) Recombinant active p38α, p38β2, p38γ, and p38δ were prepared from transfected COS-7 cells as described above. Recombinant active ERK2 was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. Reactions were performed as described previously (21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of substrate proteins was examined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS1500 phosphorimager and Tina Version 2.08e software). Peptide competition assays were performed essentially as described previously (21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, no preincubation of the peptides with the kinases was performed. Protein kinase assays and kinase binding assays were carried out as described previously (21Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Figures were generated electronically using Picture Publisher (Micrografix) or Adobe Photoshop Version 5.5 and Powerpoint Version 7.0 (Microsoft) software. Data from Western blots are computer-generated images (FluorS Max and Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Phosphorimager data from kinase assays were quantified using either Tina Version 2.08e software or Quantity One. SAP-1 is highly related to Elk-1 and exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity within the conserved D-domain (see Fig.4 A). We therefore tested whether the D-domain of SAP-1 plays a role in MAPK targeting as observed in Elk-1 and whether any specificity in targeting occurs. Initially, we constructed fusion proteins consisting of the MBP fused to either the entire C terminus of SAP-1 (MBP-SAP-1) or the same region lacking the D-domain (MBP-SAP-1ΔD) (Fig.1 A). These fusion proteins were subsequently tested as in vitro substrates for ERK and p38 MAPKs (Fig. 1 B), and the data were quantified (Fig.1 C). p38δ could efficiently phosphorylate SAP-1 with similar kinetics, irrespective of the presence of the D-domain. In contrast, the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation by ERK2, p38β2, and, to a lesser extent, p38α, was reduced upon deletion of the D-domain. Phosphorylation of SAP-1 by p38γ was inefficient and occurred independently of the presence of the D-domain (data not shown). These data therefore demonstrate that the SAP-1 D-domain plays an important role in determining its proficiency as an ERK2, p38α, and p38β2 substrate, but that it does not play a major role in determining its efficiency of phosphorylation by p38δ in vitro. One consequence of targeting MAPKs to substrates is thought to be the promotion of their specificity of action in vivo. To establish whether the selective targeting of p38α and p38β2 isoforms to SAP-1 in vitro is reflected by in vivo selectivity, we analyzed the activation of a GAL4-SAP-1 fusion protein (Fig.2 A) by different p38 isoforms in vivo. p38β2 (93-fold) and, to a lesser extent, p38α (13-fold) efficiently activated SAP-1, whereas in comparison, p38γ (0.4-fold) and p38δ (1.8-fold) were poor activators (Fig. 2 B). We also compared the activation of SAP-1 by the p38β2 and ERK2 pathways (Fig.2 C). Similar levels of activation of SAP-1 were obtained, although absolute comparisons are difficult, as differences in the activities of the constitutively active upstream kinases cannot be controlled. However, a good correlation exists between the importance of the D-domain in in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 1) of SAP-1 and the degree of activation in vivo by ERK2 and distinct p38 subfamily members. Peptide competition assays were used to probe the potential roles of short protein sequences as binding sites for protein kinases. The principle behind these assays is that peptides that correspond to docking motifs will competitively bind to the MAPKs and thereby block interactions with docking sites on substrates and hence reduce the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation by the kinase (e.g. Ref. 20Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the ability of a peptide corresponding to the SAP-1 D-domain (SAPD) (Fig. 3 A) to inhibit phosphorylation of SAP-1 by p38 MAPKs. In comparison, we analyzed a peptide corresponding to a known p38-binding motif in MEF2A and a mutant version of this peptide that can no longer inhibit p38-mediated phosphorylation (MEFD and MEFmD, respectively) (Fig.3 A) (19Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of the SAPD peptide led to a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of SAP-1 by p38α and p38β2, but had no effect on p38δ (Fig.3 B, lanes 2–4). Similarly, the MEFD peptide selectively inhibited SAP-1 phosphorylation by p38α and p38β2 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–7), whereas a mutant form of this peptide (MEFmD) did not inhibit phosphorylation by these kinases (lanes 8–10). Thus, like the docking site in MEF2, the SAP-1 D-domain acts specifically to bind to p38α and p38β2 MAPK isoforms. As SAP-1 can also be phosphorylated by ERK MAPK, we tested whether the SAPD peptide acts as an inhibitor of ERK-mediated phosphorylation. The SAPD peptide was compared with the ElkD peptide, which was derived from the same region of Elk-1 and is a known ERK inhibitor (Fig.4 A) (20Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of the SAPD peptide resulted in a decrease in the ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate SAP-1 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, the ElkD peptide, but not a mutant version (ElkmD), led to reduced SAP-1 phosphorylation by ERK2 (Fig.4 B, lanes 4–7). These results suggest that the SAP-1 D-domain acts as an ERK2-binding motif. To verify this conclusion, we carried out kinase binding assays with either MBP-SAP-1 or MBP-Elk-1 fusion protein bound to agarose beads. Both MBP-SAP-1 and MBP-Elk-1 were able to retain ERK2 on the beads (Fig. 4 C,lanes 1 and 3). However, in contrast, ERK2 binding was significantly decreased upon deletion of the D-domain of SAP-1 or Elk-1 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4). Collectively, these data demonstrate that, in addition to its role in binding to p38α and p38β2 MAPKs, the SAP-1 D-domain also recruits ERK MAPK. Recently, a novel motif was identified that is required for efficient substrate phosphorylation by MAPKs (27Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This motif, which we have termed the F XF motif, is also functionally conserved in Elk-1 and at the sequence level (FQFP) in SAP-1. We therefore investigated whether the F XF motif also plays a role in mediating MAPK phosphorylation of SAP-1 in vitro and activation in vivo in comparison with the same motif in Elk-1. First, we created a series of GAL4 and MBP fusion proteins containing either the intact C termini of Elk-1 and SAP-1 or mutant forms either lacking the D-domain or containing point mutations in the F XF motif (Fig.5 A). These proteins were then tested for their proficiency as in vitro substrates for ERK2 (Fig. 5 B) and for activation by the ERK pathway in vivo (Fig. 5 C). In Elk-1, deletion of the D-domain or mutation of the F XF motif led to a decrease in phosphorylation by ERK2 in vitro(Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, the simultaneous disruption of both motifs led to a further drop in ERK2-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B,lane 4). Similarly, individually deleting the D-domain and F XF motif of SAP-1 led to decreases in in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6 and 7), and their simultaneous deletion led to a further drop in phosphorylation by ERK2 (lane 8). Transcriptional activation in vivo following activation of the ERK pathway was monitored for each of the mutant proteins. In both Elk-1 and SAP-1, deletion of the D-domain or F XF motif led to a substantial drop in activation by the ERK pathway, and simultaneous disruption of these two motifs resulted in a further reduction (Fig. 5 C, right panel, blackand white bars, respectively). These results essentially mirror the in vitro situation (Fig. 5 C, compare with left panel) and demonstrate the importance of the D-domain and F XF motif in ERK2 targeting to SAP-1 in vivo. Previously, the F XF motif was concluded to be specifically involved in targeting ERK MAPKs to substrates (27Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). However, we tested whether the F XF motif is also important in determining the proficiency of SAP-1 as a p38 substrate in vitro and in vivo. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that, whereas deletion of the D-domain led to a large decrease in SAP-1 phosphorylation by p38α and p38β2, mutation of the F XF motif alone had either a small or virtually no effect on its phosphorylation in vitro by p38α and p38β2, respectively (Fig.6 B). Simultaneous disruption of the D-domain and F XF motif led to a further decrease in the proficiency of SAP-1 as a p38α substrate (Fig.6 B, lane 4). In contrast, phosphorylation of SAP-1 by p38δ was barely affected by disruption of these two regions. These data therefore demonstrate that, in vitro, the F XF motif of SAP-1 plays a selective role in determining its phosphorylation by the p38α isoform, although the D-domain appears to be more important. We also analyzed the response of the mutant SAP-1 fusion protein to activation by the p38 MAPK pathways in vivo (Fig.6 C). Deletion of the D-domain led to a large decrease in p38α- and p38β2-mediated transactivation. This is consistent with the decreases in in vitro phosphorylation observed with this mutant protein (Figs. 1 B and6 B). Mutation of the F XF motif also led to a large decrease in p38α-mediated transactivation, but barely affected p38β2-mediated transactivation (Fig. 6 C). Simultaneous disruption of the D-domain and F XF motif in GAL4-SAP-1ΔD-mF led to a further decrease in p38α-mediated transactivation, but did not lead to any further effects on p38β2-mediated transactivation compared with deletion of the D-domain alone (Fig. 6 C). Again, these in vivo effects are fully consistent with the in vitrophosphorylation data (Fig. 6 B). Finally, as a control, we tested the response of the SAP-1 derivatives to activation by p38δ in vivo, as neither motif appears to be important for targeting of this kinase in vitro (Fig. 6 B). As predicted from this in vitro data, neither deletion of the D-domain nor mutation of the F XF motif, either individually or in combination, led to a significant decrease in p38δ-mediated transactivation (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, the activity of the fusion proteins was actually increased in the absence of the D-domain (see “Discussion”). The D-domain of SAP-1 ther"

We undertook this study to determine whether epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment could produce a signaling cascade resulting in phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHR in a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. After establishing ErbB1, cbl, PI3 kinase and Akt were activated in EGF treated MDA-MB-231, we determined by immunoblot with FKHR antiserum that the electrophoretic mobility of FKHR was retarded after EGF treatment. This mobility retardation was reversible by treatment with alkaline phosphatase, and immunoblot with phospho-Ser256 FKHR antibody further confirmed phosphorylation on an Akt consensus site after EGF treatment. EGF stimulated FKHR phosphorylation was blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, and the ErbB1 inhibitor AG1478. FKHR immunoblotting after purification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins showed that EGF induced a simultaneous increase of FKHR in the cytoplasm and decrease in the nucleus. This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Treatment of cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3 kinase or ErbB1 blocked this effect. Thus, these results demonstrate the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of FKHR after EGF treatment by a PI3 kinase dependent mechanism, and represent the first report of growth factor regulation of endogenous FKHR localization."

This interaction may allow for translational control by the COP9 signalosome. eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline polyvinylidene difluoride glutathione S-transferase expressed sequence tag nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole green fluorescent protein Light is the major environmental signal regulating plant development. Its effect on plant development is dramatically seen in seedlings of dicotyledonous plants such as Arabidopsis. Dark-grown seedlings, which undergo skotomorphogenesis, differ vastly from light-grown seedlings, which go through photomorphogenesis, both at the morphological and molecular levels. Illumination of dark-grown seedlings induces photomorphogenesis. The transition from skotomorphogenic growth to photomorphogenic growth involves changes in transcription, translation (1Dickey L.F. Petracek M.E. Nguyen T.T. Hansen E.R. Thompson W.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and protein modifications such as ubiquitination and protein degradation (2Vierstra R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Multisubunit protein complexes play central roles in the regulation of all three processes and thus in the light-controlled regulation of plant development. The COP9 signalosome (previously referred to as the COP9 complex (30Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar)) is a recently discovered protein complex of at least eight subunits (renamed CSN1–CSN8 (3Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 4Deng X.W.

Chamovitz D.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome has been found primarily in the nucleus and has been implicated in regulating protein kinase pathways (6Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A.R. Flukinger-Staub S. Koo D. Chang C.R.

Four Arabidopsis mutants that lack the COP9 signalosome (cop9, fus6, fus5, and cop8) exhibit a constitutivephotomorphogenic (cop) phenotype, both at the morphological and molecular levels, in the absence of light. Therefore, the COP9 signalosome acts as negative regulator of photomorphogenic development in the dark. However, as in other eukaryotes, the biochemical activity of the COP9 signalosome remains to be elucidated. The pleiotropic nature of the mutants implies that the COP9 signalosome acts at the nexus between multiple photoreceptors and a variety of downstream regulatory events controlling specific aspects of cellular differentiation, presumably via transcription, translation, and/or post-translational modification. However, given that all mutations known to disrupt the COP9 signalosome are seedling-lethal and begin to show defects during late embryogenesis, i.e. before the decision between the photomorphogenic and skotomorphogenic pathways is made, it is likely that the COP9 signalosome is involved in more than just the dark repression of photomorphogenesis (5Karniol B. Chamovitz D.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Wei N. Tsuge T. Serino G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Matsui M. Deng X.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome is similar to two other multisubunit protein complexes, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3)1 and the regulatory lid of the 19 S component of the proteasome (9Wei N. Tsuge T. Serino G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Matsui M. Deng X.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Multiple subunits of all three complexes share a common motif, termed the proteasome-COP9 signalosome-initiation factor 3 (11Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 204-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or proteasome-Int6-Nip1-Trip15 (12Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) domain. The conservation between the COP9 signalosome and proteasome lid is especially striking, where all eight subunits of each complex have a corresponding similar protein (∼20% amino acid identity) in the other complex. Therefore, the three complexes may share an overall architecture and a common evolutionary ancestor. The role of eIF3 includes stabilizing the ternary complex between eIF2, GTP, and tRNAiMet and promoting mRNA binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (13Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B.

Its subunit composition has been a matter of debate, with the exact composition often being dependent on the method of purification. Mammalian eIF3 now appears to contain 11 subunits as follows: p170, p116 (PRT1), p110, p66, p48 (INT-6), p47 (mov34), p44, p40, p36, p35, and p25, whose SDS-PAGE patterns fit reasonably well with the wheat eIF3 pattern (15Asano K.

Recently, it has been reported that plant eIF3 closely resembles the subunit composition of mammalian eIF3 having 10 out of 11 subunits in common and also contains a novel subunit not present in either mammals or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Burks, E. A., Bezerra, P. P., Le, H., Gallie, D. R., and Browning, K. S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in pressGoogle Scholar). The S. cerevisiae eIF3 core complex is smaller and consists of only five subunits that are homologous to human, p170, p116, p110, p44, and p36 (22Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.P. Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), although other purifications have identified additional proteins, which may bind the core complex with lower affinities (23Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Donahue T.F. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2307-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A unified eIF3 nomenclature has recently been proposed, with the largest subunit as eIF3a and the smallest eIF3k (21Burks, E. A., Bezerra, P. P., Le, H., Gallie, D. R., and Browning, K. S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, two of the eIF3 subunits have been independently identified. The S. cerevisiae subunit corresponding to human eIF3c (p110) was originally isolated in a screen for mutants with defects in nuclear targeting (26Gu Z. Moerschell R.P. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the mammalian eIF3e (p48) subunit, also known as INT-6, was found in nuclear bodies and has been implicated in carcinogenesis (27Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggested interactions between the COP9 signalosome, the regulatory 19 S proteasome subcomplex, and eIF3. The CSN1 subunit of the Arabidopsis COP9 signalosome interacts with the AtS9 subunit of the proteasome lid in a yeast two-hybrid assay (28Kwok S.F. Staub J.M. Deng X.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Analysis of proteins that copurify with the COP9 signalosome from cauliflower identified another component of the proteasome, p43/RPN7, and two putative subunits of eIF3, eIF3c (p105) and eIF3e (p48). We have previously shown that Arabidopsis eIF3c is highly conserved with the human eIF3c subunit and that eIF3c associates in yeast with the COP9 signalosome components CSN1 and CSN8, although probably not as a core component of the COP9 signalosome (29Karniol B. Yahalom T. Kwok S. Tsuge T. Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Chamovitz D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To clarify the relationship between the COP9 signalosome and eIF3, we have now analyzed the eIF3e protein that copurifies with the COP9 signalosome. We show that eIF3e is likely the Arabidopsis ortholog of the human eIF3e. Our data indicate that eIF3e and eIF3c are subunits of Arabidopsis eIF3 that also interact with components of the Arabidopsis COP9 signalosome. Wild type plants are in the Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia background. The cop9-1 mutant is in the Wassilewskija background (30Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Plant germination and growth conditions in darkness and white light were as described previously (31McNellis T.W. von Arnim A.G. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1391-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Day/night cycle conditions consisted of 16 h of white light at 75 μmol m−2s−1 and 8 h of darkness. Brassica oleracea (cauliflower) was purchased at the supermarket. Internal peptide sequences of the cauliflower COP9 signalosome-associated protein eIF3e were described previously (29Karniol B. Yahalom T. Kwok S. Tsuge T. Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Chamovitz D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence data from four peptides, a cDNA (EST number 142E10T7) for eIF3e was identified through the Arabidopsis genome sequencing effort, sequenced on both strands, and deposited under GenBankTM accession number AF255679. A search of the Arabidopsis data base with the human eIF3b identified an expressed sequence tag (EST clone 195A21T7) of 578 base pairs. This EST was used as a probe in a screen of a λZAPII size-fractionated cDNA library from Arabidopsis (32Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). The library was screened as described for eIF3c (29Karniol B. Yahalom T. Kwok S. Tsuge T. Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Chamovitz D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phages from positive clones were excised in vivo according to standard procedure. The longest cDNA clone found was sequenced, and the sequence was confirmed through comparison with the genomic eIF3b sequence (accession number AC005405) and deposited under GenBankTM accession number AF255680. The complete coding sequence of eIF3e was cloned into the pET29b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and a pGEX-3C vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Because of poor solubility of the His6-tagged eIF3e, the protein was solubilized with SDS sample buffer and run on an SDS-PAGE gel. The fusion protein was cut from the gel and used to immunize rabbits (AniLab, Rehovot, Israel). For affinity purification of the antibodies, the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-eIF3e fusion was immobilized on an N-hydroxysuccinimide Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies bound to the GST-eIF3e protein were eluted with low pH buffer (2 m glycine, pH 2.5). The resulting affinity purified anti-eIF3e antibodies were neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The sequence encoding amino acids 58–538 of eIF3b was cloned into pGEX-4T1 and pET28a. GST-eIF3b fusion protein was over-produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and was used to immunize rabbits (AniLab, Rehovot, Israel). The His6-eIF3b was purified on a nickel column, and eIF3b antibodies were affinity-purified over HIS6-eIF3b coupled to an N-hydroxysuccinimide Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described above. Arabidopsis or cauliflower, as indicated, was ground in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was suspended in a phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EDTA with freshly added proteinase inhibitors including 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with 1:5000 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Bound antibody was detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies, nitro blue tetrazolium, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. The complete coding region of eIF3e was cloned into the EcoRI-NotI site of pJG4-5 with partial EcoRI digestion to make an in-frame fusion with the transcription activation domain. The complete coding sequence of eIF3b was cloned into the EcoRI site of pEG202 to make an in-frame fusion with LexA. CSN1, CSN7, CSN8, and eIF3c yeast constructs have been described previously (8Karniol B. Malec P. Chamovitz D.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Karniol B. Yahalom T. Kwok S. Tsuge T. Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Chamovitz D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transformed into yeast EGY48. Selection for interaction was as described (33Brent R. Finley Jr., R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase quantitation was done as described (29Karniol B. Yahalom T. Kwok S. Tsuge T. Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Chamovitz D.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Total homogenates were prepared as described above. The homogenate was spun in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 22,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). Approximately 100 μg of total soluble protein was fractionated at 4 °C through a Superose 6 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 10% glycerol, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected and concentrated by Strata Clean Resin Beads (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The protein standards for the gel fractionation were as follows: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). Total plant extract was cleared of aggregates by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 22,000 × g. 100 μg of total protein was incubated with antibodies in PBS buffer and 1% Tween for 4 h at 4 °C. Following incubation on an Orbiton rotator (Boekel Industries Inc.), the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 22,000 × g,and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes containing 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). The tubes were incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C. The tubes were spun at 22,000 ×g for 1 min, and protein A beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS). Proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted for antibody detection. For the pull-down assay with CSN7, constant amounts (140 μg) of total soluble proteins from E. coli expressing GST-eIF3e were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, with increasing amounts of total soluble proteins from E. coli expressing either His6-CSN7 or control empty pET28a vector (4 μg/μl each). Following incubation on a rotator, the tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 22,000 ×g, and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes containing 20 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Germany). The tubes were incubated for an additional hour. The tubes were spun at 22,000 ×g for 1 min. As the Ni-NTA agarose absorbed many nonspecific proteins, the Ni-NTA beads were washed 4 times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and once with buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For pull-down assay with eIF3c, constant amounts of total soluble protein (16 μg) from E. coli expressing His6-eIF3c were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, with increasing amounts of total soluble proteins from E. coli expressing either GST-eIF3e or control empty pEGX-3C vector (1 μg/μl each). Following incubation and centrifugation as above, the supernatant was transferred to new tubes containing 20 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for additional hour. The tubes were spun at 22,000 × g for 1 min and washed 5 times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Proteins were eluted from both Ni-NTA and glutathione beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted for antibody detection. The procedure for protoplast isolation and immunofluorescence assay was similar to a previously published procedure (34Matsui M. Stoop C.D. von Arnim A.G. Wei N. Deng X.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4239-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Root or leaf protoplasts were isolated from 8-day-old wild type or β-glucuronidase-transgenic seedlings. After fixation to microscope slides, affinity-purified primary antibodies against eIF3e, eIF3b, or CSN7 (FUS5) (8Karniol B. Malec P. Chamovitz D.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were applied at a dilution of 1:100. The anti-β-glucuronidase antibody (Molecular Probes) was used at 1:500 dilution. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody conjugated with fluorescein, which was used at a 1:200 dilution. Protoplasts were mounted with SlowFade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) containing 1 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For the transient assay, GFP fusion proteins were expressed from the GFP cloning vector pAVA319 (35von Arnim A. Deng X. Stacey M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in onion epidermal cells by using particle bombardment. The relative nuclear and cytoplasmic localization was determined by quantitative fluorescence measurement (35von Arnim A. Deng X. Stacey M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The location of the nucleus was determined under bright-field illumination. At least 15 cells were analyzed for each GFP fusion protein. To elucidate the composition of the COP9 signalosome, the complex was originally purified from cauliflower, and the peptides from individual proteins were microsequenced (29Karniol B. Yahalom T.

Based on amino acid sequence data from four cauliflower peptides, an Arabidopsis cDNA for p48 was identified. This cDNA has an open reading frame of 1326 base pairs that encodes 441 amino acids with a predicted mass of 51,808 Da and a pI of 5.92. The Arabidopsis protein is highly similar to cauliflower, with 68 of the 75 amino acids from the cauliflower peptides being identical to the Arabidopsis protein. The cDNA encodes a protein highly similar to the eIF3e subunit of mammalian eIF3 and its likely homologs (TableI). We therefore refer to this protein as Arabidopsis eIF3e. eIF3e is found on chromosome 3, BAC F2809. No protein similar to eIF3e was found in S. cerevisiae. Like mammalian eIF3e and other subunits of eIF3 and the COP9 signalosome, eIF3e contains a C-terminal PCI domain. Sequence data base searches indicate that eIF3e is most likely a single gene in Arabidopsis.Table IComparison of Arabidopsis eIF3e and eIF3e from human, Drosophila, C. elegans, and S. pombe% amino acid identityAmino acid similarityArabidopsisHumanDrosophilaC. elegansS. pombe%Arabidopsis62575445Human48696046Drosophila41585641C. elegans38464244S. pombe34342930Alignments and percent identity and similarity were calculated using ClustalX.

Although the human eIF3e is postulated to be a subunit of eIF3 (16Asano K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. J. Biol.

Deng X.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze further eIF3e, and its possible interaction with either the COP9 signalosome or eIF3, we needed a control protein that is thought to be solely a component of eIF3. eIF3b is a known subunit of eIF3 in yeast and humans (19Methot N.

https://openalex.org/W2069408580,"The MGSA/GRO protein is endogenously expressed in almost 70% of the melanoma cell lines and tumors, but not in normal melanocytes. We have previously demonstrated that over-expression of human MGSA/GROα, β or γ in immortalized murine melanocytes (melan-a cells) enables these cells to form tumors in SCID and nude mice. To examine the possibility that the MGSA/GRO effect on melanocyte transformation requires expression of other genes, differential display was performed. One of the mRNA's identified in the screen as overexpressed in MGSA/GRO transformed melan-a clones was the newly described M-Ras or R-Ras3 gene, a member of the Ras gene superfamily. Over-expression of MGSA/GRO upregulates M-Ras expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and this induction requires an intact glutamine-leucine-arginine (ELR)-motif in the MGSA/GRO protein. Western blot examination of Ras expression revealed that K- and N-Ras proteins are also elevated in MGSA/GRO-expressing melan-a clones, leading to an overall increase in the amount of activated Ras. MGSA/GRO-expressing melan-a clones exhibited enhanced AP-1 activity. The effects of MGSA/GRO on AP-1 activation could be mimicked by over-expression of wild-type M-Ras or a constitutively activated M-Ras mutant in control melan-a cells as monitored by an AP-1-luciferase reporter, while expression of a dominant negative M-Ras blocked AP-1-luciferase activity in MGSA/GRO-transformed melan-a clones. In the in vitro transformation assay, over-expression of M-Ras mimicked the effects of MGSA/GRO by inducing cellular transformation in control melan-a cells, while over-expression of dominant negative M-Ras in MGSA/GROα-expressing melan-a-6 cells blocked transformation. These data suggest that MGSA/GRO-mediated transformation requires Ras activation in melanocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2010770913,"The activation of most protein kinases requires phosphorylation at a conserved site within a structurally defined segment termed the activation loop. A classic example is the regulation of the cell cycle control enzyme, CDK2/cyclin A, in which catalytic activation depends on phosphorylation at Thr160 in CDK2. The structural consequences of phosphorylation have been revealed by x-ray crystallographic studies on CDK2/cyclin A and include changes in conformation, mainly of the activation loop. Here, we describe the kinetic basis for activation by phosphorylation in CDK2/cyclin A.

The effects of phosphorylation on the individual steps in the catalytic reaction pathway were determined using solvent viscosometric techniques. It was found that the increase in catalytic power arises mainly from a 3,000-fold increase in the rate of the phosphoryl group transfer step with a more moderate increase in substrate binding affinity. In contrast, the rate of phosphoryl group transfer in the ATPase pathway was unaffected by phosphorylation, demonstrating that phosphorylation at Thr160 does not serve to stabilize ATP in the ATPase reaction.

To date, nine distinct CDKs in addition to eight different cyclins have been identified, in which different CDK/cyclin combinations serve to regulate distinct points in the mammalian cell division cycle. Although Cdc2 (CDK1)/cyclin B controls the transition of cells from the G2 to M-phase, the activities of CDK2/cyclin E and CDK2/cyclin A are critical for G1/S-phase transition and progression through S-phase, respectively (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Since the critical role of the CDKs in cell cycle control has been well established, understanding the details of their regulation is now of fundamental importance. The three-dimensional structures of several forms of CDK2 have been solved by x-ray crystallography. Like all protein kinases, CDK2 displays a globular fold consisting of two lobes, a smaller N-terminal lobe that is principally β-sheet and a larger C-terminal lobe that is principally α-helix. The bilobal interface constitutes the active site cleft into which the adenine ring of substrate ATP is deeply buried. The ATP γ-phosphate is directed toward the mouth of the active site where peptide and protein substrates bind and where phosphoryl group transfer occurs (for a review see Ref. 2Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Located near the mouth of the active site is a conserved loop structure termed the activation loop (residues 146–166). This loop structure is present in all protein kinases (3Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation at a conserved site within the activation loop is necessary for full activation of most protein kinases. In CDK2, this site is Thr160, phosphorylation of which is catalyzed by a heterologous kinase, CAK (cdk-activating kinase) (4Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Activation of CDK2 requires binding to its regulatory subunit, cyclin, in addition to phosphorylation at Thr160 (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). The structural consequences of cyclin binding to CDK2 and phosphorylation at Thr160 in CDK2 have been revealed by x-ray crystallography. Interaction with cyclin A results in the repositioning of an active site helix and the consequent alignment of key catalytic residues in CDK2, including the invariant residues Lys33and Glu51, which function to stabilize the α- and β-phosphates of ATP, and Asp145, which chelates an essential Mg2+ ion also serving to stabilize ATP. Furthermore, the active site cavity of CDK2 is exposed upon cyclin binding by repositioning of the activation loop by over 15 Å(6, 7). Subsequent phosphorylation of the CDK2/cyclin A complex at Thr160 (in CDK2) is associated with less dramatic changes in structure that are localized primarily to the activation loop (8Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the latter modification is associated with a dramatic increase in catalytic power. Although abundant structural information regarding the activation of CDK2 is available, it is not known how the associated alterations in structure correlate with increased catalytic rate. In particular, it is not known which steps along the catalytic reaction pathway are altered in response to Thr160 phosphorylation to achieve kinase activation. Thus, it has not been possible to make a correlation between CDK structure and regulation. In this study, we describe the catalytic reaction pathway for both the unphosphorylated and Thr160-phosphorylated CDK2/cyclin A complexes and report the kinetic basis for activation by phosphorylation. Our results show that phosphorylation affects mainly the rate of chemistry, doing so by specific stabilization of the protein phosphoacceptor group. Cdk2 was expressed as the full-length human CDK2 N-terminally fused to GST in pGEX-2T. Cyclin A was expressed as a truncated fragment of bovine cyclin A3, (corresponding to human cyclin A residues Val171to the end) fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in pET21d (9Brown N.R.

Expression of GST-CDK2 was then induced with IPTG (0.4 mm) at room temperature for 18 h, whereas expression of cyclin A-His6 was induced with IPTG (0.2 mm) at room temperature for 3 h. Cell pellets from 1 liter of each culture were separately resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA), mixed, and colysed in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm MgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme for 20 min on ice, sonicated briefly (five 20-s bursts), and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (Sorvall SS-34) for 30 min. The supernatant was batch-incubated with 0.5 ml glutathione-agarose (Sigma)/liter of GST-CDK2 culture for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with buffer A (20 mmMOPS, 0.1 EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.4), and bound protein was eluted in a column using buffer A containing 15 mm glutathione (Sigma). The eluted protein (2–5 mg/ml) was cleaved with thrombin (Sigma, 100 units/ml) in a total volume of 2 ml at room temperature overnight. The cleaved material was digested with Dnase I (Sigma, 0.2 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature and then loaded onto a 1-ml Uno Q column (Bio-Rad Biologics). Protein was eluted by a gradient of increasing ionic strength (0.02–0.3 m NaCl/40 ml). The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at A280, peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing protein subunits corresponding to CDK2 and cyclin A were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and chromatographed again on Uno Q anion exchange. Fractions corresponding to the major peak at A280 were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE followed by assays for ATPase activity and kinase activity toward Peptide 1. The cDNA clone encoding the Saccharomyces cerevisae CAK1 protein fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was kindly provided by D. Morgan (University of California, San Francisco). CAK1 was subcloned into pGEX-2T, and overexpression of GST-CAK1 protein was carried out in E. coli BL21 (DE3) according to Kaldis et al. (10Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ten liters of bacterial culture were grown to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with IPTG (0.4 mm) at room temperature for 20 h, the cells were harvested, and an extract was prepared as described for (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A with the exception that MgCl2 was present at 5 mm. GST-CAK1 was enriched by glutathione-agarose chromatography (0.5 ml packed resin/liter of culture) as described for (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A. GST-CDK2 and cyclin A-His6 were separately purified. GST-CDK2 was purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography and subjected to thrombin cleavage. Cyclin A-His6 was purified by chromatography over Ni2+-NTA-resin according to Brown et al. (9Brown N.R.

Cdk2 (0.8 mg) was phosphorylated at Thr160 by incubation with GST-CAK1, ATP (1 mm), and MgCl2 (10 mm) overnight at room temperature based on a protocol used by Brown et al.(11Brown N.R. Noble M.E.

Pyruvate kinase (7.5 units/ml) and phosphoenolpyruvate (1 mm) were included to remove product ADP and to regenerate ATP. After phosphorylation, [p-Thr160]CDK2 was combined with cyclin A (4 mg), incubated on ice for 30 min, purified on Superose 12, and then twice subjected to chromatography over Uno Q as described for (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A. From 0.8 mg of CDK2, ∼100 μg of highly purified [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A was obtained. [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A expressed in Sf9 cells was purified according to Russo (12Russo A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A was tested for its ability to undergo activation by CAK. (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A (0.5 μm) was incubated with a concentrated extract of glutathione-agarose-enriched GST-CAK1 in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 7.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, (100 μl total volume) for 14 h at room temperature. Ten μl of the reaction mixture was then diluted into 90 μl of buffer containing 1 mm ATP and coupling reagents (15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 7.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, and 130 μm NADH), and peptide kinase activity was measured after the addition of 100 μmPeptide 1 in a coupled spectrophotometric assay (see below). The kinase activity was taken as the change in absorbance at A340 after correction for ATPase activity, which was determined by measurement in the absence of peptide. The phosphorylation of Peptide 1 was monitored by a radioisotope assay in which the direct incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into the peptide was measured. Reactions were carried out in phosphorylation buffer (20 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2(free),1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing enzyme and varying amounts of one substrate with the other held fixed. Assays on [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A contained 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In the case of (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A, an ATP regeneration system consisting of phosphoenolpyruvate (1 mm) and pyruvate kinase (7.5 units/ml) was employed. The decay in [γ-32P]ATP specific radioactivity over time follows first-order kinetics with rate constant k = [rate of ADP formation]/[ATP]. 2−dATP32/dt =V · ATP32/(ATP32 +Km · (1 + ATP/Km)) =k · ATP32 and −dATP/dt =V · ATP/(ATP + Km · (1 + ATP32/Km)) = k · ATP, where k ≈ V/(ATP +Km) and therefore: k = (−dATP/dt)/ATP = (dADP/dt)/ATP. It was assumed that the rate of ADP formation was effectively equal to the rate of ATP hydrolysis and that ADP generated from the kinase reaction was insignificant. The rate of ADP formation at a given concentration of ATP and enzyme was therefore calculated by solving for the Michaelis-Menten equation using Km and kcat values of 90 μm and 10 min−1, respectively, for the ATPase reaction, which were determined in a spectrophotometric assay (see below; data not shown). The calculated rate constant corresponding to each ATP concentration was used to simulate a decay profile using the equation,y = yo × e −kt , where y is the ATP-specific activity at any time,t, yo is the original ATP-specific activity, and k is the rate constant for decay, as defined above. The average ATP-specific radioactivity at any time,t, was obtained by determining the ATP-specific activity time integral for the entire reaction time course, dividing by the total time. Calculations were performed using the program Scientist (Micromath Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (300–500 cpm/pmol) and allowed to proceed at 23 °C for 6 to 30 min, at which time reactions were terminated with 25% acetic acid. Reaction samples (20 μl) were spotted and subjected to ascending chromatography on phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P81) in 20 mmH3PO4, pH 2. In this system, ATP and Pi migrate with the solvent front; the phosphorylated peptide product remains at the origin. Papers were dried, and radioactivity corresponding to the phosphopeptide spots were excised and quantified by Cerenkov counting. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the phosphorylation of Peptide 1 were determined from initial velocity data obtained from a matrix of several fixed ATP concentrations at varied peptide substrate concentrations. Equation 1 was globally fit to the data using the program Scientist (Micromath Inc.).v=V·A·B/((KiA·KmB)+(KmB·A)+(KmA·B)+(A·B))Equation 1 where v is the initial velocity, V is the maximal initial velocity, A and B are the concentrations of the fixed and varied substrates, respectively,Km is the Michaelis constant, and KiA is the dissociation constant for A. kcat was determined by dividing the maximal initial velocity by the enzyme concentration. ATPase activity was monitored using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in which the regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate catalyzed by pyruvate kinase is coupled to the reduction of pyruvate by NADH to form lactate and NAD+, the latter of which is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (13Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the coupling reagents were as follows: 15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 7.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, and 130 μm NADH. Reactions were performed in phosphorylation buffer with coupling reagents in a total volume of 100 μl at 23 °C. Progress of the reaction over time was monitored as a linear decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in a Shimadzu UV1601 spectrophotometer. The micromolar change in product concentration was calculated based on an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6220 cm−1m−1 at 340 nm. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear least-squares analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation, which was fit to the velocity data. Steady-state assays were carried out as described above in buffer containing varied sucrose or fructose. Relative solvent viscosity (ηrel) was determined from the following equation: ηrel =t/t o · ρ/ρo, where ηrel is the solvent viscosity relative to buffer containing no viscosogen, t is the solvent transit time measured by an Ostwald capillary viscometer, and ρ is the solvent specific gravity. The superscript “o” denotes the absence of viscosogen. [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A was produced by overexpression in either E. coli or Sf9 insect cells. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate displaying the canonical recognition motif XT/SP XK/R (Peptide 1; PKTPKKAKKL) were determined by Michaelis-Menten analysis using a two-substrate model for sequential binding (see “Materials and Methods”). The data are shown in Fig. 1 in double reciprocal form. The regression yields a turnover number (kcat) of 7 ± 0.7 s−1 and Km values for ATP and peptide equal to 55 ± 5 μm and 8 ± 0.7 μm, respectively. The optimized steady-state parameter values yield a catalytic efficiency for peptide that is among the highest reported for protein kinases (kcat/Km (peptide) = 0.9 μm−1s−1). The kinetic properties of [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A produced in Sf9 cells (12Russo A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were also determined and were found to be similar (kcat = 4.5 ± 1 s−1, kcat/Km (peptide) = 0.4 μm−1s−1). (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A was expressed and purified from E. coli. SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions corresponding to the major protein peak eluting from the final chromatographic step is shown in Fig. 2. Each fraction was assayed for ATPase activity, which was found to correspond exactly to the profile of CDK2/cyclin A protein. However, analysis of the same fractions for peptide kinase activity revealed that, while the early fractions of the protein peak displayed low activity, the later fractions exhibited substantially higher kinase activity (Fig. 2, B and C). The basis for the high kinase activity in these later fractions is not known. For all studies on [un-P]CDK2/cyclin A, fractions free of the contaminating high kinase activity species were used (fractions 31–34, Fig. 2). In these fractions, peptide kinase activity corresponded exactly to the levels of CDK2/cyclin A protein and steady-state kinetic parameters, measured for both fraction 31 and fractions 31–34 pooled, were identical (not shown). (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A in these fractions displayed low but measurable kinase activity. The kinase activity of (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A] was linear for up to 2 h, demonstrating that autoactivation does not occur within this time frame. To test the possibility that the low level of activity may be attributable to partial denaturation, (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A was tested for activation by phosphorylation (see “Materials and Methods”). Incubation of (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A with MgATP and CAK resulted in a turnover rate (∼9 s−1) corresponding to that of [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A obtained after extensive purification (data not shown). These data indicate that all of the (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A was activable and was therefore native. In addition, the maximal ATPase rates of (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A produced in E. coli (10 min−1) compared with insect cells (∼14 min−1) were similar, as were their peptide kinase activities. It was found that the maximal ATPase rate (10 min−1) was ∼20-fold higher than the maximal rate of the peptide kinase reaction (0.5 min−1). This finding presented two problems for kinetic analysis. First, (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A binds ADP with a Kd value of ∼1 μm (14Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, under initial velocity conditions with respect to the kinase reaction, significant product inhibition would be expected to occur. Second, the fraction of ATP depleted at low initial ATP concentrations would be large even at small fractions of peptide phosphorylation, precluding kinetic measurement under initial velocity conditions. To circumvent these difficulties, an ATP-regenerating system was employed. In this system, ADP is efficiently removed from the reaction mix and the concentration of ATP remains constant. However, under these conditions, the [γ-32P]ATP-specific radioactivity decays over the reaction time course as ATP is regenerated. This decay was accounted for in all analyses of peptide phosphorylation (see “Materials and Methods”). The corrected initial velocity data for the phosphorylation of Peptide 1 by (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A are shown in Fig.3, and the optimized steady-state kinetic parameter values are reported in Table I. The turnover rate for (non-P)CDK2/cyclin A is 843-fold lower than that of [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A, whereas the Km (peptide) is 137-fold higher. Thus, phosphorylation of CDK2/cyclin A results in an ∼100,000-fold increase in catalytic efficiency.Table IKinetic and thermodynamic constants for (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A and [p-Thr 160 ]CDK2/cyclin AParameter(non-p)CDK2/cyclin A[p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin AFold change upon phosphorylationKinase activity kcat0.0083 ± 0.0008 s−17 ± 0.7 s−1↑843 Km (peptide)1100 ± 400 μm8 ± 0.7 μm↓137 Km (ATP)55 ± 5 μm Ki (ATP)6 ± 6 μm kcat/Km (peptide)(7.5 ± 3) × 10−6 μm−1s−10.9 ± 0.12 μm−1s−1↑∼100,000 kcat/Km (ATP)0.12 ± 0.02 μm−1s−1 k−2(peptide)≥0.083 s−1≥220 s−1 k30.0083 s−122 ± 4 s−1↑2650 k4≥0.083 s−111 ± 1 s−1 Kd (peptide)1100 ± 400 μm25 ± 3 μm↓44ATPase activity kcat0.17 ± 0.05 s−10.2 ± 0.05 s−1↑1.2 k30.17 ± 0.05 s−10.2 ± 0.05 s−1↑1.2 Open table in a new tab The Michaelis-Menten parameters described above are composed of microscopic rate constants combined in a manner dependent upon the order of substrate addition. The steady-state data for both [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A and (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A are consistent with both random and compulsorily ordered mechanisms. For both enzymes, however, if the kinetic mechanism is ordered, it is necessarily ordered with ATP binding first; this is true because the crystal structures of both [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A and (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A were obtained with bound ATP alone. Furthermore, both enzymes display substantial ATPase activity in the absence of peptide or protein substrate. Under saturating conditions of ATP, the catalytic mechanism of CDK2/cyclin A can therefore be described by SchemeFS1. In this model, the catalytic efficiency is given by (kcat/Km (peptide)= k2 ×k3/(k−2 +k3)], while the turnover rate is given by [kcat = k3 ×k4/(k3 +k4)]. To solve for the microscopic constants,k2, k−2,k3, and k4, we employed steady-state solvent viscosometric techniques, which allow separation of the diffusive (k2,k−2, k4) from non-diffusive steps (k3) (15Brouwer A.C.

Initial velocity data for peptide phosphorylation by [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A were obtained as a function of peptide substrate concentration at several concentrations of sucrose (Fig. 4 A). At these sucrose concentrations, the maximum rate 3No change in rate was observed at 1 versus 2 mm ATP. of ATP hydrolysis (12 min−1) in the absence of peptide was constant, indicating that sucrose does not perturb the structure of the active site. Equation 2,v=E·(S/Kd·k3·k4/η)/(k4/η+k4·k3/k−2+Equation 2 S/Kd·(k3+k4/η))which describes the effect of relative solvent viscosity on initial rate, was fit to the data, where E is the concentration of enzyme, S is the concentration of Peptide 1, η is the relative solvent viscosity, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for Peptide 1 binding to the E·ATP complex (k−2/k2). All other constants are defined in Scheme FS1. The derived values for the kinetic constants are reported in Table I. Solvent viscosity studies performed on [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A produced in insect cells revealed similar kinetic parameters (Kd (peptide) = 20 μm,k3 = 8 s−1,k4 = 11 s−1).Figure 4Effect of relative solvent viscosity on Michaelis-Menten parameters. A, [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A. Equation 2, corresponding to Scheme FS1, was fit to a matrix of initial velocity data obtained with varied peptide substrate concentrations at several fixed concentrations of sucrose (giving relative solvent viscosities of 1, 2, 2.5, and 4.2, from top to bottom). The optimized microscopic rate constants are given in Table I. The concentration of ATP was fixed at 1 mm. Identical results were obtained at 2 mm ATP. The concentration of enzyme was 2 nm.B, (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A. Relative changes in initial rates were determined as a function of increasing sucrose concentration at three different subsaturating concentrations of peptide substrate (0.4 mm, solid line, open circles; 2 mm,long dashes, open squares; 4 mm,short dashes, open diamonds). The concentration of ATP was 1 mm. Identical results were obtained at 2 mm ATP. The concentration of enzyme was 1 μm. The “viscosity effect” on the reaction rate (kobsη) is defined as the slope of the line at a given substrate concentration and can vary between the theoretical limits of 0 and 1. The viscosity effects on catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km η) and turnover rate (kcatη) are obtained by extrapolation to zero and infinite substrate concentration, respectively. kcat/K m η and kcatη relate to the individual rate constants in Scheme FS1 as follows:kcat/Km η =k3/(k−2 +k3); kcatη= k3/(k3 +k4)(25). A value for kcat/Km η and kcatη equal to zero implies that k−2 ≫ k3 and k3 ≪ k4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A similar solvent viscosometric analysis was conducted on (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A. Although saturation with Peptide 1 could not be achieved because of the high Km value for this substrate, subsaturating substrate concentrations equal to 0.36, 1.8, and 3.6 times the Km (peptide) revealed no viscosity effect on initial rates (Fig. 4 B). Extrapolation to zero and infinite peptide substrate concentrations showed that neither the catalytic efficiency nor turnover rate, respectively, was sensitive to solvent viscosity. The release rates for both substrate peptide (k−2) and product (k4) can therefore be assumed to exceed the rate of chemistry (k3) by at least 10-fold (Table I). Thus, phosphoryl group transfer in (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A is rate determining. A viscosometric analysis was also carried out on the ATPase reaction. No viscosity effect on the turnover rate was observed, suggesting that phosphoryl group transfer in the ATPase reaction is also rate determining (Table I). The lack of a viscosity effect on the steady-state kinetic parameters for both the kinase and ATPase reactions indicates that sucrose perturbs only the rates of diffusion. The majority of protein kinases require phosphorylation at a conserved site within their activation loops for full catalytic activation (3Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). This site in CDK2/cyclin A is Thr160. Its phosphorylation by CAK is of interest for at least two reasons: 1) it has been established that phosphorylation at this site is a critical regulatory mechanism for control of CDK2/cyclin A activity and progression through the cell cycle (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar); 2) the structural basis for activation of CDK2 by both cyclin binding and phosphorylation is known (6De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 7Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 8Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and the structure of [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A bound to a synthetic peptide substrate has been solved (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Given the abundant structural data, the consequences of phosphorylation at Thr160 on the specific steps for substrate binding and catalytic turnover have not been investigated. Thus, a correlation between atomic structure and the mechanism of regulation is not known. In this study, we have characterized the kinetic reaction pathway for the phosphorylation of a model peptide substrate by unphosphorylated CDK2/cyclin A as well as CDK2/cyclin A phosphorylated at Thr160 by CAK. The information reveals the kinetic basis for activation by phosphorylation in terms of the individual reaction steps. We have employed a synthetic peptide (Peptide 1) as a model substrate in which the primary structure (PKTPKKAKKL) is patterned after a region of similar sequence found in histone H1 protein (19Felix M.A. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Hunt T. Karsenti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of Peptide 1 for [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A is one of the highest reported for protein kinases (kcat/Km ≃ 1 μm−1s−1) and is similar to that of histone H1 protein (not shown). The lack of a viscosity effect on kcat/Km (peptide)for both [un-P]CDK2/cyclin A and [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A demonstrates that during steady-state turnover Peptide 1 equilibrates rapidly with the active site of both enzymes. Thus, catalytic efficiency for the kinase activity in both cases is a function of only the affinity of peptide binding and the rate of phosphoryl group transfer (kcat/Km ≃k3/Kd). Phosphorylation at Thr160 increases catalytic efficiency by ∼100,000-fold, while the turnover rate is enhanced nearly 1000-fold. The dramatic increase in catalytic efficiency is in part attributable to a moderate but significant increase in peptide binding affinity. The crystal structure of [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A bound to AMPPNP and a peptide substrate (HHASPRK) (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) reveals the structural basis for interaction with peptide and protein substrates. Phosphorylation of CDK2/cyclin A at Thr160 results in displacement of the activation loop by 5.3–7.1 Å and rotation of the carbonyl oxygen of Val163 out of the so called “P+1 binding pocket” (7Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 8Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This movement is necessary to accommodate binding of the essential proline residue found in the P+1 position (P0 is the phosphorylation site) in all CDK2/cyclin substrates (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition, the substrate lysine residue at position P+3 forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group in [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Overall, phosphorylation of CDK2/cyclin A at Thr160 increases the binding affinity of Peptide 1 by ∼50-fold. Nonetheless, the large increase in both catalytic efficiency and turnover rate with respect to the kinase pathway is attributable mostly to an approximate 3000-fold increase in the rate of the phosphoryl group transfer step. In contrast, phosphorylation has no effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Solvent viscosometric studies on the ATPase reaction of both [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A and (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A show that phosphorylation affects neither the overall turnover rate nor the rate of the phosphoryl group transfer step (Table I). The large rate enhancement of chemical reactions afforded by enzymes is classically accounted for by specific stabilization of the transition state with respect to the ground state Michaelis complex (20Hackney D.D. The Enzymes. 19. Academic Press, New York1990: 1-36Google Scholar). Thus, the 3000-fold increase in the rate of phosphoryl group transfer may be attributed to optimization of the alignment of either ATP or peptide, or both, in response to phosphorylation. Phosphorylation does not, however, optimize the alignment of ATP for phosphotransfer in the ATPase reaction, because no rate enhancement of this reaction step was observed; this is consistent with the observation that phosphorylation does not affect the positioning of the invariant Lys33, Glu51, and Asp145 catalytic triad, which serves to stabilize the phosphates of ATP. Instead, the alignment of these residues is achieved by cyclin binding (2Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that phosphorylation may serve specifically to align the peptide or protein portion of the transition-state structure for phosphotransfer in the kinase reaction. The dramatically slower rate of phosphotransfer to peptide in (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A compared with [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A may be explained by an unfavorable orientation of the peptide substrate hydroxyl group as a consequence of the steric interference from the carbonyl oxygen of Val163, which is relieved by phosphorylation at Thr160. We are currently conducting studies to test our hypothesis that the alignment of ATP versus that of the peptide/protein substrate may be separately controlled by cyclin binding versusphosphorylation at Thr160, respectively. Substrate turnover by [p-Thr160]CDK2/cyclin A is partially (65%) limited by product release (k4= 11 s−1). However, our studies do not discern whether the slow step in this event is the release of ADP or phosphopeptide. If the dissociation rate of the phosphopeptide product is similar to, or greater than, that of the peptide substrate (k−2 ≥ 220 s−1), then it is the release of ADP that is slow. In addition, we cannot assess the effect that phosphorylation at Thr160 has on the product dissociation rates, as the lack of a viscosity effect on kcat in (non-p)CDK2/cyclin A permits only a lower limit value on the net rate of product release to be estimated (k4 ≥ 0.083 s−1). Studies addressing the role of autophosphorylation in the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) have been carried out employing a nonphosphorylatable mutant as a model of the unphosphorylated enzyme (21Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although the site of phosphorylation in PKA (Thr197) is homologous to residue Thr160 in CDK2/cyclin A, clear differences exist between these enzymes in their kinetic mechanisms of activation. In particular, phosphorylated wild-type PKA, in comparison with PKA(T197A), displays no change in substrate binding affinity, a small increase in the overall rate of substrate turnover (<10-fold), and a moderate increase in the rate of the phosphoryl group transfer step (<200-fold) (21Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (cf.Table I). The differences in activation of PKA versusCDK2/cyclin A may relate to their different physiological mechanisms of regulation. For example, reversible phosphorylation of the CDKs by CAK is critical to their function in cell cycle control (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar), whereas the role of autophosphorylation in the regulation of PKA remains unclear (22Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Instead, the regulation of PKA is achieved mainly by association with either the RI or RII regulatory subunits. Comparison of CDK2/cyclin A with PKA (21Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and the v-fps tyrosine kinase (24Saylor P. Hanna E. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17875-17881Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Nakatani H. Dunford H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 83: 2662-2665Google Scholar) does, however, reveal an apparent common theme, that phosphorylation of the activation loop in all cases serves mainly to enhance the rate of phosphotransfer with less influence on the affinity of substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2021755724,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family that play critical roles in stress responses and apoptosis. We have discovered that JNK is present in Xenopus oocytes, an experimental system that offers a variety of powerful experimental approaches to questions of protein function and regulation. Like ERK2/p42 MAPK, JNK is activated just prior to germinal vesicle breakdown during Xenopusoocyte maturation and remains active throughout meiosis I and II. However, unlike p42 MAPK, which is inactivated about 30 min after eggs are fertilized or parthenogenetically activated, JNK stays constitutively active until the early gastrula stage of embryogenesis. These findings suggest that the JNK pathway may play a role in oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. JNK was activated by microinjection of Mos, by activation of an estrogen-inducible form of Raf, and by a constitutively active MEK-1 (MEK R4F), indicating that the p42 MAPK cascade can trigger JNK activation. However, the MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked progesterone-induced p42 MAPK activation but not progesterone-induced JNK activation. Thus, progesterone can stimulate JNK activation both through the MEK/p42 MAPK pathway and through MEK/p42 MAPK-independent pathways. Many of the key substrates of JNKs identified to date are transcriptional regulators. However, since transcription is not required for germinal vesicle breakdown in progesterone-treated oocytes or for the early embryonic cell cycles, our findings suggest that in these contexts the JNK pathway exerts nongenomic effects.

In mammals there are three JNK genes, the ubiquitously expressed jnk1and jnk2 genes and the brain-, heart-, and testis-specific jnk3 gene (4Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Each of these genes can give rise to 46- and 55-kDa forms of the JNK protein through alternative mRNA splicing (4Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Like the ERK1/2 and p38 subfamilies of MAP kinases, the JNKs are components of a modular MAP kinase cascade (5Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the top of the cascade is a MAP kinase kinase kinase. The MAPKKK (JNKKK) phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase. The MAPKK (JNKK) in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAPK (JNK). Two JNK-activating MAPKKs have been identified, MKK4 and MKK7. These dual-specificity protein kinases activate JNK by phosphorylating conserved Thr and Tyr residues (Thr-Pro-Tyr) situated in the kinase activation loop. MKK4 and MKK7 in turn can be activated by numerous MAPKKKs. The MKK4/MKK7-activating MAPKKKs include MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4/MTK1, MEKK5/MAPKKK5, MST/MLK2, MUK/DLK, MLK3/SPRK, TAK1, Tpl-1/2, and ASK1 (3Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

In addition, Ste20-related protein kinases, calmodulin kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases can all bring about JNK activation (7Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M. Neiman A.M.

JNK cascades have long been suspected of mediating pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses. Recently these ideas have been tested through the analysis of transgenic mice with disruptions in their jnk1, jnk2, and/or jnk3 genes or in upstream activators (10Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C.

Here we have begun examining JNK regulation in another powerful experimental system, Xenopus laevis oocytes, eggs, and embryos. By virtue of their large size and natural cell cycle synchrony, these cells have been fruitful systems for the identification of cell cycle regulators and inducers of early development, exploration of apoptotic pathways, and examination of quantitative aspects of signal transduction systems. We set out to determine whether Xenopus oocytes possess a JNK-like protein and whether any such JNK protein was activated during oocyte maturation or early embryogenesis. Here we show that Xenopus oocytes express p40 JNK and p49 JNK isoforms. JNK activity increases abruptly just prior to germinal vesicle breakdown during Xenopusoocyte maturation, at the boundary between G2-phase and meiotic M-phase, and remains high throughout early embryogenesis until early gastrulation. It is possible that JNK plays an important role in these processes and exerts its function by regulating targets other than transcriptional regulators. Anti-JNK antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-JNK2 (D2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1 (SC571; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-JNK2 (SC572; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as well as anti-phospho-JNK (G7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Xenopusovarian tissue was surgically removed, and oocytes were defolliculated for 1–1.5 h at room temperature with 2 mg/ml collagenase and 0.5 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone in Ca2+-free modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The oocytes were then washed four times with modified Barth's solution. Stage VI oocytes were sorted manually and incubated at 16 °C for at least 10 h in OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Immature oocytes were microinjected with MEK R4F or Mos protein and transferred to fresh OR2 for the duration of the time course. Ten oocytes were collected per time point, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C.

For parthenogenetic activation, eggs were dejellied for 5 min in 3% cysteine, pH 7.6, washed with 1× MR buffer (10× the concentrations described above), and given two 1-s electrical shocks (12 V, alternating current) (21Murray A.W.

Fertilized eggs were dejellied in 3% cysteine, pH 7.6, for 4 min at room temperature, transferred to 0.1× MR, and lysed at the appropriate embryonic stages. Frozen oocytes, eggs, and embryos were thawed rapidly and lysed by pipetting up and down in 60 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer (EB) (0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm microcystin). Samples were clarified by centrifugation for 2.5 min in a Beckman E microcentrifuge with a right angle rotor. Crude cytoplasm was collected and processed for immunoblotting or kinase assays, as described below. Aliquots of oocyte, egg, or embryo lysates were added to 0.2 volumes of 6× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (bisacrylamide:acrylamide, 100:1) and the proteins transferred to PVDF blotting membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) and incubated with primary antibodies. Blots were washed five times with TBS, 0.5% Tween 20 and probed with an peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing, blots were stripped by incubation with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS at 70 °C for 40 min. Jun kinase assays were performed as described (23Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Crude oocyte, egg, or embryo cytoplasm was diluted 1:1 in EB and pre-cleared with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C with moderate shaking. Lysates were incubated with glutathione S-transferase GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein (hereafter denoted GST-Jun) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (24Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and once with 0.4 ml of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate). The bound JNK activity was detected by the addition of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated after 20 min at 30 °C, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to PVDF membranes (Hybond; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into GST-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. Xenopus p42 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from lysates using polyclonal antibody X15. Crude cytoplasmic lysates were diluted 1:1 in EB and precleared with 20 ml of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). After 3 h at 4 °C at moderate shaking, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and washed once with 1 ml of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate). Subsequently, kinase reactions were performed in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 4 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma), 50 μm ATP, and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 8 μl of 6× Laemmli buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 12.5% gels. Gels were transferred to PVDF (Hybond; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membranes. Phosphorylated substrate was detected by autoradiography on Kodak Biomax MS film. The cDNA for a human Raf-estrogen receptor chimera, designated ΔRaf-DD:ER, was a generous gift from M. McMahon. The Raf portion of the chimera has been activated by deletion of the N terminus and substitution of aspartate residues at Tyr-340 and -341 (25Bosch E. Cherwinski H. Peterson D. McMahon M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor portion of the chimera makes the Raf activity regulatable by estradiol. ΔRaf-DD:ER was cloned into pSP64 poly(A) (Promega), and mRNA was generated by in vitrotranscription (Ambion). Stage VI oocytes were collected and injected with 50 ng of ΔRaf-DD:ER mRNA and incubated overnight to allow protein expression. Injected oocytes were incubated with 1 μm estradiol to activate the ΔRaf-DD:ER. ΔRaf-DD:ER-expressing oocytes were lysed in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, and 100 μmβ-glycerophosphate. Cleared lysates were incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (precoated with anti-estrogen receptor antibody) at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed once with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Samples were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with kinase buffer supplemented with 1 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 ng of purified recombinant MEK protein. The reactions were denatured by boiling in sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Biomax MS) to detect incorporated radioactivity. We subjected lysates from G2- and M-phase oocytes to immunoblotting with a JNK-specific monoclonal antibody. We detected two putative JNK bands, with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 49 kDa (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Vertebrate JNKs bind tightly to the N terminus of c-Jun, which contains the residues (Ser-63 and Ser-73) that JNK phosphorylates (23Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). A fusion of GST with the first 79 amino acids of c-Jun can therefore be used as an affinity reagent to precipitate JNK protein and activity. We subjected Xenopus oocyte lysates to precipitation with GST-Jun, and we looked for JNK protein by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A (right panel), GST-Jun brought down the p40 and p49 bands seen in JNK immunoblots of whole lysates. Control GST beads did not bring down p40 or p49. This finding supports the identification of p40 and p49 as authentic JNKs, possibly corresponding to the p46 and p54 isoforms expressed in mammalian cells. Next we examined whether JNK activity differed in G2-phase immature oocytes and M-phase mature oocytes. We subjected JNKs to precipitation with nonimmune serum, GST-Jun beads, or four different JNK antisera, one of which (G7) is known not to support immune complex kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, two of the JNK antisera (SC571 and SC572) and the GST-Jun beads brought down substantial levels of Jun kinase activity from M-phase oocytes. Jun kinase activity was not detected in the nonimmune serum precipitates or in the D2 or G7 precipitates (Fig. 1 B). None of the reagents brought down significant levels of Jun kinase activity from G2-phase oocytes (Fig. 1 B). These findings further confirm that JNK is present in oocytes and indicate that JNK becomes activated during Xenopus oocyte maturation. Next we examined the time course of progesterone-induced JNK activation in detail. JNK activity increased markedly just prior to GVBD, as did p42 MAPK activity (Fig.2). Like p42 MAPK activity, JNK activity remained high throughout meiosis I and meiosis II. This pattern of JNK activation suggests a possible role for the JNK signaling pathway in oocyte maturation and the G2/M cell cycle transition. To examine JNK activity during the first mitotic cell cycle, we obtained dejellied, M-phase-arrested unfertilized Xenopus eggs and released them from their arrest with an electric shock. We then followed JNK activity and p42 MAPK activity. As shown in Fig.3, p42 MAPK activity fell by 30 min post-shock and then remained low during the first mitotic cycle. In contrast, JNK activity was high throughout the entire time course (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained with calcium ionophore-treated eggs (data not shown). These findings show that there are important differences between JNK regulation and p42 MAPK regulation in the Xenopus cell cycles. We fertilized Xenopus eggs in vitro, dejellied them, and then collected samples at various stages of embryogenesis. As shown in Fig.4, JNK activity was high during the rapid early embryonic cell cycles and the blastula stage and then decreased to basal levels at the early gastrula stage. In contrast, p42 MAPK activity fell before the first post-fertilization sample was taken (45 min after fertilization) and remained low throughout embryogenesis. These findings again point out the differences between JNK regulation and p42 MAPK regulation and suggest that JNK may play an important role in the pre-gastrula stage embryo. As described above (see Fig. 2), Xenopus JNK and p42 MAPK are activated at about the same time during oocyte maturation. This raises the possibility that there may be some connection between the two pathways. To explore this possibility, we microinjected oocytes with various proteins or mRNAs that could activate the p42 MAPK cascade without triggering the most proximal events of progesterone signaling (such as the very rapid progesterone-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) (26Ferrell Jr., J.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, injection of Mos (yielding an estimated intra-oocyte concentration of 200 nm) brought about activation of both p42 MAPK and JNK and also induced GVBD. No JNK activation, p42 MAPK activation, or GVBD was seen in mock-injected controls (data not shown). We also examined the effects of Raf activation on JNK activity. Although both Raf and Mos can function as MAPKKKs, their hierarchy within the p42 MAPK cascade is less clear, and the exact position of Raf within the p42 MAPK cascade in Xenopus oocytes is controversial. Nevertheless, active forms of Raf can be used as a way of activating the MAPK cascade and inducing GVBD in oocytes in the absence of progesterone. We therefore examined whether activation of Raf-1 causes JNK activation. We microinjected oocytes with synthetic mRNA encoding a chimera of an oncogenic form of human c-Raf-1 (ΔRaf-1 DD) fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (hereafter denoted ΔRaf-DD:ER) (25Bosch E. Cherwinski H. Peterson D. McMahon M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After allowing protein expression overnight, ΔRaf-DD:ER was activated by the addition of estradiol. Note that unlike progesterone, estradiol does not initiate maturation by itself (27Baulieu E.E. Godeau F. Schorderet M. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Nature. 1978; 275: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Estradiol treatment caused the activation of ΔRaf-DD:ER, p42 MAPK, and JNK and brought about GVBD (Fig.5 B). The extent of p42 MAPK and JNK activation seen in the mature estradiol-treated oocytes was similar to that seen in progesterone-treated oocytes (Fig. 5 B). Estradiol had no effect on JNK activity, p42 MAPK activity, or GVBD in oocytes that were not expressing ΔRaf-DD:ER (data not shown). Thus, both Mos and Raf are capable of activating JNK in Xenopus oocytes. Finally, we examined the effects of constitutively active MEK-1 (MEK R4F) on JNK activity. Constitutively active forms of MEK-1 induce p42 MAPK activation and maturation when injected into oocytes (28Huang W. Kessler D.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, concentrations of MEK R4F that were sufficient to cause p42 MAPK activation and GVBD also caused JNK activation. Microinjection of kinase-minus MEK-1 had no effect on JNK activity (data not shown). In summary, activation of the p42 MAPK cascade by either Mos, ΔRaf-DD:ER, or MEK-R4F caused activation of JNK. Thus, in Xenopus oocytes, JNK can be activated downstream of the Mos/MEK/p42 MAPK cascade. By having shown that the JNK cascade can be activated downstream of the p42 MAPK cascade, we next examined whether activation of p42 MAPK was required for JNK activation. First we examined whether hyperosmolar stress, which is known to activate JNKs in other cell types, would activate JNK and p42 MAPK in oocytes. Hyperosmolar sorbitol (0.5 m) caused marked activation of JNK (Fig.6 A) but no detectable activation of p42 MAPK (Fig. 6 B). Thus p42 MAPK activation is not an absolute prerequisite for JNK activation in oocytes. We next examined whether p42 MAPK activation was required for progesterone-induced JNK activation. We treated oocytes with progesterone in the presence or absence of U0126, an inhibitor of MEK-1. As shown in Fig. 7, U0126 effectively blocked progesterone-induced p42 MAPK activation but had no apparent effect on progesterone-induced JNK activation. Thus, although activation of the p42 MAPK cascade can bring about JNK activation, p42 MAPK activation is not required for JNK activation. Because the accumulation of Mos not only stimulates p42 MAPK activation, but also depends upon p42 MAPK activation (29Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Matten W.T. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Dev.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar), U0126 blocks Mos accumulation as well as MEK-1 and p42 MAPK activation (data not shown). Thus, there must be a pathway from the progesterone receptor to the JNK cascade that requires little or no support from Mos, MEK-1, or p42 MAPK. Inhibition of the Mos/MEK-1/p42 MAPK cascade has been reported to either block maturation or delay it (29Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol.

In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, none of the U0126-treated oocytes matured, even after 20 h of progesterone treatment, despite the fact that their JNK was fully activated. This finding demonstrates that full JNK activation is not sufficient to ensure maturation when p42 MAPK activation is blocked. Oocytes in culture sometimes degenerate, developing some mottling of the pigment in the animal hemisphere (Fig. 8, Aand B). Ultimately these oocytes adopt the “gray puffball” phenotype and die. Since JNKs have been implicated in apoptosis in other systems, we examined JNK activity in mottled, unhealthy oocytes. As shown in Fig. 8 C, unhealthy oocytes showed an elevated basal JNK activity but not an elevated basal p42 MAPK activity. Their JNK and p42 MAPK activities increased in response to progesterone, although the p42 MAPK activation was smaller than that seen in healthy oocytes (Fig. 8 C). These findings raise the possibility that the JNK pathway may contribute to apoptosis in Xenopus oocytes. In this study we have shown that Xenopus oocytes, eggs, and early embryos express 40- and 49-kDa isoforms of JNK, which we suspect correspond to the 46- and 54-kDa isoforms of mammalian JNKs. Both of the bands were recognized by anti-JNK1 and anti-JNK2 antibodies. Thus it is not certain whether Xenopus oocytes express four different JNK proteins (long and short splice variants of both JNK1 and JNK2) or just two JNK proteins (long and short) that cross-react with the anti-JNK1 and anti-JNK2 sera. Xenopus JNK is activated just prior to GVBD during oocyte maturation, at about the same time as the activation of p42 MAPK. Like p42 MAPK, JNK stays active throughout meiosis I and meiosis II. But unlike p42 MAPK (and Cdc2), JNK remains active after fertilization. JNK activity is high throughout the period of rapid embryonic cleavages (fertilization through the midblastula transition) and then falls at the early gastrula stage. The decline in JNK activity occurs shortly after the commencement of zygotic transcription (38Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Stimuli that directly impinge upon the MAPK cascade, Mos, ΔRaf-DD:ER, and MEK R4F, cause activation of JNK. In principle this could be due to the direct activation of JNK by endogenous MEK-1 (in the case of Mos and ΔRaf-DD:ER) or by MEK R4F. However, in our hands MEK R4F does not phosphorylate immunoprecipitated JNK or GST-Jun-precipitated JNK in vitro (data not shown), and in general MEK-1 proteins appear to be highly specific for p42 and p44 MAPK. Therefore we favor the hypothesis that a more indirect pathway connects the MAP kinase cascade to the JNK cascade. Progesterone can cause JNK activation even when Mos accumulation, MEK-1 activation, and p42 MAPK activation are inhibited by U0126. Thus, there is also a pathway from the progesterone receptor to the JNK cascade that does not depend upon input from Mos, MEK-1, or p42 MAPK. Likewise, hyperosmolar stress activates JNK without activating p42 MAPK. The Xenopus homologs of MKK4 or MKK7 could be likely participants in the p42 MAPK-independent JNK activation pathway. Fig. 9 schematically summarizes our current understanding of the Mos/MEK-1/p42 MAPK pathway and the JNK cascade in oocytes. Important open questions include the exact identities of the p40 and p49 JNK proteins, the identities of the upstream kinases in the JNK cascade, the connections between the Mos/MEK-1/p42 MAPK cascade and the JNK cascade, and the connections between the progesterone receptor and the JNK cascade. Another important open question is what function the JNK pathway plays in oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. There are many possibilities; however, it seems likely that whatever the function, it will not depend upon the regulation of transcription factors by JNK, since oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis can proceed in the absence of transcription. Here we shall discuss two particular hypotheses that are suggested by the timing of JNK activation and inactivation. JNKs have been implicated in apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Analysis of hippocampal neurons from transgenic mice with disruptions of their jnk3genes has supported a role for JNK3 in excitotoxin-induced neuronal apoptosis (39Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Similarly, analysis of embryonic fibroblasts from transgenic mice with disruptions of their jnk1 and jnk2 genes has supported a role for JNKs in UV-stimulated apoptosis upstream of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (11Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). However, JNKs have also been suggested as inhibitors of apoptosis. For example, MEKK1(−/−) embryonic stem cells fail to activate their JNK in response to hyperosmolarity and microtubule disruption, yet they exhibit a greater apoptotic response to these stresses (40Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Further clarification of the roles of JNKs in apoptosis is clearly warranted. Mature Xenopus oocytes and embryos up to the early gastrula stage, the stages when JNK is active, respond in an unusual way to cell cycle perturbations. Early embryos lack the normal checkpoints that make the initiation of mitosis contingent upon DNA replication and the metaphase/anaphase transition contingent upon successful alignment of the chromosomes at the metaphase plate (41Dasso M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 42Minshull J. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Murray A.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 475-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The embryo has developed a simpler strategy for dealing with cell cycle perturbations; rather than arresting and trying to correct problems in response to cell cycle perturbants, the embryo commits to carrying out apoptosis (43Hensey C. Gautier J. Mech. Dev. 1997; 69: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 44Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 46Sible J.C. Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The apoptotic program is then executed just after the mid-blastula transition, at the early gastrula stage. At the mid-blastula transition, the cell cycle slows down and gap phases begin to occur. Then, at the early gastrula stage, when JNK becomes inactive, the embryo switches strategies for responding to cell cycle perturbants, rather than immediately committing to apoptosis, the post-mid-blastula transition embryo initiates a cell cycle arrest and tries to correct the damage. Thus, the times when JNK is active during oocyte maturation and embryogenesis are also the times when the embryo is particularly prone to undergoing apoptosis. It will be of interest to determine whether and how the JNK activation contributes to the apoptotic response. Nearly 10 years ago, Hunt and coworkers (47Kobayashi H. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Stewart E. Gannon J. Minshull J. Smith R. Hunt T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that cyclin B2 undergoes a mobility shift when oocytes undergo maturation and that this mobility shift depends upon the phosphorylation of Ser-90, which is situated next to a proline residue (SP). They also showed that at least two distinct kinase activities that can phosphorylate the N terminus of cyclin B2 become activated at about the time of germinal vesicle breakdown. The first kinase activity phosphorylated Ser-90; this kinase remained active until about 30 min after fertilization. The second kinase activity phosphorylated other sites in the N terminus of cyclin B2 and remained active throughout the first mitotic cell cycles. Neither of these activities appeared to be Cdc2 or p42 MAPK (47Kobayashi H. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Stewart E. Gannon J. Minshull J. Smith R. Hunt T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Initial attempts were made to purify one or both of these activities. However, at the time it was unclear what the function of cyclin B2 phosphorylation might be, and so far none of these activities has been purified. Subsequent work has shown that the N terminus of cyclin B1 contains a nuclear export sequence and that phosphorylation of residues near this nuclear export sequence is critical for nuclear accumulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 and for the biological activity of Cdc2/cyclin B1 (48Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 49Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 50Hagting A. Jackman M. Simpson K. Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 680-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The same appears to be true for cyclin B2 (51Yoshitome S. Furuno N. Sagata N. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of the cyclin B2 N-terminal kinases is of high importance. Given the time course of JNK activity after parthenogenetic activation or fertilization of Xenopus eggs (Figs. 3 and 4), and given the fact that JNKs phosphorylate SP/TP residues, JNK is a candidate for the second cyclin kinase activity, the one that phosphorylates sites other than Ser-90 in the N terminus of cyclin B2. It will therefore be interesting to determine whether JNK can phosphorylate cyclin B2 in vitro and whether cyclin B2 phosphorylation in extracts depends upon JNK function. The use of gain-of-function JNK mutations and JNK inhibitors will help to evaluate the role of the JNK signaling pathways in oocyte maturation, cell cycle progression, and embryogenesis. Moreover, these tools will clarify whether JNK plays a positive or negative role in apoptosis, the ultimate cell fate of many oocytes and eggs. We are grateful to N. Ahn, M. Murakami, M. McMahon, A. Ullrich, and G. Vande Woude for providing plasmids; J. Baker for help with the embryos; R. Bhatt and J. Yoon for purification of MEK proteins; and M. Sohaskey, J. Besser, and D. Schechtman for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2312560264,"Eukaryotic cells have evolved a mechanism that delays the progression of mitosis until condensed chromosomes are properly positioned on the mitotic spindle. We have been studying genes that regulated the spindle checkpoint in human cells. Enforced expression of human BUBR1, but not a BUBR1 mutant allele, enhances accumulation of mitotic cells. Yeast two-hybrid system and GST-pulldown analyses show that p55CDC/hCdc20, a protein known to link spindle checkpoint components such as MAD2 to anaphase promoting complex (APC), interacts with BUBR1. In addition, p55CDC is capable of pulling down BUBR1 in sf-9 cells infected with both p55CDC and His6-BUBR1 recombinant baculoviruses but not in the cells infected with p55CDC baculoviruses or with the baculoviral vector alone. Moreover, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analyses confirmed that native p55CDC is associated with BUBR1 in HeLa cells. Spindle checkpoint activation by nocodazole treatment enhances the association between p55CDC and His6-BUBR1. In nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells, both CDC16 and hyperphosphorylated CDC27, two APC components, preferentially associate with His6-BUBR1 resins, but not the control resins. Furthermore, BUBR1 phosphorylates p55CDC in vitro, and the phosphorylation of p55CDC by BUBR1 appears to be correlated with spindle checkpoint activation. Together, our studies strongly suggest that BUBR1 may target APC via p55CDC."
https://openalex.org/W2049463266,"SHIP1 is an SH2 domain containing inositol-5-phosphatase that appears to be a negative regulator of hematopoiesis. The tyrosine kinase oncogene BCR/ABL drastically reduces expression of SHIP1. The major effect of re-expressing SHIP1 in BCR/ABL-transformed cells is reduction of hypermotility. To investigate the potential signaling pathways involving SHIP1 in hematopoietic cells, we overexpressed SHIP1 in a murine BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cell line and identified SHIP1-associated proteins. SHIP1 was found to form a novel signaling complex with BCR/ABL that includes DOK1 (p62DOK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and CRKL, each of which has been previously shown to regulate migration in diverse cell types. We found that DOK1 binds directly through its PTB domain to SHIP1. Direct interaction of SHIP1 with CRKL was mediated through the CRKL-SH2 domain. Co-precipitation experiments suggest that Tyr917 and Tyr1020 in SHIP1 are likely to mediate interactions with DOK1. In contrast to wild type SHIP1, expression of tyrosine mutant SHIP1 by transient transfection did not alter migration. PI3K was likely linked to this complex by CRKL. Thus, this complex may serve to generate a very specific set of phosphoinositol products, possibly involved in regulating migration. Overall, these data suggest that proteins that interact with SHIP1 through Tyr917 and Tyr1020, such as DOK1 and SHC, are likely to be involved in the regulation of SHIP1 dependent migration.

SHIP1 would be expected to metabolize the PI3K lipid product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2). However, it is not entirely clear at this time how such changes in phosphatidylinositol metabolism mediate biological effects. Mice with a disruption of the SHIP1 gene fail to thrive and develop a myeloproliferative disorder with extensive infiltration of myeloid cells in the lung (13Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P.

Also, marrow progenitor cells of these mice are hyper-responsive to hematopoietic growth factors (13Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F.

In cell line models, SHIP1 negatively regulates growth, differentiation, or migration, and it may have an important role in apoptosis (2Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A.

The enzyme activity of SHIP1 has not been shown to change after receptor activation, suggesting that relocation of SHIP1 to the cell membrane may be critical for signaling (18Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, transient interaction of SHIP1 with signaling complexes associated with transmembrane receptors or membrane-associated proteins is likely to be important in regulating its function. In addition to its enzymatic activity as a regulator of bioactive phospholipids, SHIP1 can also function as an adaptor protein. SHIP1 was originally identified as a SHC-binding protein, an interaction later shown to be mediated by the SH2 domain of SHIP1 (15Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and by the protein tyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of SHC (2Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K.

Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Another prominent SHIP1-binding protein is the SH2 containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (21Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M.D. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10998-11001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2379-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Deleting the SH2 domain of SHIP1 impairs apoptotic activity and prevents tyrosine phosphorylation (15Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that SHIP1 may be involved in the regulation of several distinct signaling pathways. We have previously demonstrated that expression of SHIP1 is drastically reduced in cells transformed by the BCR/ABL oncogene (17Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T. Algate P.A. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7473-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). BCR/ABL is generated by the t(9,22) (q34;q11) Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation and is the transforming protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia (23Sattler M. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One feature of primary chronic myelogenous leukemia cells is altered adhesion to fibronectin and hypermotility (24Verfaillie C.M. McCarthy J.B. McGlave P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 25Salgia R. Li J.L. Ewaniuk D.S. Pear W. Pisick E. Burky S.A. Ernst T. Sattler M. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have shown that re-expression of SHIP1 in BCR/ABL-transformed cells reduces spontaneous Transwell migration (17Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T. Algate P.A. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7473-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism whereby SHIP1 regulates migration in normal and transformed cells is unknown. In this study, we have used a BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cell line with inducible SHIP1 expression as a model system to investigate the signaling activities of SHIP1. We demonstrate that Tyr917and Tyr1020 in SHIP1 are important for the effects of SHIP1 on migration, and serve as binding sites for DOK1, a signaling protein previously linked to the regulation of migration (26Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that the SHIP1·DOK1 complex contains P13K and the unique adapter protein CRKL, also previously linked to migration in hematopoietic cells (27Uemura N. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37525-37532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We propose that SHIP1 regulates migration through the DOK1·CRKL·PI3K complex, and that the loss of SHIP1 expression in BCR/ABL-transformed cells results in further activation of migration. Further studies will define the exact role of downstream targets of DOK1 and CRKL as well as their role in regulating migration. The murine hematopoietic line Ba/F3 was grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) WEHI-3B conditioned medium (as a source of murine IL-3). Ba/F3 cell lines transfected with a BCR/ABL cDNA (Ba/F3.p210), a TEL/ABL cDNA (Ba/F3.TEL/ABL), and a v-Abl cDNA (Ba/F3.vAbl) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with a plasmid containing the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (Ton.BaF.1, obtained from G. Q. Daley, MIT, Cambridge, MA) were transfected with a BCR/ABL cDNA (Ba/F3.p210.TetON) and cultured under the same conditions as the Ba/F3.p210 cell line. In some experiments Ba/F3 cells were deprived of growth factors for 18 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 40 μg/ml leupeptin at 108 cells/ml buffer. Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and suspended vigorously every 5 min. Insoluble particles were precipitated by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 ×g. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation or directly analyzed through immunoblotting. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates by incubation with the primary antibody and Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose beads in lysis buffer for 2 or 18 h at 4 °C and finally washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Proteins were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-7.5% PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to ImmobilonTMpolyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at 25 °C or 18 h at 4 °C in 5% (w/v) fat-free dry milk powder in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl). The membrane was washed three times for 5 min in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS), incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h at 25 °C or 18 h at 4 °C, washed three times for 5 min in TBST, and incubated in the secondary HRP-coupled antibody (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:5000 dilution in TBST; anti-goat, Santa Cruz Laboratories, 1:10000 dilution in 5% (w/v) fat-free dry-milk powder in TBST) for 1 h. HRP activity was detected using HRP substrates (Enhanced Luminol Reagent-kit for immunoblotting, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and X-Omat Blue XB-1-film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Druker, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against SHIP1 (clone P1C1), DOK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ABL (clone 3F12), and CRKL (clone 3-5, for immunoblotting only) were used for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against p85PI3K (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), CRKL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, for immunoprecipitations only), and CBL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred after SDS-PAGE to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked for 18 h at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in PB-T (0.1% Tween 20 in 25 mm sodium phosphate solution (pH 7.2). The membrane was then washed in PB-T two times for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by incubation in GST fusion protein solution (60 μg of GST fusion protein in binding buffer (5% (v/v) 0.5 m sodium phosphate solution, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 5.0), 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% (w/v) fat-free dry milk powder, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 40 μg/ml leupeptin)) for 2 h at 25 °C. After washing in PB-T six times for 10 min at 25 °C, the membrane was incubated in anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500 in 40 ml binding buffer) for 2 h at 25 °C. Membrane was washed again in PB-T six times for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation in HRP-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000 in binding buffer) at 25 °C. The membrane was then washed in PB-T 6 times for 10 min at 25 °C. HRP activity was detected using HRP substrates (Enhanced Luminol Reagent-kit for Western blotting, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and X-Omat Blue XB-1-film (Kodak). Bacterial expression vectors for GST fusion proteins of the murine SHIP SH2 domain, the murine DOK PTB domain, the CRKL SH2, and the CRKL SH3 domain were used. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and isolated from sonicated bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's directions. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pBluescript-SHIP1 plasmid (2Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Complementary overlapping oligonucleotides were synthesized for altering Tyr917 to Phe and Tyr1020 to Phe. Relevant regions were sequenced to confirm successful mutagenesis. The murine SHIP1 wild type and mutant cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pTRE expression vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The pTRE-SHIP1 expression construct was used for transfection into Ba/F3.p210.TetON cells. For Transwell migration experiments pTRE-SHIP1 constructs were co-transfected with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expression construct (EGFP-C1, CLONTECH Laboratories). EGFP positive cells were sorted 1 day after transfection using a Coulter Epics Altra or Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Corp. Miami, FL). SHIP1 expression was induced 1 day after transfection by treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The lower chamber of a Transwell plate (8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) was filled with 600 μl of starvation media (0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in RPMI 1640). Cells were counted using a Coulter particle counter (Coulter Counter Z2, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and resuspended at 2 × 106cells/ml in starvation media. 100 μl of this cell suspension was transferred to the upper chamber. The medium contained either doxycycline (1 μg/ml) or no stimulus in the control samples. After 2.5 h, cells in the lower compartment were resuspended and counted using a Coulter particle counter. The spontaneous Transwell migration of cells was expressed as a “migration index” (number of migrating cells treated with doxycycline divided by the number of migrating cells left untreated). The standard error of the mean was calculated from the migration indices of independently performed experiments. The statistical significance of the data was analyzed using the Student'st test. We and others have previously shown that SHIP1 is a negative regulator of cell migration (14Kim C.H. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Helgason C.D. Yew S. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T. Algate P.A. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7473-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, none of the known signaling pathways associated with SHIP1 have been directly linked to this process. Furthermore, we have shown that loss of SHIP1 expression in BCR/ABL-transformed cells enhances migration (17Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T. Algate P.A. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7473-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate migration in these cells, we looked for novel SHIP1-associated signaling complexes in BCR/ABL-transformed cells. To visualize SHIP1-containing complexes, it was helpful to overexpress SHIP1 in BCR/ABL-transformed cells. A doxycycline inducible expression system was used to increase SHIP1 expression by severalfold in Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells compared with the untreated cells or the Ba/F3.p210.pTRE cells (Fig. 1 A, left panel). However, there was slightly increased expression of SHIP1 in untreated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells compared with untreated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE cells, likely indicating that the promotor is leaky. Re-expression of the SHIP1 protein in Ba/F3.p210 cells led to the co-immunoprecipitation of additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 210, 190, 140, 120, and 50–70 kDa. Association of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with SHIP1 of comparable molecular mass could also be observed in similar experiments with the parental Ba/F3.p210 cells when the blot was exposed for a long time (22Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2379-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 62-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that co-immunoprecipitated with SHIP1 was identified as DOK1 (Fig. 1 A, left bottom panel). These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-DOK1 followed by immunoblotting with anti-SHIP1 using lysates of Ba/F3.p210 cells re-expressing SHIP1 (Fig.1 A, right panel). We also found PI3K co-precipitating with SHIP1 in doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP1 (Fig. 1 A, left bottom panel). In contrast, there was only a very small amount of PI3K found to be constitutively associated with DOK1 when the blot was exposed for a long time (data not shown), indicating that inducible interaction of PI3K with SHIP1 was not mediated through interaction with DOK1. Immunoprecipitations of SHIP1 and DOK1 showed overlapping phosphotyrosine patterns, suggesting that both proteins were in the same signaling complex in these cells. The above results suggest the potential formation of a multimeric signaling complex including SHIP1 and DOK1. Since SHIP1 has one SH2 domain and DOK1 has a PTB domain, we sought to determine the mechanism of binding of SHIP1 to DOK1 using GST fusion proteins containing the phosphotyrosine interaction domains of each protein. Similar to the previous experiments, we used lysates of untreated and doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP and Ba/F3.p210.pTRE cells to test the interaction of SHIP1 with DOK1 (Fig. 1 B). The SH2 domain of SHIP1 precipitated both SHIP1 and DOK1 from lysates of doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP and a small amount of DOK1 from untreated cells. The BCR/ABL oncoprotein itself was found to precipitate with the SHIP1 SH2 domain in untreated as well as in doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE and Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells. In contrast, the PTB domain of DOK1 precipitated SHIP1 and a small amount of BCR/ABL only from lysates of doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells. Neither BCR/ABL, SHIP1, nor DOK1 were found to bind to GST alone. The in vitro GST fusion protein precipitations with SHIP1 and DOK1 did not indicate whether binding of the SH2 or PTB domains was direct or indirect. A protein overlay assay was used to identify directin vitro interactions. Cellular lysates from untreated and doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells were used for immunoprecipitations with anti-SHIP1 and anti-DOK1 antibodies. GST protein alone did not bind to SHIP1 or DOK1 proteins in immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1 C, top left panel). Direct binding of a single 145-kDa protein band in SHIP1 immunoprecipitates using the GST-DOK1-PTB protein as a probe was found in Ba/F3.p210 cells re-expressing SHIP1 (Fig. 1 C, top right panel). A weak interaction between the SHIP1 SH2 domain and DOK1 was detected in SHIP1 overexpressing cells, but the SHIP1-SH2 domain did not bind to SHIP1 itself (Fig. 1 C, bottom right panel). We also observed direct in vitro binding of the SHIP1 SH2 domain to BCR/ABL that was increased in SHIP1 over-expressing cells. These data suggest that overexpression of SHIP1 protects the dephosphorylation of DOK1 and BCR/ABL on a site that is important for binding the SHIP1-SH2 domain. Thus, DOK1 is linked through its PTB domain to SHIP1, whereas the SH2 domain of SHIP1 is only involved in a weak interaction with DOK1. Since SHIP1 has two binding sites for the PTB domain of SHC, we also tested if these sites regulate binding to the DOK1-PTB domain. Full-length SHIP1 and the SHC-binding mutants of SHIP1 containing the Y917F and Y1020F substitutions in the SHC-binding site (28Lamkin T.D. Walk S.F. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were expressed in Ba/F3.p210.TetON cells. The cells were treated with doxycycline to induce SHIP1 expression. Cells transfected with the SHIP1 containing vectors expressed high levels of SHIP1 compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1 D, left panel). Using the DOK1-PTB domain, a significant amount of SHIP1 was found to precipitate from cells re-expressing SHIP1, but not from cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1 D, right panel). The amount of SHIP1 tyrosine mutants precipitating with the DOK1-PTB domain was reduced significantly when compared with wild type SHIP1. These data are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that optimal binding of the SHC PTB domain to SHIP1 is reduced but not abolished by mutating either tyrosine (28Lamkin T.D. Walk S.F.

Since DOK1 has previously been shown to co-precipitate with CRKL in BCR/ABL-transformed cells (29Bhat A. Johnson K.J. Oda T. Corbin A.S. Druker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32360-32368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we also asked if CRKL was found in the complex with SHIP1. Ba/F3.p210.pTRE and Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells were either left untreated or treated with doxycycline and CRKL protein was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysate. SHIP1 was found to co-precipitate with CRKL only when re-expressed in Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP (Fig.2 A). We also found PI3K in this complex which we had previously demonstrated to bind constitutively to the CRKL SH3 domain (30Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Pisick E. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10248-10253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SHIP1 was not found in a complex with CRKL in Ba/F3.p210.pTRE or unstimulated Ba/F3 cells (not shown). Next, the molecular interactions of CRKL with SHIP1 using GST fusion proteins of the SHIP-SH2, CRKL-SH2, or CRKL-SH3 domains were determined. We did not observe significant co-precipitation of CRKL in lysates of Ba/F3.p210 cells (not shown). In contrast, SHIP1 co-precipitated with the CRKL-SH2 domain when re-expressed in Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells (Fig. 2 B). As a control, we also showed binding of the CRKL-SH3 domain to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (30Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Pisick E. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10248-10253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and binding of the CRKL-SH2 domain to p120CBL(31Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). Re-expression of SHIP1 did not significantly alter either interaction. Since SHIP1 contains Tyr-X-X-Pro motifs, potential binding sites for the CRKL SH2 domain, we also determined if there was direct in vitro interaction between SHIP1 and CRKL. GST or a GST-CRKL fusion proteins were used for protein overlay experiments with CRKL and CBL immunoprecipitations of untreated and doxycycline-treated Ba/F3.p210.pTRE-SHIP cells. The CRKL-SH2 domain was found to bind in SHIP1 immunoprecipitations to a 145-kDa protein in cells re-expressing SHIP1 (Fig. 2 C). In addition, the CRKL SH2 domain was found to bind to proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 55 and 70 kDa in SHIP1 immunoprecipitations. As a positive control, the CRKL SH2 domain bound to CBL in CBL immunoprecipitations. These data suggest that there was direct in vitro binding of CRKL through its SH2 domain to SHIP1. We next investigated the potential interaction of SHIP1 with DOK1 and CRKL in cells that are transformed by activated forms of Abl, different from BCR/ABL, including TEL/ABL and v-Abl. Cells transformed by activated forms of ABL have increased levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins compared with untransformed cells. Both Ba/F3.TEL/ABL- and Ba/F3.v-Abl-transforme"

LMP1 is essential for B-cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus and transforms rodent fibroblasts. It activates many distinct signaling pathways including the transcription factors NFκB and AP1. We have generated a mutant of LMP1 with four point mutations; amino acids 204, 206, and 208 were mutated to alanine, and amino acid 384 was mutated to glycine. This mutant, termed LMP1AAAG, is not only unable to activate nuclear signaling pathways, but also inhibits signaling from wild type LMP1. We have demonstrated the effectiveness, selectivity, and mechanism of this inhibitory molecule. It inhibits LMP1-stimulated NFκB, STAT, and Jun transcriptional activity. It is selective, as it does not inhibit TNF or interleukin-2 signaling. We have demonstrated that it does not sequester the downstream signaling molecule, TRAF2, but instead binds LMP1 and interferes with its ability to bind TRAF2. This demonstrates the importance of the interplay between the signaling domains of LMP1 and the oligomeric structure of LMP1 for effective signaling. It identifies a tool that will be useful to probe LMP1 function in disease. Latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is a signaling molecule expressed by Epstein-Barr virus during latency.

LMP1 is a 63-kDa integral membrane protein in which three signaling domains have been characterized (Fig. 1 A). The protein has six hydrophobic transmembrane segments and is thought to spontaneously oligomerize to stimulate intracellular pathways. The three signaling domains are entitled C-terminal activating region-1 (CTAR1), CTAR2, and CTAR3 (13Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M.

Both of these domains can activate NFκB transcriptional activity independently but they function optimally together (21Floettmann J.E. Eliopoulos A.G. Jones M. Young L.S. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, activation of the p38 kinase pathway is also mediated via both CTAR1 and CTAR2 (22Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16085-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In contrast, LMP1 activates the JNK kinase pathways via CTAR2 (23Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Young L.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kieser A. Kaiser C. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2511-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The activation of NFκB and p38 have been shown to be required for a number of LMP1-regulated genes, demonstrating the importance of these pathways (22Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M.

Kaiser C. Zeidler R. Scheffer B. Ueffing M. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3064-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This has been suggested to bind Jak 3 and activate the DNA binding of STAT1 (14Gires O. Kohlhuber F. Kilger E. Baumann M. Kieser A. Kaiser C. Zeidler R. Scheffer B. Ueffing M. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3064-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). No function has been ascribed to the activation of the Jak-STAT pathway by LMP1, and the interaction of CTAR3 with the other signaling domains of LMP1 remains to be elucidated. The functional domains of LMP1 were initially identified by deletional analysis. Recently, more detailed analysis has identified point mutations of critical residues that can abolish functions. By comparison of the LMP1 sequence with the functional domains of CD40, a P XQ XT motif in CTAR1 was identified and substitution of the critical Pro204/Gln206/Thr208residues to alanines abolished TRAF binding and NFκB activation from the CTAR1 of LMP1 (16Devergne O.

In the CTAR2 region, substitution of a critical Tyr384 residue completely abolished TRADD binding, and the activation of NFκB and AP1 (24Kieser A. Kaiser C. Hammerschmidt W.

The critical residues in CTAR3 for Jak3 binding have not been identified. This project was instigated to test the hypothesis that mutation of LMP1 could yield not only a nonsignaling form of the protein but also generate a dominant inhibitor. We have generated such a mutant, LMP1AAAG, in which both CTAR1 and CTAR2 were inactivated by four point mutations: P204A, Q206A, T208A, and Y384G. This report describes the key features of the LMP1AAAG mutant which enhance our understanding of the mechanism of LMP1 signaling. First, this mutant is unexpectedly defective in the ability to activate a STAT-regulated reporter, a function that was shown to be regulated by CTAR3. Second, the LMP1AAAG mutant was found to function as a dominant inhibitory molecule when coexpressed with wild type LMP1. The efficiency, specificity and mechanism of the dominant negative molecule have been examined. Jurkat is a cell line derived from an EBV negative T cell lymphoma (30Brattsand G. Cantrell D.A. Ward S. Ivars F. Gullberg M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3651-3658PubMed Google Scholar). Eli-BL is an EBV-positive B cell line established from a Burkitt's lymphoma, and it displays a latency I form of infection in which Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 is the only viral protein detected (31Rowe M. Lear A.L. Croom-Carter D. Davies A.H. Rickinson A.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 122-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DG75 is an EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line. Kit225 is a human leukemic cell line (32Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H. Ohno H. Fukuhara S. Kita K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 70: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is dependent upon IL-2 for growth. The Kit225 cells were deprived of IL-2 for 24 h prior to transfection by washing the cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline. All the lymphoid cell lines were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine and antibiotics (200 units/ml penicillin and 200 μg/ml streptomycin), and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Plasmid pSG5-LMP1 expresses a wild type LMP1 cDNA derived from the B95.8 strain of EBV, under the control of the SV-40 promoter of the SG5 vector. The pSG5-LMP1Δ(1–128) encodes an LMP1 protein deleted for the first 128 amino acids and corresponds to the truncated from of LMP1 (tr.LMP1) expressed during lytic cycle in B95.8 cells (13Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). The pSG5-LMP1AAAG mutant was constructed in two steps. First, a pSG5-LMP1AAA mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis, (23Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Young L.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to mutate the codons 204–208 from P XQ XT to A XA XA. The LMP1 gene was then polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the pSG5-LMP1AAA mutant as a BglII fragment using a variant 3′primer (GAAGATCTTTAGTCATAGCCGCTTAGC) to mutate codon 384 from Tyr to Gly, and was cloned into the BglII site of pSG5 to create pSG5-LMP1AAAG. The presence of all the correct mutations was confirmed by sequencing. The same polymerase chain reaction product was also cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to generate the pEGFP/LMP1AAAG plasmid encoding a mutant LMP1AAAG protein with an N terminus GFP tag. Generation of the plasmid pSG5-CD2/LMP1 has been reported previously (29Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The TRAF2 expression vectors were kindly provided by Elliott Kieff (17Kaye K.M. Devergne O. Harada J.N. Izumi K.M. Yalamanchili R. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11085-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), pcDNA3-TRAF2Δ(6–86) encodes a dominant negative mutant form of TRAF2 that retains the ability to bind LMP1 but is unable to affect signaling functions such as activation of NFκB. The reporter plasmid, 3Enh-luc (33Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Fernandez B. Dominguez I. Jacque J.M. Thomas D. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Virelizier J.L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6596-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assay NFκB activity. The STAT reporter, GRR luciferase is the luciferase analog of the GRRCAT reporter described previously (34Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The lex-Jun fusion protein plasmid (from Dr. R. Treisman, ICRF, London) is a fusion of codons 3 to 199 of the bacterial protein, LexA and codons 1 to 194 of c-Jun, which contains the transactivation domain of Jun. The lex reporter has been described previously (35Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). For transient expression, 0.5 to 1.5 × 107 cells from a suspension culture were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Genepulser II electroporator at 270 or 280 V and 950 microfarads at room temperature in 500 μl of growth medium. The cells were reseeded in 5 ml of fresh growth medium and were then incubated under normal conditions. The activity of the luciferase reporter plasmids was measured 24 h post-transfection using a standard bioluminescence protocol (21Floettmann J.E. Eliopoulos A.G. Jones M. Young L.S. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.65% Nonidet P-40. Samples were then assayed for CAT activity by radioisotope method (34Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The induction of ICAM-1 protein in transfected cells was routinely assayed by immunofluorescence staining of viable cells, followed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur analyzer as described previously (21Floettmann J.E. Eliopoulos A.G. Jones M. Young L.S. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 48 h post-transfection the cells were washed and stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody to human CD54 (MCA675PE; Serotec) at 4 °C for 60 min. The transfected population was marked by the expression of co-transfected EGFP-C1 plasmid (CLONTECH), and the GFP-positive population was gated for analysis of ICAM-1 staining. For each immunoprecipitation, 15 × 106 cells of the DG75 line in 0.5 ml of growth medium were electroporated at 270 V and 950 microfarads with up to 20 μg of plasmid DNA as indicated in the Results section. At 24 h post-transfection, DG75 B-cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed for 45 min on ice in 800 μl of Nonidet P-40-lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES buffer, 0.25 m NaCl, 2 mmEDTA) to which a 5% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma; P8340) was added immediately prior to use. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the soluble fraction was then precleared for 4 h with 20 μl of Sepharose-Protein G or with Sepharose-Protein G to which 1 μg of control antibody had been covalently cross-linked. The precleared lysate was then incubated for 4 h with 20 μl of Sepharose-Protein G to which 1 μg of OX34 or a mixture of 0.5 μg of CS.3 and 0.5 μg of CS.4, had been covalently cross-linked. CS.3 and CS.4 bind epitopes in the repeat regions of LMP1. The immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times and eluted by boiling in 40 μl of SDS gel sample buffer. Half of the eluate was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting to detect LMP1 and TRAF2. For Western blotting analysis performed in parallel with reporter assays, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min on ice in luciferase lysis buffer and processed as described previously (36Rowe M. Jones M. Wilson J.B. Methods in Molecular Biology: Epstein-Barr Virus Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001Google Scholar). Typically, the lysates from 2 × 105cells was applied to each track of the gel. LMP1 was detected with the mouse monoclonal antibodies CS.1–4 used at 1 μg/ml, or with a 1/1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal serum raised to a β-galactosidase fusion protein containing 189 amino acids of the C terminus of LMP1 (37Rowe M. Evans H.S. Young L.S. Hennessy K. Kieff E. Rickinson A.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1575-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). TRAF2 was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies reactive with a C terminus epitope corresponding to amino acids 478–497 (Santa Cruz; sc876) and was used at 1 μg/ml. All primary antibody incubations were for 90 min at room temperature. For LMP1 staining, DG75 cells were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody to LMP1, LMPO25 (10 μg/ml), using standard protocols with Texas Red- conjugated anti-mouse IgG (EY Laboratories) as a secondary antibody. For two color analysis of GFP-tagged LMP1AAAG and CD2-tagged wild type LMP1, CD2 staining was performed using OX34 (10 μg/ml) and detected with Texas Red conjugate as described previously (38Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The cells were visualized on a Leica TCS4D confocal microscope. A Z series was performed and equatorial region was illustrated in all cases. To create a nonsignaling LMP1, a form of LMP1 was generated in which four of critical residues in CTAR1 and CTAR2 are mutated. A schematic of this mutant, called LMP1AAAG, is shown in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 A also shows a schematic of a rare but naturally occurring truncated LMP1 (tr.LMP1) that can be expressed in a limited number of strains of EBV, and is postulated to inhibit LMP1 function (39Erickson K.D. Martin J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1057-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These two mutants and a wild type form of LMP1 were expressed in DG75 B-cells and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). The molecular weight of the LMP1AAAG is the same as wild type LMP1 (compare second and third lanes of Fig. 1 B), whereas the truncated form (Fig. 1 B, 4th lane) runs at a reduced molecular weight. The ability of LMP1AAAG to activate LMP1 signaling pathways was tested. Jurkat cells were co-transfected with a range of amounts of an expression vector for wild type LMP1 or LMP1AAAGtogether with an NFκB reporter construct (3enh luciferase) that contains three copies of an NFκB-binding site upstream of the luciferase gene. After 18 h the cells were lysed and a luciferase assay was performed. Fig.2 A shows that while wild type LMP1 signals strongly to NFκB, LMP1AAAG does not activate NFκB reporter activity. This experiment was also performed in two B-cell lines, Eli-BL cells and DG75, and an epithelial cell line, 293. LMP1AAAG was not able to stimulate NFκB transcriptional activity in any of these lines (data not shown). It was possible that mutation of CTAR1 and CTAR2 would only affect signaling to pathways activated by CTAR1 and CTAR2. For this reason we tested the ability of LMP1 to trigger STAT transcriptional activity as LMP1 effects on STAT signaling have recently been mapped to a new domain entitled CTAR3 (Fig. 1 A). A GRR reporter assay was chosen to test for STAT transcriptional activity. This is a well characterized reporter construct based on the STAT-binding site from the FcγR promoter. It has been shown to bind various STATs (34Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 40Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and has been used as a reporter in many different studies (34Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Eli-BL cells were co-transfected with the GRR reporter (10 μg) together with various amounts of both wild type LMP1 and LMP1AAAG expression vectors. Fig. 2 B shows that while wild type LMP1 was able to stimulate GRR luciferase transcriptional activity, LMP1AAAG showed no stimulatory capacity for this reporter. This was somewhat surprising and suggests that either CTAR1 or CTAR2 are required for the activation of STAT transcriptional activity. Protein expression of LMP1AAAG was examined to demonstrate that the mutant expressed at a similar level to wild type. Fig.2 C shows the results from the expression of wild type and LMP1AAAG in Eli-BL cells. Cells were transfected with a range of amounts of an LMP1 expression vector, cells were lysed, and cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-LMP1 antibody (CS.1–4) and similar levels of both wt LMP1 and LMP1AAAG were seen (Fig. 2 C). Similar data were also obtained with DG75 and 293 cells (data not shown). Since the LMP1AAAG could not activate LMP1 signaling pathways, it was postulated that it may be able to inhibit wild type LMP1 activity by preventing the formation of a functional signaling complex. NFκB transcriptional activity was tested by co-transfection of the reporter with various amounts of an expression vector for wild type LMP1 (from 0.1 to 4 μg) in combination with a constant 5 μg of LMP1AAAG. Fig.3 A shows that expression of LMP1AAAG dramatically inhibits the activation of NFκB by wild type LMP1. A ratio of 1 μg of wild type LMP1 plasmid to 5 μg of LMP1AAAG plasmid inhibited NFκB transcriptional activity by greater than 90%. Over a number of experiments, the expression of equal levels of LMP1AAAG to wild type LMP1 inhibited signaling by 50–75%, demonstrating the efficiency of the mutant. A dose response of LMP1AAAG (0–12 μg) was tested with a fixed amount of wild type LMP1 expression vector (2 μg) (Fig.3 B). This shows that the inhibition correlates with amount of LMP1AAAG. A naturally occurring truncated LMP1, tr.LMP1, which lacks amino acids 1–127, has been postulated to inhibit LMP1 signaling (39Erickson K.D. Martin J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1057-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We compared the LMP1AAAG mutant with the putative inhibitory effects of the truncated from of LMP1 (Fig. 3 C). A direct comparison of the two molecules suggests that a much lower level of expression of LMP1AAAG is efficient relative to tr.LMP1 (compare 3rd bar with 5th bar and 4th bar with 6th bar). In this experiment, the co-transfection of 3 μg of LMP1AAAG expression vector inhibited wild type LMP1 activation of NFκB by greater than 90%, whereas 3 μg of the expression vector for tr.LMP1 had very little effect. Two other nuclear signals stimulated by LMP1 were also tested. The STAT reporter (GRR luciferase) was tested in Eli-BL cells (Fig. 4 A). This showed that LMP1AAAG effectively inhibited STAT transcriptional activity stimulated by LMP1. A Jun-transactivation assay was also performed (Fig. 4 B). Jurkat cells were co-transfected with a mammalian expression vector for a chimeric protein with the DNA-binding domain from the bacterial lex protein and the transactivation domain of c-Jun (amino acids 1–194) (41Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) together with a reporter that contains two binding sites for lex- protein upstream of the CAT gene (35Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). This reporter therefore gives a measurement of Jun phosphorylation in vivo, which requires the activity of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38 stress activated protein kinase. When co-transfected with this reporter, LMP1 could induce Jun transactivation, and this activation was inhibited by coexpression of the LMP1AAAG (Fig. 4 B). It is important to demonstrate that the LMP1AAAG can also block downstream biological functions of LMP1, i.e.endogenous protein changes, and not just affect reporter constructs. Fig. 5 demonstrates that LMP1AAAG efficiently inhibits the LMP1-mediated induction of the ICAM-1 (CD54) adhesion molecule. Jurkat cells were co-transfected with a GFP vector and a wild type LMP1 plasmid. The GFP vector allows the identification of transfected cells by flow cytometry. The cells were left for 48 h and expression of ICAM-1 was determined using phycoerythrin-conjugated CD54 antibodies and flow cytometric analysis. Fig. 5 A (top panel) shows the expression of ICAM-1 in Jurkat cells transfected with EGFP and control vector DNA. When Jurkat cells were transfected with the GFP-LMP1AAAG expression vector no increase in ICAM-1 levels was detected demonstrating that LMP1AAAG could not signal effectively (Fig. 5 A, 2nd panel). In contrast, cells transfected with wild type LMP1 and EGFP expression vectors showed a dramatic increase in ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 5 A, 3rd panel). This can be represented in two ways. The first consists of determining the percentage of cells whose fluorescence intensity crosses an arbitrary threshold gate. In the example shown in Fig. 5 A, expression of wt LMP1 caused an increase from 2.7 to 34.2% of ICAM-1 positive cells. The effects upon ICAM-1 can also be determined by measuring the increase in mean fluorescence intensity which, in Fig.5 A, shows a 3-fold increase in the level of expression of ICAM-1 caused by expression of wt LMP1 (control transfectant, mean fluorescence intensity of 68; wt LMP1 transfectant, mean fluorescence intensity 195). When wild type LMP1 and GFP-LMP1AAAG expression vectors were co-transfected, no increase in either the percentage of positive cells or the mean fluorescence intensity was detected (Fig. 5 A, compare top and bottom panels). A dose response of LMP1 plasmid was performed in the presence and absence of a constant amount of LMP1AAAG. Whether the data are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5 B) or as a percentage of ICAM-1 positive cells (not shown), LMP1AAAG dramatically inhibits LMP1 signaling. These results demonstrate that LMP1AAAG can inhibit endogenous cellular gene expression in addition to synthetic reporter genes. The usefulness of a dominant-negative molecule is enhanced if it is also specific for its intended target. We therefore examined whether LMP1AAAG might interfere with the signaling pathways activated by other receptor molecules. The selectivity of the LMP1AAAG inhibitor was tested in two different systems. Jurkat cells were transfected with the 3enh (NFκB) luciferase reporter and increasing amounts of the LMP1AAAGvector. The cells were left overnight to ensure expression, and were then stimulated with TNF. The results in Fig.6 A show that doses of LMP1AAAG which inhibit wt LMP1 signaling by more than 75% had no effect on TNF activation of NFκB. The LMP1AAAGmolecule retains the putative Jak3-binding site (CTAR3) and while it appears unable to signal to STAT transcriptional activity, it could theoretically act to sequester Jak3 and thus inhibit Jak 3-dependent signaling from other receptors. This possibility was tested in Kit225 cells, a leukemic cell line that is stimulated by the cytokine, IL-2. In these cells, IL-2 utilizes Jak3"

Treatment of GEO cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5 azacytidine induced RI expression and restored TGF-beta response. A stably transfected RI promoter-reporter construct (RI-Luc) expressed higher activity in the 5 aza C treated GEO cells, suggesting the activation of a transactivator for RI transcription. Gel shift analysis indicated enhanced binding of proteins from the 5 aza C treated nuclear extracts to radiolabeled Sp1 oligonucleotides specifically contained in the RI promoter. Protein stability studies after cyclohexamide treatment suggested an increase in the Sp1 protein stability from the 5 aza C treated GEO cells. Further, transfection of Sp1 cDNA into untreated GEO control cells increased RI promoter activity and thus induced RI expression. 5 aza C mediated Sp1 expression in Sp1 deficient GEO colon and MCF-7 breast cancer cells also enhanced the activity of several other Sp1 dependent promoters such as TGF-beta receptor type II (RII), Cyclin A and p21/waf1/cip1. These results indicate that restoration of Sp1 in several different types of Sp1 deficient cells leads to enhanced activation of a wide range of Sp1 dependent promoters."

The two isoforms possess different biological properties; however, little is known about the intracrine regulatory mechanisms involved in the biological effects of the HMW FGF-2 isoform. Using pancreatic cells stably transfected with cDNAs leading to the expression of either the HMW FGF-2 (A3 cells) or the LMW form (A5 cells), we provide evidence that the two FGF-2 isoforms differentially modulate PKC levels. The LMW FGF-2 up-regulated the PKC ε levels by 1.6-fold; by contrast the HMW isoform down-regulated the level of this PKC isotype by about 3-fold and increased the amount of PKC δ by 1.7-fold. PKC mRNAs were also modified, suggesting that PKC expression was regulated at a pretranslational level. Additionally, expression of different levels of the HMW FGF-2 with an inducible expression system confirmed the role of this isoform on PKC δ and ε expressions. Increased activation of ERK-1 and -2 was also observed in cells expressing the HMW FGF-2. By using different PKC inhibitors and a dominant negative PKC δ, it was found that ERK activation was PKC δ-dependent. These data indicate that expression of HMW FGF-2 can modify PKC levels by acting at the intracellular level and that the overexpression of PKC δ induces ERK-1/2 activation. The expression of a dominant negative FGFR1 did not reduce ERK-1/2 activation by the HMW FGF-2, suggesting that ERK activation does not require FGFR activity.

Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In tumors, it is one of the key factors regulating growth, blood supply, and invasiveness. These pleiotropic effects have been related to the binding of FGF-2 to high affinity FGF receptors or their splice variants and to low affinity binding sites (2Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). However, FGF-2 possesses some peculiar features supporting the involvement of other regulatory mechanisms in the final biological effects. Indeed, FGF-2 is synthesized from a single mRNA as five different isoforms with molecular masses of 18, 22, 22.5, 24, and 34 kDa through alternative translation at AUG and CUG start codons (3Prats H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The initiation of translation at the AUG codon gives rise to a peptide of 155 amino acids, and the initiation at the four CUG codons is responsible for the synthesis of the other isoforms that possess N-terminal extensions containing nuclear localization sequences (5Arnaud E.

Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Confocal and immunohistochemical analysis show that these nuclear localization sequence-containing isoforms are predominantly localized in the nucleus and more precisely in the nucleoplasmic compartment; no labeling is found at the cell surface and in the extracellular spaces (1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 8Monzat V. Ratovo G. Estival A. Fanjul M. Bertrand C. Clement B. Vaysse N. Hollande E.

Usually the import process across the nuclear pore complex involves the activity of transport factors not yet characterized for FGF-2. All FGF-2 isoforms lack leader consensus secretory sequences. However, the LMW peptide (155 aa) can be secreted through still unclear mechanisms requiring energy and cooperation with heat shock proteins and Na+,K+-ATPase (11Piotrowicz R.S. Martin J.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 544-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After an endocytotic process small amounts of this LMW peptide can be specifically targeted to the nucleolar compartment (13Baldin V. Roman A.M. Bosc-Bierne I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The nuclear translocation of FGF-2 seems to be correlated with the nuclear import of the type 1 FGF receptor (FGFR1) (for review see Ref. 14Stachowiak M.K. Moffet J. Maher P. Tucholski J. Stachowiak E.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The selective expression of either the LMW or the HMW form of 210 amino acids in different cell types induces different and even opposite effects. For instance, expression of the LMW form enhances cell migration (10Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J.

By contrast, the HMW form specifically promotes, at the difference of the LMW form, growth at low serum concentration (0–1%) (10Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) inhibit the biological effects of the extracellular FGF-2, but they do not modify those evoked by the HMW FGF-2. Thus, the LMW isoform regulates cell functions predominantly through auto-paracrine mechanisms, whereas the larger ones exert their biological effects via an “intracrine” pathway, independent of the activation of cell surface FGF receptors (for reviews see Refs. 1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 14Stachowiak M.K. Moffet J. Maher P. Tucholski J. Stachowiak E.K. Mol.

The signaling pathways involved in intracrine regulations are still poorly known. It has been postulated that the colocalization of HMW FGF-2 and FGFR1 in the nuclear matrix might reflect the existence of FGF receptor activation at the nuclear level (14Stachowiak M.K. Moffet J. Maher P. Tucholski J. Stachowiak E.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We previously reported a reduced adenylate cyclase activity in cells expressing the HMW peptide, which was found to play a positive role on cell growth (19Estival A. Robberecht P. Fanjul M. Rouot B. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, this modification cannot fully explain the increased proliferation in low serum. Because some PKC isotypes are involved either positively or negatively in the proliferation rate of many cell types (24Martelli A.M. Sang N. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Neri L.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 499-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we sought to examine the effects of the HMW FGF-2 peptide of 210 aa on PKC levels and functions. For that purpose, we analyzed either stably transfected cells or cells transiently transfected with a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system (25Gossen M. Freundlib S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar), and the cell model used was the well differentiated pancreatic cell line AR4-2J. These cells were transfected with point mutated FGF-2 cDNAs leading to the expression either of the LMW of 155 aa or of the HMW isoform of 210 aa (16Estival A. Louvel D. Couderc B. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported here demonstrate that the HMW peptide modified the expression of PKC ε and δ and ERK-1 and -2 activities via a receptor-independent pathway. AR4-2J cells and the different transfected cells were maintained in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Trypsin (0.05%) and EDTA (0.02%) (Biowhittaker, France) were used to dissociate the cells for successive passages, and medium was replaced every 2 days. Cultures were regularly checked for the absence of contamination by mycoplasma. Cells were routinely plated at the density of 15 000 cells/cm2 in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Media were changed the day before PKC or ERK analysis to standardize the experimental conditions. For FGF-2 stimulation, after an overnight attachment medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM and buffered at pH 7.3 with 20 mm Hepes containing 2 nm FGF-2. To analyze the effect of the PKC inhibitors, cells were cultured in DMEM and buffered at pH 7.2 with 20 mm Hepes containing 0 or 2.5% fetal calf serum. Gö 6976 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was used at the concentration of 50 nm to inhibit the conventional PKCs. GF109203X (Calbiochem), which belongs to the group of bisindolylmaleimide derivatives, was used at the concentration of 1 μm to inhibit PKC α, δ, and ε, and rottlerin (Calbiochem), which specifically inhibits PKC δ, was used at the concentration of 6 nm (26Qatsha K.A.

These drugs were solubilized in Me2SO and used in cultures at the final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO. Control cells were grown in the presence of the solvent. The retroviral infection of AR4-2J cells was described previously (16Estival A. Louvel D. Couderc B. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar). Geneticin-resistant cells were shown to express low levels of FGF-2. Transfected cells synthesizing the HMW FGF-2 isoform of 210 aa were called A3, and cells expressing the LMW isoform of 155 aa were called A5. Control CAT cells were obtained by transfecting AR4-2J cells with the vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Any of these transfected cell lines has been cloned. The pTet-Off vector expresses the tetracycline repressor tTA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (25Gossen M. Freundlib S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). The HMW FGF-2 cDNA (a generous gift of Dr H. Prats, INSERM U 397, Toulouse, France) was inserted in the multiple cloning site of the pTRE vector (CLONTECH). In this gene expression system the HMW FGF-2 expression is induced by decreasing the concentrations of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline, in the culture medium. Control CAT cells were transiently cotransfected with the two vectors in the presence of 2000 ng/ml doxycycline. After 8 h of transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were grown in the presence of decreasing concentrations of doxycycline (from 2000 to 0 ng/ml). Native PKC δ cloned in pCO2 vector and the mutated T505A PKC δ cloned in pcDNA3 were kindly provided by Dr P.J. Parker (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). The dominant negative FGFR1 construct (FGFR1dn) corresponds to FGFR1 truncated at residue 405. The resulting protein contains the transmembrane region but is devoid of most of the intracellular domain and lacks kinase activity. The FGFR1dn construct was used to transfect CAT and A3 cells. All transfections were performed by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (28Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Total RNA, previously heated 10 min at 94 °C, was reverse transcribed at 39 °C in the presence of 1 mm each dNTP, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega, Charbonnières, France), 0.25 μg/μl oligo(dT) and 2 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reverse transcriptase buffer contained 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. After 10 min at 23 °C and a 1-h incubation at 39 °C, the reaction was stopped at 94 °C, 5 min. Amplification was then carried out in a final volume of 100 μl, with 0.5 μg of cDNA, 2.5 units/μl Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the same buffer, and 500 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer. All reactions were performed for 35 cycles with cycling times of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and 1.30 min at 72 °C. Primers were synthesized by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Primers were chosen on the basis of the cDNA sequences of the rat PKC isotypes (GenBankTMdata base), and the absence of cross-reactivity among the different PKCs was checked. The following primers were used: for PKC α , 5′-GATGAAATGCGACACCTGCG-3′ from 387 to 406 bp and 5′-AGGGCTGATGACTTTGTTTCC-3′ from 940 to 960 bp; for PKC δ, 5′-CCCTGAGTGGAAGTCAACATTCG-3′ from 156 to 178 and 5′-GAAGATGGTGTCCCGGCTATTGG-3′ from 638 to 660; for PKC ε, 5′-CAAAATCTGCGAGGCCGTGAGC-3′ from 30 to 51 and 5′-GCATCCGCTCCCTAAACACTCG-3′ from 433 to 454 bp; and for PKC ζ, 5′-AGGTGACCCTTGTACTGTGTCC-3′ from 192 to 213 pb and 5′-CATCGTTCTTGTCATCTACTGG-3′ from 580 to 601 pb. Sizes of amplified products corresponded to those expected according to the position of the primers in the PKC cDNA sequence. The specificity of the polymerase chain reaction products was further checked by using restriction enzymes selected according to the sequence of each cDNA by using computer analysis (PC/GENE, IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA). For each PKC, two sets of restriction endonucleases were used: one able to cut only at one restriction point, and the second one unable to cut the amplified product. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method, and Northern blot analysis of PKCs was performed as described previously (29Estival A. Clerc P. Vaysse N. Tam J.P. Clemente F. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1851-1859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nylon sheets were prehybridized for 6 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's, 6× SSC, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C in the same medium with PKC probes (lengths from 409 to 573 bp) 32P-labeled by nick translation. Blots were washed twice for 30 min at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS, then dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films at −70 °C or quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Blanchard, Institut de Génétique Moléculaire, Montpellier) was used as internal standard. Cells were grown 24 h in a serum-free medium buffered at pH 7.3 with 20 mm Hepes. After washings with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet-P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA) containing both protease (Pefabloc; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10 000 ×g. Protein was determined on the supernatant using the BCA assay (Pierce). FGF-2, PKCs or ERK-1 and -2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Polyscreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The different proteins were then revealed by using specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), directed against FGF-2, PKC isotypes, or ERK-1/2. The anti-ERK-1/2 antibody (sc-1647) reacts to a lesser extent with ERK-1 (p44) than with ERK-2 (p42). An anti-β-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used to evaluate equivalent loadings. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an ECL assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). ERK-1 and -2 phosphorylation was analyzed with an anti-phosphorylated ERK-1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ERK activity was measured on the myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as substrate (30Lengye E. Singh B. Gum R. Nerlov C. Sabichi A. Birrer M. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2639-2648PubMed Google Scholar). After cell lysis, equal amounts of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-ERK-1/2 antibody and protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated complexes were incubated with MBP in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP (1 mCi/assay). The labeled MBP was quantified with a PhosphorImager. Cells plated at 100,000 cells/35-mm dish were grown in Hepes-buffered (20 mm) serum-deprived medium at pH 7.3. Cells were incubated with suramin (400 μm) or neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies (5 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in the absence or presence of 0.1 nmrFGF-2 for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was analyzed as described above. Cells seeded at the concentration of 100,000 cells/35-mm dish were transfected with the tet-off expression system. After transfection, cells were grown in Hepes-buffered (20 mm) serum-deprived medium at pH 7.3, with or without doxycycline. 24 h after the beginning of doxycycline treatment, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of the 25 mm hypotonic Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing inhibitors of proteases (Pefabloc) and phosphatases (25 mmNaF and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate). Then cells were sonicated three times for 5 s at 4 °C and spun at 100 ×g for 5 min to discard the nonlyzed cells. The supernatant corresponding to the total PKC was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The 100,000 × g resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. This 100,000 × g pellet corresponds to the particulate fraction (31Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and revealed with the anti-PKC δ antibody as described above. To analyze the serine-phosphorylated PKC δ, equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with the anti-δ PKC antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE, and revealed with an anti-serine antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) Statistical significance was determined according to the unpaired Student's t test. Confocal analysis of AR42J cells stably transfected with the mutated cDNA encoding the FGF-2 of 210 aa (A3 cells) showed its localization in the nucleus but not at the cell surface or in the extracellular compartment (8Monzat V. Ratovo G. Estival A. Fanjul M. Bertrand C. Clement B. Vaysse N. Hollande E. Clemente F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar). We first analyzed total cell extracts by Western blots to find out whether FGF-2 expression modified PKC levels. PKC α, δ, and ε were found expressed in parental AR4-2J and FGF-2 producing cells, and they exhibited apparent molecular masses of 80, 76, and 96 kDa, respectively. Fig. 1 summarizes the results obtained in A3 cells expressing the FGF-2 of 210 aa, compared with those of A5 cells expressing the FGF-2 of 155 aa and with those of control CAT cells. In A3 cells PKC δ was significantly up-regulated by a factor of 1.7, whereas PKC ε was strongly decreased by about a factor of 3. In contrast, in A5 cells only the level of PKC ε was significantly different from that in control CAT cells, with a 1.6-fold increase. To further define the role of the HMW FGF-2 in the modulation of the PKC levels, cells were transiently transfected with the tet-off transcription regulation system to regulate the expression of the HMW FGF-2 (25Gossen M. Freundlib S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). In this system the transactivator tTA regulates a synthetic promoter composed of the tetracycline operator. The plasmid expressing the tTA transactivator was cotransfected with the plasmid containing the HMW FGF-2 cDNA inserted downstream the tetracycline operator. The presence of tetracycline or its analogue doxycycline prevents binding of the transactivator to the promoter and reduces the expression of the HMW FGF-2. Transfected cells displayed a doxycycline-dependent down-regulation of the HMW FGF-2 expression (Fig. 2). Only this FGF-2 isoform was found produced whatever the doxycycline concentration (Fig.2), indicating that the HMW FGF-2 did not modulate in the transfected cells the expression of endogenous FGF-2. The maximal level of HMW FGF-2 expressed in transiently transfected cells was comparable with that of A3 cells, as observed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). PKC δ and ε levels were modulated by the concentration of the HMW FGF-2 (Fig.2), and as observed in A3 cells, these PKCs were differentially regulated. Taken together, these data show that the HMW isoform regulates PKC δ and ε levels and also indicate that the secretory and nonsecretory FGF-2 behave differently with respect to PKC levels. To analyze whether these modifications were related to mRNA changes, the levels of the PKC transcripts were determined by using rat-specific PKC probes synthesized by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Northern blot analysis revealed that PKC α and δ were expressed as transcripts of about 3.4 kilobases, and PKC ε was expressed as a transcript of about 7 kilobases (32Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PKC α mRNA species of about 8 kilobases (32Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also detected as a faint band. As shown in Fig. 3, the level of the ε isotype mRNA was decreased by a factor of 2.5 in A3 cells; by contrast, that of PKC δ was increased by a factor of 2. In contrast, in A5 cells the PKC ε mRNA was found increased by a factor of 1.6 (Fig.3). Thus, the expression of FGF-2 modifies both PKC protein and mRNA levels. ERK-1/2 are involved in cell proliferation. We were then interested on the possible modifications of ERK-1 and 2 levels and activities in cells expressing the HMW FGF-2. ERK-1 and -2 protein levels were found to be comparable in A3 and CAT cells (Fig.4). By contrast, the anti-active ERK antibody revealed an hyperphosphorylation state of both proteins in A3 cells (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in control CAT cells transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding the HMW FGF-2 under the control of the tetracycline-dependent transactivator. Indeed, ERK-1/2 levels were not modified (Fig.5), whatever the concentration of the HMW FGF-2. In addition, a close relationship was observed between HMW FGF-2 levels and ERK-1/2 hyperphosphorylation state (Fig. 5). For control purposes CAT cells were transfected with the basal tetracycline-regulated expression vectors and treated with doxycycline. The phosphorylation state of ERK was not modified by doxycycline, as expected according to the results obtained in stably transfected cells that were not treated with doxycycline (Fig. 4). All of the data indicate that ERK phosphorylation was indeed the result of the expression of the HMW peptide. The hyperphosphorylation reflected an increased kinase activity as observed on the MBP substrate (Fig.5).Figure 5ERK-1 and -2 levels and phosphorylations in CAT cells expressing the HMW FGF-2 under the control of doxycycline. Control CAT cells were transfected with the tet-off system leading to the expression of the HMW FGF-2 under the control of tTA. Cells were then incubated for 24 h with increasing concentr"

P. carinii causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients with AIDS and malignancies. Although the life cycle of P. carinii remains poorly characterized, morphologic studies of infected lung tissue indicate that P. carinii alternates between numerous small trophic forms and fewer large cystic forms. To understand further the molecular mechanisms that regulate progression of the cell cycle of P. carinii, we have sought to identify and characterize genes in P. carinii that are important regulators of eukaryotic cell cycle progression. In this study, we have isolated a cDNA from P. carinii that exhibits significant homology, but unique functional characteristics, to the mitotic phosphatase Cdc25 found in S. pombe. P. carinii Cdc25 was shown to rescue growth of the temperature-sensitive S. pombe cdc25-22 strain and thus provides an additional tool to investigate the unique P. carinii life cycle. Although P. carinii Cdc25 could also restore the DNA damage checkpoint in cdc25-22 cells, it was unable to restore fully the DNA replication checkpoint. The dissociation of checkpoint control at the level of Cdc25 indicates that Cdc25 may be under distinct regulatory control in mediating checkpoint signaling.

Patients with AIDS, organ transplantation, and those receiving chemotherapy are particularly vulnerable to P. carinii pneumonia. The case fatality rate of P. carinii pneumonia ranges from ∼10 to 40%, being substantially higher in infected immunocompromised patients without AIDS (1Limper A.H. Offord K.P. Smith T.F. Martin W.J.

Unfortunately, a considerable number of patients are intolerant of the currently available agents used to prevent and treat this infection, such as sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine. The development of new chemotherapeutic agents to treat P. carinii pneumonia has been hampered by a limited understanding of the P. carinii life cycle. Morphological and ultrastructural studies of infected lung tissues indicate that P. carinii alternates between numerous diminutive trophic forms and fewer larger cyst forms (4Ruffolo J.J. Walzer P.D. Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonitis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 25-43Google Scholar). Trophic forms are known to bind preferentially type I alveolar epithelial cells and eventually develop into mature cysts characterized by a thickened cell wall (5Long E.G. Smith J.S. Meier J.L. Lab. Invest. 1986; 54: 609-615PubMed Google Scholar, 6Limper A.H. Martin W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mature cyst, containing eight intracystic bodies, ruptures releasing these bodies as haploid trophic forms (4Ruffolo J.J. Walzer P.D. Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonitis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 25-43Google Scholar). Although the proliferation of P. carinii in the lung is thus enhanced by the attachment of trophic forms to lung epithelium, only recently have there been initial reports of limited success with in vitro cultivation of P. carinii in the absence of feeder cells (7Limper A.H.

However, long term in vitro propagation P. carinii has perennially remained a key obstacle in the investigations of the life cycle of the organism. Based on DNA sequence analysis, P. carinii has been classified as a member of the fungi and is phylogenetically related to the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (10Edman J.C. Kovacs J.A.

The life cycle and the cell cycle of S. pombe have been well characterized and utilized to identify cell division cycle (cdc)1 genes in other organisms with obligate roles in cell proliferation (13Draetta G.

Despite the fact that these cell division cycle genes are well conserved, it is known that diverse eukaryotic organisms differentially regulate their cell cycle machinery in response to environmental stimuli and other internal signaling pathways (16Murray A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To understand better the molecular mechanisms that regulate progression of the cell cycle of P. carinii, we have sought to identify and characterize genes in P. carinii that are important regulators of cell cycle progression in related organisms. Accordingly, we began our investigations by demonstrating that P. cariniiutilizes a cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2, over its life cycle (17Thomas Jr., C.F. Anders R.A. Gustafson M.P. Leof E.B. Limper A.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Activated Cdc2, in association with cyclin B (cdc13), phosphorylates a variety of targets, such as histones and nuclear laminins, to initiate mitosis (18Labbe J. Lee M. Nurse P. Picard A. Doree M. Nature. 1988; 335: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Nakagawa P.M. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Cdc2 is regulated by both inhibitory and stimulatory phosphorylations (20Fleig U.N. Gould K.L. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). One important positive regulator is the Cdc25 phosphatase that activates Cdc2 by removing the inhibitory phosphoryl group on Tyr15of Cdc2 (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 903-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, at the G2/M border Cdc2 is able to phosphorylate and activate Cdc25, initiating an autofeedback loop resulting in a rapid entry into mitosis (24Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Capony J.P.

In addition to mitotic control, Cdc25 has roles in regulating meiosis and imposing a checkpoint arrest in the DNA repair and DNA replication processes (26Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P.

Nature. 1998; 395: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdc25 represents an integral component of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. Current models state that the phosphorylation of the Tyr15residue of Cdc2 is a key component of maintaining the S/M and G2/M checkpoints (32Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DNA damage or unreplicated DNA activates the appropriate checkpoint pathway that propagates signals that lead to the removal of Cdc25 from the nucleus and/or inactivation of Cdc25 activity, thereby maintaining the Tyr15-phosphorylated state of Cdc2 (26Furnari B.

In this study, we have identified and characterized a cDNA and corresponding genomic clone from P. carinii that is structurally and functionally homologous to the essential Cdc25 mitotic regulator. In the context of a heterologous fungal system, this homolog rescues growth in Cdc25 temperature-sensitive mutants and restores the DNA damage checkpoint. However, it is unable to restore fully the DNA replication checkpoint following hydroxyurea treatment. These findings (i) provide evidence for distinct molecular mechanisms regulating G2/M and S/M checkpoints previously thought to be under similar control, and (ii) identify a key regulatory molecule involved in P. carinii life cycle progression.

(special form) carinii via transtracheal injection to induce P. carinii pneumonia (39Bartlett M.S. Fishman J.A. Queener S.A. Durkin M.M. Jay M.A. Smith J.W. J. Clin.

The following primers were used for amplification, 5′-ATW ATW GAT TGT CGS TTG-3′ and 5′-WGG ATA ATA SAA AAA WGG ATA-3′. PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. A single 280-bp fragment was amplified, subcloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega), and sequenced. The amplicon was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and hybridized to a nitrocellulose membrane containing P. carinii chromosomes. The P. carinii chromosomes were separated by contour-clamped homogenous field electrophoresis (CHEF) and transferred to nitrocellulose (38Cushion M.T. Kaselis M. Stringer S.L. Stringer J.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4801-4813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min of prehybridization in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), the CHEF blot was incubated with probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml) at 68 °C for 60 min, washed four times at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS buffer, washed twice at 50 °C for 40 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and visualized by autoradiography. In addition, the probe was used to screen a rat-derived P. carinii cDNA library under similar conditions. Clones were isolated after plaques were purified to homogeneity. A 2.1-kb clone was purified and sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF098935). The genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF098936) was determined by PCR amplification using freshly isolated P . carinii genomic DNA as the template. Primers made from the 5′ end and the 3′ end of the cDNA used for amplification are as follows: 5′-CATATATGGATACTTCACCTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CGGACGTTACTCACATC-TTTTTGCAG-3′. PCRs were carried out as previously mentioned. Total RNA was isolated from uninfected rat lung, P. carinii-infected rat lung, isolated P. carinii, and S. pombe via the TRIZOL® method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA from each sample was used to make cDNA with the Advantage™ RT-for-PCR Kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Cdc25 primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification were used as follows: P. carinii-specific primers at nucleotide 108 from the beginning of the coding region (5′-GGGAAGAAATATACTGATAAGAATAATAAATTCCGG-3)′ and at nucleotide 748 (5′-GCAATATCAGTATCAGTATCATTCTTTATCTG-3′); rat-specific primers at nucleotide 39 (5′-CTCTTCACTTGCAGCCCCACTC-3′) and nucleotide 691 (5′-CATCATTCTTCTGATTCTCTCCATCCAG-3′); and S. pombe-specific primers at nucleotide 295 (5′-CTTGTACTGTAGAAACCCCTCTCGC-3′) and at nucleotide 899 (5′-GAATTATCATTGCAAGCACCAAAATCACTG-3′). PCR components except primers were added and split into three tubes for each template. Specific primers were then added. Amplification conditions were the same in all reactions as discussed previously, and the products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose TBE (100 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA) gel. The full-length cDNAs for the P. carinii Cdc25 homolog, an inactive mutant (C432A), and the S. pombe cdc25 were subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.5 at 27 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Isopropylthio-β-galactosidase was added for 4 h at a final concentration of 1 mm for BL21 cells harboring P. carinii Cdc25 and C432A expression plasmids and 0.2 mm for BL21 cells containing the S. pombeCdc25 expression plasmid. The pelleted cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A final concentration of 100 μg/ml of lysozyme and 1% Triton was added, incubated on ice for 15 min, lysed by mild sonication, and centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. The GST fusion proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using glutathione-Sepharose beads and eluted with 10 mmreduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The inactivated P. carinii Cdc25 was created by mutating the Cys432 residue in the active site to an Ala residue with the Stratagene Quikchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit®. The following primers were used: C432A-5′ (5′-GTTTGATTATTTTTCATGCTGAATATAGTTCACATCGTGC-GCCA-3′) and C432A-3′ (5′-GGCGCACGATGTGAACTATATTCAGCATG-AAAAATAATCAAAC-3′) with the mutated codon underlined. DNA sequencing verified the presence of the C432A mutation and the absence of other mutations. Reactions for p-nitrophenyl phosphate assays were performed as described by Dunphy and Kumagai (43Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). For GST-PcCdc25 purification, the eluted protein was loaded onto a Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column, and fractions were collected and visualized by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing the fusion protein were subsequently loaded onto a Mono Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column. Two buffers consisting of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol with and without 1 mNaCl were used to create a 40-ml gradient to elute the protein. An NdeI-BamHI fragment encoding the entire 1614-bp open reading frame encoding the P. carinii Cdc25 homolog was subcloned into NdeI-BamHI-digested pREP41 (containing a leu2 marker). The resulting construct contained the P. cariniigene in sense orientation under control of the thiamine-repressible nmt promoter. A 7-kb SalI genomic clone of the S. pombe Cdc25 was subcloned into SalI-digested pREP41 in an analogous fashion. The constructs, including pREP-C432A and pREP alone, were transformed into the S. pombeh+ cdc25-22 leu1-32 ura4-218 ade6-M210 strain as described (44Prentice H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 621Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and selected on leucine- and thiamine-deficient media. Leucine-positive clones that grew at the permissive temperature (25 °C) were then tested for growth at the restrictive temperature (35 °C). The expression of the P. carinii Cdc25 was repressed by the addition of 25 μm thiamine. For the DNA replication checkpoint studies, 12 mm hydroxyurea was added to asynchronous yeast cultures (1 × 106/ml) and fixed with 3% formaldehyde at selected time points and then stained with DAPI (45MacNeill S.A. Fantes P.A. Fantes P.A. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach Series. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 106-108Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and counted for cells containing mitotic cuts. For the DNA damage checkpoint studies, cells were synchronized in G1 in media lacking nitrogen, released, and irradiated with 200 Gy from a 137Cs source. Following fixation and DAPI staining, images were taken on an Olympus AX-70 fluorescence microscope and analyzed using the Metamorph software program (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). A degenerative PCR approach was taken to determine whether P. carinii contained a Cdc25 homolog. Because the active site of Cdc25 family members is highly conserved across species, degenerate primers were designed from the CH2A and CH2B domains flanking the catalytic site. To optimize the efficiency of the degenerate primers, codon bias was used to reflect the adenine/thymine-rich (>65%)P. carinii DNA (46Fletcher L.D. Berger L.C. Tidwell R.R. Dykstra C.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A 280-base pair product was amplified from P. carinii genomic DNA. Sequencing the product revealed that the 280-base pair fragment was unique but homologous to cdc25 genes from other organisms (data not shown). To confirm the P. carinii origin of the amplicon, it was hybridized to rat-derived P. carinii chromosomes separated by contour-clamped homogenous field electrophoresis (CHEF). Under high stringency, the amplicon hybridized to a single chromosome from P. carinii and to a 2.3-kb P. carinii RNA transcript (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Subsequent screening of a P. carinii cDNA library identified a 2.1-kb fragment that was isolated and characterized. Based on Northern data, this cDNA clone appears to contain the entire coding region and most of the surrounding regulatory regions. The genomic clone was isolated by PCR amplification from freshly isolated P. carinii genomic DNA. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequences indicated that the coding region is interrupted by five introns that span 40–50 base pairs in length and contain the GT/AG intron/exon junction sequence (GenBankTM accession numbers AF098935 and AF098936, respectively). Fig.2 shows the predicted amino acid alignment of P. carinii Cdc25 with Cdc25 proteins from other eukaryotic species. Consistent with other Cdc25 family members, PcCdc25 exhibits a highly conserved C terminus containing the catalytic site and a variable N terminus. The PcCdc25 protein was found to be most closely related to fission yeast, being 61.2% homologous and 40.3% identical to the S. pombe Cdc25. The PcCdc25 homolog contained the HC XXXXXR consensus sequence (amino acids 431–438) and the conserved DCR motif at amino acids 389–391 unique to Cdc25 phosphatases (47Eckstein J.W. Beer-Romero P. Berdo I. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the homolog does not contain an LIGD motif found in higher eukaryotes, it has three putative Cdc2 consensus phosphorylation sites on the N terminus at amino acids 91–93, 112–114, and 141–143 (47Eckstein J.W. Beer-Romero P. Berdo I. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the isolated cDNA is from P. carinii and exhibits significant homology to other Cdc25 species.Figure 2Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence from PcCdc25 with other Cdc25 family members. Sequences from the P. carinii Cdc25 cDNA (accession numberAF098935), S. pombe Cdc25 (accession numberM13158), S. cerevisiae Cd25 homolog, MIH1 (accession numberJ04846), human Cdc25C (accession number 4502706), and rat Cdc25B (accession number D16237) were obtained from the GenBankTMdata base.

Whereas the CHEF blot provides substantial evidence for P. carinii origin, these preparations likely contain minor amounts of host material. As such, to ensure specificity, a PCR-based approach was taken to determine whether specific primers designed from one cdc25 gene would amplify a cdc25 gene from another organism. Primers were designed near the 5′ end of the putative P. carinii cdc25+ homolog, rat cdc25+ , and S. pombe cdc25+ genes, reflecting the region of the proteins that are the least conserved (see “Experimental Procedures”). RT-PCR was performed with RNA isolated from normal rat lung, P. carinii-infected rat lung, isolated P. carinii, and S. pombe. The P. carinii cdc25+ primers amplified products from only P. carinii-infected lungs and isolated P. carinii (Fig.3 A). Rat cdc25+ primers only generated a product from rat lung and P. carinii-infected rat lung, whereas S. pombe cdc25+ primers specifically produced a transcript from S. pombe cDNA. By having verified the origin of the cDNA, we wished to determine the gene expression pattern in the two major life forms of P. carinii. From Northern analysis, the P. carinii cdc25+ transcript was expressed in both the trophic and cyst form, with a moderate increase in expression in the cysts (Fig. 3 B). These results, in addition to the CHEF hybridization and nucleotide and amino acid sequence differences, clearly demonstrate the Cdc25 gene product is from P. carinii and is expressed in both life cycle forms. Cdc25 proteins are dual-specific phosphatases known to catalyze the transition from various cell cycle checkpoints (25Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 28Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science. 1998; 280: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To determine whether the P. carinii Cdc25 homolog had similar enzymatic activity as that seen for other Cdc25 proteins, we expressed the protein fused to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) domain at the N terminus in E. coli. Phosphatase activity was measured by the ability to dephosphorylate p-nitrophenol phosphate and compared with GST fusion proteins of human Cdc25C and S. pombe Cdc25. As shown in Fig. 4, the kinetic parameters of the partially purified GST-PcCdc25, GST-SpCcdc25, and the GST-HuCdc25C were similar, with Km values of 17, 26, and 35 mm, and Vmax values of 6, 3, and 31 nmol·min−1·mg−1, respectively. Similar kinetics have been reported for Xenopus laevis Cdc25 with a Km of 50 mm and Vmax of 56 nmol·min−1·mg−1(21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 903-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). To ensure that the phosphatase activity observed in Fig. 4 reflected an enzymatic activity of GST-PcCdc25 and not some bacterial contaminant, a Cys432 → Ala mutation was introduced in the predicted catalytic domain of GST-PcCdc25. This mutation abolishes phosphatase activity by deletion of the active site nucleophile (43Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the introduced mutation abolished P. carinii Cdc25 activity. In addition, the GST-PcCdc25 fusion protein was purified to >80% purity using a gel filtration and ion exchange (Mono Q) chromatography (data not shown). The resulting purification resulted in a 7-fold increase in the specific activity of the protein. Moreover, the Km of the Mono Q-purified enzyme (average of two preparations) remained very close to the partially purified protein (15 versus 17 mm, respectively), but the Vmax increased from 6 to 15 nmol·min−1·mg−1. These data not only documented that the phosphatase activity was due to the added fusion protein, but strongly suggested that GST-PcCdc25 has a similar active site to other Cdc25 proteins. The absence of defined genetics and culture systems makes it difficult to do genetic manipulations in P. carinii. As such, it is presently not possible to examine directly the role of the P. carinii Cdc25 homolog in P. carinii proliferation. However, to overcome that limitation, we determined whether the P. carinii Cdc25 cDNA would complement a temperature-sensitive Cdc25 S. pombe mutant (cdc25-22).

Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). During import of precursors into mitochondria, the presequences are recognized by multiple proteins (4Roise D. J.

Despite the identification of various proteins that interact with the mitochondrial precursors, the mechanism of recognition of the presequence by these components has not yet been understood. The lack of sequence homology of the presequences, even though they are characterized by the positively charged residues and the formation property of amphiphilic α-helices, has inhibited clarification of the recognition mechanism (6Hartl F.-U.

Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP),1 located in the matrix of the mitochondria, cleaves off most presequences of the imported precursors. MPP consists of two structurally related subunits, α-MPP and β-MPP. Complex formation with the two subunits is essential for both enzymatic activity (7Géli V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Earlier studies indicated that some structural elements of the presequence are required for recognition by MPP. An arginine residue at position −2, the so-called “proximal arginine,” from the cleavage site, which is usually found among most precursor proteins, plays a critical role in cleavage reaction (10Niidome T.

In this studies, we numbered the residues according to the full-length MPP precursors. For instance, His-101, Glu-104, and His-105 in rat β-MPP were represented as His-56, Glu-59, and His-60, respectively, in our previous papers. 2In our previous works, the residues of MPP were numbered from the N terminus of the mature protein reported in the data base.

For instance, His-101, Glu-104, and His-105 in rat β-MPP were represented as His-56, Glu-59, and His-60, respectively, in our previous papers. Findings on functional amino acid residues both in precursor proteins and MPP required for the processing reaction, especially for precursor recognition by MPP, suggest that the two subunits of MPP cooperatively form the substrate binding pocket and that they have several substrate binding sites to cope with different structural elements in the extension peptide. To elucidate the recognition mechanism that makes feasible strict substrate specificity for MPP, it is necessary to determine the structure of the presequence bound to the enzyme. In the present study, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments provide the first evidence that the distal arginine and the portion around the cleavage site of the presequence are located at specific sites in the MPP molecule, irrespective of the position of the distal arginine. An induced-fit mechanism of substrate recognition of MPP seems likely. The fluorescent dyes, 7-diethyl aminocoumarin-3-carbonic acid (DAC),N,N′-dimethyl- N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD), and 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Peptide synthesis and DAC labeling were done as described (9Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IANBD amide labeling with the cysteine residue of peptides for intra- and intermolecular FRET experiments was done essentially the same as DAC labeling. Peptide authenticity was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager, PerSeptive Biosystems). The concentrations of the fluorescence peptides were calculated from the molar extinction coefficient of 45,000 (m−1cm−1) for DAC or 23,500 (m−1cm−1) for IANBD amide. A hexahistidine-tagged yeast α-MPP and yeast α/βE73Q complex were purified as described (9Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purification and fluorescent labeling of a hexahistidine-tagged yeast βE73Q were done as follows. The supernatant from the BL21(DE3) strain carrying pET-βE73QHis was loaded on a 5-ml Hi-trap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl). The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. The β-MPP was eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. To the fractions containing β-MPP were added 0.1 mm CPM, and then the sample was left to react for 1 h at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated using 1 mm cysteine for 30 min at 25 °C. The free dye was removed on a PD-10 desalting column equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl. Labeled β-MPP was then applied onto 2 ml of Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 30 ml of the same buffer, and then the protein was eluted with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl. The purity of CPM-labeled β-MPP was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by UV transillumination and Coomassie Blue staining. The labeling efficiency was calculated from a molar extinction coefficient of 33,000 (m−1cm−1) for CPM. The labeling procedure resulted in the incorporation of 0.11 ± 0.01 mol of CPM/mol of β-MPP. The CPM-labeled β-MPP was mixed with an equal mol amount of the purified α-MPP, and intermolecular FRET measurements were made. Fluorescence was measured at 25 °C using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with automatic fluorescencce polarization system. In the intramolecular FRET measurement of the double-labeled peptide, excitation of DAC was measured at 390 nm and the emission intensity at 470 nm. MPP (0.5 μm) was diluted into 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 30% glycerol, and then various concentrations of the double-labeled peptides were added. The emission spectra were taken after each sample and the blank had been thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 1–2 min. In the intermolecular FRET, the excitation of CPM was measured at 390 nm and the emission intensity at 480 nm. To the IANBD-labeled peptides (0.5 μm), CPM-labeled MPP was added at the indicated concentrations, and then the emission spectra were taken, and the fluorescence intensity at 480 nm was read. The dissociation constant, K d , was determined as follows: F = (F max[Enz])/(K d + [Enz]), where F and F max are the measured and maximal fluorescence intensity of the peptides, respectively, and [Enz] represents the concentrations of the enzyme. A plot of [Enz]/F versus [Enz] yields a linear function with a slope of 1/F and an ordinate intercept ofK d . From the decrease in fluorescence of donor DAC or CPM, induced in the presence of acceptor IANBD, the energy transfer efficiency Ewas calculated fromE=1−QDA/QDEquation 1 where Q D stands for the unquenched quantum yield of the donor and Q DA is the quantum yield in the presence of the acceptor. Quantum yield was substituted for emission maximum intensity F. From the energy transfer efficiency results, the distance between donor and acceptor was calculated according to the Förster theory (21Dale R.E. Eisinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar),R=R0(E−1−1)1/6Equation 2 where R is the calculated distance andR 0 is the distance at which 50% energy transfer would occur between the donor-acceptor pair; it is given in angstroms, as shown in Equation 3,R0=9790(Jκ2QDn−4)1/6Equation 3 where J, the overlap integral, is the degree of spectral overlap of donor emission F D(λ) and acceptor absorbance εA(λ), as defined by Equation4.J=IntegralFD(λ)εA(λ)λ4dλ/IntegralFD(λ)dλEquation 4 κ 2 is assumed to be 2/3.

Fluorescein was used as the reference dye and was assumed to have a quantum yield of 0.92 in 0.1n NaOH. Although κ 2 was taken as 2/3 for the calculation of distances, the maximum and minimum values ofκ 2 were estimated according to the method of Dale et al. (21Dale R.E. Eisinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar).κmax2=(2/3)×(1+dD+dA+3dDdA)Equation 6 κmin2=(2/3)×[1−(dD+dA)/2]Equation 7 where d D = (r D/0.4)1/2,d A = (r A/0.4)1/2;r D and r A are the limiting anisotropies of the donor and acceptor, respectively. Using these values for the orientation factor, the maximum and minimum distances between probes were calculated and were regarded as the probable error limits of the distance (R-limits). Sequence data on the presequence of mitochodrial protein precursors show that position of the distal basic acid is not so fixed among the extension peptides and is located −7 to −17 from the cleavage site. To elucidate the structure of the substrate peptide bound to the enzyme, it is vital to determine whether the distal basic amino acids at various positions interact with the same amino acid(s) in the enzyme, because the proximal arginine must be fixed with certain amino acid residues near the active center in β-MPP. In attempting this elucidation, we measured the distance between the distal arginine and the residue around the cleavage site, using intramolecular FRET. We synthesized a series of peptides with different lengths of intervening sequence between the proximal and distal arginines, labeling them at the N-terminal end with fluorescent donor DAC and at position +4 cysteine with the acceptor IANBD amide (Table I). These sites were two and five amino acid residues away from the distal and proximal arginines, respectively, to avoid interference by probes in the interaction between the arginines and other recognition elements of the peptide and MPP. In MDH-14A, arginine at position −3 (position 14 from the N-terminal end) was replaced with alanine in the original sequence of rat MDH, as it is not necessary for the residue at this position to be arginine (10Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide has a distal arginine at position −10 and is used as a standard peptide in the present work. In MDH-ΔAAL, three intervening amino acid residues between proximal and distal arginines were deleted so that the distal arginine was at position −7. This peptide was found to have the minimum length for effective cleavage by the MPP (13Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). MDH-AdAR and MDH-AdRA have the distal arginine residue at position −14 and −17, respectively. In these peptides, the linker sequence in the presequence of bovine adrenodoxin precursor was introduced between the proximal and distal arginines instead of the original one of the MDH presequence.Table IAmino acid sequences of the fluorescence-labeled peptides for intramolecular FRET measurementsPeptidesPosition of the distal ArgSequencesMDH-ΔAAL−7(α-DAC)LARPVGARS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNNMDH-14A−10(α-DAC)LARPVGAALARS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNNMDH-AdAR−14(α-DAC)LARGPGLGGGAVATRS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNNMDH-AdRA−17(α-DAC)LARGSAGPGLGGGAVATRS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNNModel peptide substrates were double-labeled with the fluorescence dyes DAC and IANBD.

The absorption spectrum of IANBD, which gives the peak at 498 nm, has an excellent overlap with the emission spectrum of DAC (data not shown). The spectral overlap,J, between these spectra is calculated to be 9.31 × 10−14m−1cm−1nm4. The spectral characteristics of all the peptides were essentially the same. For the intermolecular FRET measurements, fixed concentrations (0.5 μm) of the DAC or DAC/IANBD-labeled peptides were added to various concentrations (usually 0–3 μm) of the purified α/βE73Q, in which β-MPP is an inactive mutant with glutamine substituting for the glutamate residue of the active center (18Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32547-32553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). As demonstrated in our previous study (9Kojima K. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32542-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the fluorescence of DAC introduced to the peptide substrate bound to MPP increases with environmental change around the dye (Fig. 1). Titration of the DAC-labeled peptides gave the dissociation constant, K d , of peptides for binding to MPP (Fig. 2). All of the peptides bound to MPP with a high affinity to the same extent.Figure 2Titration of DAC - and DAC/IANBD-labeled peptides with the MPP. The single- or double-labeled MDH-ΔAAL (A), MDH14A (B), MDH-AdAR (C), and MDH-AdRA (D) (all at 0.5 μm) were titrated with yeast MPP (0–3 μm). The fluorescence intensities at 470 nm of DAC- and DAC/IANBD-labeled peptides (circles and squares, respectively) were plotted as a function of the concentration of MPP. The solid linesare nonlinear least-squares fits of the plots to the equation,F = (F max × [Enz])/(K d + [Enz]), where F,F max, and [Enz] represent increased fluorescence intensity, the calculated maximum of F, and the enzyme concentration, respectively.

In the titration of DAC- or DAC/IANBD-labeled peptides with MPP, the fitting curves showed a biphasic nature (Fig.2). Because fluorescence anisotropy change of the peptides was saturated at a stoichiometric amount of the enzyme (data not shown), the biphasic fluorescence change in the titration experiments might be due to increased scattering by increasing the concentration of the enzyme. For calculation of FRET efficiency, E, the fluorescence intensities, F D andF DA for DAC- and DAC/IANBD-labeled peptides, respectively, were taken by extrapolating the second phase curve to the ordinate. The calculated FRET efficiencies of all the peptides showed a range of 80–85% (Table II). The quantum yield, Q, of the fluorescence donor DAC showed a gradual decrease with the increasing length of the peptides; this also resulted in a decrease in the distance at which 50% FRET occurred between the donor-acceptor pair, R 0, suggesting that the mobility of the N-terminal portion of the peptides bound to MPP increases with length of the presequence. Taken together with the parameters described above, the distances of the donor-acceptor pair,R, were substantially the same among all of the peptides measured and were calculated to be ∼28 Å (Table II); this indicates that the distance between the N-terminal end of the peptides and cysteine residue at position +4 is fixed, irrespective of the length of the intervening sequence between the proximal and distal arginines. Our findings suggest that the distal basic amino acid interacts with a specific site, probably the acidic residue(s), in the enzyme.Table IIDistance between DAC at the N terminus and IANBD at position +4 in the various peptide substrates bound to MPPPeptidesK dQR 0ERR-limitsμmÅÅÅMDH-ΔAAL0.200.21738.10.85028.521.1–36.5MDH-14A0.210.20337.70.85028.221.9–36.1MDH-AdAR0.380.15836.20.79728.822.1–36.9MDH-AdRA0.330.14835.80.83427.421.2–35.0The amino acid sequences of the peptides are shown in Table I.K d , dissociation constant; Q, quantum yield; R 0, distance at which 50% FRET would occur between the donor-acceptor pair; E, FRET efficiency;R, calculated distance between the donor-acceptor pair;R-limits, probable error limits of the distance including the orientation factor.

See “Experimental Procedures” for the calculation of these parameters. The similarity of the calculated distances between donor-acceptor pairs on the substrates might be because of compensation for changes in distance by changes in orientation of the fluorescent dyes. To eliminate this possibility, we next carried intermolecular FRET measurements between a fluorescence donor in the β-MPP and the acceptor in the substrate peptides bound to MPP. This measurement could also estimate the location in the MPP of the N-terminal end of the peptide substrate and the amino acid residue at +4 position from the cleavage site. We first modified a single cysteine residue, Cys-252, in yeast β-MPP (βE73Q) by CPM, as the fluorescent donor. The histidine-tagged βE73Q partially purified by nickel-chelating column chromatography was reacted with CPM (Fig. 3, lane 1). When CPM-labeled βE73Q was purified further with Q-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 3, lane 3), a single band was obtained by both Coomasie Blue staining and UV transillumination. To confirm the specificity of the labeling to the cysteine residue, the labeling with CPM was done with a mutant enzyme, βE73Q/C252S, in which the single cysteine residue was substituted to serine. No visible band in UV transillumination was obtained with the mutant enzyme (Fig. 3,lanes 2 and 4), confirming the specific labeling with CPM of Cys-252 in β-MPP. A series of peptides labeled with IANBD amide at the N-terminal end or at position +4 was synthesized (TableIII). For labeling with IANBD at the N-terminal end of the peptides, a cysteine residue, instead of leucine, was introduced at the N terminus. The α-amino group of the N-terminal end of the peptides was acetylated to avoid the effect of the positive charge of the α-amino group in the peptides. In intermolecular FRET measurements, titration of the fixed concentration (0.5 μm) of CPM-labeled α/βE73Q was done with various concentrations (typically 0–1.5 μm) of the IANBD-labeled peptides. The emission spectrum of CPM, which has a fluorescence maximum at 475 nm, is similar to that of DAC, and overlaps the excitation spectrum of IANBD amide (J = 9.68 × 10−14m−1cm−1nm4). The quantum yield of CPM was extremely high (0.90 ± 0.02) relative to that of DAC. The addition of the acceptor-labeled peptides led to a decrease in the fluorescence of CPM and a small increase in that of IANBD, which has a peak at 545 nm (Fig. 4). Because FRET can be detected when donor and acceptor molecules are in close proximity (typically 10–100 Å) and fluorescence quenching by collision between the donor-acceptor pair was negligible, under the conditions of this measurement (data not shown), the observed decrease in fluorescence indicates binding of the IANBD-labeled peptide to the CPM-labeled MPP molecule. The absorption spectra of IANBD did not change with binding to MPP. From the spectral parameters obtained, the Förster distance, R 0, was calculated to be 48.6 ± 0.3 Å. The titration curves were shown in Fig.5 as a plot of 1 − (F DA/F D)versus [Pep], where [Pep] is the concentration of the IANBD-labeled peptides. The K d values calculated from the nonlinear least-squares fit of the data increased slightly relative to those of DAC-labeled peptides. In both cases of the peptides labeled at the N-terminal end and at position +4, the FRET efficiency, E, which is calculated as the limitation value of 1 − (F DA/F D), showed essentially the same value among the peptides that have distal arginine at different positions (TableIV). Distances between CPM in β-MPP and IANBD at position +4 of the peptides were calculated to be in the range of 44 to 46 Å, whereas those between CPM in MPP and IANBD at the N terminus of the peptides were in the range of 43 to 45 Å, irrespective of the position of the distal arginine residue. The finding showing that the distance between the cysteine residue in β-MPP and the N terminus of the peptides is substantially the same among the peptides with various lengths of intervening sequences between the proximal and distal arginines confirmed that the distal basic amino acid residue interacts with the specific site of the enzyme if the distal basic residue is at least within −7 to −17 of the cleavage site.Table IIIAmino acid sequences of the fluorescence-labeled peptides for intermolecular FRET measurementsPeptidesPosition of the distal ArgSequencesLabeled at position +4 MDH-ΔAAL−7Ac-LARPVGARS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNN MDH-14A−10Ac-LARPVGAALARS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNN MDH-AdAR−14Ac-LARGPGLGGGAVATRS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNN MDH-AdRA−17Ac-LARGSAGPGLGGGAVATRS-FSTC(S-IANBD)AQNNLabeled at the N terminus MDH-ΔAAL−7Ac-C(S-IANBD)ARPVGARS-FSTSAQNN MDH-14A−10Ac-C(S-IANBD)ARPVGAALARS-FSTSAQNN MDH-AdAR−14Ac-C(S-IANBD)ARGPGLGGGAVATRS-FSTSAQNN MDH-AdRA−17Ac-C(S-IANBD)ARGSAGPGLGGGAVATRS-FSTSAQNNModel peptide substrates were double-labeled with IANBD as the fluorescent acceptor.

We found that when mitochondrial protein precursors are bound to MPP, distal basic amino acids in its presequences interact with the specific site in the enzyme if the basic residues are present at positions −7 to −17. This means that the intervening sequence between the proximal arginine and the distal basic amino acid is flexible so that the distal basic residue can fit into a specific binding site in MPP. Thus, the present study is the first to propose the structure of the presequence bound to MPP. We generated an energy-minimized model of rat MPP (22Ito A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of the core proteins in the bovine bc1 complex (23Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M.

In the simulation model (Fig. 6), the distance between Glu-73 in yeast β-MPP (corresponding to Glu-104 in rat β-MPP), which is a catalytic center (17Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol.

Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25158-25163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was calculated to be about 30 Å. The glycine-rich loop in α-MPP, which is conserved among different organisms and has been shown to be essential for MPP function, is close to the metal binding active center in β-MPP and is located about 30 Å from Glu-390/Asp-391 in α-MPP. These values are close to those (about 28 Å) obtained from FRET measurements between the N-terminal end and the amino acid residue at position +4 of the peptides (Table II). On the other hand, in the simulation model, Cys-252 in yeast β-MPP modified with CPM seems to be located on the surface of the C-terminal domain of β-MPP and is about 50 and 40 Å away from Glu-390/Asp-391 and the glycine-rich segment in α-MPP, respectively. Taking the uncertainty of the predicted location of Cys-252 in the model of β-MPP into consideration, these values are also similar to those obtained from FRET measurement of about 45 Å from Cys-252 to the N-terminal end and the amino acid residue at position +4 of the peptides. The scissile bond of the presequence bound to MPP must be close to the active center in β-MPP. Taken together, these findings lead one to expect that the distal basic residue and the amino acid residue at position +4 of the peptide interact with the acidic residue cluster and the glycine-rich region in α-MPP, respectively, and that the substrate peptide in the cavity of MPP is needed to form the loop structure, depending on the length of the intervening sequence (Fig. 6). In the intervening sequence between the proximal arginine and the distal basic amino acid in the presequence, several prolines and/or glycines are usually present, and substitution of these residues for alanine led to a reduction in cleavage efficiency (13Ogishima T.

Insertion of ethoxy linkage instead of peptide bonds, as a more flexible linker, between the distal and proximal arginines led to a 2-fold increase in cleavage efficiency compared with that of the control peptide (14Moriwaki K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Studies using two-dimensional proton NMR combined with circular dichroism on synthetic peptides corresponding to the presequences of the precursor proteins have also demonstrated that peptides to be cleaved by MPP have the potential ability to form a helix-linker-helix structure, in which glycine and/or proline residues serve as an α-helix-breaking linker (25Thornton K.

Taking those findings together with the present results, one could surmise that the intervening sequence forms a flexible loop structure and function to aid structural elements, including the distal basic and proximal arginine residues, in binding to multiple subsites in MPP. During import into mitochondria, multiple proteins, including molecular chaperones, receptors, and processing peptidases, recognize the presequences of mitochondrial protein precursors. The formation of an α-helix of the presequence is required apparently for interaction with these components (25Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hammen P.K. Gorenstein D.G. Weiner H.

The NMR structure of the cytosolic domain of Tom20, a component of the translocase complex in mitochondrial outer membrane, with a synthetic peptide based on the aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor has recently been resolved (28Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The peptide that forms an amphiphilic α-helix in a crack of the core structure of Tom20 consists of four helices. The present results indicate that structures required for targeting and processing differ and that a flexible structure is required for the processing, although basic residues in the presequences function as recognition signals for both processes. Structural convergence between MPP and thermolysin, a Zn2+-peptidase with a typical metal-binding motif, HExxH, has been discussed recently (29Makarova K.S. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2537-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Superimposition between the N-terminal domain of core 1 protein of the bc1 complex and the portion around the active site of thermolysin showed a similar arrangement of secondary structural elements but with different topological connections and in a reverse main chain orientation. This structural architecture is based on four helices, which contain metal ligands and the catalytic glutamate residue, and the neighboring five strands of a β-sheet. A main chain of substrates of thermolysin interacts with the edge of the β-sheet through hydrogen bonds. Like thermolysin, the β-sheet structure around the active center of MPP might interact with a nonhelical structure around the cleavage site of the precursors through hydrogen bonding, to present the scissile bond of the substrate to the active center in β-MPP. Further studies, especially on the crystal structure of MPP, should reveal the precise structure of the presequence bound to MPP and the mechanisms of strict recognition and specific cleavage of precursor proteins by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2084596944,"The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is well established, but the mechanism by which the enzyme is inactivated during the prolonged NO stimulation has not been characterized. In this paper we studied the interactions between NO and intracellular Ca2+ in the control of sGC in rat anterior pituitary cells. Experiments were done in cultured cells, which expressed neuronal and endothelial NO synthases, and in cells with elevated NO levels induced by the expression of inducible NO synthase and by the addition of several NO donors. Basal sGC-dependent cGMP production was stimulated by the increase in NO levels in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, depolarization of cells by high K+ and Bay K 8644, an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, inhibited sGC activity. Depolarization-induced down-regulation of sGC activity was also observed in cells with inhibited cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterases but not in cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium. This inhibition was independent from the pattern of Ca2+ signaling (oscillatory versus nonoscillatory) and NO levels, and was determined by averaged concentration of intracellular Ca2+. These results indicate that inactivation of sGC by intracellular Ca2+serves as a negative feedback to break the stimulatory action of NO on enzyme activity in intact pituitary cells.

Coexpression of both subunits is required to obtain enzyme activity and NO regulation. The binding of NO to the sGC heme activates the enzyme, resulting in the conversion of GTP to cGMP (1Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Together with particulate guanylyl cyclase and adenylyl cyclase (AC), these enzymes compose a family of proteins that is involved in a broad array of cellular functions in cardiovascular, neuronal, neuroendocrine, and other cell types (2Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In this respect, sGC-generated cGMP production allows this enzyme to transmit the NO signal to the downstream elements of the signaling cascade, such as cGMP-dependent protein kinase (3Smolenski A. Burkhardt A.M. Eigenthaler M. Butt E. Gambaryan S. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1988; 358: 134-139Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGs) (4Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev.

Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well established role of NO in the activation of sGC, the mechanisms of inactivation for this enzyme have been incompletely characterized. This is especially important for cells in which the highly diffusible NO is intimately involved in the control of Ca2+ signaling by facilitating Ca2+ release and/or Ca2+ influx pathways, as in hepatocytes (6Patel S. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Stellato K.A. Shon M. Thomas A.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Charles A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), glial cells (8Willmott N.J. Wong K. Strong A.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neuroendocrine cells (9Yermolaieva O. Brot N. Weissbach H. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the elevated intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i) stimulates the activity of two NO-producing enzymes, neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), such up-regulation would lead to overloading the cells with Ca2+. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that the negative feedback effect of Ca2+ on sGC would provide the necessary mechanism to coordinate the regulation of intracellular cGMP and Ca2+ concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we chose rat anterior pituitary cells, the majority of which exhibit spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients of high amplitude that are sufficient to trigger hormone secretion (10Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These cells also express the messages for rod, cone, and olfactory CNGs, which may participate in the generation of spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients (11Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Yuan D. Andric S.A. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35693-35702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although not fully characterized, the NO-signaling pathway is also expressed in these cells (12Hartt D.J. Ogiwara T. Ho A.K. Chik C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In our study, we initially characterized the NOS subtypes expressed in pituitary cells and their participation in the delivery of NO and sGC-controlled cGMP. We further characterized the role of calcium in the control of sGC activity in intact pituitary cells. Experiments were performed on anterior pituitary cells from normal female Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Pituitary cells were dispersed as described previously (18Tomic M. Zivadinovic D. Van Goor F. Yuan D. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7721-7731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in medium 199 containing Earle's salts, sodium bicarbonate, 10% horse serum, and antibiotics. Cell purification was done as described previously (18Tomic M. Zivadinovic D. Van Goor F. Yuan D. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7721-7731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and further identification of gonadotrophs and lactotrophs was done by the addition of specific Ca2+-mobilizing agonists for these cells, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Peninsula, San Carlos, CA), respectively. To express iNOS, cells (106/well) were treated for 16 h with 30 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide + 1000 IU/ml interferon-γ (LPS+IFN-γ), both from Sigma. To elevate NO levels, cells were treated with three NO donors: sodium nitroprusside (SNP) from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA) and N-ethylethanamine:1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine (DEA) and 3,3′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazino)bis-1-propanamine (DPTA), both from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Basal and stimulated NOS activity was inhibited by aminoguanidine (RBI), an NOS inhibitor. sGC activity was inhibited by 4 H-8-bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d)benz(b)(1,4)oxazin-1-one (NS 2028) and 1 H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), and cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases were inhibited by vinpocetine and dipyridamole (all from Calbiochem). For [Ca2+] i measurements, cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer, supplemented with 2 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) at 37 °C for 60 min. Coverslips with cells were washed with this buffer and mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). Cells were examined under a ×40 oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340- and 380-nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was measured. The ratio of light intensities,F340/F380, which reflects changes in Ca2+ concentration, was followed in several single cells simultaneously. To calculate the area under the [Ca2+] i (t) curve, SigmaPlot 2000 software by SPSS was used. Average [Ca2+] i (t) curves, shown in Fig. 8, were calculated from traces obtained from 73 to 256 cells, base-line values were subtracted, and the area was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Cells (1 million/well) were plated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2-air and saturated humidity. Prior to the experiments, the medium was removed and cells were washed with Ca2+-containing medium 199 and stimulated at 37 °C under 5% CO2-air and saturated humidity. cAMP and cGMP were measured in the medium and in dialyzed cells as described previously (18Tomic M. Zivadinovic D. Van Goor F. Yuan D. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7721-7731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using specific antisera provided by Albert Baukal (NICHD, Bethesda, MD). For measurement of total NO production (NO2− + NO3−), samples were initially treated with nitrate reductase (Alexis Biochemicals) to convert nitrate to nitrite. Sample aliquots were then mixed with an equal volume of Greiss reagent containing 0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.05% naphthylethylenediamine in 2.5% phosphoric acid (all from Sigma); the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and the absorbance was measured at 546 nm (19Green L.C. Wagner A.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). In experiments with NO2− measurements, samples were not treated with nitrate reductase. In both measurements, nitrite concentrations were determined relative to a standard curve derived from increasing concentrations of sodium nitrite. Concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, and NO2 are expressed as combined values in cell content and in medium. Postmitochondrial fractions of anterior pituitary tissue and dispersed pituitary cells, cerebellum, and aortic rings were obtained from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Concentration of proteins was estimated by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (22 μg) from each postmitochondrial fraction were run on one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a discontinuous buffer system (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). The immunodetections on nNOS and iNOS were done with primary antibodies from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO); eNOS antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); and β-actin antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). The secondary antibody for all assays was an anti-mouse IgG (rabbit) from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) linked to horseradish peroxidase. The reactive bands were always determined with a luminol-based kit, and the reaction was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system, using x-ray film. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of detectable levels of nNOS in pituitary tissue (Fig.1 A, line 2), cultured cells (line 3), and control tissue (cerebellum;line 1). eNOS was also detectable in pituitary tissue (line 5), dispersed pituitary cells (line 6), and control tissue (aorta; line 4). iNOS was not detectable in pituitary tissue (line 8) and dispersed cells (line 9), but was expressed in pituitary cells stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ for 16 h (line 7). In these experiments, β-actin expression was used as an internal standard (lines 10, 11, and 12). These results indicate that nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed in mixed populations of anterior pituitary cells and that the expression of iNOS can be induced in dispersed pituitary cells. Basal cGMP production was analyzed in mixed populations of anterior pituitary cells cultured in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Under these conditions, cGMP was produced in a time-dependent manner, reaching the steady-state plateau response 60–90 min after replacing medium in cultured cells (Fig. 1 B, open circles). Consistent with the role of the NO signaling pathway in the control of cGMP production, the addition of NO donors, SNP, DEA, and DPTA (21Feelisch M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 358: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), was accompanied by a significant increase in cGMP accumulation. In cells stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ for 16 h, cGMP production was also significantly elevated compared with controls and was comparable with levels observed in cells stimulated with SNP. Nitrite levels, which are commonly used as indicators of NO production (22Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar), were significantly elevated in treated cells. As expected, the profiles of nitrite levels expressed as the sum of both NO2− and NO3− versusNO2− only (without nitrate reductase treatment) were highly comparable. The levels of total nitrite measured 1 h after stimulation were similar in SNP- and LPS+IFN-γ-stimulated cells and significantly higher in cells treated with DPTA and DEA. Finally, the levels of cGMP progressively increased with the elevation in nitrite levels (Fig. 1 C). Both basal and LPS+IFN-γ-induced cGMP productions were completely inhibited by aminoguanidine, an NOS inhibitor (23Mayer B. Andrew P. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 358: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in the micromolar to millimolar concentration range (Fig.2 A). In parallel to cGMP production, nitrite accumulation in cultured medium was inhibited by aminoguanidine (Fig. 2 B). The blockers of sGC, NS 2028 (24Olesen S.-P. Drejer J. Axelsson O. Moldt P. Bang L. Nielsen-Kudsk J.E. Busse R. Mulsch A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and ODQ (25Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar) also inhibited cGMP productions in a dose-dependent manner. Fig.3 A illustrates the effect of NS 2028 on cGMP accumulation in pituitary cells during the first 60 min of incubation. In the same samples, NS 2028 treatment did not significantly affect cAMP production, indicating that AC is not sensitive to this compound. NS 2028 also inhibited the SNP-induced cGMP production (Fig. 3 B) without affecting cAMP production. Likewise, basal and SNP-induced cGMP production, but not cAMP production, was significantly inhibited by ODQ (Fig.4, A and B).Figure 3Dependence of cAMP and cGMP production on sGC activity (I).

Fig. 5 Aillustrates that depolarization of cells with 50 mmK+ led to similar patterns of [Ca2+] i response in somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and gonadotrophs (shown on left panels), as well as all other unidentified cells (not shown). A high K+-induced increase in [Ca2+] i was accompanied by a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of cGMP production to about 20% of that observed in controls (Fig. 5 B, left panel). Both depolarization-induced elevation in [Ca2+] i and inhibition of cGMP production were almost abolished in cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium (Fig. 5, A and B, right panels), indicating that depolarization per se is not responsible for the observed effects. Consistent with the role of [Ca2+] i in the control of nNOS and eNOS, depletion of extracellular Ca2+ was accompanied with a significant decrease in cGMP production (illustrated by the upper dashed line in Fig. 5 B). Manipulation of extracellular Ca2+ concentration did not obviously affect cAMP production (Fig. 5 B). The addition of two inhibitors of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, vinpocetine and dipyridamole (26Yamamoto T. Yamamoto S. Osborne J.C. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14173-14177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cataldi M. Secondo A. D'Alessio A.D. Sarnacchiaro F. Colao A.M. Amoroso S. Di Renzo G.F. Annunziato L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), elevated basal cGMP levels (Fig.6 A). In cells with inhibited phosphodiesterases, however, depolarization of cells inhibited cGMP production with a comparable efficiency. High K+-induced inhibition of cGMP production, but not cAMP production, was also observed in cells expressing iNOS (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, high K+ inhibited cGMP production in control cells treated with SNP, DEA, and DPTA (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that elevated [Ca2+] i inhibits sGC activity and that this inhibition occurs in the presence of elevated NO levels. High K+-induced elevation in [Ca2+] i (50, 75, and 100 mm) occurred in a nonoscillatory manner. In contrast, depolarization of cells with 10–20 mmK+ frequently led to the generation of an oscillatory [Ca2+] i response after an initial spike response. Fig. 7 A illustrates the effects of 12 mm K+ on the pattern of [Ca2+] i signaling in identified somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and gonadotrophs. At that particular concentration of K+, a significant inhibition of cGMP production was observed in control cells (Fig. 5 B), as well as in cells expressing iNOS (Fig. 6 B). In further studies, the effects of low K+ were compared with those induced by Bay K 8644, an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist. Addition of Bay K 8644 initiated [Ca2+] i oscillations in quiescent somatotrophs, lactotrophs, gonadotrophs (Fig. 7 B), and other pituitary cells and increased the amplitude of transients in oscillating cells (not shown). As in K+-stimulated cells, the rise in [Ca2+] i induced by Bay K 8644 was accompanied with the inhibition of cGMP production in controls and vinpocetine-treated cells (Fig. 7 C, left panels). SNP-induced cGMP production was also inhibited by Bay K 8644 (Fig.7 C, right panel). Finally, Bay K 8644 inhibited cGMP production by LPS+IFN-γ-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 D). To quantify the dependence of sGC activity on [Ca2+] i , pituitary cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of K+ (10, 18, 30, 50, 75, and 100 mm) and Bay K 8644 (0.1 and 1 μm), and the averaged area [Ca2+] i (t) curves during 15 min of stimulation were calculated and compared with cGMP production. Fig. 8, A and B, illustrates the dependence of cGMP production and the elevation in [Ca2+] i on the level of cell depolarization. The relationship between [Ca2+] i and cGMP in lower potassium (closed squares), high potassium (open circles), and Bay K 8644-treated cells (closed circles) is shown in Fig. 8 B. A linear relationship between the [Ca2+] i and cGMP production indicates that Ca2+-mediated inhibition of sGC was not dependent on the pattern of signaling (nonoscillatory versus oscillatory) but was determined by the averaged [Ca2+] i . The NO-cGMP signaling pathway exhibits a complex action on Ca2+ signaling in a number of cells. A cross-talk between NO and Ca2+ is critical in cells with intra- and intercellular Ca2+ oscillations, which are dependent on Ca2+ release mechanisms, such as those reported recently in hepatocytes (6Patel S. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Stellato K.A. Shon M. Thomas A.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NO-cGMP also facilitates the Ca2+ influx pathway by stimulating CNGs, channels that depolarize cells to the level needed for activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (28Wei J.-Y. Samantra R. Leconte L. Barnstable C.J. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1998; 56: 37-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The same pathway may also inhibit Ca2+ influx by activating Ca2+-controlled K+ channels in a cGMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent manner (8Willmott N.J. Wong K. Strong A.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the rise in [Ca2+] i is required to activate nNOS and eNOS, the latter pathway would lead to the coordinated regulation of [Ca2+] i and cGMP. That is not the case with cells expressing CNGs, where the positive feedback effects of Ca2+ on NOS would elevate [Ca2+] i in an uncontrolled manner. Two recent reports have indicated the expression of CNGs in pituitary cells (11Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Yuan D. Andric S.A. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35693-35702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and hypothalamic immortalized neurons (30Vitalis E.A. Costantin J.L. Tsai P.-S. Sakakibara H. Paruthiyil S. Liri T. Martini J.-P. Taga M. Choi A.L.H. Charles A.C. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In general, activation of these channels by cAMP and cGMP leads to depolarization of cells and the subsequent facilitation of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx (28Wei J.-Y. Samantra R. Leconte L. Barnstable C.J. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1998; 56: 37-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These channels may provide a rationale for the dual control of Ca2+ signaling and secretion in neuroendocrine cells by the NO signaling pathway and by AC-coupled receptors. The NO-cGMP pathway is operative in pituitary and hypothalamic cells (12Hartt D.J. Ogiwara T. Ho A.K. Chik C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mixed populations of pituitary cells express two enzymes, nNOS and eNOS (Fig.1) (17Lozach A. Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Berault A. Counis R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Wolff D. Datto G.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 128: 201-206Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These cells also express iNOS in response to LPS+IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 1) (38Vancelecom H. Matthys P. Denef C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). AC-coupled receptors are also operative in these cells and stimulate Ca2+ influx (39Kwiecien R. Tseeb V. Kurchikov A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 613-623Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Herrington J. Hille B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 41Lussier B.T. French M.B.

It was obvious that in cells where the NO-cGMP pathway is positively coupled to Ca2+ influx, the inactivation of sGC is needed to break the stimulatory action of NO on Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+-controlled cellular functions. However, it was not clear how sGC activity is controlled. Here we show that sCG activity in anterior pituitary cells is down-regulated by elevation in intracellular Ca2+ and that the inhibition of the enzyme activity is dependent on the [Ca2+] i . Our results further indicate that Ca2+-dependent inhibition of sGC activity occurs in the presence of elevated NO, i.e.independently of the status of NOS, as well as when cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases were inhibited. Ca2+-dependent inhibition of sGC was observed in cells exhibiting oscillatory and nonoscillatory signaling. The effects of the nonoscillatory and high amplitude [Ca2+] i signals, induced in our experiments with depolarization of cells with high potassium, are unlikely to occur under physiological situations and are here used to pharmacologically establish the relationship between [Ca2+] i and sGC activity. On the other hand, the effects of oscillatory [Ca2+] i signals observed in low potassium and Bay K 8644-stimulated cells are of relevance for the control of sGC activity. Unstimulated pituitary cells frequently exhibit periods of spontaneous and extracellular Ca2+-dependent fluctuations in [Ca2+] i (11Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Yuan D. Andric S.A. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35693-35702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which control basal hormone secretion (10Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The activation of several AC-coupled receptors also leads to the initiation of extracellular Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+] i fluctuations in quiescent cells and to an increase in the frequency of fluctuations in spontaneously active cells (39Kwiecien R. Tseeb V. Kurchikov A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 613-623Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Herrington J. Hille B.

Finally, when activated, Ca2+-mobilizing receptors generate extracellular Ca2+-independent oscillatory Ca2+ signals in pituitary cells (10Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In accord with our observations concerning intact cells, it has also been shown recently that Ca2+ inhibits sGC in crude cell extract and immunopurified preparations (43Parkinson S.J. Jovanovic A. Jovanovic S. Wagner F. Terzic A. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Such a role of Ca2+ signaling is not unique for sGC; intracellular Ca2+ also inhibits two other members of this family of enzymes, particulate guanylyl cyclase (44Wolbring G. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 45Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and adenylyl cyclase, particularly types V and VI (46Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The common point in [Ca2+] i -dependent inhibition of these enzymes is in the reciprocal regulation of intracellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides and Ca2+. The unique characteristic of the action of elevated [Ca2+] i on sGC signaling pathway is its dual action; it stimulates cGMP production by activating eNOS and nNOS but inhibits sGC even in the presence of elevated NO. This inhibition is not only required to balance the nNOS- and eNOS-generated NO production but also to protect the cells from overloading with Ca2+ when NO production occurs in a [Ca2+] i -independent manner, i.e. by iNOS (22Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated eNOS (47Butt E. Bernhardt M. Smolenski A. Kotsonis P. Frohlich L.G. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Lohmann S.M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5179-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In summary, here we show that sGC and AC are operative in unstimulated pituitary cells and differently regulated by [Ca2+] i . The basal levels of cGMP are 2–4-fold higher than cAMP when estimated in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Facilitation of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx and removal of Ca2+ from medium were practically ineffective in modulating cAMP production. This suggests that the participation of [Ca2+] i -sensitive AC in unstimulated pituitary cells is minor. In contrast, both treatments affected sGC activity. Consistent with the role of [Ca2+] i in facilitating nNOS and eNOS, cGMP production was inhibited but not abolished by culturing cells in Ca2+-deficient medium. Inhibition was not observed in cells with elevated NO. An increase in [Ca2+] i also inhibited cGMP production but independently of NO levels and the phosphodiesterase activity. The low cAMP production and its independence of [Ca2+] i and the high level of cGMP and its dependence on [Ca2+] i are consistent with the coupling of the NO signaling pathway, but not the AC signaling pathway, to spontaneous Ca2+ signaling in cultured pituitary cells."

To elucidate the events leading to this drastic change, MTSV1-7 cells and its subclone HB2 (which shows a more strictly epithelial phenotype) were transfected with the hybrid trk-neu receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the trkA nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of c-erbB2 (neu). In cells expressing this construct, c-erbB2 homodimerization can be mimicked by addition of NGF. In trk-neu transfectants of HB2 cells, modest expression led to increased cell proliferation upon NGF treatment. When clones with higher expression levels were grown in collagen, NGF instead induced cell scattering, diminished viability and dramatically increased apoptosis. Interestingly, both the dissociation of colonies and loss of cell viability could be completely reversed by treatment of the cells with antibodies that activate the adhesive capacity of the alpha2beta1 integrin. Long-term NGF treatment of high-expressing transfectants generated fibroblastic clones displaying a reduced expression of integrin alpha2 and E-cadherin, and extensive apoptosis in collagen. These results, which indicate that strong c-erbB2 signalling may lead to downregulation and/or inactivation of the alpha2beta1 integrin, promoting apoptosis in collagen, provide one possible explanation to the increased apoptosis frequently seen in early tumour development."
