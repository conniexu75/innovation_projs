A newly developed method is described for calculating the intramitochondrial pH of isolated bovine heart mitochondria based on the distribution of 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione between mitochondrial compartments, pKa of 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione, and pH of the extramitochondrial medium. The measurement of intramitochondrial pH also permitted calculation of the intra- and extramitochondrial pH gradient. 2. Intramitochondrial pH and pH gradient values were calculated for respiration and in ATP-dependent Ca++-, Mg++-, and Zn++-activated bovine heart mitochondria. 3. The intramitochondrial pH of succinate-supported State 4 mitochondria ranged from 7.40 to 7.51 while the extramitochondrial pH ranged from 6.96 to 7.00. The pH gradient ranged from 0.40 to 0.51, depending upon the pH of the extramitochondrial medium. The addition of either 0.565 mm or 6.237 mm Ca++ gave rise to an intramitochondrial pH ranging from 8.31 to 8.58 while the extramitochondrial pH was between 6.70 and 7.00. The pH gradient ranged from 1.51 to 1.75 pH units. Under these conditions the stoichiometry of H+ ejected from and OH- accumulated within the mitochondria was 1.00. 4. When either 20 µm 2,4-dinitrophenol or 1.7 mm phosphate was added to mitochondria activated with 0.565 mm Ca++, the intramitochondrial alkalinization and high pH gradient were neutralized. Acetate (8.3 mm) partially neutralized these effects. 5. No intramitochondrial alkalinization was observed in ATP-supported mitochondria supplemented with 80 nmoles of Ca++ per mg of protein (0.436 mm). 6. The pH gradient of State 3 mitochondria, in the presence of 20 mm Mg++ and permeant anions, was 0.20 pH unit. In the absence of permeant anions, the addition of 10 mm Mg++ to State 4 mitochondria gave rise to a slight intramitochondrial alkalinization. Supplementing succinate-oxidizing (State 4) mitochondria containing 10 mm Mg++ with either 100 or 300 µm Zn++ did not induce any further alkalinization. Ten millimolar Mg++-induced ascorbate oxidation (State 4) gave rise to a slight alkalinization. 7. The pH gradients of State 4 and uncoupled mitochondria were the same. 8. The pH gradients of State 4 mitochondria, in the absence of permeant anions and oxidizing 30 mm succinate, were not different from those oxidizing 5 mm ascorbate in the presence of 100 µm N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl phenylenediamine. 9. The reliability, sensitivity, and limitations of this method for calculating intramitochondrial pH as well as the significance of the findings are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1550332661,"A soil microorganism has been isolated which will grow on yeast mannan as the sole carbon source. The organism secretes into the cultural medium an α-mannosidase which appears to act as an exoglycosidase and removes the short α-1,2′- and α-1,3′-linked mannose side chains of the mannan molecule to leave a resistant core composed of a linear α-1,6′-linked mannose polymer. This provides the first direct proof that yeast mannan contains such a backbone structure. While the mannosidase does not appear to degrade the 1,6′-linked backbone, it does hydrolyze α-1,6′-mannobiose as well as the α-1,2′ and α-1,3′-linked oligosaccharides obtained from yeast mannan by acetolysis. It is not yet known whether this reflects a broad substrate specificity or the presence of several different proteins in the preparation. The enzyme may be useful for studies on the yeast cell wall and on mannose-containing glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1517709759,"Abstract DNA methylase activity was detected in cell-free homogenates of rat spleen nuclei. S-Adenosylmethionine was active as the methyl donor, and the product was identified as 5-methylcytosine in DNA. Unlike bacterial DNA methylases, spleen DNA methylase methylated its own DNA; however, the reaction was stimulated by the addition of salmon sperm DNA. Evidence is presented that this incorporation was not due to synthesis and methylation of DNA by intact cells or bacteria remaining in the cell-free extract. A different enzymatic activity which can be confused with DNA methylase activity is also described."

https://openalex.org/W1961265804,"1. A technique was devised for ready sequential sampling of lipocyte suspensions for measurement of metabolic activities. 2. With the use of this technique in paired incubations, an effect of oligomycin to decrease the QO2 of fat cells to 45% of control was shown. 3. An analogy between the effect of oligomycin on intact cells and that described for isolated mitochondria was suggested, since the antibiotic inhibited incorporation of 32Pi into acid-soluble mononucleotides and decreased 14CO2 production from glucose-1-14C and glucose-6-14C. 4. Stimulation of QO2 by epinephrine was shown in the presence and in the absence of oligomycin; there was no accompanying increase in 14CO2 production from glucose when oligomycin was present, indicating that glucose was not the substrate for the observed increase in oxygen consumption. 5. It is concluded that oligomycin inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in the fat cell. Under these conditions, (a) a significant portion of the respiration of the lipocyte is not linked in an obligatory fashion to phosphorylation, and (b) it may be inferred that the calorigenic effect of epinephrine in adipose tissue involves electron flow to oxygen not linked to phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1526758473,"Scylloinositol has been detected in myoinositol preparations from boar seminal vesicle secretion. It represents approximately 6% of the total inositol isolated and has been characterized as its hexaacetate. Scylloinositol has also been detected chromatographically in extracts prepared from the seminal vesicles, coagulating glands, dorsolateral prostate, ventral prostate, and epididymis of the male rat, the ampullae of the stallion, and bull and ram semen. A glycerol inositol phosphate diester has been detected chromatographically in extracts prepared from the dorsolateral prostate, epididymis, ventral prostate, and coagulating gland of the rat as well as stallion ampullae and bull and ram semen. It has been isolated as its crystalline cyclohexylamine salt from the male rat dorsolateral prostate gland and from stallion ampullae. The compound was shown to be identical in chemical behavior and physical properties with an authentic sample of the monohydrate of the cyclohexylamine salt of D-glycerol 1-(L-myoinositol 1-hydrogen phosphate)."
https://openalex.org/W1741327916,"Abstract The present study attempts to analyze the nature of the intramolecular cross-linking in rat skin collagen. A new procedure is described for the isolation of a cross-linking peptide from rat skin collagen. The procedure is also useful for the separation of similar peptides from other collagen species. The peptide obtained from rat skin collagen contains the α,β unsaturated aldehyde as 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, is devoid of lysine, but when prepared from young animals that received 14C- and 3H-labeled lysine it is radioactive. In two different experiments the 14C specific activity of the peptide (expressed as disintegrations per min per µmole of aldehyde) was twice the specific activity of collagen lysine, suggesting that two modified lysines are involved in the cross-link. The percentage of retention of 3H in the peptide obtained from collagen labeled with l-lysine-14C, uniformly labeled, and dl-lysine-6-3H strongly suggests that the aldehyde is formed by removal of the e-amino group of lysine and that the cross-link is formed by an aldol-like condensation of two aldehydes from adjacent chains. Similar experiments with the same 14C-labeled lysine and dl-lysine-4,5-3H add support to this possibility. Both experiments are also suggestive of the loss of a single tritium from position 5 of lysine during hydroxylation, as has already been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1577624912,"Abstract Exposure of peanut seed to 500 kr of x-rays followed by 6 weeks of storage before planting resulted in a severe reduction of 14C-amino acid incorporation by the ribosomal material. Ribosomes from irradiated tissue were just as effective as those from control tissue in amino acid incorporation directed by exogenous messenger ribonucleic acid and polyuridylic acid. Polyribosomes were nearly absent from the ribosomal material obtained from irradiated tissue, and the synthesis of RNA and protein in vivo was much less than that for control cotyledons. The 105,000 x g supernatant from irradiated tissue was superior to the control supernatant when control ribosomes were used, but gave the same activity with ribosomes from irradiated tissue. Assay of leucyl and phenylalanyl transfer RNA synthetases showed that x-irradiation does not affect their activities. The supernatant fraction from irradiated tissue contains, however, only one-third as much ribonuclease activity as that of the control. The high level of RNase activity in the control 105,000 x g supernatant possibly leads to degradation of the template and ribosomal RNAs, thereby reducing amino acid incorporation. Other experiments showed that mRNA, purified by methylated albumin Kieselguhr column chromatography from irradiated tissue, hybridized with control DNA about 20% as well as that from control tissue. It is concluded from our results that x-irradiation reduces the capacity of cells to produce biologically functional mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2095214594,"ACCESSORY nuclei have been described in the oocytes of Hymenoptera1–3 and some other insect orders. They are present during vitellogenesis, probably originating from the oocyte nucleus3. Structurally they resemble nuclei and their electron-dense inclusions contain RNA, possibly of nuclear origin. They seem to be concerned with the control of the synthesis of albuminous yolk and afterwards perhaps with the formation of the vitelline membrane3,4. In Nasonia vitripennis (Walk), they first appear near the nucleus of the oocyte, and spread from there through the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1492571255,"Abstract Some kinetic properties of the soluble and the mitochondrially bound hexokinases of Ehrlich-Lettre ascites tumor cells were examined. Both enzyme forms were essentially kinetically identical, and both were found to be exceedingly sensitive to inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate. Ki values in the absence of Pi at 1 and at 2 mm ATP were 0.019 and 0.035 mm glucose-6-P, respectively, for the bound enzyme. In agreement with the results of others, added Pi (3 mm) increased the Ki values to 0.034, 0.045, and 0.060 mm glucose-6-P at 1, 2.5, and 5 mm ATP, respectively. Glucose-6-P was a mixed inhibitor with respect to ATP. A 90 to 95% inhibition of hexokinase was found when the ratio of ATP to glucose-6-P approached 3 at 1 mm ATP and 3 mm Pi. A comparison of these kinetic results with the ATP and glucose-6-P levels observed in intact Ehrlich-Lettre ascites cells incubated in air indicated that the marked inhibition of glucose uptake which begins 1 to 2 min after glucose addition may be explained by the hexokinase inhibition expected because of the accumulated glucose-6-P. It does not appear necessary to postulate other hexokinase control mechanisms in these cells."

https://openalex.org/W1595701475,"Abstract Isolated cell walls of Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 9945 were digested with lysozyme, and a low molecular weight fraction was obtained after dialysis of the digest. A disaccharide and two disaccharide peptides were isolated from this fraction by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-4 column and chromatography on Dowex 50. The structure of the isolated compounds was studied by chemical and enzymatic techniques. The disaccharide was found to be identical with O-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-2-acetamido-3-O-(d-1-carboxyethyl)-2-deoxy-d-glucose (GlcNAcβ-(1 → 4)MurNAc) previously isolated from Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls. The two disaccharide peptides were shown to be tripeptide derivatives of this disaccharide, wherein the peptide is linked to the disaccharide by an amide bond between the carboxyl group of the muramic acid of the latter and the NH2-terminal amino group of the peptide. One of the disaccharide peptides was shown to have the structure [see PDF for structure] (shown in Fig. 4). The other has the same structure as this, but in addition contains an amide group on the α-COOH of glutamic acid. Small amounts of a tetrasaccharide, GlcNAcβ-(1 → 4)MurNAcβ(1 → 4)GlcNacβ(1 → 4)MurNAc, were also isolated."

https://openalex.org/W2025351948,"NITROSAMINES and nitrosamides are recognized as potent carcinogens1,2 and mutagens3. N-Methyl-N-nitroso urethane has produced viable mutations of Amoeba proteus4 and we describe a mutant called “Pale”, which is twelve months old and has passed through 70–100 generations. Its cell cycle occupies 5 days compared with 2–2.25 days for the parent X65 strain of A. proteus. Both X65 and Pale amoebae are mass cultured using Tetrahymena as a food organism. The Pale mutant, unlike the parent, has few cytoplasmic crystals. These are square thin platelets generally 5–10µ long and strongly birefringent between crossed polaroid filters. Strain X65 amoebae, and other strains of A. proteus5, have many non-birefringent bi-pyramidal crystals which give the cytoplasm its darker granular appearance. Occasionally X65 A. proteus has a few birefringent crystals in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1607858579,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion of crystalline cytochrome b2, the l(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.3) of bakers' yeast, is observed in the wave length range, 600 to 195 mµ. The dispersion at short wave lengths is similar in character to that observed with α-helical polypeptides, including a shoulder at about 210 mµ, except that the minimum occurs at 230 mµ instead of 233 mµ. The depth of this minimum and the height of the maximum at 199 mµ agree in suggesting that the content of α helix ranges from 15% to 40%, the higher values being observed with more active samples of enzyme. The optical rotatory dispersion in this region is little if at all affected by changes in the oxidation states of the heme and flavin mononucleotide prosthetic groups or by removal of the latter group. Anomalies in the dispersion are observed in the region of the α, β, and γ absorption bands of the heme group. The oxidized enzyme shows a small, negative Cotton effect centered near the γ, or Soret, band, and some small irregularities in the 500 to 600 mµ region. In contrast, the reduced enzyme shows a much larger, negative Cotton effect at the Soret band and a smaller, unsymmetrical one at the α-band (550 mµ). The amplitude of the Soret Cotton effect is inversely dependent on the concentration of l-lactate when this is used as reducing agent. The amplitude of this anomaly is somewhat larger when the enzyme is reduced by mercaptoethanol than when it is reduced by l-lactate or by hydrogen in the presence of a platinum catalyst. The amplitude of the anomaly in the dispersion of the enzyme reduced by l-lactate near the α absorption band is found to be dependent on the concentration of the enzyme in a manner consistent with the view that it results from aggregation. On the other hand, this anomaly is not observed when hydrogen plus catalyst or mercaptoethanol is used as reducing agent. Large changes in the heme Cotton effects result from removal of the FMN prosthetic group. The oxidized apoenzyme has a small, positive effect in the Soret region, and the reduced apoenzyme has a large, positive effect. These changes are nearly completely reversed by addition of FMN to the apoenzyme; with apoenzyme which was 50% reactivated by addition of FMN, the regenerated Soret Cotton effect had an amplitude 70% of that of the original holoenzyme. The addition of excess p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate to the reduced enzyme gives rise to a Cotton effect similar to that of the reduced apoenzyme. If the system is kept strictly anaerobic, addition of mercaptoethanol completely reverses this effect. The observations reported here show that the FMN is located close enough to the heme to affect the symmetry of the absorption bands of the latter. The fact that the action of p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate on the enzyme produces optical rotatory dispersion changes very similar to those resulting from complete removal of FMN suggests that the asymmetry produced by FMN is the result of a significant coupling between the two groups which is weakened by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate to the point that it completely loses its effect on the heme absorption bands."

https://openalex.org/W2002621413,"CHANGES in the composition of cells of different tissues in relation to age may result in alterations of the enzyme activities and metabolic rate which ultimately regulate the function of the cell. The study of chemical changes has therefore a basic association with the ageing of various tissues. The fact that ageing is accompanied by concomitant loss of functional cells has attracted the attention of various workers1. The nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus contents of rat skeletal muscle, a fixed post-mitotic tissue, decreased significantly with age when compared with those of liver, a mitotic potential tissue2. No significant change was found in the activity of DNA and various other enzymes of the liver when fully matured rats were compared with old rats3. Ascorbic acid is known to participate in various metabolic functions4, and these specific functions indicate that it may play some important part in the ageing process4–6. Bound ascorbic acid has been shown to have an enzyme function7. In the present investigation the content of bound ascorbic acid in liver and muscle has been estimated to evaluate the effect of age."
