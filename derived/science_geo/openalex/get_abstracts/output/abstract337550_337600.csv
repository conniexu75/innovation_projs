https://openalex.org/W1969975108,"The development of mass spectrometric techniques for determination of (230)Th abundance has made it possible to reduce analytical errors in (238)U-(234)U-(230)Th dating of corals even with very small samples. Samples of 6 x 10(8) atoms of (230)Th can be measured to an accuracy of +/-3 percent (2sigma) and 3 x 10(10) atoms of (230)Th can be measured to an accuracy of +/-0.2 percent. The time range over which useful age data on corals can be obtained now ranges from about 50 to about 500,000 years. For young corals, this approach may be preferable to (14)C dating. The precision with which the age of a coral can now be determined should make it possible to critically test the Milankovitch hypothesis concerning Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Analyses of a number of corals that grew during the last interglacial period yield ages of 122,000 to 130,000 years. The ages coincide with, or slightly postdate, the summer solar insolation high at 65 degrees N latitude which occurred 128,000 years ago. This supports the idea that changes in Pleistocene climate can be the result of variations in the distribution of solar insolation caused by changes in the geometry of the earth's orbit and rotation axis."
https://openalex.org/W1999750072,"A natural single crystal of zircon, ZrSiO(4,) from Sri Lanka exhibited zonation due to alpha-decay damage. The zones vary in thickness on a scale from one to hundreds of micrometers. The uranium and thorium concentrations vary from zone to zone such that the alpha-decay dose is between 0.2 x 10(16) and 0.8 x 10(16) alpha-events per milligram (0.15 to 0.60 displacement per atom). The transition from the crystalline to the aperiodic metamict state occurs over this dose range. Differential expansion of individual layers due to variations in their alpha-decay dose caused a systematic pattern of fractures that do not propagate across aperiodic layers. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed a systematic change in the microstructure from a periodic atomic array to an aperiodic array with increasing alpha-decay dose. At doses greater than 0.8 x 10(16) alpha-events per milligram there is no evidence for long-range order. This type of damage will accumulate in actinide-bearing, ceramic nuclear waste forms. The systematic pattern of fractures would occur in crystalline phases that are zoned with respect to actinide radionuclides."
https://openalex.org/W1990104828,"A statistical procedure, derived from a theoretical model of fracture growth, is used to identify a foreshock sequence while it is in progress. As a predictor, the procedure reduces the average uncertainty in the rate of occurrence for a future strong earthquake by a factor of more than 1000 when compared with the Poisson rate of occurrence. About one-third of all main shocks with local magnitude greater than or equal to 4.0 in central California can be predicted in this way, starting from a 7-year database that has a lower magnitude cut off of 1.5. The time scale of such predictions is of the order of a few hours to a few days for foreshocks in the magnitude range from 2.0 to 5.0."
https://openalex.org/W1971704780,"The composition of precipitation in China is highly influenced by fossil fuel combustion and agricultural and cultural practices. Compared to the eastern United States, precipitation in China generally has higher concentrations of sulfate, ammonium, and calcium. Wet deposition rates of sulfur in China are 7 to 130 times higher than those in a remote area in the Southern Hemisphere. In many areas of the world, significant ecological changes have occurred in ecosystems that have acid deposition rates substantially less than those currently existing in China."
https://openalex.org/W2022287518,"In a seminal article in 1946, S. S. Stevens noted that the numerical measures then in common use exhibited three admissible groups of transformations: similarity, affine, and monotonic. Until recently, it was unclear what other scale types are possible. For situations on the continuum that are homogeneous (that is, objects are not distinguishable by their properties), the possibilities are essentially these three plus another type lying between the first two. These types lead to clearly described classes of structures that can, in principle, be incorporated into the classical structure of physical units. Such results, along with characterizations of important special cases, are potentially useful in the behavioral and social sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2090541855,"Members of lowland Costa Rican forest populations of Hymenaea courbaril (Leguminosae) have longer intervals between seed crops, a later age at first reproduction, larger seed crops, and more resin in the pod walls than do the H. courbaril native to Puerto Rico. The primary predispersal seed predators of H. courbaril in Costa Rica, Rhinochenus spp., are absent from Puerto Rico, and it is postulated that this is a major cause of the interpopulation differences."

https://openalex.org/W2130403562,"The frequency of true altruism in nature requires assessment because, if true altruism is common, Darwin's theory of natural selection is inadequate to account for all of evolution. An experiment provided birds with the opportunity to behave truly altruistically. One member of each of 25 wild pairs was collected. Ten of these were replaced naturally by courting birds, or consorts. Only one consort fostered the young of her prospective mate, and her behavior was interpretable as a reproductive error. Other consorts behaved reproductively selfishly."
https://openalex.org/W2028414419,"Chemical mechanisms of pyrolysis, growth, and oxidation processes in flames have traditionally been inferred from spatial profile measurements of species concentrations. Experimental investigations now include the detection of numerous minor species such as reactive radicals and intermediate hydrocarbons. In assessing a proposed mechanism important new constraints can be established when the detailed species profile data are combined with velocity and temperature measurements and analyzed to determine production and destruction rates for specific molecules. Recent results on hydrocarbon diffusion flames provide new information on the interplay between chemical and transport processes. These measurements have led to direct tests of proposed routes for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the first, small soot particles. The inception chemistry of hydrocarbon growth reactions and initial particle formation is thought to control soot formation, flame radiation and energy transfer, and pollutant emission in combustion environments."
