https://openalex.org/W2145840889,"Fungi play major roles in ecosystem processes, but the determinants of fungal diversity and biogeographic patterns remain poorly understood. Using DNA metabarcoding data from hundreds of globally distributed soil samples, we demonstrate that fungal richness is decoupled from plant diversity. The plant-to-fungus richness ratio declines exponentially toward the poles. Climatic factors, followed by edaphic and spatial variables, constitute the best predictors of fungal richness and community composition at the global scale. Fungi show similar latitudinal diversity gradients to other organisms, with several notable exceptions. These findings advance our understanding of global fungal diversity patterns and permit integration of fungi into a general macroecological framework."

However, no surfaces were able to repel extremely-low-energy liquids such as fluorinated solvents, which completely wet even the most hydrophobic material. We show how roughness alone, if made of a specific doubly reentrant structure that enables very low liquid-solid contact fraction, can render the surface of any material superrepellent. Starting from a completely wettable material (silica), we micro- and nanostructure its surface to make it superomniphobic and bounce off all available liquids, including perfluorohexane. The same superomniphobicity is further confirmed with identical surfaces of a metal and a polymer. Free of any hydrophobic coating, the superomniphobic silica surface also withstands temperatures over 1000°C and resists biofouling."

This single-site gold species is active for the low-temperature (&lt;200°C) water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. Unexpectedly, gold is thus similar to platinum in creating –O linkages with more than eight alkali ions and establishing an active site on various supports. The intrinsic activity of the single-site gold species is the same on irreducible supports as on reducible ceria, iron oxide, and titania supports, apparently all sharing a common, similarly structured gold active site. This finding paves the way for using earth-abundant supports to disperse and stabilize precious metal atoms with alkali additives for the WGS and potentially other fuel-processing reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2131400772,"Introduction The notion that species boundaries can be porous to introgression is increasingly accepted. Yet the broader role of introgression in evolution remains contentious and poorly documented, partly because of the challenges involved in accurately identifying introgression in the very groups where it is most likely to occur. Recently diverged species often have incomplete reproductive barriers and may hybridize where they overlap. However, because of retention and stochastic sorting of ancestral polymorphisms, inference of the correct species branching order is notoriously challenging for recent speciation events, especially those closely spaced in time. Without knowledge of species relationships, it is impossible to identify instances of introgression. Rationale Since the discovery that the single mosquito taxon described in 1902 as Anopheles gambiae was actually a complex of several closely related and morphologically indistinguishable sibling species, the correct species branching order has remained controversial and unresolved. This Afrotropical complex contains the world’s most important vectors of human malaria, owing to their close association with humans, as well as minor vectors and species that do not bite humans. On the basis of ecology and behavior, one might predict phylogenetic clustering of the three highly anthropophilic vector species. However, previous phylogenetic analyses of the complex based on a limited number of markers strongly disagree about relationships between the major vectors, potentially because of historical introgression between them. To investigate the history of the species complex, we used whole-genome reference assemblies, as well as dozens of resequenced individuals from the field. Results We observed a large amount of phylogenetic discordance between trees generated from the autosomes and X chromosome. The autosomes, which make up the majority of the genome, overwhelmingly supported the grouping of the three major vectors of malaria, An. gambiae , An. coluzzii , and An. arabiensis . In stark contrast, the X chromosome strongly supported the grouping of An. arabiensis with a species that plays no role in malaria transmission, An. quadriannulatus . Although the whole-genome consensus phylogeny unequivocally agrees with the autosomal topology, we found that the topology most often located on the X chromosome follows the historical species branching order, with pervasive introgression on the autosomes producing relationships that group the three highly anthropophilic species together. With knowledge of the correct species branching order, we are further able to uncover introgression between another species pair, as well as a complex history of balancing selection, introgression, and local adaptation of a large autosomal inversion that confers aridity tolerance. Conclusion We identify the correct species branching order of the An. gambiae species complex, resolving a contentious phylogeny. Notably, lineages leading to the principal vectors of human malaria were among the first in the complex to radiate and are not most closely related to each other. Pervasive autosomal introgression between these human malaria vectors, including nonsister vector species, suggests that traits enhancing vectorial capacity can be acquired not only through de novo mutation but also through a more rapid process of interspecific genetic exchange.

https://openalex.org/W2023550692,"T cell responses are initiated by antigen and promoted by a range of costimulatory signals. Understanding how T cells integrate alternative signal combinations and make decisions affecting immune response strength or tolerance poses a considerable theoretical challenge. Here, we report that T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signals imprint an early, cell-intrinsic, division fate, whereby cells effectively count through generations before returning automatically to a quiescent state. This autonomous program can be extended by cytokines. Signals from the TCR, costimulatory receptors, and cytokines add together using a linear division calculus, allowing the strength of a T cell response to be predicted from the sum of the underlying signal components. These data resolve a long-standing costimulation paradox and provide a quantitative paradigm for therapeutically manipulating immune response strength."

Mobility is essential to all living organisms, from organelle transport to movement of entire organisms. In many motile systems, actin and myosin filaments assume ordered arrays organized by specific actin or myosin ligands. In higher animals, movement is performed by striated muscle, defined by highly regular arrangements of visible striations. The minimal contractile unit of striated muscle is the sarcomere, which is anchored and stabilized by transverse crosslinking structures at the two lateral Z-disk boundaries, the A-band and the central M-band (Gautel, 2011Gautel M. The sarcomeric cytoskeleton: who picks up the strain?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2010Tskhovrebova L. Trinick J. Roles of titin in the structure and elasticity of the sarcomere.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010: 612482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the giant protein titin (connectin) spans Z-disks to M-bands and may act as a blueprint for sarcomere assembly (Gautel, 2011Gautel M. The sarcomeric cytoskeleton: who picks up the strain?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2010Tskhovrebova L. Trinick J. Roles of titin in the structure and elasticity of the sarcomere.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010: 612482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Within the vertebrate Z-disk, a complicated network of protein-protein interactions anchors and stabilizes the actin and the elastic titin filaments (Luther, 2009Luther P.K. The vertebrate muscle Z-disc: sarcomere anchor for structure and signalling.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2009; 30: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). α-actinin was originally described as an actin-crosslinking Z-disk protein in muscle (Masaki et al., 1967Masaki T. Endo M. Ebashi S. Localization of 6S component of α-actinin at Z-band.J. Biochem. 1967; 62: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but its four closely related isogenes (ACTN1–4) fulfil similar functions in all cell types (Foley and Young, 2014Foley K.S. Young P.W. The non-muscle functions of actinins: an update.Biochem. J. 2014; 459: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Sjöblom et al., 2008Sjöblom B. Salmazo A. Djinović-Carugo K. α-actinin structure and regulation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2688-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). α-actinin, in particular isoform 2 (encoded by ACTN2), is the major Z-disk component, where it plays a central role crosslinking actin and titin filaments. α-actinin is an antiparallel homodimer of more than 200 kDa, comprising an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD), a central domain of four spectrin-like repeats (SRs), and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (CAMD) with two pairs of EF hand motifs (EFs) (Figure 1A). Because the SR region appears to have a cylindrical shape, it is also called the rod domain. The elementary structure of the Z-disk is that of a tetragonal array of antiparallel actin filaments spaced 240 Å apart and crosslinked by successive layers of filaments at intervals of ≈190 Å rotated by 90° between each layer along the myofibril axis (Goldstein et al., 1979Goldstein M.A. Schroeter J.P. Sass R.L. The Z lattice in canine cardiac muscle.J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These filaments correlate with α-actinin crosslinks, but the molecular layout of α-actinin that allows strict alternating crosslinks between actin filaments remains elusive (reviewed in Luther, 2009Luther P.K. The vertebrate muscle Z-disc: sarcomere anchor for structure and signalling.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2009; 30: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In striated muscle, α-actinin also binds differentially spliced titin Z-repeats, possibly regulating the number of crosslinking α-actinin molecules (Gautel et al., 1996Gautel M. Goulding D. Bullard B. Weber K. Fürst D.O. The central Z-disk region of titin is assembled from a novel repeat in variable copy numbers.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These titin Z-repeats contain a short, hydrophobic α-actinin-binding motif, which interacts with the CAMD (Atkinson et al., 2001Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Ca2+-independent binding of an EF-hand domain to a novel motif in the α-actinin-titin complex.Nat. Struct.

Molecular structure of the sarcomeric Z-disk: two types of titin interactions lead to an asymmetrical sorting of α-actinin.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Additionally, α-actinin binds a plethora of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in striated muscle and nonmuscle tissues (Djinovic-Carugo et al., 2002Djinovic-Carugo K. Gautel M. Ylänne J. Young P. The spectrin repeat: a structural platform for cytoskeletal protein assemblies.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 119-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Foley and Young, 2014Foley K.S. Young P.W. The non-muscle functions of actinins: an update.Biochem. J. 2014; 459: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To achieve ordered cytoskeletal assemblies, the binding properties of α-actinin must be spatiotemporally regulated. Actin binding of nonmuscle isoforms is regulated by binding of Ca2+ ions to the CAMD (Foley and Young, 2014Foley K.S. Young P.W. The non-muscle functions of actinins: an update.Biochem. J. 2014; 459: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, muscle α-actinin is calcium insensitive, and its F-actin- and titin-binding properties are likely regulated by phospholipids (most notably phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PIP2) (Fukami et al., 1992Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Requirement of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for α-actinin function.Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, Young et al., 1998Young P. Ferguson C. Bañuelos S.

Gautel M. The interaction of titin and α-actinin is controlled by a phospholipid-regulated intramolecular pseudoligand mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite being a major integrator of titin and actin in one of the stiffest structures of the sarcomere, muscle α-actinin shows surprisingly dynamic association with the Z-disk actin cytoskeleton (Sanger and Sanger, 2008Sanger J.M. Sanger J.W. The dynamic Z bands of striated muscle cells.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe37Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that its actin and titin binding activity must be dynamically regulated. Biochemical analysis led us to propose previously that the α-actinin-titin interaction is regulated by an intramolecular mechanism where a short sequence in α-actinin between the ABD and the rod interacts with the CAMD in a pseudoligand mechanism (Young and Gautel, 2000Young P. Gautel M. The interaction of titin and α-actinin is controlled by a phospholipid-regulated intramolecular pseudoligand mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mode of interaction has been found for the α-actinin ligand palladin (Beck et al., 2011Beck M.R. Otey C.A. Campbell S.L. Structural characterization of the interactions between palladin and α-actinin.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 413: 712-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, we report the crystal structure of human α-actinin-2 at 3.5 Å resolution. It is a complete high-resolution α-actinin-2 structure, revealing insight into the mechanism that promotes the molecular assembly of the Z-disk and the intramolecular contacts that regulate these interactions. Furthermore, the structure provides a template for the α-actinin and spectrin superfamily and insight into the impact of disease-associated genetic variants in ACTN genes. The structure of α-actinin-2 was solved and refined to 3.5 Å resolution to an Rwork/Rfree of 20.5%/25.8% (Table S1 available online). The α-actinin-2 dimer reveals a cylindrical shape ∼360 Å long and ∼60 Å wide (Figures 1B and 1C). Each protomer comprises an N-terminal ABD followed by an α-helical linker (neck), four spectrin-like repeats (SR1–4), and a C-terminal CAMD of two pairs of EF hands (EF1-2 and EF3-4). The first 34 and last 2 residues are missing from our model. Two antiparallel SR1–4s that assemble the core of the extended structure form the central portion of the dimer (rod). The two ABDs and two CAMDs flank the elongated assembly at its ends. As expected, in the absence of actin, the ABD is in a closed conformation, in which the two calponin homology domains (CH1 and CH2) are in extensive contact, similar to the arrangement found in α-actinin-3, plectin, and fimbrin ABD domains (Franzot et al., 2005Franzot G. Sjöblom B. Gautel M. Djinović Carugo K. The crystal structure of the actin binding domain from α-actinin in its closed conformation: structural insight into phospholipid regulation of α-actinin.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Klein et al., 2004Klein M.G. Shi W. Ramagopal U. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Kovar D.R. Staiger C.J. Almo S.C. Structure of the actin crosslinking core of fimbrin.Structure. 2004; 12: 999-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ABD is linked to the first spectrin-like repeat (SR1) of the rod through the six-turn α-helical neck that is flanked by two hinges, the first on residue G258 linking the ABD to the neck and the second on residue M283 linking the neck to SR1 (Figure 2A). Comparison of the spectrin-like repeats in the full-length α-actinin-2 structure with the previously determined dimeric rod domain (Ylänne et al., 2001Ylänne J. Scheffzek K. Young P. Saraste M. Crystal structure of the α-actinin rod reveals an extensive torsional twist.Structure. 2001; 9: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID code 1HCI) reveals high similarity between SR2, SR3, and SR4 and minor differences for SR1 (Table S2). However, although the α helices of the two SR4 domains are well aligned, there are large deviations between α helices h1 and h2 due to contacts of EF1-2 positioned over this loop in the full-length structure (Figures 1 and 2B; Figure S1A). The antiparallel α-actinin-2 dimer assembles predominately via the rod domain. The two ABDs are flanked at both termini along the long axis of the rod and are stabilized in their position by a few polar interactions with the neck region and EF3-4. The C-terminal CAMD is divided into structurally distinct N- and C-terminal lobes: EF hands 1-2 and 3-4 connected by a short linker. The overall structure of each lobe is well defined through the main-chain atoms on the α helices of the EF hands. As expected, no density conforming to bound calcium was detected, and the architecture of the CAMD resembles calcium-free conformations of calmodulin (see below). The EF3-4 accommodates the α helix of the neck from the juxtaposed α-actinin-2 protomer through its hydrophobic cleft. This classifies the EF3-4-neck interaction as 1:1 or canonical (Hoeflich and Ikura, 2002Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Calmodulin in action: diversity in target recognition and activation mechanisms.Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), involving the cavity formed by the first helix of the EF3-4, the linker between the EF3-4 helices, and the C-terminal helix of the lobe (Figures 2C and 2D). The EF3-4-neck interface is mainly hydrophobic, supported with a few H-bonds (Figure 2C). The neck region displays the known hydrophobic Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-binding motif, termed 1-4-5-8 (Bayley et al., 1996Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Target recognition by calmodulin: dissecting the kinetics and affinity of interaction using short peptide sequences.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), with hydrophobic A266, I269, C270, and L273 at these positions (Figure 2F). Additionally, EF3-4 interact with the connecting loop of α helices 2 and 3 from SR1 via an H-bond and a π-stacking interaction, supporting previous reports that SR1 stabilizes the interaction with EF3-4 (Young and Gautel, 2000Young P. Gautel M. The interaction of titin and α-actinin is controlled by a phospholipid-regulated intramolecular pseudoligand mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall binding interface of EF3-4 is ∼500 Å2, representing 11% of its total surface area. The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) with the C-terminal lobe in complex with Zr-7 of titin (Atkinson et al., 2001Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Ca2+-independent binding of an EF-hand domain to a novel motif in the α-actinin-titin complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (PDB ID code 1H8B) is 1.1 Å for 64 equivalent Cα atoms, implying no significant conformational difference. EF1-2 are less well defined in the electron density compared to the C-terminal lobe, and similar to EF3-4 show a binding interface of ∼500 Å2 with SR4. The interactions occur between the N-terminal α helix of EF1-2, the loop connecting EF1 and EF2 intercalates between α helices 2 and 3 of SR4, whereas the C-terminal α helix of EF1-2 lies in a parallel orientation on the third α helix 3 of SR4 (Figure 2B). In essence, only the N- and C-terminal helices of EF1-2 are involved in the binding, and this mode has no resemblance to any known classification of calmodulin-like domains but rather is similar to a bound-free lobe (Hoeflich and Ikura, 2002Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Calmodulin in action: diversity in target recognition and activation mechanisms.Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though EF1-2 and EF3-4 have different interaction interfaces, they both adopt the same semiopen conformation (Chin and Means, 2000Chin D. Means A.R. Calmodulin: a prototypical calcium sensor.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, Swindells and Ikura, 1996Swindells M.B. Ikura M.

Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). The interaction of EF3-4 with the neck resembles that with titin Zr-7, both in terms of domain structure and ligand binding (Atkinson et al., 2001Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Ca2+-independent binding of an EF-hand domain to a novel motif in the α-actinin-titin complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure 2F). EF1-2 and EF3-4 are mostly similar to the C-terminal lobe of human cardiac troponin C (TnC) (rmsd 3.1 and 3.2 Å for EF1-2 and EF3-4, respectively, with the C-terminal TnC lobe; PDB ID code 1J1E) (Takeda et al., 2003Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Structure of the core domain of human cardiac troponin in the Ca(2+)-saturated form.Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), confirming a previous observation that side-chain clusters in the EF hands are not related to the semiopen conformation (Atkinson et al., 2001Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Ca2+-independent binding of an EF-hand domain to a novel motif in the α-actinin-titin complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further details on CAMD conformation can be found in Supplemental Information. Sequence alignment of the EF hand pairs from α-actinin-2 and TnC reveals that in α-actinin-2, several calcium ligands in TnC, typically D, N, and E, are replaced by bulkier charged or smaller residues (Figure 2E). In essence, an R inhibits calcium binding in EF1 and a longer Q in EF2, where also a smaller S occupies the last position. In EF3, two positions typically occupied by a negatively charged D host an A and a P, whereas no residue promoting calcium binding is found in EF4. Young and Gautel, 2000Young P. Gautel M. The interaction of titin and α-actinin is controlled by a phospholipid-regulated intramolecular pseudoligand mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar showed that CAMD binds to the neck region with lower affinity than to Zr-7 (Kd of 0.57 μM and 0.19 μM, respectively). In order to understand the higher affinity of CAMD for Zr-7, we compared the interaction interfaces of CAMD with Zr-7 (Atkinson et al., 2001Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Ca2+-independent binding of an EF-hand domain to a novel motif in the α-actinin-titin complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the neck region. Structural superposition of EF3-4 domains in complex with the ligands shows a similar layout between the α helices of the neck and Zr-7 in complex with CAMD (Figure 2F). Comparison of the 1-4-5-8 motifs shows that titin Zr-7 hosts a bulkier hydrophobic residue at position 1 (V702/A266), whereas position 5 in the neck is a less bulky Cys residue at position 270 (cf V706 in Zr-7) (Carugo, 2014Carugo, O. (2014). Wolumes - an algorithm to compute the volume of atoms and residues in proteins. arXiv, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3242.pdf.Google Scholar), resulting in reduced stabilization of the interaction. This is reflected in the increase of the probability measure PΔG,IF for the interface derived from the gain in solvation energy upon complexation, where PΔG,IF > 0.5 points to hydrophilic/unspecific and PΔG,IF < 0.5 points to hydrophobic/specific interfaces using PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (5701) Google Scholar). Calculated for the ligand, these range from 0.31 in the EF3-4-Zr-7 complex to 0.49 for the EF3-4-neck complex, indicating a reduced specificity with a concomitant increased hydrophilic nature of the interaction. The model of α-actinin-2 and -3 activation by PIP2 hypothesizes that PIP2 docks with the polar head group on the CH2 domain, whereas its aliphatic chain reaches the CAMD binding site on the neck, perturbing this interaction (Franzot et al., 2005Franzot G. Sjöblom B. Gautel M. Djinović Carugo K. The crystal structure of the actin binding domain from α-actinin in its closed conformation: structural insight into phospholipid regulation of α-actinin.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This regulatory mechanism requires spatial proximity of the PIP2 binding site and neck region. The PIP2 binding site was originally mapped to residues 165–181 (Fraley et al., 2003Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2646-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) on a loop connecting the first and second α helix of the CH2 domain. Structural analysis of the ABD of α-actinin-3 suggested a triplet of positively charged residues, which form a platform for PIP2 binding (α-actinin-2 residues R163, R169, and R192) (Franzot et al., 2005Franzot G. Sjöblom B. Gautel M. Djinović Carugo K. The crystal structure of the actin binding domain from α-actinin in its closed conformation: structural insight into phospholipid regulation of α-actinin.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and flexible ligand docking to place PIP2 into the structure of α-actinin-2. Although the results suggest that the PIP2 binding site is likely not rigid, a large fraction of docked poses exhibits important commonalities. Namely, in about 40% of 10,000 generated models of the complex, the polar PIP2 head directly interacts with the above-mentioned arginine platform. This was supported by fluorescence anisotropy using PIP2 binding site mutants (Figures S2A and S2B). At the same time, one (∼35% of models; Figure 2G) or both (∼4% of models; Figure S2F) PIP2 aliphatic chains, which span some 17 Å, lean on the partially hydrophobic surface of the ABD and extend toward the 1-4-5-8 motif in the neck region (Figure 2G). A similar binding mode, where not only the polar head is involved but also the aliphatic chain, has been observed in the matrix domain of HIV-1 (Saad et al., 2006Saad J.S. Miller J. Tai J. Kim A. Ghanam R.H. Summers M.F. Structural basis for targeting HIV-1 Gag proteins to the plasma membrane for virus assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This suggests that the architecture of the α-actinin-2 wild-type (WT) provides a suitable spatial orientation of both PIP2 and CAMD binding sites. The biochemical model suggests that α-actinin is activated by PIP2 binding to ABD, resulting in a release of EF3-4 from the neck, thus facilitating its interaction with titin (Young and Gautel, 2000Young P. Gautel M. The interaction of titin and α-actinin is controlled by a phospholipid-regulated intramolecular pseudoligand mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structure-guided mutants were designed to disrupt key contacts between the neck segment of α-actinin-2 and EF3-4, producing a constitutively open variant. In particular, one positively charged residue (R268) and two hydrophobic residues (I269, L273) were replaced by negatively charged glutamates (R268E/I269E/L273E), hereafter termed NEECK (Figure 2F). NEECK was used to validate the closed conformation observed in the crystal structure of WT α-actinin and to probe in cellula the biological relevance of the opening/closing mechanism. We explored whether the molecular architecture observed in the crystal structure of α-actinin-2 is maintained in solution and how this is altered in NEECK as a model of the open state. We used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to obtain structural information on WT and NEECK α-actinin. All possible pairwise distances between labeled cysteines were computed (Figure 3A) and compared to those obtained by Q band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments, showing a bimodal distribution peaking at 30 Å and below 20 Å (Figure 3B; Table S3). The experimental and computed distributions fit well in the distance range up to 35 Å (Figure 3B), confirming that the structures of α-actinin-2 in the crystal and solution are comparable. We focused on the distance range below and around 20 Å, because the distance between C270 in the neck and C862 in EF3-4 is 12 ± 0.2 Å (Figure 3A). This spin label pair could sense open and closed conformations of α-actinin-2. Other spin label sites within a 20 Å distance are buried or located on the rigid rod domain (Table S3). An open conformation of NEECK was inferred from a decreased fraction of short distances between C270 and C862 in the DEER distribution compared with WT (Figure 3C). This change in distances was validated with low-temperature continuous-wave (cw) EPR (Figures S3A and S3B). The analysis of the crystal structure using MD/docking suggests that the PIP2 binding site on ABD maps at a suitable position and distance from the CAMD-neck interaction to sense the hydrophobic tail of PIP2 (Figures 2A and 2G; Figures S2C–S2F). Can PIP2 alone induce opening of α-actinin-2? DEER measurements were carried out on WT α-actinin-2 using the more hydrophilic PIP2 analog Bodipy-TMR-PIP2-C16 (PIP2-C16∗; Figure 3C; Figures S2 and S3). No significant changes were detectable in the short distance range (Figure 3C; Figure S3). We tested whether titin Zr-7 could act on the conformational equilibrium of α-actinin-2. We addressed this question structurally by EPR spectroscopy and quantitatively by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Addition of Zr-7 plus PIP2-C16∗ to α-actinin-2 significantly reduced the short distance peaks in the DEER distance distribution, indicating conversion to an open conformation. A similar effect was observed after addition of 15-fold molar excess of Zr-7 to α-actinin alone in the absence of PIP2-C16∗ (Figure 3C; Figures S3C and S3D). This decrease was validated by cw EPR at low temperature (Figure S3E). The effect of PIP2-C16∗ on α-actinin affinity to Zr-7 was quantified by MST (Figures 3D–3F; Table S4). PIP2-C16∗ bound to WT α-actinin with Kd 2.96 ± 0.26 μM (Figure 3D). The results showed a significantly higher affinity of titin Zr-7 for the PIP2-C16∗-α-actinin complex (Figure 3F; Kd 0.38 ± 0.06 μM) compared to α-actinin alone (Kd 2.90 ± 0.12 μM). The nanomolar Zr-7 binding affinity for the PIP2-C16∗-α-actinin complex is comparable to that observed for the isolated CAMD (EF1–4) and Zr-7 (Figure 3E; Kd 0.24 ± 0.04 μM), whereas NEECK shows an intermediate affinity (Figure 3E; Kd 0.92 ± 0.02 μM) in the absence of PIP2-C16∗. The results for CAMD agree with earlier binding studies (Table S4). MST thus confirms that PIP2-C16∗ increases Zr-7 affinity for α-actinin-2 ∼10-fold, whereas the PIP2 mutant—having lower PIP2-C16∗ affinity (Figure 3D)—showed an insignificant increase of Zr-7 binding by PIP2-C16∗ (Figure 3F; Table S4). We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), multiangle static laser light scattering (MALLS), and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on WT and NEECK α-actinin to understand the structural differences between closed and open conformations. The derived molecular parameters are given in Figures 4A and 4B and Table S5. SEC-MALLS shows that both α-actinin samples display the same molecular mass but that NEECK has an increased Stokes radius. In order to model the NEECK variant, we first addressed the structural consequences for the α-helical neck upon release of EF3-4 by performing NMR of the WT free neck peptide (amino acids A259–Y286). Analysis of 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) showed no evidence of stable secondary structure (Figure S4). NEECK was thus modeled with a flexible neck region (Figure 4C), whereas the neck for WT was modeled as a rigid-body α helix, as in the X-ray structure (Figure 4D). The best WT model fits with the crystal structure (χ = 1.25). In NEECK, the ABDs deviate from the linear alignment with the rod and EF3-4 are in open conformation (Figure 4C), giving a fit of χ = 1.14. This agrees with increased mobility of NEECK and unfolding of the neck. In addition, we found a change in spin label mobility between WT and NEECK α-actinin using cw EPR room temperature measurements"

Moreover, perpetuated transport dysfunction, as we found in a model of progressive MS, led to reduced distal organelle supply and could thus contribute to axonal dystrophy in advanced stages of the disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the CNS and a frequent cause of neurological disability. In MS, chronic disability is due to progressive axon degeneration (Trapp and Nave, 2008Trapp B.D. Nave K.A. Multiple sclerosis: an immune or neurodegenerative disorder?.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). During the initial phase of the disease, axon degeneration predominantly occurs in focal white matter lesions, while in later stages of the disease, a more widespread pattern of axonal pathology emerges (Lassmann et al., 2012Lassmann H. van Horssen J. Mahad D. Progressive multiple sclerosis: pathology and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Neurol. 2012; 8: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Such diffuse axon degeneration is reminiscent of the continuous decline observed in classical neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms that cause progressive axon loss in MS remain poorly understood. Axonal transport, which shuttles critical cell body-derived cargos back and forth between soma, axon, and synapses (Coleman, 2005Coleman M. Axon degeneration mechanisms: commonality amid diversity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, Millecamps and Julien, 2013Millecamps S. Julien J.P. Axonal transport deficits and neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), appears to be a vulnerable target in neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, impairments of axonal transport have been associated with axon degeneration in neurological disease. First, transport disturbances have been described in several neurodegenerative conditions and appear to precede the initiation of overt neurodegeneration (Millecamps and Julien, 2013Millecamps S. Julien J.P. Axonal transport deficits and neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Second, mutations that cause neuronal and axonal degeneration in mice and humans often affect axonal transport (Baloh et al., 2007Baloh R.H. Schmidt R.E. Pestronk A. Milbrandt J. Altered axonal mitochondrial transport in the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease from mitofusin 2 mutations.J.

Genet. 2008; 17: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and, in converse, mutations that affect transport can cause axon degeneration (Hurd and Saxton, 1996Hurd D.D. Saxton W.M.

Finally, therapeutic strategies that restore transport tracks and reverse transport deficits have been shown to slow the progression of axon degeneration, for example, in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or hereditary spastic paraplegia (d’Ydewalle et al., 2011d’Ydewalle C. Krishnan J. Chiheb D.M. Van Damme P. Irobi J. Kozikowski A.P. Vanden Berghe P. Timmerman V. Robberecht W. Van Den Bosch L.

While transport disturbances have thus been linked to classical neurodegenerative diseases, it is currently unclear whether and when similar transport deficits occur in neuroinflammatory lesions, how such deficits relate to structural axon damage, and which inflammatory mediators can impede transport. Here we use in vivo two-photon imaging to directly measure organelle transport and microtubule dynamics in acute and chronic mouse models of MS. Remarkably, we found that in neuroinflammatory lesions axonal transport was not only reduced in morphologically altered axons, but also in the majority of normal-appearing axons. Further analysis showed that transport impairments are already present before demyelination or major abnormalities of microtubule tracks became apparent. This indicates that transport deficits represent an early and pervasive stage of axonal dysfunction. Transport deficits recovered within days in an acute MS model but failed to resolve in a chronic model, resulting in a lasting impairment of distal organelle supply. Redox scavenging, as well as acute anti-inflammatory interventions, quickly restored transport levels, demonstrating that transport deficits can be therapeutically ameliorated. To investigate how organelle transport is affected by neuroinflammation, we used an acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS, in which inflammatory lesions with axon damage evolve in the spinal cord of mice (Figures 1A and 1B ). We then established a spinal in vivo two-photon imaging approach (Davalos et al., 2008Davalos D. Lee J.K. Smith W.B. Brinkman B. Ellisman M.H. Zheng B. Akassoglou K. Stable in vivo imaging of densely populated glia, axons and blood vessels in the mouse spinal cord using two-photon microscopy.J. Neurosci.

Kerschensteiner M. A reversible form of axon damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) that allowed us to follow the dynamics of individual fluorescently labeled organelle cargos, such as mitochondria (in Thy1-MitoCFP mice; Misgeld et al., 2007Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. Bareyre F.M. Burgess R.W. Lichtman J.W. Imaging axonal transport of mitochondria in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) or peroxisomes (in newly generated Thy1-PeroxiYFP mice), in individual spinal axons in the healthy and inflamed spinal cord (Figures 1C and 1D and Movies S1 and S2 available online). Neuroinflammatory lesions were identified in vivo by application of a nuclear dye that reveals cellular infiltration (Romanelli et al., 2013Romanelli E. Sorbara C.D. Nikić I. Dagkalis A. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. Cellular, subcellular and functional in vivo labeling of the spinal cord using vital dyes.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or based on the local presence of damaged axons (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Our in vivo recordings showed that anterograde and retrograde transport of mitochondria and peroxisomes were markedly reduced in spinal axons that pass through these lesions (Figures 1E and 1F and Movie S1). Strikingly, transport was not only reduced in axons that were swollen and hence had entered the degeneration process (Nikić et al., 2011Nikić I. Merkler D. Sorbara C. Brinkoetter M. Kreutzfeldt M. Bareyre F.M. Brück W. Bishop D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. A reversible form of axon damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), but also in the majority of normal-appearing axons in the lesion area. In contrast, dorsal root axons imaged proximal to the lesion area displayed normal anterograde transport and even increased retrograde transport rates (Figure S1). In inflammatory lesions, such localized transport deficits were not only observed acutely but persisted for several weeks in a chronic EAE model (Figure S2A). These transport deficits resulted in a long-lasting reduction of net organelle delivery from the soma toward the synapses, as anterograde transport rates were more profoundly affected than retrograde ones. In the case of mitochondria, for example, parts of axons that are distal to inflamed sites lacked the supply of several hundred mitochondria per day (Figure S2B). Indeed, anterograde tracing of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons that pass through the inflamed spinal cord revealed that local axon collaterals within the lumbar gray matter, as well as the distal axon compartments in ascending tracts of the dorsal thoracic spinal cord, became depleted of mitochondria in a chronic (but not in an acute) EAE model (Figure S3). To better understand why organelle transport is impaired, we tracked the movements of individual mitochondria through acute neuroinflammatory lesions in normal-appearing axons. Our results show that while parameters such as moving speed and stop frequency were only moderately altered, the duration of mitochondrial stops was dramatically increased for both anterogradely and retrogradely moving mitochondria in neuroinflammatory lesions. Furthermore, persistent arrests of organelles were almost exclusively observed in the inflamed spinal cord (Figure 2). Such persistent stops likely explain the increased density of organelles (mitochondrial density: 0.15 ± 0.003 mitochondria/μm2 in control axons compared to 0.25 ± 0.008 mitochondria/μm2 and 0.35 ± 0.02 mitochondria/μm2 in normal-appearing and swollen axons within acute neuroinflammatory lesions, respectively), as well as the raised mitochondrial content (relative to control axons: 111% ± 5% of mitochondrial content in stage 0 axons, 128% ± 9% in stage 1 axons), that we observed in neuroinflammatory lesions in situ (n = 3–4 Thy1-YFP-16 × Thy1-MitoCFP-S mice and 10–35 axons per group). Indeed, such organelle accumulations have also been previously documented in MS tissue (Vergo et al., 2011Vergo S. Craner M.J. Etzensperger R. Attfield K. Friese M.A. Newcombe J. Esiri M. Fugger L. Acid-sensing ion channel 1 is involved in both axonal injury and demyelination in multiple sclerosis and its animal model.Brain. 2011; 134: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Witte et al., 2009Witte M.E.

Pathol. 2009; 219: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We next asked whether focal structural alterations could explain why organelles accumulate in neuroinflammatory lesions. Demyelination or dysmyelination, for instance, have been previously shown to associate with increased organelle density in axons (Edgar et al., 2004Edgar J.M. McLaughlin M. Yool D. Zhang S.C. Fowler J.H. Montague P. Barrie J.A. McCulloch M.C. Duncan I.D. Garbern J. et al.Oligodendroglial modulation of fast axonal transport in a mouse model of hereditary spastic paraplegia.J.

Mitochondrial immobilization mediated by syntaphilin facilitates survival of demyelinated axons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9953-9958Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To address the role of demyelination in vivo, we labeled myelin in the intact spinal cord using a vital dye (Romanelli et al., 2013Romanelli E. Sorbara C.D. Nikić I. Dagkalis A. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. Cellular, subcellular and functional in vivo labeling of the spinal cord using vital dyes.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and measured organelle transport in acute neuroinflammatory lesions. Interestingly, transport deficits were already present in myelinated axons (Figures S4A and S4B) and were thus not secondary to demyelination. Another possibility would be that damage to mitochondria themselves, as described in neuroinflammatory lesions (Nikić et al., 2011Nikić I. Merkler D. Sorbara C. Brinkoetter M. Kreutzfeldt M. Bareyre F.M. Brück W. Bishop D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. A reversible form of axon damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.Nat.

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis.Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), might lead to transport disruption. However, when we measured mitochondrial transport rates in intact-appearing axons with either normally shaped or morphologically altered mitochondria, we found that transport deficits preceded structural changes to organelles (Figures S4C and S4D). Finally, we asked whether alterations of the microtubule tracks, along which organelles travel, interfere with transport. To assess the state of microtubules in individual axons at different stages of neuroinflammatory damage, we analyzed the orientation of microtubule tracks by electron microscopy (Figures 3A–3C). In addition, we evaluated the presence of posttranslational modifications of tubulin, such as acetylation and tyrosination, which respectively indicate the stabilization or destabilization of microtubules (Janke, 2014Janke C. The tubulin code: molecular components, readout mechanisms, and functions.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 206: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), by quantitative immunohistochemistry (Figure S5). Finally, we directly assayed the density and orientation of dynamic microtubules by in vivo two-photon imaging of Thy1-EB3-YFP mice (Kleele et al., 2014Kleele T. Marinković P. Williams P.R. Stern S. Weigand E.E. Engerer P. Naumann R. Hartmann J. Karl R.M. Bradke F. et al.An assay to image neuronal microtubule dynamics in mice.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which express a fluorescently tagged version of the plus-end binding protein EB3 in neurons (Figures 3D–3F and Movie S3). Together, these analyses showed that transport deficits occurred in axons before marked alterations of the microtubule cytoskeleton. While there is a subset of normal appearing EAE axons, which show increased microtubule tyrosination, acetylation levels in EAE and control axons are similar, with even a slight increase seen in normal-appearing axons in EAE lesions compared to controls. Furthermore, the orientation of microtubules in electron micrographs, as well as the density and orientation of dynamic microtubule comets, are comparable between control and normal-appearing axons in EAE. In contrast, we found disorganized, tyrosinated, and highly dynamic microtubules in a subset of swollen axons in neuroinflammatory lesions (Figures 3C–3E, Figure S5, and Movie S3). Such a destabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is reminiscent of microtubule changes induced after traumatic axon injury (Erez et al., 2007Erez H. Malkinson G. Prager-Khoutorsky M. De Zeeuw C.I. Hoogenraad C.C. Spira M.E. Formation of microtubule-based traps controls the sorting and concentration of vesicles to restricted sites of regenerating neurons after axotomy.J.

Bradke F. et al.An assay to image neuronal microtubule dynamics in mice.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), might mark the transition to more permanent structural axon damage and predispose affected axons to subsequent degeneration. Our results show that transport deficits can be initiated in morphologically normal axons with intact myelin, normal-appearing cargos, and unaltered microtubule tracks. Hence, transport deficits appear to represent an early state of inflammation-induced axonal “dysfunction” rather than a later sequel of structural alterations. This suggests that transport deficits could reverse once the underlying inflammatory driving force subsides. Indeed, transport deficits started to recover within a few days after the peak of EAE in the acute model. This recovery could be accelerated by treating mice at the peak of their symptoms with a single dose of corticosteroids, an intervention that is commonly used to curb disease exacerbation in MS patients (Sellebjerg et al., 2005Sellebjerg F. Barnes D. Filippini G. Midgard R. Montalban X. Rieckmann P. Selmaj K. Visser L.H. Sørensen P.S. EFNS Task Force on Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis RelapsesEFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses.Eur. J. Neurol. 2005; 12: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Figure 4A). Next, we asked which inflammatory mediators could cause such reversible axonal dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) were previously shown to induce transport deficits in vitro (Stagi et al., 2005Stagi M. Dittrich P.S. Frank N. Iliev A.I. Schwille P. Neumann H. Breakdown of axonal synaptic vesicle precursor transport by microglial nitric oxide.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and to initiate structural axon damage in vivo (Nikić et al., 2011Nikić I. Merkler D. Sorbara C. Brinkoetter M. Kreutzfeldt M. Bareyre F.M. Brück W. Bishop D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. A reversible form of axon damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To follow the evolution of transport deficits over time after application of such reactive species, we repetitively measured axonal transport in individual spinal axons of healthy Thy1-MitoCFP mice for several hours. When we applied the NO donor, Spermine NONOate, at a dose that did not induce axonal degeneration, to the exposed spinal cord, organelle transport came to a complete halt within 90 min but could be restarted by application of the NO scavenger cPTIO (Figure 4B and Movie S4). To determine whether reactive species also contribute to the induction of transport deficits in neuroinflammatory lesions, we treated EAE mice with ROS/RNS scavengers. Indeed, therapeutic neutralization of reactive species not only limits structural axon damage, as we have previously shown (Nikić et al., 2011Nikić I. Merkler D. Sorbara C. Brinkoetter M. Kreutzfeldt M. Bareyre F.M. Brück W. Bishop D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. A reversible form of axon damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), but also ameliorated axonal transport deficits (Figure 4C). By assaying the movement of individual axonal organelles in the spinal cord of living mice, we reveal widespread axonal transport deficits in neuroinflammatory lesions. Transport deficits affected diverse organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes and both anterograde and retrograde transport. A number of surprising findings emerged from of our study. First, transport deficits were already observed in normal-appearing and myelinated axons, indicating that demyelination is not required for initiation of inflammation-associated transport deficits. At the same time, in line with previous studies (Kiryu-Seo et al., 2010Kiryu-Seo S. Ohno N. Kidd G.J. Komuro H. Trapp B.D. Demyelination increases axonal stationary mitochondrial size and the speed of axonal mitochondrial transport.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 6658-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Ohno et al., 2014Ohno N. Chiang H. Mahad D.J. Kidd G.J. Liu L. Ransohoff R.M. Sheng Z.H. Komuro H. Trapp B.D. Mitochondrial immobilization mediated by syntaphilin facilitates survival of demyelinated axons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9953-9958Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we find that demyelination modulates important aspects of axonal transport including the moving speed of anterograde organelle movement (0.31 ± 0.03 μm/s in normal appearing myelinated axons versus 0.49 ± 0.03 μm/s in all normal appearing axons in EAE, n = 17–81 mitochondria from 4–18 Thy1-YFP-16 × Thy1-MitoCFP-P mice per group), as well as the density of stationary mitochondria (93% ± 6% of control in normal appearing myelinated axons versus 149% ± 5% of control in all normal appearing axons in EAE, n = 30–128 axons from 4–18 Thy1-YFP-16 × Thy1-MitoCFP-P mice per group). It is thus likely that in neuroinflammatory lesions the final transport pattern reflects both the influences of inflammation and demyelination, the relative importance of which might shift as the disease advances. Second, transport deficits occurred before marked alterations of the ultrastructure or acetylation of microtubule tracks could be observed. Imaging of fluorescently labeled microtubule end-binding proteins further showed that the stability of microtubules was likewise unaltered in the initial stage of axonal dysfunction when transport deficits start to manifest. Third, transport deficits were strikingly reversible, both spontaneously and after intervention, suggesting that altered transport might be a suitable therapeutic target. Indeed, both a standard anti-inflammatory treatment, as well as a redox-scavenging protocol, efficiently reversed the transport deficit. So how does inflammation cause reversible transport deficits? While multiple factors are likely to contribute, a number of observations point to alterations of motor engagement at the microtubules. First, we did not find any structural changes of axons, cargos, or tracks that correlated with transport deficits, making it unlikely that overt structural damage disrupts transport. Second, both mitochondria and peroxisomes, as well as anterograde and retrograde transport, are affected, making a primary interruption of organelle-specific linkers, such as Miro or Trak (Schwarz, 2013Schwarz T.L. Mitochondrial trafficking in neurons.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: 5Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar), or of specific motors, such as kinesins or dynein, unlikely. Finally, tracking of single organelles revealed that stop duration is dramatically increased in the inflamed spinal cord, suggesting a temporary disengagement of cargos from tracks. This notion is further supported by the increased density and content of mitochondria observed in EAE axons that suggest that moving mitochondria accumulate in the lesion area. Indeed, arrest of moving mitochondria (which are comparatively smaller than resting ones; Misgeld et al., 2007Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. Bareyre F.M. Burgess R.W. Lichtman J.W. Imaging axonal transport of mitochondria in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar and data not shown) might explain the drop in the average mitochondrial volume observed in early stages of axon damage, but which later normalizes as axon damage progresses, perhaps due to mitochondrial fusion or local growth (relative mitochondrial volume: 63% ± 1% in normal appearing axons and 97% ± 4% in swollen axons in EAE, n = 397–1,361 mitochondria from 3–4 Thy1-YFP-16 × Thy1-MitoCFP-S mice per group). The organelle accumulations we found could thus be caused by local molecular alterations of microtubules that affect binding of different motor-cargo complexes. Indeed, the reduced severity and faster recovery of retrograde transport deficits we observed could be explained by the fact that dynein motors can circumvent such obstacles more efficiently than kinesins (Dixit et al., 2008Dixit R. Ross J.L. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L. Differential regulation of dynein and kinesin motor proteins by tau.Science. 2008; 319: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). While we observe a more prominent impairment of the anterograde transport, it should be noted that in other neurological conditions, e.g., in a mouse model of hereditary spastic paraplegia, a selective accumulation of retrograde motor proteins and consequent disturbance of retrograde transport have been described (Edgar et al., 2004Edgar J.M. McLaughlin M. Yool D. Zhang S.C. Fowler J.H. Montague P. Barrie J.A. McCulloch M.C. Duncan I.D. Garbern J. et al.Oligodendroglial modulation of fast axonal transport in a mouse model of hereditary spastic paraplegia.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Obstacles for organelle transport could in principle result from posttranslational modification and destabilization of microtubules, e.g., by tyrosination or deacetylation (Dunn et al., 2008Dunn S. Morrison E.E. Liverpool T.B. Molina-París C. Cross R.A. Alonso M.C. Peckham M. Differential trafficking of Kif5c on tyrosinated and detyrosinated microtubules in live cells.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, Reed et al., 2006Reed N.A. Cai D. Blasius T.L. Jih G.T. Meyhofer E. Gaertig J. Verhey K.J. Microtubule acetylation promotes kinesin-1 binding and transport.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2166-2172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Our results, however, show no evidence for microtubule deacetylation and indicate that microtubule tyrosination as well as changes in microtubule dynamics primarily occur in the late stages of axon damage (Figures 3C–3E and Figure S5). An alternative cause for motor-to-track disruptions is the excessive attachment of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which can competitively inhibit the binding of motors to microtubules (Dixit et al., 2008Dixit R. Ross J.L. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L. Differential regulation of dynein and kinesin motor proteins by tau.Science. 2008; 319: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Notably, MAPs can be targeted by reactive oxygen or nitrogen species either directly (Stroissnigg et al., 2007Stroissnigg H. Trancíková A. Descovich L. Fuhrmann J. Kutschera W. Kostan J. Meixner A. Nothias F. Propst F. S-nitrosylation of microtubule-associated protein 1B mediates nitric-oxide-induced axon retraction.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or through activation of upstream kinases (Dias-Santagata et al., 2007Dias-Santagata D. Fulga T.A. Duttaroy A. Feany M.B. Oxidative stress mediates tau-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The quick reversal of NO donor-induced transport deficits that occurred after application of the NO scavenger cPTIO (Figure 4B) is compatible with the idea that reversible MAP modifications such as oxidation or phosphorylation mediate transport arrest. Taken together, our data thus suggest that re"
https://openalex.org/W2094841924,"Development of neuronal circuits is controlled by evolutionarily conserved axon guidance molecules, including Slits, the repulsive ligands for roundabout (Robo) receptors, and Netrin-1, which mediates attraction through the DCC receptor. We discovered that the Robo3 receptor fundamentally changed its mechanism of action during mammalian evolution. Unlike other Robo receptors, mammalian Robo3 is not a high-affinity receptor for Slits because of specific substitutions in the first immunoglobulin domain. Instead, Netrin-1 selectively triggers phosphorylation of mammalian Robo3 via Src kinases. Robo3 does not bind Netrin-1 directly but interacts with DCC. Netrin-1 fails to attract pontine neurons lacking Robo3, and attraction can be restored in Robo3(-/-) mice by expression of mammalian, but not nonmammalian, Robo3. We propose that Robo3 evolution was key to sculpting the mammalian brain by converting a receptor for Slit repulsion into one that both silences Slit repulsion and potentiates Netrin attraction."

However, these drugs have serious side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and diabetes. Identifying a specific D2R signaling pathway that could be targeted for antipsychotic effects, without inducing EPS, would be a significant improvement in the treatment of schizophrenia. We report here that the D2R forms a protein complex with Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) that facilitates D2R-mediated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 signaling and inhibits agonist-induced D2R internalization. D2R-DISC1 complex levels are increased in conjunction with decreased GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9) phosphorylation in both postmortem brain tissue from schizophrenia patients and in Disc1-L100P mutant mice, an animal model with behavioral abnormalities related to schizophrenia.

Transport depends on a V-ATPase-dependent electrochemical proton gradient (ΔμH+) and requires chloride ions, but how chloride acts and how ionic and charge balance is maintained during transport is controversial. Using a reconstitution approach, we used an exogenous proton pump to drive VGLUT-mediated transport either in liposomes containing purified VGLUT1 or in synaptic vesicles fused with proton-pump-containing liposomes. Our data show that chloride stimulation can be induced at both sides of the membrane. Moreover, chloride competes with glutamate at high concentrations. In addition, VGLUT1 possesses a cation binding site capable of binding H+ or K+ ions, allowing for proton antiport or K+ / H+ exchange. We conclude that VGLUTs contain two anion binding sites and one cation binding site, allowing the transporter to adjust to the changing ionic conditions during vesicle filling without being dependent on other transporters or channels."

Significance: A novel PII-like protein is involved in c-di-AMP signaling. All living cells have to monitor their environment to sense any relevant changes, to transduce this information, and to respond by appropriate adaptation. Inability to survey the environment would inevitably result in loss of fitness, and other cells or species would rapidly take over. Therefore, interaction with the environment through adaptive responses is one of the hallmarks of life, and it contributes to the ability of organisms to live and survive in highly competitive ecosystems. In bacteria, alterations in gene expression programs are a major factor in response to changing conditions. This is also reflected in the short half-lives of bacterial mRNAs that persist only in the minute range. In addition to adaptation at the level of gene regulation, pre-existing enzymes and proteins may receive signals to alter their activity. Both types of response often involve common principles of signal transduction such as the formation of second messengers or the use of dedicated signal transduction proteins. We are interested in signaling pathways triggered by second messengers. Typically, specific nucleotides that are not incorporated into nucleic acids serve as second messengers, which are formed in response to extra- or intracellular signals. The paradigmatic prototype of this class of molecules, cyclic AMP (cAMP), is found in both pro- and eukaryotic cells. In Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, its presence is a signal for the lack of preferred carbon sources. The molecule binds to its receptor protein Crp, and this complex activates the expression of genes for the utilization of secondary carbon sources. In addition, cAMP is involved in a variety of functions including the control of virulence in many pathogenic bacteria (1Görke B. Stülke J. Carbon catabolite repression in bacteria: many ways to make the most out of nutrients.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 2McDonough K.A. Rodriguez A. The myriad roles of cyclic AMP in microbial pathogens: from signal to sword.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 27-38Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In nearly all bacteria, the stringent response factor (p)ppGpp serves to switch off cellular household activities in response to nutrient limitation (3Boutte C.C. Crosson S. Bacterial lifestyle shapes stringent response activation.Trends Microbiol. 2013; 21: 174-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the past few years, cyclic dinucleotides have attracted much attention. Cyclic di-GMP is widespread in bacteria, and this second messenger is implicated in switching between two mutually exclusive lifestyles: motility and biofilm formation (4Hengge R. Principles of c-di-GMP signalling in bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Cyclic di-AMP, which was discovered in 2008 (5Witte G. Hartung S.

Finally, the sporulation-specific diadenylate cyclase CdaS is required for efficient spore germination (22Mehne F.M. Schröder-Tittmann K. Eijlander R.T. Herzberg C. Hewitt L. Kaever V. Lewis R.J. Kuipers O.P. Tittmann K. Stülke J. Control of the diadenylate cyclase CdaS in Bacillus subtilis: an autoinhibitory domain limits cyclic di-AMP production.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 21098-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The various cellular functions of c-di-AMP as well as the essentiality of this second messenger ignited a strong interest in the identification of binding partners of the nucleotide. The first identified target was the DarR transcription factor from Mycobacterium smegmatis (17Zhang L. He Z.G. Radiation-sensitive gene A (RadA) targets DisA, DNA integrity scanning protein A, to negatively affect cyclic di-AMP synthesis activity in Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22426-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In S. aureus, the potassium transporter KtrA, the putative transporter CpaA, the KdpD histidine kinase, and the PII-like protein PstA were identified (20Corrigan R.M. Campeotto I. Jeganathan T. Roelofs K.G. Lee V.T. Gründling A. Systematic identification of conserved bacterial c-di-AMP receptor proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9084-9089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For KtrA, inhibition of potassium uptake upon binding of c-di-AMP was reported (20Corrigan R.M. Campeotto I. Jeganathan T. Roelofs K.G. Lee V.T. Gründling A. Systematic identification of conserved bacterial c-di-AMP receptor proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9084-9089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This observation was recently confirmed for the corresponding protein CabP from Streptococcus pneumoniae (23Bai Y. Yang J. Zarrella T.M. Zhang Y. Metzger D.W. Bai G. Cyclic di-AMP impairs potassium uptake mediated by a cyclic di-AMP binding protein in Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Further studies aimed at the identification of the controlling metabolite of the B. subtilis ydaO riboswitch identified the binding of c-di-AMP to this RNA structure (24Nelson J.W. Sudarsan N. Furukawa K. Weinberg Z. Wang J.X. Breaker R.R. Riboswitches in eubacteria sense the second messenger c-di-AMP.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Jones C.P. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Crystal structure of a c-di-AMP riboswitch reveals an internally pseudo-dimeric RNA.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2692-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the ydaO riboswitch controls two transcription units in B. subtilis: the ydaO gene and the ktrAB operon that encodes the c-di-AMP-responsive potassium transporter (26Block K.F. Hammond M.C. Breaker R.R. Evidence for widespread gene control function by the ydaO riboswitch candidate.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3983-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, c-di-AMP is the only second messenger that cannot only bind to two different classes of receptors, proteins and RNA, but that also controls one biological process by binding to a protein and by controlling its expression via RNA binding! Very recently, a proteome-wide study with L. monocytogenes confirmed c-di-AMP binding of PstA and led to the identification of the pyruvate carboxylase, an enzyme that replenishes the citric acid cycle as a direct target of c-di-AMP-mediated inhibition (21Sureka K. Choi P.H. Precit M. Delince M. Pensinger D.A. Huynh T.N. Jurado A.R. Goo Y.A. Sadilek M. Iavarone A.T. Sauer J.D. Tong L. Woodward J.J. The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-AMP is an allosteric regulator of metabolic enzyme function.Cell. 2014; 158: 1389-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this work, we aimed to identify c-di-AMP targets in the Gram-positive model organism B. subtilis. Our results suggest that the PII-like signal transduction protein DarA is a major target of c-di-AMP in this bacterium. This finding suggests the integration of two signal transduction principles, second messengers and small signal transduction proteins, in a common mechanism. The determination of the structure of DarA in complex with c-di-AMP defines specificity determinants for the interaction with c-di-AMP and reveals conformational changes upon c-di-AMP binding. All B. subtilis strains are derivatives of the wild type strain 168. E. coli DH5α (27Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) was used for cloning experiments and for the expression of recombinant protein. B. subtilis was grown in sporulation medium (28Commichau F.M. Herzberg C. Tripal P. Valerius O. Stülke J. A regulatory protein-protein interaction governs glutamate biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: the glutamate dehydrogenase RocG moonlights in controlling the transcription factor GltC.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in CSE defined minimal medium (28Commichau F.M. Herzberg C. Tripal P. Valerius O. Stülke J. A regulatory protein-protein interaction governs glutamate biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: the glutamate dehydrogenase RocG moonlights in controlling the transcription factor GltC.Mol.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). E. coli was grown in LB medium, and transformants were selected on plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). LB and sporulation plates were prepared by the addition of 17 g of Bacto agar/liter (Difco) to LB or sporulation medium, respectively. Transformation of E. coli and plasmid DNA extraction were performed using standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and DNA polymerases were used as recommended by the manufacturers. DNA sequences were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method (27Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis was isolated as described (28Commichau F.M. Herzberg C. Tripal P. Valerius O. Stülke J.

Microbiol. 2007; 65: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To isolate c-di-AMP-binding proteins from B. subtilis, biotinylated c-di-AMP (2′-[biotin]-AHC-c-di-AMP; BIOLOG, Bremen, Germany) was coupled to Strep-Tactin-covered MagStrep “type 2HC” beads (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). Briefly, B. subtilis crude cell extracts were incubated in an assay mixture (1.2 mg of protein extract, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 4 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) in a total of 1 ml of binding buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 230 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)). To prepare the matrix, 40 μl of Strep-Tactin-covered beads were equilibrated twice with 800 μl of binding buffer containing glycerol (10%), bovine serum albumin (50 μg/ml), and EDTA (4 mm). After equilibration, 40 μl of biotinylated c-di-AMP was added, and the tubes were incubated with weak shaking for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes of the beads (800 μl of binding buffer containing glycerol (10%), bovine serum albumin (50 μg/ml), and EDTA (4 mm) to discard free c-di-AMP), the prepared protein extracts (1.2 mg) were added to the charged beads and incubated for 30 min with slight shaking at room temperature. After incubation, the samples were washed four times to eliminate all proteins that might have bound nonspecifically to c-di-AMP. The washing buffer contained Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (100 mm), NaCl (150 mm), and EDTA (1 mm). Proteins bound to c-di-AMP were eluted by incubation with 50 μl of biotin buffer (28Commichau F.M. Herzberg C. Tripal P. Valerius O. Stülke J.

Microbiol. 2007; 65: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that contained 5 mm biotin. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent silver staining. To confirm the specificity of binding, the experiment was repeated using 8′-[biotin]-AET-c-di-AMP (BIOLOG). Proteins of interest were identified by mass spectrometry as described previously (29Meyer F.M. Gerwig J. Hammer E. Herzberg C. Commichau F.M. Völker U. Stülke J. Physical interactions between tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in Bacillus subtilis: evidence for a metabolon.Metab. Eng. 2011; 13: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, after destaining gel pieces, proteins underwent in-gel digestion with trypsin (10 ng/μl trypsin in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate). Resulting peptides were extracted from gel pieces separated by a non-linear water-acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% acetic acid on a nanoAcquity UPLC reverse phase column (BEH130, C18, 100 μm × 100 mm; Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with a nano-UPLC system (Waters) coupled on line with an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) operated in data-dependent MS/MS mode. Proteins were identified by searching all MS/MS spectra in.dta format against a B. subtilis protein database (4254 entries; extracted from SubtiList using SEQUEST version 2.7 revision 11 (Sorcerer build 4.04, Sage-N Research Inc., Milpitas, CA). Initial mass tolerances for peptide identification on MS and MS/MS peaks were 10 ppm and 1 Da, respectively. Up to two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed. Methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) and propionamide modification on cysteine (+71.037109 Da) were set as variable modifications. Protein identification results were evaluated by determination of probability for peptide and protein assignments provided by PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet (Institute of Systems Biology, Seattle, WA) incorporated in the Scaffold software package release 4.3.2 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR). Proteins were identified by at least two peptides with a peptide probability >90%, reflecting a protein probability of >99%. Annotation information was derived from the SubtiWiki web server (30Michna R.H. Commichau F.M. Tödter D. Zschiedrich C.P. Stülke J. SubtiWiki—a database for the model organism Bacillus subtilis that links pathway, interaction and expression information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D692-D698Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To fuse the DarA protein (previously referred to as YaaQ; see SubtiWiki: DarA (30Michna R.H. Commichau F.M. Tödter D. Zschiedrich C.P. Stülke J.

The PCR product was digested with PstI and BamHI, and the resulting fragment was cloned into the expression vector pWH844 (31Schirmer F. Ehrt S. Hillen W.

Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm) to exponentially growing cultures (A600 of 0.8) of E. coli carrying the relevant plasmid. Cells were lysed by three passes at 18,000 p.s.i. through an HTU DIGI-F press (G. Heinemann, Germany). After lysis, the crude extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min and then passed over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (IBA). The protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient. After elution, the fractions were tested for the desired protein using 15% SDS-PAGE. The relevant fractions were combined and dialyzed overnight. The protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (55Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay and bovine serum albumin as the standard. To investigate, whether His6-tagged DarA and PtsH bind to c-di-AMP, the proteins were expressed in E. coli (see above), and cytoplasmic cell extracts were incubated with 40 μl of biotinylated c-di-AMP (2′-[biotin]-AHC-c-di-AMP; 1 nm). For the negative control, cytoplasmic cell extracts were incubated without biotinylated c-di-AMP. After incubation, the samples were purified according to the standard protocol for purification of Strep-tagged proteins (28Commichau F.M. Herzberg C. Tripal P. Valerius O. Stülke J. A regulatory protein-protein interaction governs glutamate biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: the glutamate dehydrogenase RocG moonlights in controlling the transcription factor GltC.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Deletion of the darA gene was achieved by transformation of B. subtilis 168 with a PCR product constructed using oligonucleotides to amplify DNA fragments flanking the darA gene and an intervening chloramphenicol resistance cassette (cat) as described previously (9Mehne F.M. Gunka K. Eilers H. Herzberg C. Kaever V. Stülke J. Cyclic di-AMP homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis: both lack and high level accumulation of the nucleotide are detrimental for cell growth.J. Biol.

The integrity of the regions flanking the integrated resistance cassette was verified by sequencing PCR products of about 1,000 bp amplified from chromosomal DNA of the resulting mutant strain GP1712 (ΔdarA::cat). Cultures of B. subtilis 168 were grown in CSE minimal medium with glucose as the carbon source, pelleted, and lysed in a Micro Dismembrator S instrument (Sartorius). The resulting cell powder was used to extract the metabolites as described previously (14Diethmaier C. Newman J.A. Kovács A.T. Kaever V. Herzberg C. Rodrigues C. Boonstra M. Kuipers O.P. Lewis R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2089178702,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor mainly caused by mutations in the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene. For therapy of advanced MTC, the Food and Drug Administration recently approved vandetanib and cabozantinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting RET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and/or c-MET. Nevertheless, not all patients respond to these drugs, demanding additional therapeutic strategies. We found that mortalin (HSPA9/GRP75), a member of HSP70 family, is upregulated in human MTC tissues and that its depletion robustly induces cell death and growth arrest in MTC cell lines in culture and in mouse xenografts. These effects were accompanied by substantial downregulation of RET, induction of the tumor-suppressor TP53 and altered expression of cell cycle regulatory machinery and apoptosis markers, including E2F-1, p21CIP1, p27KIP1 and Bcl-2 family proteins. Our investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects revealed that mortalin depletion induces transient MEK/ERK (extracellular signal–regulated kinase) activation and altered mitochondrial bioenergetics in MTC cells, as indicated by depolarized mitochondrial membrane, decreased oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification and increased oxidative stress. Intriguingly, mortalin depletion induced growth arrest partly via the MEK/ERK pathway, whereas it induced cell death by causing mitochondrial dysfunction in a Bcl-2-dependent manner. However, TP53 was not necessary for these effects except for p21CIP1 induction. Moreover, mortalin depletion downregulated RET expression independently of MEK/ERK and TP53. These data demonstrate that mortalin is a key regulator of multiple signaling and metabolic pathways pivotal to MTC cell survival and proliferation, proposing mortalin as a novel therapeutic target for MTC."

https://openalex.org/W2108040424,"Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) is among the most poisonous substances on Earth and a major cause of neonatal death in nonvaccinated areas. TeNT targets the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) with high affinity, yet the nature of the TeNT receptor complex remains unknown. Here, we show that the presence of nidogens (also known as entactins) at the NMJ is the main determinant for TeNT binding. Inhibition of the TeNT-nidogen interaction by using small nidogen-derived peptides or genetic ablation of nidogens prevented the binding of TeNT to neurons and protected mice from TeNT-induced spastic paralysis. Our findings demonstrate the direct involvement of an extracellular matrix protein as a receptor for TeNT at the NMJ, paving the way for the development of therapeutics for the prevention of tetanus by targeting this protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1971043408,"Although members of SOX family have been well documented for their essential roles in embryonic development, cell proliferation and disease, the functional role and molecular mechanism of SOX30 in cancer are largely unexplored. Here, we first identified SRY-box containing gene 30 (SOX30) as a novel preferentially methylated gene using genome-wide methylation screening. SOX30 hypermethylation was detected in 100% of lung cancer cell lines (9/9) and 70.83% (85/120) of primary lung tumor tissues compared with none (0/20) of normal and 8.0% (2/25) of peri-tumoral lung tissues (P<0.01). SOX30 was expressed in normal and peri-tumoral lung tissues in which SOX30 was unmethylated, but was silenced or downregulated in lung cancer cell lines and primary lung tumor tissues harboring a hypermethylated SOX30. De-methylation experiments further confirmed that silence of SOX30 was regulated by its hypermethylation. Ectopic expression of SOX30 induces cancer cell apoptosis with inhibiting proliferation in vitro and represses tumor formation in vivo, whereas knockdown of SOX30 demonstrates a reversed effect both in vitro and in vivo. At the molecular level, the antitumorigenic effect of SOX30 is mediated by directly binding to CACTTTG (+115 to +121) of p53 promoter region and activating p53 transcription, suggesting that SOX30 is a novel transcriptional activating factor of p53. Indeed, blockade of p53 attenuates the tumor inhibition of SOX30. Overall, these findings demonstrate that SOX30 is a novel epigenetic silenced tumor suppressor acting through direct regulation of p53 transcription and expression. This study provides novel insights on the mechanism of tumorigenesis in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2036891087,"DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are highly toxic lesions associated with cancer and degenerative diseases. ICLs can be repaired by the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway and through FA-independent processes involving the FAN1 nuclease. In this work, FAN1-DNA crystal structures and biochemical data reveal that human FAN1 cleaves DNA successively at every third nucleotide. In vitro, this exonuclease mechanism allows FAN1 to excise an ICL from one strand through flanking incisions. DNA access requires a 5′-terminal phosphate anchor at a nick or a 1- or 2-nucleotide flap and is augmented by a 3′ flap, suggesting that FAN1 action is coupled to DNA synthesis or recombination. FAN1’s mechanism of ICL excision is well suited for processing other localized DNA adducts as well."
https://openalex.org/W1971092542,"Interstitial fluid flow in and around the tumor tissue is a physiologically relevant mechanical signal that regulates intracellular signaling pathways throughout the tumor. Yet, the effects of interstitial flow and associated fluid shear stress on the tumor cell function have been largely overlooked. Using in vitro bioengineering models in conjunction with molecular cell biology tools, we found that fluid shear (2 dyn/cm2) markedly upregulates matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) expression and its activity in human chondrosarcoma cells. MMP-12 expression is induced in human chondrocytes during malignant transformation. However, the signaling pathway regulating MMP-12 expression and its potential role in human chondrosarcoma cell invasion and metastasis have yet to be delineated. We discovered that fluid shear stress induces the synthesis of insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) B and D, which in turn transactivate MMP-12 via PI3-K, p38 and JNK signaling pathways. IGF-2-, VEGF-B- or VEGF-D-stimulated chondrosarcoma cells display markedly higher migratory and invasive potentials in vitro, which are blocked by inhibiting MMP-12, PI3-K, p38 or JNK activity. Moreover, recombinant human MMP-12 or MMP-12 overexpression can potentiate chondrosarcoma cell invasion in vitro and the lung colonization in vivo. By reconstructing and delineating the signaling pathway regulating MMP-12 activation, potential therapeutic strategies that interfere with chondrosarcoma cell invasion may be identified."

A total of 415 undergraduates in 1974, 1991, and 2009 recalled as many presidents as possible and attempted to place them in their correct ordinal positions. All showed roughly linear forgetting of the eight or nine presidents prior to the president holding office at the time, and recall of presidents without respect to ordinal position also showed a regular pattern of forgetting. Similar outcomes occurred with 497 adults (ages 18 to 69) tested in 2014. We fit forgetting functions to the data to predict when six relatively recent presidents will recede in memory to the level of most middle presidents (e.g., we predict that Truman will be forgotten to the same extent as McKinley by about 2040). These studies show that forgetting from collective memory can be studied empirically, as with forgetting in other forms of memory."
https://openalex.org/W2044856539,"DNA polymerase eta (Polη) has unique and pivotal functions in several DNA damage-tolerance pathways. Steady-state level of this short-lived protein is tightly controlled by multiple mechanisms including proteolysis. Here, we have identified the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), as a novel regulator of Polη stability. USP7 regulates Polη stability through both indirect and direct mechanisms. Knockout of USP7 increased the steady-state level of Polη and slowed down the turnover of both Polη and p53 proteins through destabilizing their E3 ligase murine double minute 2 (Mdm2). Also, USP7 physically binds Polη in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type USP7 but not its catalytically-defective mutants deubiquitinates Polη and increases its cellular steady-state level. Thus, USP7 directly serves as a specific DUB for Polη. Furthermore, ectopic expression of USP7 promoted the UV-induced proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) monoubiquitination in Polη-proficient but not in Polη-deficient XPV (Xeroderma pigmentosum variant) cells, suggesting that USP7 facilitates UV-induced PCNA monoubiquitination by stabilizing Polη. Taken together, our findings reveal a modulatory role of USP7 in PCNA ubiquitination-mediated stress-tolerance pathways by fine-tuning Polη turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1983516478,"Background Palmitate, a saturated fatty acid (FA), is known to induce toxicity and cell death in various types of cells. Resveratrol (RSV) is able to prevent pathogenesis and/or decelerate the progression of a variety of diseases. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown a protective effect of RSV on fat accumulation induced by FAs. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has recently been linked to cellular adipogenic responses. To address the hypothesis that the RSV effect on excessive fat accumulation promoted by elevated saturated FAs could be partially mediated by a reduction of ER stress, we studied the RSV action on experimentally induced ER stress using palmitate in several cancer cell lines. Principal Findings We show that, unexpectedly, RSV promotes an amplification of palmitate toxicity and cell death and that this mechanism is likely due to a perturbation of palmitate accumulation in the triglyceride form and to a less important membrane fluidity variation. Additionally, RSV decreases radical oxygen species (ROS) generation in palmitate-treated cells but leads to enhanced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) splicing and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression. These molecular effects are induced simultaneously to caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RSV promotes palmitate lipoapoptosis primarily through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the lipotoxicity reversion induced by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist reinforces the hypothesis that RSV-mediated inhibition of palmitate channeling into triglyceride pools could be a key factor in the aggravation of palmitate-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusions Our results suggest that RSV exerts its cytotoxic role in cancer cells exposed to a saturated FA context primarily by triglyceride accumulation inhibition, probably leading to an intracellular palmitate accumulation that triggers a lipid-mediated cell death. Additionally, this cell death is promoted by ER stress through a CHOP-mediated apoptotic process and may represent a potential anticancer strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1981348429,"Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has an essential role in cancer progression, notably in breast cancer. Although its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration is well documented, the molecular basis is not completely established. Here, we report that LRH-1 inhibition affects two- and three-dimensional cell proliferation of different types of breast cancer cells, including estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive and triple-negative cells. This phenotype is accompanied by the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A (aka p21CIP1/WAF1) in a p53-independent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that LRH-1 cooperates with FOXA1 and binds directly to CDKN1A promoter and a distal regulatory region found at −62 kb from its transcriptional start sites, allowing repression of CDKN1A transcription. LRH-1 or FOXA1 depletion induces CDKN1A upregulation by removing histone deacetylase 2 from the promoter and distal regulatory elements and permitting histone acetylation in these regions. Analysis of breast cancer samples reveals that a high LRH-1 level is inversely correlated with CDKN1A expression in breast cancer patients and is associated with poor prognosis. This study reveals a novel mechanism of control of cell proliferation by LRH-1 regulating CDKN1A transcription in breast cancer cells, independent of ERα and p53 status. Targeting LRH-1 may provide an attractive prospect for treatment of tumors that are resistant to hormonal and targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2061615516,"Purpose This study was aimed to determine whether pure molecular-based diffusion coefficient (D) and perfusion-related diffusion parameters (perfusion fraction f, perfusion-related diffusion coefficient D*) differ in healthy livers and fibrotic livers through intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging. Material and Methods 17 healthy volunteers and 34 patients with histopathologically confirmed liver fibrosis patients (stage 1 = 14, stage 2 = 8, stage 3& 4 = 12, METAVIR grading) were included. Liver MR imaging was performed at 1.5-T. IVIM diffusion weighted imaging sequence was based on standard single-shot DW spin echo-planar imaging, with ten b values of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200, 400, 800 sec/mm2 respectively. Pixel-wise realization and regions-of-interest based quantification of IVIM parameters were performed. Results D, f, and D* in healthy volunteer livers and patient livers were 1.096±0.155 vs 0.917±0.152 (10−3 mm2/s, p = 0.0015), 0.164±0.021 vs 0.123±0.029 (p<0.0001), and 13.085±2.943 vs 9.423±1.737 (10−3 mm2/s, p<0.0001) respectively, all significantly lower in fibrotic livers. As the fibrosis severity progressed, D, f, and D* values decreased, with a trend significant for f and D*. Conclusion Fibrotic liver is associated with lower pure molecular diffusion, lower perfusion volume fraction, and lower perfusion-related diffusion. The decrease of f and D* in the liver is significantly associated liver fibrosis severity."

A tungsten atomizer absorption spectrophotometer was employed to determine blood lead levels.The arithmetic mean, geometric mean and median of blood lead levels of 0- to 6-year-old children from Shanghai were 22.49 µg/L, 19.65 µg/L and 19.5 µg/L, including 0.26% (6/2291) with concentrations ≥100 µg/L and 2.7% (61/2291) with concentrations ≥50 µg/L. Boys' levels (23.57 µg/L) were greater than those of girls (21.2 µg/L). The blood lead levels increased with age. This survey showed that the Chongming district was the highest and Yangpu district was the lowest, this result is completely opposite with the earlier survey in Shanghai. Risk factors for lead contamination included housing environment, parents' education levels, social status, hobbies, and children's nutritional status.The blood lead levels of children in Shanghai were lower than the earlier data of Shanghai and those of published studies in China, but higher than the blood lead levels of developed countries. The blood lead levels of urban districts are higher than the central districts with the industrial transformation. Society and the government should take an active interest in childhood lead poisoning of urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W2153098250,"Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) is an alternative to Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) for correction of myopia. In cases where surgeons inadvertently dissect the posterior surface first, identification of the anterior surface and subsequent removal become difficult since the anterior surface of the lenticule is compacted against the anterior stromal surface. This may result in incomplete lenticule removal, and a remnant of intrastromal lenticule in SMILE may lead to visual sequelae. In order to aid surgeons in lenticule removal, we have designed and developed 5 novel SMILE lenticule strippers to locate and extract the lenticules more easily. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy and quality of these lenticule strippers in assisting SMILE. Thirty porcine eyes were used. The ease of extraction and removal of the lenticule with different strippers was graded by an experienced SMILE surgeon, the extracted lenticule circularity was evaluated by calculating the lenticule circularity, and the intactness of the extracted lenticule edge was assessed using scanning electron microscopy. We found these novel strippers can be of great help to improve the safety and quality of SMILE surgery, particularly in those cases of difficult lenticule extraction."

To support this study, a climate baseline was constructed at a spatial resolution of 5 km. Twenty-one bioclimatic indicators were drawn from this baseline data and from yield data for different coffee genotypes evaluated under conditions at eight experimental stations (ESs) belonging to the National Center for Coffee Research (CENICAFÉ). Three topographic indicators were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM). Zoning at a national level resulted in the differentiation of 12 agro-climatic zones. Altitude notably influenced zone differentiation, however other factors such as large air currents, low-pressure atmospheric systems, valleys of the great rivers, and physiography also played an important role. The strategy of zoning according to coffee-growing conditions will enable areas with the greatest potential for the development of coffee cultivation to be identified, criteria for future research to be generated, and the level of technology implementation to be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W1981524366,"Relapse after clinical remission remains a leading cause of cancer-associated death. Although the mechanisms of tumor relapse are complex, the ability of cancer cells to survive physiological stress is a prerequisite for recurrence. Ewing sarcoma (ES) and neuroblastoma (NB) are aggressive cancers that frequently relapse after initial remission. In addition, both tumors overexpress the polycomb group (PcG) proteins BMI-1 and EZH2, which contribute to tumorigenicity. We have discovered that ES and NB resist hypoxic stress-induced death and that survival depends on PcG function. Epigenetic repression of developmental programs is the most well-established cancer-associated function of PcG proteins. However, we noted that voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel genes are also targets of PcG regulation in stem cells. Given the role of potassium in regulating apoptosis, we reasoned that repression of Kv channel genes might have a role in cancer cell survival. Here we describe our novel finding that PcG-dependent repression of the Kv1.5 channel gene KCNA5 contributes to cancer cell survival under conditions of stress. We show that survival of cancer cells in stress is dependent upon suppression of Kv1.5 channel function. The KCNA5 promoter is marked in cancer cells with PcG-dependent chromatin repressive modifications that increase in hypoxia. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BMI-1 and EZH2, respectively, restore KCNA5 expression, which sensitizes cells to stress-induced death. In addition, ectopic expression of the Kv1.5 channel induces apoptotic cell death under conditions of hypoxia. These findings identify a novel role for PcG proteins in promoting cancer cell survival via repression of KCNA5."
https://openalex.org/W2054206087,"In the future, periods of strongly increased temperature in concert with drought (heat waves) will have potentially detrimental effects on trees and forests in Central Europe. Norway spruce might be at risk in the future climate of Central Europe. However, Douglas-fir is often discussed as an alternative for the drought and heat sensitive Norway spruce, because some provenances are considered to be well adapted to drier and warmer conditions. In this study, we identified the physiological and growth responses of seedlings from two different Douglas-fir provenances to increased temperature and atmospheric drought during a period of 92 days. We analysed (i) plant biomass, (ii) carbon stable isotope composition as an indicator for time integrated intrinsic water use efficiency, (iii) apparent respiratory carbon isotope fractionation as well as (iv) the profile of polar low molecular metabolites. Plant biomass was only slightly affected by increased temperatures and atmospheric drought but the more negative apparent respiratory fractionation indicated a temperature-dependent decrease in the commitment of substrate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The metabolite profile revealed that the simulated heat wave induced a switch in stress protecting compounds from proline to polyols. We conclude that metabolic acclimation successfully contributes to maintain functioning and physiological activity in seedlings of both Douglas-fir provenances under conditions that are expected during heat waves (i.e. elevated temperatures and atmospheric drought). Douglas-fir might be a potentially important tree species for forestry in Central Europe under changing climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2091154658,"Aurora-A overexpression is common in various types of cancers and has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis through different signaling pathways, yet how the deregulation affects cancer therapeutics remains elusive. Here we showed that overexpression of Aurora-A rendered esophageal cancer cells resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) by inhibiting apoptosis. By using an apoptosis array, we identified a downstream gene, p21-activated kinase 7 (PAK7). PAK7 was upregulated by Aurora-A overexpression at both mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, the expression levels of Aurora-A and PAK7 were correlated in ESCC primary samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that binding of E2F1 to the promoter of PAK7 was significantly enhanced upon Aurora-A activation, and knockdown of transcription factor E2F1 decreased PAK7 expression, suggesting that Aurora-A regulated PAK7 through E2F1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PAK7 knockdown led to increased apoptosis, and Aurora-A-induced resistance to CDDP was reversed by downregulation of PAK7, suggesting PAK7 was a downstream player of Aurora-A that mediated chemoresistance of ESCC cells to CDDP. Our data suggest that PAK7 may serve as an attractive candidate for therapeutics in ESCC patients with Aurora-A abnormality."

However, the relationship between IQGAP1 and Dvl in tumor tissues is unclear. Materials and Methods We used immunohistochemistry to assess the expressions of IQGAP1 and Dvl in a cohort of 111 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Association of their localization expressions with clinicopathological factors was also analyzed. Results The positive rate of IQGAP1 in primary tumors was 48.6% (54/111) for its cytoplamic expression, 9.0% (10/111) for nuclear expression and 31.5% (35/111) for membranous expression; the positive rate of Dvl was 65.8% (73/111) for cytoplamic expression, 9.9% (11/111) for nuclear expression and 10.8% (12/111) for membranous expression. Coexpression rate of IQGAP1 and Dvl was 77.8% (42/54) in the cytoplasm, 80.0% (8/10) in the nucleus and 8.6% (3/35) in the membrane. Coexpression of IQGAP1 and Dvl in the cytoplasm and nucleus were significantly correlated (P<0.05), but not in the membrane (P>0.05). The positive expression rates of cyclin D1 and c-myc were significantly higher in the group of IQGAP1 and Dvl coexpression in the nucleus than that in the cytoplasm. Coexpression rate of IQGAP1 and Dvl in the cytoplasm and nucleus was significantly higher in lymph nodal metastases (63.3%, 19/30) than in primary growths (38.3%, 31/81), correlating with poor prognosis. Five-year survival time after resection in the group with their coexpression in the cytoplasm and nucleus was significantly lower than that with no coexpression (44.705±3.355 vs 58.403±2.543 months, p<0.05). Conclusions Coexpression of IQGAP1 and Dvl in the cytoplasm and nucleus was correlated with the lymph nodal metastase and poor prognosis of NSCLC, and coexpression in nucleus might play a critical role in the activation of canonical Wnt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2090839611,"Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is a debilitating, often fatal, systemic amyloid disease associated with chronic inflammation and persistently elevated serum amyloid A (SAA). Elevated SAA is necessary but not sufficient to cause disease and the risk factors for AA amyloidosis remain poorly understood. Here we identify an extraordinarily high prevalence of AA amyloidosis (34%) in a genetically isolated population of island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) with concurrent chronic inflammatory diseases. Amyloid deposits were most common in kidney (76%), spleen (58%), oral cavity (45%), and vasculature (44%) and were composed of unbranching, 10 nm in diameter fibrils. Peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry revealed that SAA peptides were dominant in amyloid-laden kidney, together with high levels of apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein A-IV, fibrinogen-α chain, and complement C3 and C4 (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05). Reassembled peptide sequences showed island fox SAA as an 111 amino acid protein, most similar to dog and artic fox, with 5 unique amino acid variants among carnivores. SAA peptides extended to the last two C-terminal amino acids in 5 of 9 samples, indicating that near full length SAA was often present in amyloid aggregates. These studies define a remarkably prevalent AA amyloidosis in island foxes with widespread systemic amyloid deposition, a unique SAA sequence, and the co-occurrence of AA with apolipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2030579524,"Oncogenic c-Kit mutations have been shown to display ligand-independent receptor activation and cell proliferation. A substitution of aspartate to valine at amino acid 816 (D816V) is one of the most commonly found oncogenic c-Kit mutations and is found in >90% of cases of mastocytosis and less commonly in germ-cell tumors, core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia and mucosal melanomas. The mechanisms by which this mutation leads to constitutive activation and transformation are not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that the D816V mutation causes a structural change in the activation loop (A-loop), resulting in weaker binding of the A-loop to the juxtamembrane domain. In this paper, we have investigated the role of Y823, the only tyrosine residue in the A-loop, and its role in oncogenic transformation by c-Kit/D816V by introducing the Y823F mutation. Although dispensable for the kinase activity of c-Kit/D816V, the presence of Y823 was crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, mutation of Y823 selectively downregulates the Ras/Erk and Akt pathways as well as the phosphorylation of STAT5 and reduces the transforming capacity of the D816V/c-Kit in vitro. We further show that mice injected with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V/Y823F display significantly reduced tumor size as well as tumor weight compared with controls. Finally, microarray analysis, comparing Y823F/D816V cells with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V, demonstrate that mutation of Y823 causes upregulation of proapoptotic genes, whereas genes of survival pathways are downregulated. Thus, phosphorylation of Y823 is not necessary for kinase activation, but essential for the transforming ability of the c-Kit/D816V mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2051270419,"Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis or translation can promote cancer, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. UTP18 is a component of the small subunit processome, a nucleolar multi-protein complex whose only known function is to cleave pre-ribosomal RNA to yield the 18S ribosomal RNA component of 40S ribosomal subunits. Here, we show that UTP18 also alters translation to promote stress resistance and growth, and that UTP18 is frequently gained and overexpressed in cancer. We observed that UTP18 localizes to the cytoplasm in a subset of cells, and that serum withdrawal increases cytoplasmic UTP18 localization. Cytoplasmic UTP18 associates with the translation complex and Hsp90 to upregulate the translation of IRES-containing transcripts such as HIF1a, Myc and VEGF, thereby inducing stress resistance. Hsp90 inhibition decreases cytoplasmic UTP18 and UTP18-induced increases in translation. Importantly, elevated UTP18 expression correlates with increased aggressiveness and decreased survival in numerous cancers. Enforced UTP18 overexpression promotes transformation and tumorigenesis, whereas UTP18 knockdown inhibits these processes. This stress adaptation mechanism is thus co-opted for growth by cancers, and its inhibition may represent a promising new therapeutic target."

Clinical case–control studies indicate the Mdm2SNP309-G allele associates with a significant increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk that is heightened in women, but the biological significance of this polymorphism has never been directly evaluated. To examine whether the Mdm2SNP309-G allele contributes to colorectal cancer, we generated cohorts of mice harboring either the G (minor allelic variant) or T (major allelic variant) allele and treated them with azoxymethane (AOM), a carcinogen that induces sporadic colorectal cancer. Mdm2SNP309-G/G mice displayed a significant reduction in survival following AOM treatment with more colonic lesions in a wider distribution throughout the lower and upper colon and an attenuated apoptotic response following exposure. AOM did not significantly induce stabilization of wild-type p53 or activate p53 downstream targets following AOM treatment, regardless of the genotype. Instead, Mdm2SNP309-G/G colons had significant changes in the expression of genes that regulate Mdm2 transcription (ERα and Sp1) as well as downstream targets of Mdm2. Together these results suggest the Mdm2SNP309-G allele significantly impacts CRC through mechanisms outside the p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2162283217,"The Montebello archipelago consists of 218 islands; 80 km from the north-west coast of Western Australia. Before 1912 the islands had a diverse terrestrial fauna. By 1952 several species were locally extinct. Between 1996 and 2011 rodents and cats were eradicated, and 5 mammal and 2 bird species were translocated to the islands. Monitoring of the broader terrestrial ecosystem over time has been limited. We used 20 dry-season Landsat images from 1988 to 2013 and estimation of green fraction cover in nadir photographs taken at 27 sites within the Montebello islands and six sites on Thevenard Island to assess change in vegetation density over time. Analysis of data averaged across the 26-year period suggests that 719 ha out of 2169 ha have increased in vegetation cover by up to 32%, 955 ha have remained stable and 0.6 ha have declined in vegetation cover. Over 492 ha (22%) had no vegetation cover at any time during the period analysed. Chronological clustering analysis identified two breakpoints in the average vegetation cover data occurring in 1997 and 2003, near the beginning and end of the rodent eradication activities. On many islands vegetation cover was declining prior to 1996 but increased after rodents were eradicated from the islands. Data for North West and Trimouille islands were analysed independently because of the potential confounding effect of native fauna being introduced to these islands. Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and Shark Bay mice (Pseudomys fieldi) both appear to suppress native plant recruitment but not to the same degree as introduced rodents. Future research should assess whether the increase in vegetation cover on the Montebello islands is due to an increase in native or introduced plants."
