https://openalex.org/W2067789711,"Several animal species, including sheep, mice, cattle, goats, rabbits, cats, pigs and, more recently, mules have been reproduced by somatic cell cloning, with the offspring being a genetic copy of the animal donor of the nuclear material used for transfer into an enucleated oocyte. Here we use this technology to clone an adult horse and show that it is possible to establish a viable, full-term pregnancy in which the surrogate mother is also the nuclear donor. The cloned offspring is therefore genetically identical to the mare who carried it, challenging the idea that maternal immunological recognition of fetal antigens influences the well-being of the fetus and the outcome of the pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2096372265,"The transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 was identified from a human placenta cDNA library by the expression cloning method as a gene product that interacts with membrane type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP). Co-expression of MT1-MMP with syndecan-1 in HEK293T cells promoted syndecan-1 shedding, and concentration of cell-associated syndecan-1 was reduced. Treatment of cells with MMP inhibitor BB-94 or tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-2 but not TIMP-1 interfered with the syndecan-1 shedding promoted by MT1-MMP expression. In contrast, syndecan-1 shedding induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment was inhibited by BB-94 but not by either TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. Shedding of syndecan-1 was also induced by MT3-MMP but not by other MT-MMPs. Recombinant syndecan-1 core protein was shown to be cleaved by recombinant MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP preferentially at the Gly245-Leu246 peptide bond. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells stably transfected with the syndecan-1 cDNA (HT1080/SDC), which express endogenous MT1-MMP, spontaneously shed syndecan-1. Migration of HT1080/SDC cells on collagen-coated dishes was significantly slower than that of control HT1080 cells. Treatment of HT1080/SDC cells with BB-94 or TIMP-2 induced accumulation of syndecan-1 on the cell surface, concomitant with further retardation of cell migration. Substitution of Gly245 of syndecan-1 with Leu significantly reduced shedding from HT1080/SDC cells and cell migration. These results suggest that the shedding of syndecan-1 promoted by MT1-MMP through the preferential cleavage of Gly245-Leu246 peptide bond stimulates cell migration.

Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on all adherent cells (1Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev.

Since the expression of syndecans appears to be controlled during both development and the progression of tumor cells to the metastatic phenotype, it has been proposed that syndecans are important regulators of the migratory and invasive behaviors of both normal and transformed cells (9Bernfield M.

Med. 1996; 28: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The syndecan family is composed of four closely related proteins (syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4) encoded by four different genes. Syndecan-1 is abundant in normal epithelial cells and tissues, localizing to both basal and suprabasal cell layers (1Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Disruption of syndecan-1 expression in cultured cells leads to an epithelial mesenchymal transformation, with associated changes in cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion and altered epithelium-specific gene expression (7Rapraeger A.C.

Ectodomain shedding appears to contribute to diverse pathophysiological events such as host defense, wound healing, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, but how shedding is regulated remains largely unknown (15Kiessling L.L.

To date, more than 20 mammalian MMPs have been identified by cDNA cloning, and they can be subgrouped into soluble type and membrane type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (20Seiki M. APMIS. 1999; 107: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 21Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3877) Google Scholar). MMPs are overexpressed in various human malignancies and have been thought to contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading extracellular matrix components (18Birkedal H.H. Moore W.G.

Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of MMP expression correlates with the invasiveness or malignancy of tumors (23Nomura H. Sato H. Seiki M.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2055-2060PubMed Google Scholar). Particularly, MT1-MMP, MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 have been reported to be most closely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Whereas degradation of extracellular matrix is an important aspect of MMP biology, growing evidence has demonstrated specific processing/activation or degradation of cell surface receptors and ligands.

Recently, matrilysin (MMP-7) was shown to mediate shedding of syndecan-1/a CXC chemokine (KC) complex from the mucosal surface, which directs and confines neutrophil influx to active sites in injured lungs (36Li Q.

Previously, we have developed an expression cloning method to screen genes, the products of which not only modulate pro-MMP-2 activation mediated by MT1-MMP but also serve as substrates of MT1-MMP (37Miyamori H.

In this study, we have identified syndecan-1 as a substrate of MT1-MMP and demonstrated that shedding of syndecan-1 by MT1-MMP stimulates cell migration. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Primers were synthesized by Genset (Kyoto, Japan). A human placenta cDNA library constructed in the pEAK8 expression vector was obtained from EdgeBio Systems (Gaithersburg, MD). Recombinant MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP catalytic domains tagged with FLAG epitope at the COOH terminus were prepared as described previously (40Kinoshita T. Sato H. Okada A. Ohuchi E. Imai K. Okada Y.

(Takaoka, Japan). Monoclonal antibodies against FLAG and His6 epitope were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. [4-(N-hydroxyamino)-2R-isobutyl-3-S-(thienylthiomethyl)-succinyl]-l-phenylalanine-N-methylamide (BB-94) was a gift from Kotobuki Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Nagano, Japan). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney HEK293T and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Expression Cloning—Expression cloning to identify genes, the products of which interact with MMP-2, MMP-9, or MT1-MMP, was performed as described previously (37Miyamori H. Takino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokai H. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Sato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28204-28211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Western blotting and slot blotting For Western blot analysis, an expression plasmid for syndecan-1 (1 μg), was co-transfected with either MT1-MMP or control plasmid (4 μg) into 293T cells cultured in 10-cm dishes using TransIT LT1 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mirus, Madison, WI). At 24 h after transfection, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for a further 24 h. Syndecan-1 was enriched from the culture supernatants or cell lysates by DEAE-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (42Numa F. Hirabayashi K. Tsunaga N. Kato H. O'Rourke K.

Haematol. 1999; 104: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Enriched syndecan-1 was separated on 7% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then pretreated with 10% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h. Syndecan-1 was detected with anti-syndecan-1 MI15 antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as a first antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as a second antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% skim milk. The signal was monitored by LI-COR Odyssey™ infrared imaging system (Lincoln, NE). For slot blot analysis, an expression plasmid for syndecan-1 (100 ng) was co-transfected with either MT1-MMP or control plasmid (400 ng) into 293T cells cultured in 24-well microplates as described above. The culture supernatants and cell lysates were blotted onto Hybond N+ by the method described previously (17Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 44Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and syndecan-1 was detected as above. HT1080 cells stably expressing syndecan-1 (HT1080/SDC) were established by selecting cells transfected with syndecan-1 cDNA cloned in pEAK8 vector (EdgeBio Systems) in culture medium containing 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Immunostaining—Expression plasmids for syndecan-1 (0.2 μg) and MT1-MMP (0.8 μg) were co-transfected with TIMP or control plasmid (1 μg) into 293T cells cultured in 35-mm diameter dishes with glass bottoms coated with type I collagen (Matsunami Glass Industry Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunostaining for syndecan-1 was performed 48 h after transfection using anti-syndecan-1 MI15 antibody and goat antimouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) as described previously (37Miyamori H. Takino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokai H. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Sato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28204-28211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). F-actin was visualized with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was monitored using inverted confocal laser microscopy (Zeiss). Preparation of Recombinant Syndecan-1 Protein—Syndecan-1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 23–251 was generated by PCR using a flanking forward primer with an extra XhoI site (underlined) starting at nucleotide 272 (GenBank™ accession number J05392) (GGCCCTCGAGCAAATTGTGGCTACTAATTT) and a flanking reverse primer with an extra BglII site (underlined) starting at nucleotide 958 (CCAGATCTCTCTTTCCTGTCCAGGAGGCCC). A cDNA fragment encoding a syndecan-1 mutant protein in which Gly245 was substituted with Leu was generated by PCR amplification of syndecan-1 cDNA using mutagenesis primers (sense, GGGCCTCACAGCTCCTCCTGGACAGGAAAG; antisense, CTTTCCTGTCCAGGAGGAGCTGTGAGGCCC), which contain mutated nucleotides (underlined). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with XhoI and BglII and inserted into the XhoI and BglII sites of His6-CTC plasmid (39Takino T. Koshikawa H. Miyamori H. Tanaka M. Sasaki T. Okada Y. Seiki M. Sato H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4617-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Expression plasmid for syndecan-1-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was generated by inserting a cDNA fragment encoding GST at the BglII site of the above plasmid as described previously (39Takino T. Koshikawa H. Miyamori H. Tanaka M. Sasaki T. Okada Y. Seiki M. Sato H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4617-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The BL20 Escherichia coli strain was transformed with these plasmids, and the protein expression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were collected and then sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Syndecan-1 protein tagged with His6 was purified from the supernatant by a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Syndecan-1 GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the Cleavage Site of Syndecan-1 Protein—Recombinant syndecan-1 fusion protein (200 ng) was incubated with recombinant MT1-MMP catalytic domain (20 ng) in 50 μl of TNC buffer at 37 °C for 3 h, and generated fragments were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Milipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of each fragment was determined using the Beckman Coulter LF300 amino acid sequencer. Wound-induced Migration Assay—Mock-transfected HT1080 cells or HT/SDC cells were plated onto 35-mm diameter dishes coated with collagen (1 × 106 cells/plate). Semiconfluent monolayers formed 2 h after plating were scraped with a plastic tip, rinsed in medium to avoid cells resettling, and cultured in fresh medium for further 12 h. Migrating cells were photographed under microscopy before and after incubation at 10 points for each culture (39Takino T. Koshikawa H. Miyamori H. Tanaka M. Sasaki T. Okada Y. Seiki M. Sato H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4617-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Screening of Human Placenta cDNA Library—Plasmid DNA from the human placenta cDNA library was co-transfected with MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP cDNA into 293T cells, and cell lysates were analyzed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1). Transfection with MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP cDNA into 293T cells generated a 92-kDa gelatinolytic band of latent pro-MMP-9, a 68-kDa band of latent pro-MMP-2, and a 64-kDa band of MMP-2 intermediate form. Transfection of a pool of cDNA partially stimulated processing of MMP-2 to the 62-kDa active form (lane 2). Five cDNA clones of 24 clones from this cDNA pool were isolated by a second screening, transfection of which induced partial MMP-2 processing to the active form (data not shown). The size of all five cDNA fragments was 2.4 kb, and the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was determined. Homology search analysis revealed that this cDNA encodes the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 (GenBank™ accession number J05392). Shedding of Syndecan-1 by MT1-MMP—Although stimulation of MMP-2 activation mediated by MT1-MMP by the expression of syndecan-1 was weak, it suggested a possible interaction between MT1-MMP and syndecan-1. Thus, we examined whether syndecan-1 serves as a substrate of MT1-MMP. Syndecan-1 was co-expressed with MT1-MMP in 293T cells, and the shedding of syndecan-1 into culture medium or its association with cells was examined by Western blotting and slot blotting using anti-syndecan-1 antibody (Fig. 2). Syndecan-1 was spontaneously shed slightly into culture medium from 293T cells transfected with the syndecan-1 cDNA, detected as a smear band ranging from 100 to more than 200 kDa. Most of the syndecan-1 was observed in cell lysate, which migrated rather slower than that in the culture medium. Co-expression of MT1-MMP accelerated syndecan-1 shedding and reduced its level in the cell layer. Treatment of cells with the MMP inhibitor BB-94 blocked the shedding of syndecan-1 stimulated by MT1-MMP expression. Treatment of syndecan-1-transfected cells with TPA also stimulated shedding of syndecan-1 (Fig. 3A) as reported previously (17Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 45Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To compare syndecan-1 shedding induced by TPA and MT1-MMP, effects of MMP inhibitors BB-94, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were examined (Fig. 3, A and B). Shedding of syndecan-1 induced by either TPA treatment or MT1-MMP expression was inhibited by the addition of BB-94, but TIMP-1 had no effect. In contrast, the addition of recombinant TIMP-2 blocked syndecan-1 shedding induced by MT1-MMP expression but not that by TPA treatment. These results indicate that TPA induces a BB-94-sensitive endogenous protease capable of syndecan-1 shedding in 293T cells that is different from MT1-MMP. Shedding of syndecan-1 induced by TPA and MT1-MMP was also compared by immunostaining of cells using anti-syndecan-1 antibody (Fig. 3C). The surface of cells transfected with the syndecan-1 cDNA was only faintly immunostained for syndecan-1 when treated with TPA. Syndecan-1 staining was also weak on the surface of cells co-transfected with the MT1-MMP gene. Treatment with BB-94 recovered a strong syndecan-1 staining on cells treated with TPA or co-transfected with MT1-MMP. Co-expression of TIMP-2 or TIMP-3 recovered syndecan-1 staining of cells co-transfected with the MT1-MMP gene, but co-expression of TIMP-1 had no effect. Reduction of syndecan-1 staining by TPA treatment was reversed by the expression of TIMP-3 but not by the expression of TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. These results further confirmed that the TPA-induced syndecan-1 shedding is due to protease(s) different from MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP mutants were compared with wild type for their capacity to cause shedding of syndecan-1 (Fig. 4). MT1-MMP mutant defective in catalytic domain (MT1-EA) did not induce syndecan-1 shedding. Deletion of the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain (Δ535 or Δ335) abolished shedding, but substitution of the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain with that of interleukin-2 receptor (MT1/IL2R) did not affect it. MT1-MMP deletion mutant lacking hemopexin domain (ΔPex) also failed to induce syndecan-1 shedding. These results suggest that MT1-MMP may interact with syndecan-1 through its hemopexin domain and that cell surface localization of MT1-MMP is essential for the shedding of syndecan-1. Next, other members of the MT-MMP family were compared for their capacity to cause shedding of syndecan-1 (Fig. 5). Among the six members, only MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP promoted syndecan-1 shedding with a comparable efficiency. Cleavage of Syndecan-1 by MT1-MMP—Recombinant syndecan-1 ectodomain protein tagged with His6 epitope at the carboxyl terminus was incubated with recombinant MT1-MMP and was analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). The major digestion product of 25 kDa and a minor fragment of 23 kDa were observed; however, none of them was detected by the antibody against the His6 epitope. This indicates that syndecan-1 ectodomain protein tagged with His6 epitope at the carboxyl terminus is preferentially cleaved at the site adjacent to the carboxyl terminus. To identify the cleavage site, recombinant syndecan-1 ectodomain protein fused to GST was synthesized and incubated with recombinant MT1-MMP (Fig. 6B). The major digestion product was a 29-kDa fragment, the NH2-terminal sequence of which demonstrated the cleavage of Gly245-Leu246 peptide bond of syndecan-1. Next, syndecan-1-GST mutant protein in which Gly245 was substituted with Leu (G245L-GST) was incubated with recombinant MT1-MMP, which did not generate a 29-kDa fragment but a major fragment of 58 kDa. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the 58-kDa fragment generated by digestion of syndecan-1-GST or G245L-GST showed the cleavage of Gly82-Leu83 peptide bond of syndecan-1 by MT1-MMP. Incubation of syndecan-1-GST fusion protein with MT3-MMP generated a similar digestion pattern including other minor fragments (data not shown). Syndecan-1 Shedding Enhances Cell Motility—The syndecan-1 cDNA was stably transfected into HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080/SDC), which express high levels of endogenous MT1-MMP (46Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), and syndecan-1 shed into culture medium or associated with cells was monitored by Western and slot blotting using anti-syndecan-1 antibody (Fig. 7). HT1080/SDC cells continuously shed a moderate level of syndecan-1, which was detected by Western blotting as a smear band migrating slower that that from 293T cells, and the syndecan-1 concentration in cell lysate was low (Fig. 7A). TPA treatment of HT1080/SDC cells induced further syndecan-1 shedding and reduced the level of cell-associated syndecan-1. In contrast, treatment of cells with BB-94 blocked syndecan-1 shedding, resulting in syndecan-1 accumulation in the cells. Spontaneous shedding of syndecan-1 from HT1080/SDC cells was also blocked by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1 as shown by slot blotting (Fig. 7B). TPA-induced shedding from HT1080/SDC cells was inhibited only by BB-94. HT1080/SDC cells were also examined by immunostaining for syndecan-1 localization (Fig. 7C). Syndecan-1 was weakly stained on HT1080/SDC cell surface, and treatment with BB-94 induced accumulation of syndecan-1 on the cell surface. Formation of actin stress fibers was frequently observed in BB-94-treated HT1080/SDC cells but not in mock-transfected cells (data not shown). The addition of TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1 significantly enhanced cell surface staining of syndecan-1. Motility of HT1080/SDC cells on collagen-coated dishes was examined in the wound-induced migration assay (Fig. 7D). Motility of mock-transfected HT1080 cells was slightly inhibited by the addition of BB-94 or TIMP-2 (93 and 94% of mocktreated cells, respectively). Migration of HT1080/SDC cells was 78% of mock-transfected cells. Treatment of HT1080/SDC cells with BB-94 or TIMP-2 further suppressed migration to 70 and 71% of the untreated HT1080/SDC cells, respectively. Syndecan-1 Shedding through the Cleavage of Gly245-Leu246 Peptide Bond—Wild-type syndecan-1 and its mutant with an amino acid substitution of Gly245 with Leu (G245L) were compared for shedding accelerated by MT1-MMP expression (Fig. 8A). Shedding of G245L mutant induced by MT1-MMP expression or TPA treatment was significantly less effective than that of wild-type syndecan-1. Spontaneous shedding from HT1080 cells stably expressing G245L (HT1080/G245L) was less effective than that from HT1080/SDC cells, and the level of cell-associated syndecan-1 in HT1080/G245L cells was higher than that of HT1080/SDC cells (Fig. 8B). The concentration of syndecan-1 accumulated in these cells by BB-94 treatment was at a comparable level. Consistent with the level of cell-associated syndecan-1, migration of HT1080/G245L cells was significantly slower than that of HT1080/SDC cells (Fig. 8C). As described above, BB-94 suppressed migration of HT1080/SDC cells, but migration of HT1080/G245L was not significantly affected by it. Previously, we have identified claudin-5, N-Tes/testican-3, and KiSS-1/metastin as molecules that interact with MMPs by the expression cloning strategy (37Miyamori H. Takino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokai H.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4617-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified that expression of the syndecan-1 gene also promoted conversion of the MMP-2-activated intermediate form to the fully active form in the process mediated by MT1-MMP in 293T cells. Since endogenous TIMP-2 concentrations in 293T cells are suboptimal for pro-MMP-2 activation through the formation of ternary complex between pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and MT1-MMP, focal concentration of the complex by syndecan-1 may promote this process (37Miyamori H. Takino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokai H. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Sato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28204-28211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the effect of syndecan-1 expression on pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP was weak compared with that of claudin-5 expression (data not shown) (37Miyamori H. Takino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokai H. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Sato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28204-28211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CD44, a major receptor for hyaluronan, not only directs MT1-MMP to lamellipodia but also serves as a substrate for MT1-MMP (47Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 48Mori H. Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Kajita M. Itoh Y. Sato H. Tojo H. Yana I. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which led us to examine weather syndecan-1 is also cleaved by MT1-MMP. Co-expression of MT1-MMP with syndecan-1 promoted shedding of syndecan-1, and the concentration of cell surface syndecan-1 was reduced. The promotion of syndecan-1 shedding was also observed with MT3-MMP, but not with other MT-MMPs. Mutation analysis of MT1-MMP suggested that its cell surface localization is essential for the shedding of syndecan-1. Deletion of the hemopexinlike domain of MT1-MMP abolished syndecan-1 shedding, which suggests the interaction of MT1-MMP with syndecan-1 through this domain. Syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding was also accelerated by TPA. Syndecan-1 shedding accelerated by either MT1-MMP or TPA was inhibited by both BB-94 and TIMP-3; however, TIMP-2 selectively blocked syndecan-1 shedding promoted by MT1-MMP, and neither were inhibited by TIMP-1. These results indicate that syndecan-1 shedding induced by TPA is mediated by metalloproteinase(s) other than MT1-MMP. TPA-accelerated shedding of mouse syndecan-1 ectodomain results from cleavage at a juxtamembrane site in core protein (17Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). One of the potential cleavage sites of syndecan-1 by MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP determined using recombinant proteins was the Gly245-Leu246 peptide bond within a juxtamembrane site. Indeed, substitution of Gly245 with Leu significantly reduced shedding promoted by MT1-MMP expression or TPA treatment. This indicates that the Gly245-Leu246 peptide bond is one of the major cleavage sites for shedding promoted by MT1-MMP expression or TPA treatment. Gly245-Leu246 of human syndecan-1 corresponds to Ser246-Leu247 in mouse syndecan-1. It still remains to be examined whether mouse syndecan-1 is cleaved at this site by MT1-MMP. Syndecan-mediated cellular attachment to extracellular matrix proteins including collagen and fibronectin regulates the migratory and invasive phenotype of both normal and transformed cells (9Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 10Inki P. Jalkanen M. Ann. Med. 1996; 28: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For example, exogenous expression of syndecan-1 in epithelial mammary tumor cells restored an epithelial morphology and growth characteristics (49Leppa S. Mali M. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study, syndecan-1 expression was shown to down-regulate migration of HT1080 cells, and treatment of cells with MMP inhibitors increased cell surface syndecan-1 concentrations concomitant with formation of actin stress fibers, which resulted in further retardation of cell migration. HT1080 cells are known to produce relatively high levels of MMPs, including MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9. HT1080/SDC cells constitutively shed syndecan-1 ectodomain, and this could be blocked by TIMP-2 or BB-94 but not by TIMP-1. The selective inhibition suggests that endogenous MT1-MMP in HT1080 cells is mainly involved in syndecan-1 shedding. Matrilysin (MMP-7) was also recently reported to mediate syndecan-1 shedding (36Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar); however, matrilysin appears not be involved in shedding from HT1080 cells, because TIMP-1 did not block the shedding. High cancer cell syndecan-1 expression in tissue biopsies has been found to be associated with a favorable outcome in head and neck cancer (50Anttonen A. Kajanti M. Heikkila P. Jalkanen M. Joensuu H.

Pathol. 1998; 186: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and low syndecan-1 expression in immunostaining of cancer tissue is associated with poor histological grade of differentiation in squamous cell lung carcinoma (52Anttonen A.

Lung Cancer. 2001; 32: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), increasing aggressiveness of basal cell carcinoma (54Bayer-Garner I.B. Dilday B. Sanderson R.D.

Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Kohgo Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). High serum syndecan-1 levels at diagnosis were reported to be associated with poor outcome in lung cancer (56Joensuu H. Anttonen A. Eriksson M. Makitaro R. Alfthan H. Kinnula V. Leppa S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5210-5217PubMed Google Scholar). It would be hypothesized that syndecan-1 ectodomain might be shed by MT1-MMP and/or matrilysin expressed in tumor cells, because expression levels of MT1-MMP and matrilysin are also associated with the malignancy of tumors including lung cancer (24Ueno H. Nakamura H. Inoue M. Imai K. Noguchi M. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2055-2060PubMed Google Scholar, 57Tokuraku M. Sato H. Murakami S. Okada Y. Watanabe Y. Seiki M. Int. J.

Tang X. Hosokawa M. Imai K. Cancer. 2001; 91: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Syndecans are also known to bind to various growth factors and cytokines via glycosaminoglycan chains and consequently regulate signal transductions (5Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 149: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 6Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Woods A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, shedding of syndecan-1 complexed with these factors and the interaction of shed products with these factors may be one of the important steps for the regulation of their activities in various pathophysiological situations. Recently, matrilysin was shown to mediate shedding of a syndecan-1/a CXC chemokine (KC) complex from the mucosal surface, which directs and confines neutrophil influx to sites of injury in injured lungs (36Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is also expressed in diverse pathophysiological conditions and may contribute to the regulation of signals from growth factors and cytokines by shedding syndecan-1 complexed with them. In conclusion, we have shown that MT1-MMP cleaves and sheds syndecan-1 ectodomain, which enhances cell motility on collagen. Since syndecan-1 shedding is involved in diverse pathological events such as tumor progression, wound healing, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, the identification of shedding proteases may contribute to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2035212947,"Stars that explode as supernovae come in two main classes. A type Ia supernova is recognized by the absence of hydrogen and the presence of elements such as silicon and sulphur in its spectrum; this class of supernova is thought to produce the majority of iron-peak elements in the Universe. They are also used as precise ‘standard candles’ to measure the distances to galaxies. While there is general agreement that a type Ia supernova is produced by an exploding white dwarf star1, no progenitor system has ever been directly observed. Significant effort has gone into searching for circumstellar material to help discriminate between the possible kinds of progenitor systems2, but no such material has hitherto been found associated with a type Ia supernova3. Here we report the presence of strong hydrogen emission associated with the type Ia supernova SN2002ic, indicating the presence of large amounts of circumstellar material. We infer from this that the progenitor system contained a massive asymptotic-giant-branch star that lost several solar masses of hydrogen-rich gas before the supernova explosion."

The present study analyses the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells, with special attention to the role of the death receptor Fas in this pathway. We show that, in the 10–100 μm range of concentrations, resveratrol activates various caspases and triggers apoptosis in SW480 human colon cancer cells. Caspase activation is associated with accumulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak that undergo conformational changes and relocalization to the mitochondria. Resveratrol does not modulate the expression of Fas and Fas-ligand (FasL) at the surface of cancer cells, and inhibition of the Fas/FasL interaction does not influence the apoptotic response to the molecule. Resveratrol induces the clustering of Fas and its redistribution in cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich fractions of SW480 cells, together with FADD and procaspase-8. This redistribution is associated with the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Transient transfection of either a dominant-negative mutant of FADD, E8, or MC159 viral proteins that interfere with the DISC function, decreases the apoptotic response of SW480 cells to resveratrol and partially prevents resveratrol-induced Bax and Bak conformational changes. Altogether, these results indicate that the ability of resveratrol to induce the redistribution of Fas receptor in membrane rafts may contribute to the molecule's ability to trigger apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

Because of their spectrum of biological activities, especially as antioxidants, polyphenolics are suspected to afford the cardioprotective effects of red wine identified by epidemiological studies (1Lamuela-raventos R.M.

Blood. 1998; 92: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A number of pathways leading to apoptosis converge on the mitochondria to induce the release of soluble molecules from their intermembrane space. One of these molecules is cytochrome c, which, in the cytosol, induces oligomerization of the adapter molecule Apaf-1 to generate a complex in which caspase-9 is activated. Active caspase-9 then triggers the catalytic maturation of caspase-3 and other downstream caspases, thus leading to cell death. The release of cytochrome c can be prevented by anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which are supposed to preserve the mitochondrial membrane integrity. The pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family known as BH3-only proteins behave as sensors of cellular damage and initiate the death process by either inhibiting anti-apoptotic members of the family or activating another group of proapoptotic, Bcl-2-related proteins, the Bax/Bak proteins, through induction of conformational changes (14Solary E. Bettaieb A. Dubrez-Daloz L. Corcos L. Leuk. Lymph. 2003; 44: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

One of the most studied death receptors is Fas (APO-1/CD95). In response to engagement by its specific ligand (FasL) or an agonistic anti-Fas Ab, the cytoplasmic domain of the trimerized receptor recruits the adaptor molecule FADD (Fas-associating protein with death domain) (19Boldin M.P.

We show that resveratrol induces conformational changes of Bax, its redistribution to the mitochondria and caspase-dependent apoptosis in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480. Resveratrol does not increase the expression of Fas nor does it induce the appearance of Fas-ligand at the surface of tumor cells, but the compound triggers the redistribution of the transmembrane Fas receptor in plasma membrane rafts. Then, the DISC is formed and actively contributes to Bax redistribution and cell death. These results suggest that redistribution of Fas in the plasma membrane rafts induced by resveratrol in colon carcinoma cells could account for the ability of this polyphenol to trigger apoptosis in these cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Vectors, and Transient Transfection—SW480, SW620, and HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). SW480 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 and HCT116 and SW620 cells in Eagle's minimum essential medium, (Biowhittaker Co, Fontenay sous Bois, France). Both media were complemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine (Biowhittaker). The vectors used for transient transfections include pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI), pCI-MC159, and pCI-E8 (kindly provided by Dr. J. I. Cohen, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and pCI-FADD-DN (a kind gift from Dr. C. M. Zacharchuk). Exponentially growing cells were incubated with a mixture of 9 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 1 μg of the above-indicated plasmid together with 1 μg of an EGFP-encoding plasmid (pEGFP-C1, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Transfected cells were treated 24 h later for indicated times before measuring the number of EGFP-positive, apoptotic cells.Drugs, Chemical Reagents, and Antibodies—Resveratrol and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. We used rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abs) against human caspase-3 active fragments, procaspase-9 and PARP (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), procaspase-10 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), Bax N terminus (Pharmingen and N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Bcl-xL (Transduction Lab, Erembodegen, Belgium), Fas (clone M20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Mcl-1 (Santa Cruz), rat Abs against human FasL (clone H11; Alexis biochemicals, Illkirch, France), and mouse monoclonal Abs against human procaspase-8 (Immunotech, Marseille, France), caspase-8 active fragments (Cell Signaling), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), mitochondrial HSP70 (Alexis), Bak N terminus (Oncogene Research, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France), Bcl-2 (Dako, Denmark), Fas (clone ZB4 blocking Ab, clone CH11 agonistic Ab, Biovalley Co., Rockville, MD, clone Apo1–3, Alexis and clone DX2, Pharmingen), FasL (NOK1, Sigma-Aldrich), FADD (Transduction Laboratories), caveolin-2 (clone 65, Transduction Laboratories), and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Soluble FasL was collected from the supernatant of sFas-L-transfected Neuro 2A cells as described previously (27Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Martin F. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and unique pools of sFas-L (one arbitrary unit: 1 μl of a 100-fold concentrated supernatant of confluent Neuro 2A cells after a 48-h culture) and mock supernatant were used throughout the study. The tested caspase peptide inhibitors included z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk, z-IETD-fmk, z-VDVAD-fmk, z-LEHD-fmk (R&D Systems, Lille, France).Apoptosis Identification—Apoptosis was identified by staining the nuclear chromatin of trypsinized cells with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37 °C. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by analyzing 300 cells. When indicated, cells were incubated for 1 h with 2 μg/ml antagonistic anti-Fas ZB4 Ab or 5 μg/ml NOK-1 anti-FasL Ab prior exposure to resveratrol (usually 30 μm)orfor 72 h with the anti-Fas CH11 agonistic Ab (100 ng/ml in the presence of 0.8 μg/ml cycloheximide).Flow Cytometry Analyses—Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was measured by using the DepSipher kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe forms aggregates in normal polarized mitochondria that result in a green-orange emission of 590 nm after excitation at 490 nm whereas the monomeric form present in cells with depolarized mitochondrial membranes emits only green fluorescence at 527 nm. Briefly, 106 cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μg/ml DepSipher solution, then washed twice in DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) (BioWhittaker) before analysis. As a control, cells were treated for 30 min with the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 100 μm; Sigma-Aldrich). Analysis of Fas and FasL expression on the plasma membrane was performed by incubating the cells for 45 min at 4 °C with either clone DX2 mouse anti-Fas Ab or clone H11 rat anti-FasL Ab or isotype-matched controls (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Abs were diluted in DPBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3. After two washes in DPBS, cells were incubated for 45 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and analysis was performed using a FACscan cytometer (BD Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Studies—Tumor cells were seeded into tissue culture chambers at 20,000 per well (Chamber Slide, Invitrogen) for 24 h, then treated and subsequently fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Chemical Co.) for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with DPBS for 10 min, preincubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated with the primary Ab (DPBS, 0,1% saponin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) for2hat room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated for 30 min with 488-Alexa goat anti-rabbit and/or 568-Alexa goat anti-mouse Ab (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Analysis was made by using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Champigny, France) or a confocal laser-scanning microscope (28Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A non-relevant isotypematching Ab was used as negative control (not shown).Western Blotting—Cells washed in DPBS were lysed in boiling buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate 10 mm, Tris, pH 7.4) in the presence of 1:50 Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 4 °C. The viscosity of the samples was reduced by several passages through a 26-gauge needle. Mitochondrial (M) and cytosolic (C) fractions were prepared as previously described (29Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Ivry-sur Seine, France). 30 μg of protein were incubated in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, separated on a polyacrylamide SDS-containing gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking nonspecific binding sites overnight by 5% nonfat milk in TPBS (DPBS with 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with the primary Ab, washed twice with TPBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The membrane was washed twice with TPBS and revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation—Cells (15 × 106) were detached, washed in DPBS, and incubated in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, 0.1 μg/ml of an anti-human CD95 monoclonal Ab (APO1–3, Alexis Co.) was added at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) during 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times in lysis buffer. The precipitate was resuspended in a loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis.Caspase Activity Measurement—Cells were incubated in lysing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). 50 μg of proteins of the resulting supernatant were incubated in buffer assay (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm ETDA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 100 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-LEHD-AFC, z-VEID-AFC, z-IETD-AFC and z-VDVAD-AFC; France Biochem, Meudon, France). AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) and AFC (7-amino-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarin) released from the substrate were excited at 380 and 400 nm to measure emission at 460 and 505 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was monitored continuously at 37 °C for 30 min in a dual luminescence fluorimeter (MicroTek OS, Bio-Tek Kontron Instruments, Winooski). Enzyme activities were determined as initial velocities expressed as relative intensity/min/mg.Raft Isolation and Biochemical Characterization—Cells (100 × 106) were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of buffer MES (Sigma-Aldrich) (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C, before passing them through an ice-cold cylinder cell homogenizer. Then, lysate was diluted with 2 ml of buffer MES containing 80% sucrose (w/v) and placed at the bottom of a linear sucrose gradient. The sample was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C, and 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Then, 60 μl of each fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted.Lipids were extracted from these fractions by the method of Folch et al. (30Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentration was determined by evaporating an aliquot of the chloroformic phase, then adding 100 μl of chloroform/methanol 1/2 (v/v) for quantitative LC/MS (Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry). Phospholipid analysis was performed on a Hypersil Si 2*200 mm column (Agilent Technologies) with a binary gradient of solvent A (5 mm ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol, 4:1) and solvent B (5 mm ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol/water, 6:3.4:0.5). Positive ESI-MS (electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) was performed on a MSD 1100 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). To analyze cholesterol content, another aliquot of the chloroformic phase was evaporated before adding 60 μl of KOH (10 m) and 1 ml of methanol and incubating at 56 °C for 45 min. Then, 2 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of water were added before shaking, then evaporating the chloroformic phase. 100 μl of a mixture of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamited/trimethylchlorosilane (4/1 v/v) (Acros Organics) were added to each samples before incubation for 1 h at 80 °C, evaporation and addition of 100 μl of hexane. Trimethylsilylethers of sterols analysis was performed by GCMS (Gas Liquid Mass Spectrometry) in a 6890 gas chromatograph coupled with a 7673 Mass Detector (Agilent Technologies). The column was an HP-5MS 30m*.25 mm (Agilent Technologies) and helium was used as the carrier gas. Concentrations of phospholipids and cholesterol were determined from the ratio of the peak area of a given molecule to the peak area of the internal standard. Levels were determined by comparison of this ratio with a standard curve of known amounts of cholesterol or of different species of phospholipids. Concentrations were expressed in μg/mg total proteins.RESULTSResveratrol Induces Caspase-mediated Apoptosis in SW480 Cells—When cultured in the presence of resveratrol, SW480 colon carcinoma cells underwent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell staining with Hoechst 33342 demonstrated that resveratrol induced an increase in the nucleus size that preceded the appearance of characteristic apoptotic changes, i.e. the condensation and fragmentation of the nuclear chromatin (Fig. 1, A and B). These nuclear changes were inhibited by co-treatment with the cell permeant caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (50 μm), suggesting caspase involvement in the death process (Fig. 1B). The role of these proteases in resveratrol-induced apoptosis was further suggested by the observation that the nuclear DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) was cleaved into an N-terminal 89-kDa fragment in cells treated with 30 μm resveratrol for 48 h (Fig. 1C).Several experiments confirmed caspase involvement in resveratrol-induced SW480 apoptosis. First, immunoblots demonstrated that the M r 32,000 proform of caspase-3, the M r 55,000 proform of caspase-8, and the M r 47,000 proform of caspase-9 were cleaved into their active fragments during the death process (Fig. 1C). Secondly, active caspase-3 was detected by immunofluorescence in SW480 apoptotic cells by using an Ab that specifically detects the active fragments of the protease (Fig. 1D). Third, a time-dependent increase in the cleavage of fluorogenic peptide substrates that mimic the target cleavage sites of different caspases was identified in cell lysates (Fig. 1E). Lastly, various cell-permeant peptides designed to inhibit caspases with various specificities were observed to negatively interfere with resveratrol-induced cell death. Altogether, these results suggested that resveratrol induced SW480 cell apoptosis through one or several caspase-dependent pathways. Similar observations were made in SW620 and HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell lines when treated in the same conditions (not shown).Resveratrol Induces Cytochrome c Release from the Mitochondria—One of the main pathways leading to caspase activation involves the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. To identify involvement of the mitochondria in resveratrol-induced apoptosis of SW480 cells, we measured first mitochondrial potential by using the DepSipher probe. SW480 cells were left untreated or treated with 30 μm resveratrol for 48 h, stained with DepSipher, then analyzed by flow cytometry. Resveratrol induced a weak but reproducible increase in the percentage of cells that emitted only green fluorescence, indicating a decrease in mitochondrial Δψm. This decrease was higher in SW480 cells treated for 48 h with FasL, which correlates with a higher level of apoptosis (Fig. 2A). These changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, as identified by immunoblot showing a decrease of cytochrome c expression in the mitochondrial fraction and its accumulation in the cytosolic fraction under resveratrol exposure (Fig. 2B). This apoptosis-associated redistribution of cytochrome c was confirmed by immunofluorescence studies that identified a punctuate staining pattern in the cytoplasm of untreated cells (Fig. 2C), similar to the pattern produced by the mitochondrial-specific Mitotracker Red dye (not shown), and a more diffuse cytosolic staining in resveratrol-treated cells exhibiting chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Changes at the mitochondrial level in resveratrol-induced apoptosis. A, mitochondrial membrane potential Δψm was studied by flow cytometry in untreated SW480 cells (gray line) or treated with 100 μm CCCP for 30 min (positive control) or 30 μm resveratrol for 48 h (R30) or recombinant Fas-L for 48 h (CD95-L)(black line). Mitochondrial depolarization was suggested by reproducible changes in the curve shape of cytosolic green monomers (FL1). B and C, Resveratrol-induced apoptosis involves cytochrome c release. B, Western blot analysis of cytochrome c in the mitochondria-(M) and cytosolenriched (C) extracts obtained from SW480 cells left untreated (Co) or treated for 48 h with 30 μm resveratrol (R30). C, a pool of detached and attached treated cells (see above) was stained with an anti-cytochrome c Ab (green) with nuclei counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Arrows indicate a typical apoptotic cell with diffuse cytochrome c in the cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Resveratrol Induces Bax Redistribution to the Mitochondria—Apoptosis-associated mitochondrial events have been shown to be modulated by Bcl-2 and related proteins. Western blot analyses indicated that exposure of SW480 cells to 30 μm resveratrol for 48 h induced a decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins without modifying Bcl-XL protein level (Fig. 3A). This treatment also induced an increase in Bax and Bak protein expression (Fig. 3A). Bax and Bak protein level decreased in the cytosol of resveratrol-treated cells and accumulated in the mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Bax and Bak involvement in apoptotic pathways was demonstrated to be associated with exposure of their N terminus (31Makin G.W. Corfe B.M. Griffiths G.J. Thistlethwaite A. Hickman J.A. Dive C.

https://openalex.org/W1981667569,"Deregulated expression of SPARC/osteonectin, a secreted glycoprotein with multiple biological functions, has been associated with the progression of various cancers. Using microarrays, we previously identified SPARC as one of the genes induced by treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor in pancreatic cancer cells. We therefore analysed the expression pattern and methylation status of the SPARC gene in pancreatic cancer. Gene expression profiling by oligonucleotide microarray and reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated that SPARC mRNA was expressed in non-neoplastic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, but was not expressed in a majority of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The loss of SPARC expression was associated with aberrant hypermethylation of its CpG island. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed that the SPARC protein was overexpressed in the stromal fibroblasts immediately adjacent to the neoplastic epithelium in primary pancreatic cancers, but rarely expressed in the cancers themselves. Primary fibroblasts derived from pancreatic cancer strongly expressed SPARC mRNA and secreted SPARC protein into the conditioned media, and treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with exogenous SPARC resulted in growth suppression. SPARC expression in fibroblasts from noncancerous pancreatic tissue was augmented by coculture with pancreatic cancer cells. These findings suggest that SPARC is a frequent target for aberrant methylation in pancreatic cancer and that SPARC expression in fibroblasts adjacent to pancreatic cancer cells is regulated through tumor-stromal interactions."

Obesity is another serious health problem and has been shown to be associated with prostate cancer. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this association. Here we show that factor(s) secreted from adipocytes stimulate prostate cancer cell proliferation. Leptin is one of the major adipose cytokines, and it controls body weight homeostasis through food intake and energy expenditure. We identify leptin as a novel growth factor in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth. Strikingly, leptin stimulates cell proliferation specifically in androgen-independent DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells but not in androgen-dependent LNCaP-FGC cells, although both cell types express functional leptin receptor isoforms. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown recently to play a crucial role in obesity and insulin resistance. Intriguingly, leptin induces JNK activation in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, and the pharmacological inhibition of JNK blocked the leptin stimulation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation. This suggests that JNK activation is required for leptin-mediated, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, other cytokines produced by adipocytes and critical for body weight homeostasis cooperate with leptin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation: interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor I demonstrate additive and synergistic effects on the leptin stimulation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation, respectively.

Therefore, adipose cytokines, as well as JNK, are key mediators between obesity and hormone-resistant prostate cancer and could be therapeutic targets. Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death among men in the United States. The disease is characterized by a prolonged natural history. Despite its relatively slow growth, a number of patients have persistent and/or recurrent disease. Initial treatment for many patients with recurrent disease is hormonal therapy to remove or decrease serum androgen as a potential growth stimulant for the prostate cancer. Although this approach is initially effective in the majority of patients, ultimately the disease becomes resistant to the loss of hormones, returns, and in many cases, culminates in the death of the patient. Thus, it is desired to develop effective therapies and preventives for hormone-resistant (androgen-independent) prostate cancer.Several lines of evidence indicate that obesity is a risk factor for prostate cancer. In particular, obesity is associated with clinical features characteristic of accelerated progression of prostate cancer: high mortality (1Rodriguez C. Patel A.V. Calle E.E. Jacobs E.J. Chao A. Thun M.J. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar), prostatectomy at a younger age with high grade and more pathologically advanced cancer (2Amling C.L. Kane C.J.

Furthermore, abdominal adiposity, even in a lean population, has been shown associated with an increased risk of clinical prostate cancer (4Hsing A.W. Deng J. Sesterhenn I.A. Mostofi F.K. Stanczyk F.Z. Benichou J. Xie T. Gao Y.T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 1335-1341PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular basis of such associations. It is widely recognized that adipocytes produce various cytokines and hormones (5Fruhbeck G. Gomez-Ambrosi J. Muruzabal F.J. Burrell M.A. Am. J. Physiol.

JNK is activated in response to various stimuli and agents, including lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)), ionizing radiation, ultraviolet, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and inhibitors of translation, such as anisomycin and cycloheximide (27Derijard B.

Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Activated c-Jun participates in activator protein-1 (AP-1) formation. AP-1 is a group of dimeric basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins that pertain to the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, JunD), Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2), Maf (c-Maf, MafA, MafB, MafF/K/G, Nrl), and activating transcription factor (ATF) (ATF2, LRF1/ATF3, B-ATF, JDP1, JDP2) sub-families, which bind either the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element or the cAMP response element (32Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). JNK, as well as AP-1, contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis during various physiological and pathological events, including embryonic morphogenesis and tumor development (33Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, JNK has been demonstrated recently (34Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z.

JNK2 has been shown involved in cell proliferation (cell cycle progression) and survival in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells (35Potapova O. Anisimov S.V. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Gaarde W.A. Boheler K.R. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our best knowledge, no cytokines or growth factors have been reported to trigger the cell cycle progression or cell survival of prostate cancer cells via JNK activation.Leptin is not the only cytokine that is produced by adipocytes and plays a role both in body weight homeostasis and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is secreted from adipocytes in addition to other cell types (5Fruhbeck G. Gomez-Ambrosi J. Muruzabal F.J. Burrell M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2001; 280: E827-E847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with leptin, serum IL-6 levels correlate to body mass index (36Fried S.K. Bunkin D.A. Greenberg A.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Rudling M. Carlsten H. Dickson S.L. Ohlsson C. Jansson J.O. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Interestingly, serum IL-6 levels are remarkably elevated in patients with clinically evident hormone-resistant prostate cancer as compared with those with hormone-dependent cancer (39Drachenberg D.E. Elgamal A.A. Rowbotham R. Peterson M. Murphy G.P. Prostate. 1999; 41: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Consistent with the clinical result, IL-6 is secreted by androgen-independent prostate cancer cells but not by androgen-dependent LNCaP cells (40Chung T.D. Yu J.J. Spiotto M.T. Bartkowski M. Simons J.W. Prostate. 1999; 38: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 41Okamoto M. Lee C. Oyasu R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 141-146PubMed Google Scholar). This autocrine IL-6 (40Chung T.D. Yu J.J. Spiotto M.T. Bartkowski M. Simons J.W. Prostate. 1999; 38: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 41Okamoto M. Lee C. Oyasu R.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 141-146PubMed Google Scholar), stimulates androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth. This suggests that IL-6 can stimulate androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth in both autocrine and paracrine manners. Adipocytes also secrete insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I (5Fruhbeck G. Gomez-Ambrosi J. Muruzabal F.J. Burrell M.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Like IL-6, IGF-I is secreted by prostate cancer cells and can promote androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth in both autocrine and paracrine fashions (46Kaicer E.K. Blat C. Harel L.

We identify leptin as a novel growth factor in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation and show that JNK mediates leptin-stimulated, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we identify collaboration of leptin with IL-6 and IGF-I in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation. Thus, adipose cytokines, such as leptin, IL-6, and IGF-I, are key mediators between prostate cancer and obesity.MATERIALS AND METHODSCytokines, JNK Inhibitor, and Antibodies—Recombinant human IL-6 and leptin were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). SP600125, a pharmacological JNK inhibitor, and anisomycin were purchased from Tocris Cookson, Inc. (Ellisville, MO). The stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit, anti-JNK, anti-c-Jun, anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63), and anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-73) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA).Prostate Cancer Cells and Culture Conditions—Human prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP-FGC were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). DU145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). PC-3 and LNCaP-FGC cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.In Vitro Adipocyte Differentiation—Human primary preadipocytes were purchased from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in preadipocyte basal growth medium (PBM) (BioWhittaker Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. To induce the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, confluent preadipocytes plates (3.3 × 104/cm2) were cultured in PBM plus 10% FBS and antibiotics for 24 h and then switched to PBM plus 10% FBS, antibiotics, 10 μg/ml insulin, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 200 μm indomethacin. After 9 days of incubation, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with PBM without serum for 24 h; the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged at 1,000 × g to remove cell debris, and stored at -80 °C until use. To identify fat accumulation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with Oil-Red-O (Sigma) and observed under a bright-field microscope as described previously (48Calkhoven C.F. Muller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar).Thymidine Incorporation Assay—DU145 (1.5 × 105/well), PC-3 (1.0 × 105/well), and LNCaP-FGC (2.0 × 105/well) cells were seeded into 24-well plates 24 h before serum starvation. Cells were deprived of serum for 48 h, followed by incubation with leptin at indicated concentrations or 100 ng/ml IL-6 for 20 h. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with SP600125 prior to cytokine stimulation as described below. Cells in each well were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) during the final 5 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized with 0.25 m NaOH, and counted in scintillant. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate, and the values are reported as mean ± S.D.MTT Assay—DU145 (1 × 103/well), PC-3 (1 × 103/well), and LNCaP FGC (1.5 × 103/well) cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h prior to serum starvation. Cells were starved of serum for 24 h and then incubated in the serum-free medium with or without 12.5 μg/ml leptin for 5 days. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to each well to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were lysed in 50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS at 37 °C. Optical densities (OD) at 550 and 670 nm were measured by a plate reader, and differential OD between 550 and 670 nm (OD 550 minus OD 670 nm) were determined. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate, and the values are reported as mean ± S.D.Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the TRIZOL standard technique. To evaluate mRNA expression patterns of leptin receptor isoforms (huOB-R, huB219.1-3), total RNA was extracted from DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP-FGC cells incubated without serum for 24 h. Two micrograms of each RNA were used to generate cDNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture, according to the Omuniscript reverse transcriptase protocol (Qiagen). The reaction mixture for PCR (20 μl) contained 1× PCR buffer (Roche Applied Science), 0.1-0.5 μm of each primer, 0.2 μm of each dNTP (Qiagen), 1.0 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and 1 μl of the cDNA solution. PCR was performed with an initial denaturing at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 19-39 cycles consisting of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55-62 °C for 30 s, and extending at 72 °C for 1 min. Amounts of PCR products were compared after cycles of reactions that exhibited DNA amplification in a linear range. The same forward primer (5′-TTG TGC CAG TAA TTA TTT CCT CTT-3′) was used for amplification of all the leptin receptors with different reverse primers as follows: huB219.1 (5′-CTG TGG CCT TCC GCA GTG-3′), huB219.2 (5′-ACC TCC ACC CAG TAG TTC CTT-3′), huB219.3 (5′-AGT TGG CAC ATT GGG TTC AT-3′), and huOB-R (5′-CTG ATC AGC GTG GCG TAT TT-3′) (49Mix H.

The PCR reactions were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal standard. Forward and reverse primers used for GAPDH were 5′-TGA AGG TCG GTG TCA ACG GAT TTG GC-3′ and 5′-CAT GTA GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC-3′, respectively. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.0% gel with ethidium bromide staining.Cell Lysate Preparation—Eighty-percent confluent prostate cancer cells were starved in the serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated by 12.5 μg/ml leptin or 10 μg/ml anisomycin for the indicated periods. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with SP600125 prior to cytokine stimulation as described below. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by a scraper, and centrifuged for 10 min at 700 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized in the cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 30 min. This homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was saved as a cell lysate and stored at -80 °C until use.Western Blot Analysis of c-Jun Phosphorylation—Cell lysates containing 100 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following the supplier's instructions, the membranes were washed, blocked, and hybridized with anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63 or Ser-73) polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes a phosphorylated form of c-Jun. Bands were visualized using a Lumiglo reagent (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). The membranes were then stripped and re-hybridized with anti-c-Jun antibody that detects both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms to normalize sample variations.In Vitro JNK Assay—JNK activity was measured using the stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, JNK was precipitated in 250 μl of cell lysates (250 μg protein) with 2 μg of glutathione-Sepharose beads immobilized by a recombinant fusion protein of the c-Jun N terminus (1-89) and glutathione S-transferase as a JNK substrate. After being washed with the cell lysis buffer three times, the precipitates were incubated in 50 μl of the kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of the SDS sample buffer. The N-terminal c-Jun (1-89) fusion protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its phosphorylation was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) polyclonal antibody as described above. JNK protein levels in cell lysates were also measured by Western blot analysis using anti-JNK antibody to normalize sample variations.Pharmacological Inhibition of JNK in Prostate Cancer Cells—SP600125 was dissolved in Me2SO to make a stock solution. Eighty-percent confluent prostate cancer cells were serum-starved for 24 h and pretreated with SP600125 at indicated concentrations for 30 min, followed by leptin treatment (12.5 μg/ml) of 15 min for Western blot analysis or 20 h for thymidine incorporation assays. Me2SO-treated cells were employed as controls.RESULTSTo address our hypothesis that factor(s) produced by adipocytes may accelerate prostate cancer progression, we examined whether conditioned medium from human primary adipocyte culture stimulates cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells using a thymidine incorporation assay. We differentiated primary human preadipocytes to mature adipocytes in vitro by treating cells with insulin, isobutyl-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and indomethacin as described above. Fat staining with Oil-Red-O demonstrates that cells accumulated fat droplets only after the treatment (Fig. 1A), indicating they successfully differentiated from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Prostate cancer cells were treated with conditioned media from these two cell types. Strikingly, the conditioned medium from mature adipocyte culture stimulated thymidine incorporation remarkably in both androgen-independent DU145 and PC-3 cells and androgen-dependent LNCaP-FGC cells, whereas that from preadipocyte culture exhibited only modest effects (Fig. 1B). This suggests strongly that adipose factor(s) promote cell proliferation both in androgen-independent and -dependent prostate cancer cells.Leptin is one of the major cytokines secreted from adipocytes (6Campfield L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2076016709,"We have isolated artificial ligands or aptamers for infectious prions in order to investigate conformational aspects of prion pathogenesis. The aptamers are 2'-fluoro-modified RNA produced by in vitro selection from a large, randomized library. One of these ligands (aptamer SAF-93) had more than 10-fold higher affinity for PrPSc than for recombinant PrPC and inhibited the accumulation of PrPres in near physiological cell-free conversion assay. To understand the molecular basis of these properties and to distinguish specific from non-specific aptamer-PrP interactions, we studied deletion mutants of bovine PrP in denatured, alpha-helix-rich and beta-sheet-rich forms. We provide evidence that, like scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF), the beta-oligomer of PrP bound to SAF-93 with at least 10-fold higher affinity than did the alpha-form. This differential affinity could be explained by the existence of two binding sites within the PrP molecule. Site 1 lies within residues 23-110 in the unstructured N terminus and is a nonspecific RNA binding site found in all forms of PrP. The region between residue 90 and 110 forms a hinge region that is occluded in the alpha-rich form of PrP but becomes exposed in the denatured form of PrP. Site 2 lies in the region C-terminal of residue 110. This site is beta-sheet conformation-specific and is not recognized by control RNAs. Taken together, these data provide for the first time a specific ligand for a disease conformation-associated site in a region of PrP critical for conformational conversion. This aptamer could provide tools for the further analysis of the processes of PrP misfolding during prion disease and leads for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to TSEs."
https://openalex.org/W2095279010,"We demonstrate that PS-341, a small molecule inhibitor of the proteasome, markedly sensitizes resistant prostate, colon, and bladder cancer cells to TNF-like apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis irrespective of Bcl-xL overexpression. PS-341 treatment by itself does not affect the levels of Bax, Bak, caspases 3 and 8, c-Flip or FADD, but elevates levels of TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. This increase in receptor protein levels is associated with the ubiquitination of the DR5 protein. When PS-341 is combined with TRAIL, the levels of activated caspase 8 and cleaved Bid are substantially increased. In Bax-negative TRAIL-resistant HC-4 colon cancer cells, the combination of PS-341 and TRAIL overcomes the block to activation of the mitochondrial pathway and causes SMAC and cytochrome c release followed by apoptosis. Similarly, murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking Bax undergo apoptosis when exposed to the combination of PS-341 and TRAIL; however, fibroblasts lacking Bak are significantly resistant. Taken together, these findings indicate that PS-341 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increasing the cleavage of caspase 8, causing Bak-dependent release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1993424211,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) is a natural protease inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Recent studies revealed a novel function of TIMP-1 as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis in mammalian cells. However, the mechanisms by which TIMP-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effect are not understood. Here we show that TIMP-1 activates cell survival signaling pathways involving focal adhesion kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and ERKs in human breast epithelial cells to TIMP-1. TIMP-1-activated cell survival signaling down-regulates caspase-mediated classical apoptotic pathways induced by a variety of stimuli including anoikis, staurosporine exposure, and growth factor withdrawal. Consistently, down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression greatly enhances apoptotic cell death. In a previous study, substitution of the second amino acid residue threonine for glycine in TIMP-1, which confers selective MMP inhibition, was shown to obliterate its anti-apoptotic activity in activated hepatic stellate cells suggesting that the anti-apoptotic activity of TIMP-1 is dependent on MMP inhibition. Here we show that the same mutant inhibits apoptosis of human breast epithelial cells, suggesting different mechanisms of TIMP-1 regulation of apoptosis depending on cell types. Neither TIMP-2 nor a synthetic MMP inhibitor protects breast epithelial cells from intrinsic apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, TIMP-1 enhances cell survival in the presence of the synthetic MMP inhibitor. Taken together, the present study unveils some of the mechanisms mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of TIMP-1 in human breast epithelial cells through TIMP-1-specific signal transduction pathways. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) is a natural protease inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Recent studies revealed a novel function of TIMP-1 as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis in mammalian cells. However, the mechanisms by which TIMP-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effect are not understood. Here we show that TIMP-1 activates cell survival signaling pathways involving focal adhesion kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and ERKs in human breast epithelial cells to TIMP-1. TIMP-1-activated cell survival signaling down-regulates caspase-mediated classical apoptotic pathways induced by a variety of stimuli including anoikis, staurosporine exposure, and growth factor withdrawal. Consistently, down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression greatly enhances apoptotic cell death.

A. 1996; 93: 3509-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cell-ECM interaction-mediated signal transduction is regulated in part by the composition and integrity of the ECM and actions of its components on specific cell adhesion receptors (3Lelievre S.

Integrity and turnover of the ECM are in part regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases (7Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S.

Four members of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase family (TIMP-1 to -4) have been identified as natural inhibitors of MMPs. Previous studies in our laboratory (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar) showed that bcl-2 overexpression is associated with enhanced levels of TIMP-1 expression in human breast epithelial cells, suggesting a role for TIMP-1 in apoptosis. Indeed, apoptosis studies showed that TIMP-1 protects against a variety of apoptotic stimuli including anoikis, hydrogen peroxide, x-ray irradiation, and adriamycin treatment (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIMP-1 inhibition of apoptosis in human breast epithelial cells involves focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated cell survival signaling rather than regulation of cell-ECM interactions via MMP activity. During the past several years, investigators have shown the role of TIMPs in apoptosis regulation. TIMP-1 inhibits apoptosis in many cell types including activated hepatic stellate cells (11Murphy F.R. Issa R. Zhou X. Ratnarajah S. Nagase H. Arthur M.J. Benyon C. Iredale J.P. J. Biol.

TIMP-3 induction of human colon carcinoma cell apoptosis is mediated by protecting tumor necrosis factor-α receptor on the cell surface against MMP-mediated cleavage (18Smith M.R. Kung H. Durum S.K.

Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study (24Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Voura E.B. Yu H.Y. Waterhouse P. Murphy G. Moorehead R.A. Khokha R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed increased epithelial cell apoptosis in TIMP-3-deficient mice during mammary gland involution, suggesting an anti-apoptotic activity of TIMP-3. Both pro- and anti-apoptotic activities of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 have been reported depending on the cell type. For example, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 enhance apoptosis in human T lymphocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, respectively (25Lim M.S. Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Stetler-Stevenson M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Tummalapalli C.M. Heath B.J. Tyagi S.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas TIMP-2 enhances cell survival of metanephric mesenchymes (27Barasch J. Yang J. Qiao J. Tempst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Leung W. Oliver J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and B16F10 melanoma cells (28Valente P. Fassina G. Melchiori A. Masiello L. Cilli M. Vacca A. Onisto M. Santi L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Albini A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and TIMP-4 protects human breast cancer cells, as well as mammary tumor xenografts, from apoptotic cell death (29Jiang Y. Wang M. Celiker M.Y. Liu Y.E. Sang Q.X. Goldberg I.D. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2365-2370PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has become clear that TIMPs are critical determinants for cell survival, the signaling mechanisms by which TIMPs control cell survival in a cell type-specific manner remain undefined. Also, it is still controversial whether the anti-apoptotic effect of TIMP-1 depends on its ability to inhibit MMP activity. In Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines TIMP-1 inhibition of apoptosis was shown to be independent of its inhibitory activity (13Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Wolff L. Wang J. Fukushima P. Mansoor A. Stetler-Stevenson M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 2002-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Guedez L. Courtemanch L. Stetler-Stevenson M. Blood. 1998; 92: 1342-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a mutant TIMP-1 devoid of inhibitory activity against certain MMPs had no anti-apoptotic effect in hepatic stellate cells (11Murphy F.R. Issa R. Zhou X. Ratnarajah S. Nagase H. Arthur M.J. Benyon C. Iredale J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11069-11076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In this study, we further examined the TIMP-1-mediated cell survival pathways and its significance in TIMP-1 regulation of apoptosis using breast epithelial MCF10A cells engineered to express high or low levels of TIMP-1. We also investigated whether TIMP-1 inhibition of apoptosis in these cells was dependent or independent of MMP inhibitory activity. Cell Culture—Immortalized nonmalignant human breast epithelial MCF10A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.1 μg/ml cholera enterotoxin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.5 μg/ml Fungizone in a 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (30Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Reagents—Anti-TIMP-1 Ab-2 (clone 102 D1) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were purchased from NeoMarkers, Inc. (Fremont, CA). Anti-human β-actin mAb, anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate, and anti-Rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-p44/42 MAPK, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and anti-p38 MAPK polyclonal antibodies (pAb) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Anti-active JNK pAb (pTPpY) was purchased from Promega. Anti-JNK1 (C-17) goat affinity purified pAb and anti-PI 3-kinase p85α (Z-8) pAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) mAb was purchased from Upstate USA Inc. MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059, SB202474 (PD-, a negative control for PD98059), PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Wor), LY294002 (LY), and LY303511 (LY-, a negative control for LY294002) were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Recombinant Proteins, Enzymes, and Protein Inhibitors—Human recombinant TIMP-1, TIMP-2, pro-MMP-2, and pro-MMP-9 were produced using a vaccinia mammalian cell expression system as described previously (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Heat-activated human stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) was a generous gift from Dr. Paul Cannon (Center for Bone and Joint Research, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant human active matrilysin (MMP-7) was obtained from Chemicon. Batimastat (BB-94), a hydroxamate-based broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (33Rasmussen H.S. McCann P.P. Pharmacol Ther. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), was obtained from British Biotech (Annapolis, MD). Plasmid Constructs and Transfection—Antisense TIMP-1 construct (AS TIMP-1) was generated by EcoRI digestion and re-ligation from its sense construct containing the human full-length TIMP-1 cDNA and the neomycin resistance gene, under control of the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus (kindly provided by Dr. M. Johnson at Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). To construct a TIMP-1/FLAG fusion cDNA, BamHI sites were introduced to both ,5′ and 3′ ends of the human full-length TIMP-1 cDNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction using primers TIMP-1AA BamHI, 5′-AAG GAT CCA TGG CCC CCT TTG AGC CCC TGG-3′, and TIMP1-207AA BamHIA, 5′-AAG GAT CCG GCT ATC TGG GAC CGC AGG GAC-3′. The fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site in the p3XFLAG-CMV-14 vector (Sigma). To substitute Thr-2 with Gly at the mature TIMP-1 protein (after cleavage of the signal peptide), site-directed mutagenesis was performed using primers T1T2G, 5′-CCA GCA GGG CCT GCG GGT GTG TCC CAC CCC A-3′, and T1T2GAA, 5′-TGG GGT GGG ACA CAC CCG CAG GCC CTG CTG G-3′, and a TIMP-1/FLAG construct as a template as instructed by the manufacturer (Stratagene). DNA sequencing analysis confirmed the fidelity of the constructs. Hereafter, the wild type TIMP-1/FLAG and T2G mutated TIMP-1/FLAG constructs are referred to as WT TIMP-1/FLAG and T2G TIMP-1/FLAG. Generation of TIMP-1 overexpressing MCF10A clones was described previously (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar). AS TIMP-1 construct was transfected into MCF10A cells as previously described (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar), and WT TIMP-1/FLAG, T2G TIMP-1/FLAG, and FLAG control constructs were transfected, respectively, into both MCF10A cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were subjected to 400 μg/ml G418 antibiotic selection for 14 days, and at least six colonies from each transfection were isolated for further analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were obtained by lysing the cell monolayer with SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 20% glycerol). The lysates were boiled for 5 min and then clarified by a 20-min centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amount of protein samples in SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) were boiled for 5 min and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with T-TBS containing 5% milk and in the appropriate antibodies. After three washes with T-TBS, the blot was incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen was detected using the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Apoptosis Induction—Apoptosis was induced by culturing cells in serum-free medium (growth factor withdrawal) or by treatment with staurosporine. Anoikis (apoptosis induced by loss of cell adhesion) was induced by culturing cells in polyHEMA-coated 6-well plates, which prevents cell adhesion (34Kim H.R. Lin H.M. Biliran H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4148-4154PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of TIMP-1 Effects on Cell Survival Using MTT Assay—Cell number was determined by an indirect colorimetric immunoassay (MTT assay). In brief, the cells (4 × 103 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well culture plate overnight followed by culture in serum-free medium for 48 h in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml TIMP-1, 500 ng/ml TIMP-2, 10 μm PD98059, 10 μm SB202474, 200 nm wortmannin, 50 nm LY294002, 50 nm LY303511, 5 μm BB-94, or vehicle (Me2SO). MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was then added, and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The cellular formazan was extracted with acidic isopropanol, and the absorbance of the converted dye was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm, with background subtraction at 650 nm, using a Bio-Rad Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). DEVDase Activity Assay—Cells were lysed in cell extract buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Fifty μl of the cytosolic fraction were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl of caspase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol), containing 25 μm capase-3 substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) (BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA). 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorescence, released by active caspase, was measured at 460 nm using 360-nm excitation wavelength by a Spectra Maxi Germini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Caspase activity was normalized per microgram of protein determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Detection of PI 3-Kinase Phosphorylation—Cells were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 10% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g to remove debris and immunoprecipitated using an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (clone 4G10; Upstate USA Inc.) and immobilized protein G-agarose beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and resolved by 8% reducing SDS-PAGE. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PI 3-kinase proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-PI 3-kinase p85α pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Purification of FLAG-tagged TIMP-1 Proteins—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells that stably expressed WT TIMP-1/FLAG or T2G TIMP-1/FLAG, were cultured in phenol red-free conditioned medium for 48 h. The conditioned medium was clarified by centrifugation and concentrated 5-fold using Centricon YM-10 (Millipore Corp.). Twenty ml of the conditioned medium were incubated with 120 μl of EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C. After the resin was collected and washed with TBS, the proteins were eluted with TBS buffer containing 3× FLAG peptide (150 μg/ml). Proteins were then analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and stained with Simply Blue SafeStain (Invitrogen). The fidelity of the T → G TIMP-1 mutation protein was confirmed by N-terminal microsequencing of affinity purified T2G TIMP-1/FLAG (Proseq, Inc., Boxford, MA). The concentrations of wild type TIMP-1/FLAG and T2G TIMP-1/FLAG were estimated by densitometry after immunoblot analysis and by titration with a MMP-9 solution with known concentration. MMP Inhibition Studies—The inhibitory activity of WT TIMP-1/FLAG, T2G TIMP-1/FLAG, and TIMP-1 produced by the vaccinia expression system was tested with MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-3, and MMP-7. The active enzymes (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were obtained by incubating pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate dissolved in 200 mm Tris at 37 °C in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, pH 7.5). The activation reaction was monitored with the fluorescence-quenched peptide MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2, as will be described below. p-Aminophenylmercuric acetate was removed by dialysis against collagenase buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, pH 7.5) at 4 °C. The enzyme concentrations were determined by active-site titration with TIMP-1 solutions of known concentration. The concentration of MMP-3 and MMP-7 was determined by titration with TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, respectively. The enzymatic assays were carried out at 25 °C, using a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer, equipped with the RadioMaster™ and FeliX™ hardware and software, respectively. Excitation and emission band passes of 1 and 3 nm, respectively, were used. Fluorescence measurements were taken every 4 s. MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-7 enzymatic activities were monitored with the fluorogenic synthetic substrate MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2, at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively. MOCAcRPKPVE(Nva)WRK(Dnp)NH2 was the substrate used to monitor MMP-3 activity at λex = 325 and λem = 393 nm. All fluorogenic substrates were obtained from Peptides International Inc., Louisville, KY. MMP inhibition was monitored after incubating the enzyme (0.2-0.7 nm) with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor at 37 °C in Buffer A for at least 1 h. The remaining enzymatic activity was monitored with the appropriate fluorogenic substrate (5-7 μm) at 25 °C. The initial rates of the enzyme reaction with the fluorogenic substrate were determined by linear regression analysis of the fluorescence versus time traces using FeliX™. These rates were analyzed according to a competitive model of inhibition (35Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 100-120Google Scholar) using the program SCIENTIST (MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT), yielding K i(app) values, because TIMP-1 has been shown to be a tight, slow binding inhibitor of the MMPs (32Olson M.W.

Down-regulation of TIMP-1 Expression in MCF10A Cells and Its Effects on Apoptosis—Our previous study (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar) showed that TIMP-1 overexpression protects MCF10A cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. To further investigate TIMP-1 regulation of human breast epithelial cell survival, we generated MCF10A clones in which endogenous TIMP-1 expression is down-regulated by an antisense construct (AS TIMP-1 MCF10A). Immunoblot analysis confirmed significant down-regulation of TIMP-1 in AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells and up-regulation of TIMP-1 in TIMP-1 overexpressing MCF10A clone 29 (T29) cells, when compared with the neo-control MCF10A cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To test the consequences of different levels of TIMP-1 expression on cell death, we compared the percentage of cell survival of neo-MCF10A (Neo), AS TIMP-1 MCF10A (AS), and TIMP-1 overexpressing MCF10A clone 29 (T29) cells, following loss of cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 1C, only ∼25% of AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells remained viable after 18 h of anoikis, whereas ∼80% of control vector-transfected and ∼95% of T29 MCF10A cells were viable. After 48 h, almost none of AS TIMP-1 MCF10A and only ∼15% neo-MCF10A cells survived, whereas ∼85% of T29 MCF10A cells remained viable. These results further confirmed our previous finding (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar) that TIMP-1 levels are critical determinants for apoptosis sensitivity in human breast epithelial cells. We next examined whether exogenously added TIMP-1 could protect AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells from cell death. We also tested TIMP-2, a close homologue of TIMP-1, for its effect on apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1D, TIMP-1 significantly enhanced AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cell survival (∼5-fold increase) following growth factor withdrawal, whereas TIMP-2 had little effect. Compared with AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells, TIMP-1 effect on neo-MCF10A cell survival was less drastic (∼2-fold). This is likely to be because of the fact that the neo-MCF10A cells express higher levels of endogenous TIMP-1 than AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Considering that both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 inhibit MMP activity, these results suggest that inhibition of MMP activity is unlikely to be a key mechanism for the anti-apoptotic effects of TIMP-1. TIMP-1 Regulates Caspase Activity—We showed previously (10Li G. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275PubMed Google Scholar) that TIMP-1 inhibits cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase following anoikis induction, suggesting that TIMP-1 regulates caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways. Because caspases, including caspase-3 and -7, cleave poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase at the DEVD216G site, we measured DEVDase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, DEVDase activity greatly increased in AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells after 18 h of anoikis induction, whereas neo-MCF10A cells had only a mild induction of DEVDase activity. At 24 and 48 h of anoikis, both neo-MCF10A and AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells exhibited high levels of activity. In contrast, there was no significant induction of DEVDase activity in the TIMP-1 overexpressing T29 MCF10A cells. We then examined whether TIMP-1 could inhibit caspase activity induced by staurosporine, an apoptotic agent that rapidly decreases the transmembrane potential of the mitochondria, resulting in activation of the intrinsic caspase cascade (37Nomura K.

Down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression significantly enhanced staurosporine-induced DEVDase activity in AS TIMP-1 MCF10A cells, and TIMP-1 overexpression effectively prevented DEVDase activity in T29 MCF10A cells (Fig. 2B). These studies demonstrate that TIMP-1 regulates classical apoptotic pathways involving caspases. TIMP-1 Activation of PI 3-Kinase and MAPK Survival Signaling Pathways Are Critical for Its Apopt"
https://openalex.org/W2035396256,"Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B), a novel gene upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was cloned using fluorescence differential display, RACE, and RT-PCR. It contains seven exons and encodes a 35-kDa protein with four putative transmembrane regions. Both the N- and C-termini of the protein are proline-rich, and may serve as potential ligands for the SH3 domain. Immunohistochemical analysis localized the protein predominantly to intracellular membranes. Northern blot showed that the LAPTM4B mRNAs were remarkably upregulated in HCC (87.3%) and correlated inversely with differentiation status. LAPTM4B was also overexpressed in many HCC-derived cell lines. It was also highly expressed in fetal livers and certain adult normal tissues including the heart, skeletal muscle, testis, and ovary. Promoter function assays showed a distinct difference in the gene's activities between BEL7402 and HLE cell lines, suggesting that the transcription factors responsible for regulation of the gene in the two cell lines are different, and that possible negative regulatory cis-elements may exist upstream of the promoter region. It was demonstrated that the N-terminus of LAPTM4B was essential for survival of the cells. Cells harboring the full-length LAPTM4B cDNA expression clone displayed a slightly increased efficiency in colony formation. These results suggest that LAPTM4B is a potential protooncogene, whose overexpression is involved in carcinogenesis and progression of HCC. In normal cells, it may also play important roles such as regulation of cell proliferation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2121067105,"Non-excitable cells use Ca2+ influx for essential functions but usually lack voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The main routes of Ca2+ entry appear to be store-operated channels or Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels, of which the magnesium-inhibited cation (or magnesium-nucleotide-regulated metal cation) current has received considerable recent attention. This current appears to be produced by one of the recently cloned transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, TRPM7. In this study of rat microglia, we identified TRPM7 transcripts and a prevalent current with the hallmark biophysical and pharmacological features of TRPM7. This is the first identification of a TRPM7-like current in the brain. There is little known about how members of the TRPM sub-family normally become activated. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings from rat microglia, we found that the TRPM7-like current activates spontaneously after break-in and that the current and its activation are inhibited by elevated intracellular Mg2+ but not affected by cell swelling or a wide range of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The TRPM7-like current in microglia appears to depend on tyrosine phosphorylation. It was inhibited by several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including a peptide (Src 40–58) that was shown previously to inhibit Src actions, but not by inactive drugs or peptide analogues. The current did not depend on the cell activation state; i.e. it was the same in microglia recently removed from the brain or when cultured under a wide range of conditions that favor the resting or activated state.

Because TRPM7 channels are permeable to Ca2+, this current may be important for microglia functions that depend on elevations in intracellular Ca2+. Non-excitable cells use trans-membrane Ca2+ influxes for essential cell functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, secretion, volume regulation, and ion homeostasis. Immune cells were among the first and remain among the most intensively studied, with focus on general and more specific roles of Ca2+ signaling, such as mitogenic activation, secretion of lymphokines, cytokines, cytotoxic molecules, and antibodies, and on phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and migration. In parallel, there have been an increasing number of studies on the pathways of Ca2+ entry into these cells. In almost all cases, the role of membrane potential in Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells is fundamentally different from excitable cells. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are rare in immune cells, and many cell types appear to be devoid of them. In these cells, although Ca2+ influx is electrogenic and tends to depolarize the cell, the main effect of depolarization is to reduce the driving force for Ca2+ influx. Because hyperpolarization favors Ca2+ entry, the focus has been on store-operated Ca2+ channels, including the Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) 1The abbreviations used are: CRAC, Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+; ACM, astrocyte conditioned medium; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate; K4BAPTA, K41,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; MEM, minimal essential medium; nMDG, n-methyl d-glucamine; NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid; TRP, transient receptor potential; PLC, phospholipase C.1The abbreviations used are: CRAC, Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+; ACM, astrocyte conditioned medium; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate; K4BAPTA, K41,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; MEM, minimal essential medium; nMDG, n-methyl d-glucamine; NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid; TRP, transient receptor potential; PLC, phospholipase C. channel, and on Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels. The CRAC current is widely expressed in immune cells, where it is one of the best characterized store-operated channels (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Lewis R.S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, two Ca2+-permeable channel types often co-exist. Recent studies on the Jurkat T cell line and rat basophilic leukemia cells were the first to distinguish between co-existing CRAC currents and a Mg2+-inhibited cation current (also called magnesium nucleotide-regulated metal cation current) (3Hermosura M.C.

The latter current is nearly identical to one of the recently cloned transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, TRPM7. The TRP family comprises >20 channels, all with six transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic N and C termini, and recently divided into three sub-families: TRPC, TRPV, and TRPM (for reviews see Refs. 6Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 7Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

Many of these channels are widely distributed in mammalian tissues, and following their cloning and heterologous expression, properties of some have made them excellent candidates for the Ca2+ entry pathways of non-excitable cells. Most members of the TRPC sub-family are store-operated and Ca2+ permeable, one of the TRPV members (TRPV4) is activated by changes in cell volume, and some members of the TRPM sub-family (TRPM7, TRPM8) are permeable to divalent cations, including Ca2+ (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 10Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). TRP channels are not voltage-gated and thus are open over a wide range of voltages once activated. Those that are Ca2+-permeable produce Ca2+ influxes that increase with the driving force; i.e. with hyperpolarizing membrane potentials, the common feature of Ca2+ entry into immune cells and many other non-excitable cells. Indeed, the properties of TRPM7 (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q.

Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) make it the best candidate for the non-store-operated Ca2+ pathway for Ca2+ entry in many immune cells. Expression of TRPM7 is widespread, with transcripts in brain, spleen, lung, kidney, heart, and liver (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M.

Within the brain, it is not known which cell types express this channel or what role it might play in normal or pathological brain function. We have been studying ion-channel expression and roles in the immune cell of the central nervous system, the microglia. These cells express several types of K+ channels, and some are involved in key microglia functions; e.g. proliferation and the respiratory burst (12Kotecha S.A. Schlichter L.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10680-10693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Khanna R. Roy L. Zhu X. Schlichter L.C. Am. J. Physiol.

Potassium Channels and Proliferation of Neuroimmune Cells. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, Kerala, India2002Google Scholar. Although the precise roles of the K+ channels are not yet known, they may act by maintaining a hyperpolarized membrane potential and facilitating Ca2+ entry, as in lymphocytes (for reviews see Refs. 14Schlichter L.C. Khanna R. Rouzaire-Dubois B. Benoit E. Dubrois J.M. Potassium Channels and Proliferation of Neuroimmune Cells. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, Kerala, India2002Google Scholar and 15Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The routes of Ca2+ entry in microglia are poorly understood. Microglia have ionotropic purinergic receptors that are permeable to Ca2+ and monovalent cations (16Illes P. Norenberg W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and a current reported to be CRAC (17Hahn J. Jung W. Kim N. Uhm D.Y. Chung S. Glia. 2000; 31: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), both of which should produce Ca2+ influxes that increase with hyperpolarization. The functional expression of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (18Colton C.A. Jia M. Li M.X. Gilbert D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1650-C1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is somewhat controversial, but if present they should produce a depolarization-activated Ca2+ influx. The presence of other Ca2+-permeable channels in microglia has not been reported. In the present study, we have identified transcripts for TRPM7 and characterized a prevalent current in rat brain microglia that has the hallmark features of expressed TRPM7 channels. The same current was expressed in ex vivo microglia, studied within 2 days of removal from the brain, as well as in microglia cultured under a wide range of conditions that favor either the resting or activated cell state. There is little known about how members of the TRPM sub-family normally become activated. For instance, TRPM7 contains an active protein kinase domain (atypical α-kinase), it can phosphorylate itself, and mutations in the ATP-binding motif reduce the current (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). But it appears that effects of changing ATP may be entirely because of inhibition of TRPM7 channel activation by intracellular free Mg2+ (10Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J.

Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), which is also a distinguishing feature of native Mg2+-inhibited cation or magnesium nucleotide-regulated metal cation currents (3Hermosura M.C.

Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 922-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We addressed this question in the present study, using whole-cell and perforated patch clamp recordings on rat microglia. We found that the TRPM7-like current activates spontaneously after break-in, but much less current develops in perforated-patch recordings. The current, like TRPM7, was inhibited by millimolar total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations. It was not affected by cell swelling or a wide range of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Activation of the current was inhibited by several tyrosine kinase inhibitors and by a peptide that interferes with actions of Src kinase but not by the appropriate inactive drug analogues or a scrambled peptide. Because TRPM7 channels are permeable to Ca2+, this current may be important for microglia functions that depend on elevations in intracellular Ca2+. Microglia—Cultures of highly purified microglia were prepared from neopallia of 2-day-old Wistar rat pups (Charles River, Quebec) as described previously (20Schlichter L.C. Sakellaropoulos G. Ballyk B. Pennefather P.S. Phipps D.J. Glia. 1996; 17: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In brief, finely minced neopallial tissue was pelleted and resuspended in minimal essential medium (MEM; University Health Network, Sera and Media Services, Toronto). The tissue was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer and re-suspended in MEM that was supplemented with 5% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin (all from Invitrogen). The cells were then seeded into 75-cm2 flasks and re-fed 2 days after isolation. After 10–12 days in culture without feeding, the flasks were shaken (180 rpm, 8–12 h), and the floating cells (>95% pure microglia) were harvested. For electrophysiology, microglia were plated on 15-mm sterile glass coverslips and cultured in either serum-free medium (i.e. MEM with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin) or astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), collected as the supernatant from rat astrocyte cultures grown in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum (21Eder C. Schilling T. Heinemann U. Haas D. Hailer N. Nitsch R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ACM was collected twice a week, frozen at –70 °C, and used within one month. Where indicated, microglia were treated with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide or 100 nm phorbol myristate acetate overnight before patch clamping. For ex vivo cells, freshly prepared suspensions of neopallial tissue were plated onto 15-mm sterile glass coverslips, fed with ACM, and patch-clamped 2 days after isolation. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed as described previously (22Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) from cultures that were >98% pure microglia. To eliminate genomic contamination, the cell suspension was digested with DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.1 units/ml, for 15 min at 37 °C. First strand cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer (Amersham Biosciences) and used as a template for PCR reactions with a gene-specific primer (from ACGT, Toronto, ON) for ChaK (GenBank™ accession number NM_053705) (forward primer CTGAAGAGGAATGACTACAC; reverse primer ACAGGGAAAAAGAGAGGGAG). As a control, oligo mouse actin (M12481) was amplified (forward primer CTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTGG; reverse primer TAGCTCTTCTCCAGGGAGGA). The PCR reaction was conducted with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm forward and reverse primers, 10% of the cDNA reaction mixture, and 1.25 μm of Taq DNA polymerase, using a GeneAmp PCR 2400 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The mixture was preheated to 95 °C for 5 min and then subjected to 25 cycles of a denaturing phase at 94 °C, a 30-s annealing phase at 55 °C, and a 30-s extension phase at 72 °C. The amplified products were resolved in 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The identities of products of the predicted sizes were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion. Patch Clamp Recordings—We made whole-cell or perforated-patch configurations at room temperature with an Axopatch 200A or Axopatch 1B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and 5–10-megohm resistance pipettes pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL). Capacitance and series resistance (but not leak current) were compensated online, and recordings were filtered at 5 kHz before acquiring data. pCLAMP v6.0 or 8.0 (Axon Instruments) was used for generating voltage commands, recording current, and collecting data, which were analyzed offline with Origin v6.0 (Northampton, MA). Liquid junction potentials were measured between each bath and pipette solution with a 3 m KCl electrode, subtracted offline, and used to correct all voltages and current versus voltage relations. Several combinations of bath and pipette solutions (indicated in each figure legend) were used to isolate the current and to characterize its selectivity and ion dependence. The standard bath solution contained (in mm) 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES, and standard pipette solution contained 40 KCl, 100 potassium aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 K2ATP, and 10 EGTA. To minimize contributions of the swelling-activated Cl– current (20Schlichter L.C. Sakellaropoulos G. Ballyk B. Pennefather P.S. Phipps D.J. Glia. 1996; 17: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) many experiments were performed with low Cl– solutions made by substituting NaCl and KCl with 125 mm NaMeSO4 and 5 mm KMeSO4 (bath) and 130 mm KMeSO4 or potassium aspartate (pipette). Sucrose was added when necessary to adjust the osmolarity of all solutions to 300 milliosmolar, measured with a freezing point-depression osmometer (Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA). For ion-selectivity studies, low Cl– solutions were used, with one of the following substitutions: 130 mm nMDG MeSO4 (pipette), K+-free bath, or pipette solutions were made by replacing KMeSO4 with CsMeSO4, or a divalent-free bath solution was prepared by replacing MgCl2 and CaCl2 with 4 mm NaCl and adding 10 mm HEDTA. To assess the dependence of the current on internal Ca2+, the pipette calcium solutions contained 1 mm K41,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (K4BAPTA) instead of EGTA, with free Ca2+ adjusted by adding CaCl2, according to the CaBuffer program (from J. Kleinschmidt, formerly of New York University). The effect of changing the internal Mg2+ concentration was tested by adding MgCl2 to the low Cl– pipette solution while keeping the ATP concentration fixed at 2 mm. For perforated-patch recordings, the pipette was back-filled with intracellular solution containing 20 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma) diluted from a freshly prepared 1 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO (23Rae J. Cooper K. Gates P. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). All bath solutions were pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH), and pipette solutions were pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH or CsOH). To initially assess regulation of the current by tyrosine kinases, a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (or its inactive analogue, daidzein, both at 50 μm), or the more Src-selective inhibitor, herbimycin A (2 μm) (24Fujishima H. Nakano S. Tatsumoto T. Masumoto N. Niho Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (all from Sigma), was added to the bath. A specific role for Src tyrosine kinase was further examined using pipette solutions containing the Src peptide, Src40–58, or the scrambled inactive peptide, Src40–58s (0.1 mg/ml), as we described previously (25Cayabyab F.S. Khanna R. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1949-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto). Spermine was purchased from Calbiochem, and unless indicated, the remaining chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were the highest purity available. Statistics—Where appropriate, data are presented as mean ± S.E., with n indicating the number of cells studied under each condition. Differences between means were analyzed by using either paired or unpaired Student's t tests as appropriate. An Outward-rectifying Cation Current—Unless otherwise indicated, all recordings were from microglia that were cultured in serum-free medium or astrocyte-conditioned medium, conditions that reduce microglia activation (21Eder C. Schilling T. Heinemann U. Haas D. Hailer N. Nitsch R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

Throughout this study, the holding potential was –5 mV to inactivate the voltage-gated K+ currents that have been well characterized in microglia: Kv1.3-like (12Kotecha S.A. Schlichter L.C. J.

Voltage-clamp steps and ramps were applied between –85 and +115 mV, avoiding more negative potentials that activate the well characterized inward rectifier (Kir2.1-like) current (20Schlichter L.C.

DeCoursey T.E. Eder C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1123-C1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except where noted, we observed an outward rectifying current that lacked time-dependent activation or inactivation during voltage-clamp steps. Fig. 1, A and B shows examples of the current; similar currents were seen in >200 microglia and, as shown in subsequent figures, under a wide range of conditions. Responses to voltage steps and ramps illustrate some hallmarks of this current; that is, lack of detectable time-dependent gating and strong outward rectification with a reversal potential of about –15 mV with standard bath and pipette solutions (circles in Fig. 1C). These features are very similar to the recently cloned TRPM7 channel (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Nadler M.J.

Most reports on transfected TRPM7 channels (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K.

Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) have not shown or mentioned the tail currents, and many have shown currents only in response to voltage-ramp protocols. We found very small tail currents upon return to the holding potential of –5 mV (Fig. 1, A and E), which was close to the reversal potential. When steps to more negative potentials followed strong depolarizing steps, the tail currents were immediately small (not shown), without the relaxations that occur when voltage-gated channels close with hyperpolarization. A similar lack of time dependence is expected for TRPM7 channels, because the inward current is rapidly blocked by external divalent cations. The outward current is carried by efflux of monovalent cations. That is, replacing intracellular K+ with nMDG+ nearly eliminated the outward current (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that the monovalent cation, K+, is highly permeant, but the bulky cation, nMDG+, is not. In contrast, replacing external Cl– with methanesulfonate (MeSO4) (Fig. 1D) did not affect the current amplitude or rectification, and similar results were seen with external aspartate (n = 3 cells, not shown). Thus, the outward current is not because of anion influx. K+ appears to be more permeant than Cs+, because the outward current was significantly reduced by replacing internal K+ with Cs+ (Fig. 1C). Although a selectivity sequence of K+>Cs+>nMDG+ is characteristic of K+ channels, the reversal potential of –10 to –15 mV with internal K+ or Cs+ rules out a K+-selective channel; E K is –85 mV with the normal K+-containing bath and pipette solutions used in Fig. 1, A–C. However, these features are typical of the TRPM7 channel, which passes monovalent cations (not anions) with a permeability sequence K+∼Cs+∼Na+>Ca2+ (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Possible contributions of ionotropic purinergic receptors, which produce a non-selective cation current in microglia (see “Discussion”), were ruled out by several observations. First, to eliminate the possibility that ATP leaking from the pipette during seal formation activated the cation current, some experiments were done without ATP; the current activated normally (n = 4, not shown). Second, the outward-rectifying current took several minutes to fully activate (see Fig. 7) whereas purinergic currents activate rapidly in the presence of ATP. Third, purinergic-receptor-mediated currents in microglia have nearly linear I-V relations, with substantial inward current. In the absence of external divalent cations, a large inward current was revealed during voltage-clamp steps (Fig. 1E) or ramps (Fig. 1F). As before, there was no time-dependent gating evident, thus the step-elicited currents were superimposed on the ramp currents. As shown here and in Fig. 8C (open circles), in divalent-free solution there was a dramatic decrease in current rectification; e.g. the ratio of current density at +115 mV versus –85 mV decreased from 8.6 ± 2.3 in standard bath solution to 1.8 ± 0.3 (n = 7) in divalent-free bath solution. In divalent-free bath solution, the current reversed at –11 ± 1 mV (n = 7), which expected for a non-selective cation channel through which Na+ (predominant in the bath) and K+ (predominant in the pipette) permeate well. That is, the K+ Nernst potential is about –85, and the Na+ Nernst potential is about +60 mV; thus, if the TRPM7 channel is equally permeable to K+ and Na+ (9Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) the reversal potential should be ∼–12 mV. Inhibition by Intracellular Mg2 + but Not by Intracellular Ca2 + —With the standard 1 mm Mg2+ and 2 mm K2ATP in the pipette, the outward-rectifying current increased over the first several minutes of whole-cell recording (Fig. 2A; for average time course see Fig. 7D). The current was not sensitive to internal Ca2+ (Fig. 2B); i.e. there were no changes in current density, degree of outward-rectification, or reversal potential over a wide range of free Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, the microglia channel is not Ca2+-activated, like some cation non-selective channels (28Colquhoun D. Neher E. Reuter H. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1981; 294: 752-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 29Petersen O.H. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), or subject to Ca2+-dependent slow deactivation, as is the CRAC current (30Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, buffering internal Ca2+ to ∼100 nm had no effect on cloned TRPM7 channels (31Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of current by internal Mg2+. The current density at both early (<3 min; see Fig. 2C, part i) and later times (>20 min; see Fig. 2C, part ii) reached significantly larger values when internal Mg2+ was omitted. In contrast, the normal time-dependent build up of current was"

In order to explore the function of wild-type ERβ (ERβ1) and its variant form, ERβcx/β2, stable transformants of ERα-positive breast cancer MCF7 cells with ERβ1 or ERβcx/β2 expression vector were established. Constitutive expression of ERβ1 or ERβcx/β2 reduced the S phase population of the cell cycle in dish culture and the number of colonies in an anchorage-independent assay. DNA–protein complexes of ERE with nuclear extracts from ERβ1 transformants were observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, while no complex was observed for ERβcx/β2 transformants. Reporter gene assay using estrogen-responsive element (ERE)-luciferase showed less responsiveness to estrogen in these transformants compared with parental cells. Endogenous mRNA expression of two known estrogen-responsive genes, cathepsin D and IGFBP4, was weakly induced by estrogen in ERβ1 and ERβcx/β2 transformants compared with parental cells. A comprehensive gene expression analysis using our custom-made cDNA microarray showed that MCF7 and ERβ1 transformants had a similar gene expression profile, whereas ERβcx/β2 showed a distinct profile from others. These results indicate that ERβ1 and ERβcx/β2 inhibit ERα function differently in MCF7 cells."

We investigated the respective roles of Skp2 and subcellular localization of p27 Kip1 in down-regulation of p27 Kip1 induced in MCF-7 cells by estrogens. 17β-Estradiol treatment increased Skp2 expression in MCF-7 cells; however, this increase was prevented by G1 blockade mediated by p16 Ink4a or the CDK inhibitor roscovitine, whereas down-regulation of p27 Kip1 was maintained.

The results suggest that Skp2 participates in ubiquitination/degradation of p27 Kip1 in the nucleus of estrogen-treated MCF-7 cells and further demonstrate that Skp2 overexpression prevents antiestrogen-mediated growth arrest of MCF-7 cells by down-regulating p27 Kip1 expression and maintaining CDK2 activity. In contrast, estrogen-induced down-regulation of p27 Kip1 proceeds in the absence of any increase in Skp2 expression in MCF-7 cells subjected to G1 blockade with p16 Ink4a or roscovitine and appears to depend in this context upon export of p27 Kip1 to the cytoplasm. Our studies also indicate that this process requires phosphorylation of p27 Kip1 on Ser10 as well as participation of the Ras/Raf-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway at a stage beyond phosphorylation of p27 Kip1 on this residue. In addition, enforced activation of the Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway elicited cytoplasmic relocalization of p27 Kip1 and prevented growth arrest by antiestrogen.

https://openalex.org/W1982341119,"EDD (E3 isolated by differential display), located at chromosome 8q22.3, is the human orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster tumour suppressor gene 'hyperplastic discs' and encodes a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein-ligase. To investigate the possible involvement of EDD in human cancer, several cancers from diverse tissue sites were analysed for allelic gain or loss (allelic imbalance, AI) at the EDD locus using an EDD-specific microsatellite, CEDD, and other polymorphic microsatellites mapped in the vicinity of the 8q22.3 locus. Of 143 cancers studied, 38 had AI at CEDD (42% of 90 informative cases). In 14 of these cases, discrete regions of imbalance encompassing 8q22.3 were present, while the remainder had more extensive 8q aberrations. AI of CEDD was most frequent in ovarian cancer (22/47 informative cases, 47%), particularly in the serous subtype (16/22, 73%), but was rare in benign and borderline ovarian tumours. AI was also common in breast cancer (31%), hepatocellular carcinoma (46%), squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (50%) and metastatic melanoma (18%). AI is likely to represent amplification of the EDD gene locus rather than loss of heterozygosity, as quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that EDD mRNA and protein are frequently overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancers, while among breast cancer cell lines EDD overexpression and increased gene copy number were correlated. These results demonstrate that AI at the EDD locus is common in a diversity of carcinomas and that the EDD gene is frequently overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancer, implying a potential role in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2034459612,"Deletion of the INK4a/ARF locus at 9p21 is detected with high frequency in human melanoma. Within a short genomic distance, this locus encodes several proteins with established tumor-suppressor roles in a broad spectrum of cancer types. Several lines of evidence support the view that p16INK4a and p19ARF exert the tumor-suppressor activities of this locus, although their relative importance in specific cancer types such as melanoma has been less rigorously documented on the genetic level. Here, we exploit a well-defined mouse model of RAS-induced melanomas to examine the impact of germline p16INK4a or p19ARF nullizygosity on melanoma formation. We demonstrate that loss of either Ink4a/Arf product can cooperate with RAS activation to produce clinically indistinguishable melanomas. In line with the common phenotypic end point, we further show that RAS+ p16INK4a-/- melanomas sustain somatic inactivation of p19ARF-p53 and, correspondingly, that RAS+ p19ARF-/- melanomas experience high-frequency loss of p16INK4a. These genetic studies provide definitive proof that p16INK4a and p19ARF cooperate to suppress the development of melanoma in vivo."

ClC-5 is a voltage-gated chloride channel found in the proximal tubule where it has been shown to be essential for protein uptake, based on evidence from patients with Dent's disease and studies in ClC-5 knockout mice. To further delineate the role of ClC-5 in albumin uptake, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the C-terminal tail of ClC-5 to identify any interactions of the channel with proteins involved in endocytosis. We found that the C-terminal tail of ClC-5 bound the actin depolymerizing protein, cofilin, a result that was confirmed by GST-fusion pulldown assays. In cultured proximal tubule cells, cofilin was distributed in nuclear, cytoplasmic, and microsomal fractions and co-localized with ClC-5. Phosphorylation of cofilin by overexpressing LIM kinase 1 resulted in a stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. Phosphorylation of cofilin in two proximal tubule cell models (porcine renal proximal tubule and opossum kidney) was also accompanied by a pronounced inhibition of albumin uptake.

This study identifies a novel interaction between the C-terminal tail of ClC-5 and cofilin, an actin-associated protein that is crucial in the regulation of albumin uptake by the proximal tubule. One of the major roles of the cortical nephron is to reabsorb proteins such as albumin from the glomerular filtrate. It is estimated that the kidneys reabsorb up to several grams of albumin/day, a process that is achieved in the proximal tubule by highly active and tightly regulated receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the megalin-cubulin scavenger receptor complex (1Christensen E. Birn H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F562-F573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that the uptake of albumin requires the coordinated activity of a number of proteins that may exist in a macromolecular complex within the endosome. This complex seems to include the albumin receptor megalin, V-type H+-ATPase, Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), 1The abbreviations used are: NHE3, Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3; ClC-5, voltage-gated Cl- channel; OK, opossum kidney; LLC-PK1, porcine renal proximal tubule; PI, phosphatidylinositol; LIMK-1, LIM kinase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and the Cl- channel ClC-5 (2Jentsch T.

Hypertens. 2002; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These proteins have defined transport functions that account for the various ion movements required during endosomal formation and acidification. V-type H+-ATPase plays a critical role in the acidification of the endosome, leading to dissociation of the albumin from megalin and its subsequent degradation in the lysosome (4Marshansky V. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ClC-5 is thought to be essential to provide the necessary anion shunt to neutralize the positive charge caused by H+ movement by the V-type H+-ATPase during the acidification of the endosome as it progresses to the lysosome (5Devuyst O. Christie P.T. Courtoy P.J. Beauwens R. Thakker R.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). NHE3 may play a facilitatory role in mediating the initial acidification process by exchanging the high Na+ for H+ in the newly formed endosome as it buds away from the membrane (3Gekle M. Serrano O.K. Drumm K. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Gassner B. Jansen H.W. Christensen E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F549-F558Google Scholar). The functional importance of these proteins in mediating albumin uptake has been shown in genetic disorders and in cell culture models. ClC-5 is essential for albumin uptake. In Dent's disease, which is caused by mutations in ClC-5, one of the key outcomes is low molecular weight proteinuria (6Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ClC-5 knockout mice also have proteinuria and in both of these cases, the proteinuria is caused by defective protein uptake in the proximal tubule (6Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 7Wang S.S. Devuyst O. Courtoy P.J. Wang X.T. Wang H. Wang Y. Thakker R.V. Guggino S. Guggino W.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This effect is thought to be caused by the key role of ClC-5 as an anion shunt, as the rate of acidification of apical vesicles derived from ClC-5 knockout mice is significantly lower than that observed in vesicles derived from wild-type mice (6Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). As a result, the uptake of markers of receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosis is severely impaired in the kidneys of ClC-5 knockout mice (6Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 7Wang S.S. Devuyst O. Courtoy P.J. Wang X.T. Wang H. Wang Y. Thakker R.V. Guggino S. Guggino W.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, NHE3 activity also seems to be involved in albumin uptake. In cultured opossum kidney (OK) cells or porcine renal proximal tubule (LLC-PK1) cells (8Drumm K. Gassner B. Silbernagl S. Gekle M. Eur. J. Med. Res. 2001; 6: 422-432PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of NHE3 with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride inhibits albumin uptake, and in OK cells lacking NHE3, albumin uptake is abolished (3Gekle M. Serrano O.K. Drumm K. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Gassner B. Jansen H.W. Christensen E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F549-F558Google Scholar). In contrast to ClC-5 knockout mice, however, there are no reports of proteinuria in NHE3 knockout mice, which argues against an obligate role for NHE3 in albumin uptake in vivo. In addition to mediating ion transport, both ClC-5 and NHE3 possess large intracellular C-terminal tails which can interact with scaffold or regulatory proteins in the cytoplasm, an essential component of the endocytotic pathway (9Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Schwerdt G. Silbernagl S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F668-F677PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the binding of sodium-hydrogen exchange regulatory factor to the PDZ binding domain of NHE3 (the subject of extensive study) mediates the interaction of NHE3 with the actin cytoskeleton (10Kim J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, NHE3 has been shown to interact with megalin by means of C-terminal interactions (14Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite ClC-5 being essential for the uptake of albumin, little is known about the functional interactions of the intracellular C terminus of ClC-5. The terminus contains a number of potential binding signals for regulatory molecules, including cystathione-β synthase domain (15Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Ponting C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a PY motif (17Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and a PDZ binding domain. Thus, it is possible that ClC-5 may play a crucial role in regulating endocytosis by means of C-terminal interactions with other proteins involved in the endocytotic pathway in the proximal tubule. We have recently shown that horseradish peroxidase infused into the kidneys of ClC-5 knockout mice remains trapped in a sub-plasmalemmal pre-endocytotic compartment and fails to enter the endosomal pathway proper (7Wang S.S. Devuyst O. Courtoy P.J. Wang X.T. Wang H. Wang Y. Thakker R.V. Guggino S. Guggino W.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the endocytotic defect may also be occurring earlier, at the formation of the nascent endosome, and that this may be because of interactions of ClC-5 with proteins involved in regulating the endocytotic process. Another possibility is trafficking, with evidence for this role for ClC-5 in the trafficking of other membrane proteins provided by studies in patients with Dent's disease, where defective ClC-5 resulted in the mis-trafficking of the V-type H+-ATPase (18Moulin P. Igarashi T. Van Der Smissen P. Cosyns J.-P. Verroust P. Thakker R. Scheinman S.J. Courtoy P.J. Devuyst O. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1285-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and in ClC-5 knockout mice, where mis-trafficking results in reduced levels of megalin/cubulin at the plasma membrane (19Christensen E. Devuyst O. Dom G. Nielsen R. Van Der Smissen P. Verroust P. Leruth M. Guggino W.B. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8472-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The internalization of the albumin-megalin complex occurs by means of clathrin-coated pits (20Zhai X.Y. Nielsen R. Birn H. Drumm K. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Moestrup S.K. Verroust P.J. Christensen E.I. Gekle M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1523-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The processes by which clathrin-coated pits are formed, recruit cargo, and detach as nascent endosomes are well characterized. The series of events, however, that allows the nascent endosome to pass through the cortical actin web into the cytoplasm are less well understood. Although albumin endocytosis is known to require intact cytoskeletal structures (21Schwegler J. Heppelmann B. Mildenberger S. Silbernagl S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 418: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the exact nature of the role of the cytoskeleton remains to be elucidated. The cytoskeleton itself may present a physical barrier to the endocytotic machinery (22Apodaca G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 23Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and therefore some localized remodeling of the network filaments must occur for the endosome to pass into the cytoplasm. In fact, it has been observed that the area in the immediate vicinity of clathrin-coated pits is largely devoid of actin filaments (24Fujimoto L. Roth R. Heuser J.E. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). One way this can be achieved is by the dissolution of actin filaments in the immediate vicinity of the endosome by actin depolymerizing proteins. The rapid turnover of actin filaments and the tertiary meshwork formation is regulated by a variety of actin-binding proteins such as the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin proteins (25Bamburg J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). These proteins are potent regulators of actin filament dynamics in eukaryotic cells and mediate the severing and depolymerization of actin. The actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin family has been shown to play a crucial role in mediating microvillar breakdown and rapid cytoskeletal alterations in ischemic and ATP-depleted proximal tubule cells (26Ashworth S.L. Southgate E.L. Sandoval R.M. Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F852-F862Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to determine whether the C terminus of ClC-5 interacts with proteins involved in endocytosis. This revealed a novel interaction between the C terminus of ClC-5 and the actin binding protein, cofilin. These proteins co-localize in vesicles containing the endosomal marker AP-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase inhibits albumin uptake in two model proximal tubule cell lines, namely LLC-PK1 and OK cells. Our data suggest that the interaction between cofilin and ClC-5 plays a critical regulatory role in the reabsorption of low molecular weight proteins in the proximal tubule. Cells and Antibodies—The LLC-PK1 and OK cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, whereas OK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's-F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Polyclonal antibodies against the N terminus of human ClC-5 were generated in rabbits immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated with synthetic peptide (CKSRDRDRHREITNKS), corresponding to amino acids 26-40 near the N terminus of ClC-5 with an additional N-terminal cysteine. Anti-ClC-5 IgG was affinity-purified with a column containing 5 mg of peptide (Eurogenetec, Seraing, Belgium). Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-cofilin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Anti-c-myc was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Anti-actin was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). TRITC-phalloidin was purchased from Sigma. All secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad. Labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Cloning of Human ClC-5 cDNA and Construction of Bait Vectors—Human ClC-5 (hClC-5) cDNA was isolated from a human kidney Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using reverse transcriptase-PCR with the forward and reverse primers and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was screened for the desired insert by restriction analysis, sequenced entirely by automated DNA sequencing (performed at the Johns Hopkins University Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility), and confirmed to be human ClC-5. The full-length C-terminal tail of ClC-5 (amino acids 563-746) was then cloned into the two-hybrid bait vector pAS2-1 and designated FBD. In addition, the C-terminal tail was divided into three regions and cloned into pAS2-1. These three regions isolated the two CBS regions (CBS1, amino acids 595-645, and CBS2, amino acids 686-733) and the region encompassing the PY domain (amino acids 646-685). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Two-hybrid analysis was performed by using the Matchmaker human kidney cDNA library (Clontech) and screened for interacting proteins by transformation of Y190 yeast on selective minimal synthetic dropout medium (Leu-, Trp-, His-, 35 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) at 30 °C for 2-7 days. A β-galactosidase assay confirmed the interactions. To confirm the interactions with cofilin, a bait pACT2 vector expressing cofilin was created (Cofilin). GST-cofilin Pulldown Assay—Cofilin was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) vector using the EcoRI and XhoI sites (GST-cofilin). The GST-cofilin fusion protein was produced by using the GST purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of the GST fusion protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were lysed by sonication, and the GST fusion protein was purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. For the pulldown assay, 50 μg of GST or GST-cofilin fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed by centrifugation and incubated with ∼1 mg of lysate from LLC-PK1 cells at 4 °C for 18 h. The beads were then washed, the samples were eluted into Laemmli gel sample buffer, separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was performed using the anti-ClC-5 and anti-GST antibodies, and the blots were detected by using secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Intracellular Distribution of Cofilin—LLC-PK1 cells were scraped into suspension buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA), and the membranes were disrupted by passing the sample through a 25-gauge needle 20 times. Nuclear, cytosolic, and microsomal fractions were harvested as described previously (27Wylie F. Heimann K. Luam Le T. Brown D. Rabnott G. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C497-C506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclei were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet (microsomal fraction) was suspended in suspension buffer. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and the subsequent supernatant was collected (cytosolic fraction). Equal volumes of protein fractions were resolved on 4-15% Tris-HCl gradient gels, and cofilin was detected by Western blotting as described above. Confocal Microscopy of Endogenous ClC-5 and Cofilin—Cells (LLCPK1 or OK) grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, for 10 min and permeabilized for 1 min with an ice-cold solution of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, 1% (v/v) normal donkey serum. Cells were washed three times in PBS, and the non-antigenic sites were blocked with 1% (v/v) normal donkey serum for 30 min. Incubation with the primary antibodies was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. To co-label the samples for ClC-5 and cofilin, the following protocol was employed (28Negoescu A. Labat-Moleur F. Lorimier P. Lamarcq L. Guillermet C. Chambaz E. Brambilla E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Samples were first incubated with rabbit anti-ClC-5, then with goat anti-rabbit to block any non-bound sites on the rabbit antibody, and finally with donkey anti-goat conjugated to TRITC. Cofilin was then labeled cofilin with the anti-cofilin antibody and subsequently with a Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary. Between each antibody exposure, samples were washed three times for 10 min in PBS to eliminate nonspecific binding of the antibodies and cross-reactivity. Samples were then mounted in Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and viewed with a Noran Oz confocal microscope fitted with a 100× oil immersion objective. Analysis of LIMK-1-transfected Cells—LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with a c-myc-tagged LIMK-1 in pCDNA3 (kindly provided by Dr. Pico Caroni, Friedrich Miescher Institute, Switzerland) using NovaFector (Venn Nova, Pompano Beach, FL). Expression of the c-myc LIMK-1 was confirmed by using a monoclonal c-myc antibody Western blot analysis. An antibody that specifically binds to phosphorylated cofilin (29Meberg P. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. James Bamburg, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) was used to detect the phosphorylated cofilin. Equal loading of samples was confirmed by using an actin antibody as a control. To determine the effects of LIMK-1 overexpression on the actin distribution, transfected cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with TRITC-phalloidin (1 μg/ml) for 20 min, and LIMK-1 was detected by using the c-myc antibody as described above. Albumin Uptake—We used two different methods to measure the effects of LIMK-1 overexpression on albumin uptake in cultured proximal tubule cells. The first method used a modified albumin uptake method in OK cells, a cell line commonly used for the study of proximal tubule albumin uptake (3Gekle M. Serrano O.K. Drumm K. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Gassner B. Jansen H.W. Christensen E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F549-F558Google Scholar, 9Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Schwerdt G. Silbernagl S. Am. J.

Kidney Int. 2003; 84: 103-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Control (mock-transfected) OK cells or cells transfected with c-myc-LIMK-1 were grown in 48-well plates for 7 days. In the final 48 h prior to experimentation, cells were changed to serum-free medium. Then cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml albumin conjugated to Texas Red (TR-albumin, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) under different conditions for 120 min. As a control to determine the level of endocytosis dependent on the intact cytoskeleton, some cells were pre-treated with latrunculin A (1.5 μm) for 60 min before exposure to TR-albumin. Nonspecific binding was determined in cells exposed to albumin for 1 min, a time at which no albumin uptake could be detected. At the end of the uptake period, cells were washed in HEPES buffer, pH 6, at 4 °C and then lysed in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS with 0.1% Triton X-100). The TR-albumin fluorescence was determined by using a Fusion spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard, Blackburn, Victoria, Australia) at 580 nm excitation and 630 nm emission wavelengths. TR-albumin uptake was standardized to total cellular protein, and the amount of fluorescence/μg of cellular protein was adjusted for background. To confirm the effects of LIMK-1 overexpression on albumin uptake in proximal tubule cells, we used single cell confocal microscopic analysis and a different proximal tubule cell line, LLC-PK1 (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells have also been shown to take up albumin at a rate comparable with OK cells. LLC-PK1 cells grown on coverslips and transfected with c-myc-LIMK-1 were exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C and incubated at times from 0 to 15 min. At the end of each time point, the cells were washed thoroughly in PBS and fixed as described above for confocal microscopy. Expression of c-myc LIMK-1 was detected with anti-c-myc antibody, and secondary antibody was conjugated to Cy3. The rate of albumin uptake was measured by averaging the fluorescence intensity of 10 individual control cells at each of the time points using Interaction and Presentation Laboratory software version 3.5. Parallel experiments were performed on untransfected control cells, on cells held at 4 °C to abolish endocytosis, and on cells pretreated with 30 μm cytochalasin D for 30 min to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and inhibit endocytosis. For the LIMK-1 transfected cells, only those cells determined to be positive for c-myc LIMK-1 expression were analyzed. Detection of LIMK-1 and LIMK-2 by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—RNA was extracted from OK cells using Trizol reagent and the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and an aliquot analyzed by PCR using the following primers: LIMK-1 forward, 5′-GTGATGGGGACACCTACACACTGG-3′; LIMK-1 reverse, 5′-GGAGCAGGCGGCTGGTCTCCTGG-3′; LIMK-2 forward, 5′-TCCTCCTCCCCATTTCCGGGCTCC-3′; LIMK-2 reverse, 5′-TCTGTGGAGAGTCTCTCAAACATG-3′. β-Actin was amplified as a control for reverse transcriptase-PCR. Quantification of Results and Statistical Analysis—Densitometric analysis of the Western blot data was performed using Fujifilm ScienceLab 99 Image Gauge (version 3.3). The percent co-localization between cofilin and ClC-5 was determined by using the Ultraview software co-localization function. The data were obtained from eight images composed of at least five cells in each view and reported as percent co-localization ± S.E. Statistical analyses of the data were performed with two-tailed Student's paired t tests; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library using the C terminus of human ClC-5 revealed an interaction with a clone (82-5) that coded for non-muscle isoform of cofilin (cofilin1) (GenBank™ accession number NM_005507). This cDNA was subcloned, and a subsequent two-hybrid screen confirmed the interaction between cofilin and ClC-5 (Table I). We then used the C-terminal fragments to attempt to identify the residues responsible for the interaction with cofilin. Unlike the interaction with the full-length tail, we found that none of the C-terminal fragments (CBS1, CBS2, or PY) interacted with cofilin in the two-hybrid assay.Table IYeast two-hybrid analysis of the interaction between ClC-5 and cofilinpACT2pAS2-1Interaction?No insertFBDNoClone 82-5FBDYesCofilinFBDYesCofilinCBS1NoCofilinCBS2NoCofilinPYNoCofilinNo insertNo Open table in a new tab GST Pulldown—To confirm an interaction between cofilin and ClC-5 in mammalian cells, we performed GST pulldowns. A GST-cofilin fusion protein was produced in BL-21 Escherichia coli and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Lysate from LLC-PK1 cells was applied to the beads, and after washing, the protein bound to the beads was eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted. The Western blots were then probed with the antibody against ClC-5. In control lysates incubated with GST alone, there was a nonspecific band at ∼50 kDa (data not shown). However, in lysates incubated with GST-cofilin, there was a clear band at ∼85 kDa corresponding to ClC-5 (Fig. 1A). This experiment was performed three times, and it was found that there was a significant level (p < 0.001) of ClC-5 binding to GST-cofilin compared with GST alone (Fig. 1B). These data confirm the interaction between endogenous ClC-5 and cofilin in cells of proximal tubule origin. Cellular Distribution of Cofilin—Cofilin is widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells and can translocate to the plasma membrane in response to various stimuli (23Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Cofilin has no predicted transmembrane domains; therefore, its association with cellular membranes is caused by interactions with proteins in or associated with these membranes. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of cofilin in nuclear, cytoplasmic, and microsomal fractions of LLC-PK1 cells. We found that in addition to being in the nucleus and cytoplasm, a significant fraction of the cofilin was associated with the microsomal membranes (Fig. 2). This association indicated that cofilin must be associating constitutively with other membrane-bound proteins in these cells, which is consistent with the high levels of ClC-5 found in these fractions. Subcellular Localization of Cofilin and ClC-5—We then performed dual wavelength confocal microscopy on permeabilized cells using antibodies against cofilin and ClC-5 to demonstrate co-localization. We found that endogenous ClC-5 occurred in punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm, which is consistent with its presence in recycling endosomes (Fig. 3A). Cofilin also showed a similar distribution (Fig. 3B), and when the two images were overlaid, there was clear co-localization of the two proteins (Fig. 3C). Pixel density analysis confirmed that there w"

The antineoplastic agent camptothecin specifically targets DNA topoisomerase I, and several mutations have been isolated that render the enzyme camptothecin-resistant. The catalytic and structural dynamical properties of a human DNA topoisomerase I mutant in which Ala-653 in the linker domain was mutated into Pro have been investigated. The mutant is resistant to camptothecin and in the absence of the drug displays a cleavage-religation equilibrium strongly shifted toward religation. The shift is mainly because of an increase in the religation rate relative to the wild type enzyme, indicating that the unperturbed linker is involved in slowing religation. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that the Ala to Pro mutation increases the linker flexibility allowing it to sample a wider conformational space. The increase in religation rate of the mutant, explained by means of the enhanced linker flexibility, provides an explanation for the mutant camptothecin resistance.

The three-dimensional structure of reconstituted and N-terminal truncated versions of human topoisomerase I (hTop1p) in complex with a 22-bp DNA molecule have shown that the enzyme is organized in multiple domains that “clamp” around the DNA molecule (5Redinbo M.R.

Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Changes in DNA topology are achieved by introducing a transient break in the phosphodiester bond of one strand in the duplex DNA. The phosphodiester bond energy is preserved during catalysis through the formation of a transient covalent phosphotyrosine bond between the catalytic Tyr-723 and the 3′ end of the broken DNA strand. DNA relaxation has been proposed to proceed via “controlled rotation” in which the covalently bound enzyme holds one end of the DNA duplex and allows the end downstream of the cleavage site to rotate around the remaining phosphodiester bond (6Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Top1p is the cellular target of the anti-tumor drug camptothecin (CPT), which reversibly stabilizes the cleavable intermediate complex formed in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme (1Hsiang Y.-H.

Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin Jr., A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). This structure revealed that the drug molecule intercalates between upstream (–1) and downstream (+1) bp, displacing the downstream DNA and thus preventing the religation of the cleaved strand. The structure helps to clarify the role of several, but not all, mutant residues that produce a CPT-resistant enzyme. In particular the structure permits to explain the CPT resistance for mutations involving residues that interact directly with the drug or that would alter the interaction with DNA. However it is not able to explain the CPT resistance for point mutations such as Ala-653 (9Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Glu-418 (10Chang J.Y. Liu J.F. Juang S.H. Liu T.W. Chen L.T.

Among them the Ala-653 mutation in proline (hTop1A653P), residing in the linker domain, is intriguing, because it has been shown that the linker region is required for maximum sensitivity to CPT (12Stewart L.

In this paper, we have investigated the effect of the single A653P mutation through experimental and simulative approaches to clarify the role of the linker domain. The data indicate that the single mutant displays an increased religation rate and a high CPT resistance. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reveals that the substitution renders the linker more flexible, providing a structural dynamical explanation for the experimental results. Materials, Yeast Strains, and Plasmids—Camptothecin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C. M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains JN2–134 (MATα rad52::LEU2, trp1, ade2–1, his7, ura3–52, ise1, top1, leu2) and EKY3 (ura3–52, his3Δ200,leu2Δ1, trpΔ63, top1::TRP1, MATα) were described previously (13Bjornsti M.-A.

Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). To express the htop1 mutant A653P from the pGAL1 promoter, the fragment bearing the mutation was excised from bacterial expression vectors and exchanged for the wild type sequence in YEpGAL1-hTOP1 to yield plasmid YEpGAL1-htop1A653P and for the wild type sequence in YCpGAL1-hTOP1 to yield plasmid YCpGAL1-htop1A653P. The mutant htop1G363C has been described (17Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged construct YEpGAL1-heTOP1 contains the N-terminal sequence DYKDDDY recognized by the M2 monoclonal antibody (9Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To introduce the epitope tag into htop1A653P, the BamHI-SphI fragment containing the tag sequence was excised from the YEpGAL1-heTOP1 plasmid and used to replace the untagged YEpGAL1-htop1A653P to yield the YEpGAL1-hetop1A653P plasmid. The identity of the mutation and the presence of the tag sequence in each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The oligos used for the religation experiment were kindly provided by Mary-Ann Bjornsti, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN. Drug Sensitivity—Cultures of JN2–134 transformed with plasmids YEpGAL1-hTOP1, YEpGAL1-htop1A653P, YEpGAL1-htop1G363C, and YEpGAL1 were grown to an A 595 of 0.3 serially 10-fold diluted and 5 μl spotted onto selective media containing dextrose or galactose. CPT sensitivity was assayed on dextrose plates containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 5 μg/ml CPT. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Cell Viability Assay—Overnight cultures of EKY3 transformed with plasmids YCpGAL1-hTOP1, YCpGAL1-htop1A653P, and YCpGAL1 were diluted 1:100 into selective media containing 2% raffinose. At an A 595 of 0.3 the cultures were induced for 1 h with 2% galactose. After induction cells were treated with 50 μm CPT or 1% Me2SO. At various time points aliquots were serially diluted and plated onto selective media containing 2% dextrose. The number of colonies was counted following incubation at 30 °C and plotted relative to that obtained at time 0 (drug addition). Purification of DNA Topoisomerase I—Purifications of heTOP1p and heTop1A653Pp from galactose-induced EKY3 cells were performed as described (9Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad (Pierce) reagent. 60 μl of the peak fraction used in the experiments was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the levels and integrity were measured in immunoblot assays, using the epitope-specific monoclonal antibody M2. The fractions from heTop1p and heTop1A653Pp used in all the experiments were normalized to have a comparable amount of specific activity based on the relaxation assay in vitro. The inclusion of the epitope had no effect on mutant or wild type enzyme activity, either in solution or in the bead-bound form (data not shown). Proteins epitope-tagged at the N terminus were bound to beads via the epitope-specific M2 monoclonal antibody, as described by Hann et al. (18Hann C.L. Carlberg A.L. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Top1p preparations were incubated in 30 μl of reaction volume containing 0.5 μg of negatively supercoiled plasmid pHC624 DNA and reaction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 100 mm KCl). Reactions were stopped with a final concentration of 0.5% SDS after 1 h at 37 °C. To assess the effects of ionic strength on enzyme activity, 50, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mm KCl was added in the DNA relaxation assay. Each reaction was stopped with a final concentration of 0.5% SDS, and electrophoresis of the samples was carried out in a 1% agarose gel. DNA Cleavage Assay—Cleavage of DNA was assayed by incubating enzyme preparations with a double-stranded DNA fragment, radiolabeled at one unique 3′ end, in the presence or absence of 100 μm CPT. A 900-bp fragment was single 32P-end-labeled and purified from plasmid pBlueAK31 as described (16Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reactions were terminated with 1% SDS, heated at 75 °C for 15 min, and treated with 0.2 μg/ml proteinase K. The cleaved DNA fragments were resolved in 8 m urea/8% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography (16Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Kinetics of Religation Using Oligonucleotide Substrate—Oligonucleotide substrate CL14 (5′-GAAAAAAGACTTAG-3′) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP at its 5′ end. The CP25 complementary strand (5′-TAAAAATTTTTCTAAGTCTTTTTTC-3′) was phosphorylated at its 5′ end with unlabeled ATP. The two strands were annealed at a 2-fold molar excess of CP25 over CL14 by heating to 95 °C for 1 min and cooling to 25 °C in 60 min according to Stewart et al. (12Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The duplex were stored at 4 °C. 20 nm CL14/CP25 was incubated with an excess of enzyme for 60 min at 23 °C followed by 30 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 100 mm KCl. CPT was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. Religation reactions were initiated by adding a 200-fold molar excess of R11 oligonucleotide (5′-AGAAAAATTTT-3′) over the duplex CL14/CP25. At 37 °C at various time point 5-μl aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped with 0.5% SDS. After ethanol precipitation samples were resuspended in 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by denaturing urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The percentage of the remaining covalent complex (cleavage 1) was determined by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software and normalized on the total amount of radioactivity in each lane. The religation rate (kr) was determined by fitting the data, up to 4 min, to the equation ln(%remaining cleavable complex) = 4.605–kr t (12Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

Kinetics of Cleavage Using Oligonucleotide Substrate—The duplex substrate was generated as described above. The suicide cleavage reactions were carried out by incubating 20 nm of the duplex with an excess of enzyme in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 100 mm KCl at 23 °C in a final volume of 50 μl as described in Yang et al. (35Yang Z. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A 5-μl sample of the reaction mixture before the addition of the protein was removed and used as the zero time point. At various time points 5-μl aliquots were removed and stopped with 0.5% SDS. After ethanol precipitation samples were resuspended in 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by denaturing urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The percentage of cleavage 1 was determined by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software and normalized on the total amount of radioactivity in each lane. MD Simulation—The starting coordinates of the linker domain (residues 636–712) were extracted from those of DNA topoisomerase I obtained from x-ray diffraction (Protein Data Bank entry 1A36) (5Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The five residues constituting the loop region that connects the linker to the core domain (residues 636–640), which are lacking in the Protein Data Bank structure because of thermal fluctuation, were added to the linker domain by molecular modeling. The spatial environment of each new residue was checked for close contact or overlap with neighboring residues, and stereochemical regularization of the structures was obtained by the Powell minimization method implemented in the SYBYL program (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The residue Ala-653 was changed into proline to generate the mutant linker, and the dihedral angles of the substituted residue were repaired and adapted to the introduced stereochemical constraint. Model building and molecular mechanics were carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 R5000 SC using the version 6.2 of the SYBYL program. The system topology was built using the AMBER leap module and the AMBER95 all atom force field (22Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Kenneth M. Merz J. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kolman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11687) Google Scholar). The system was immersed in a rectangular box (wild type, 49 × 87 × 47 Å3; mutant, 51 × 93 × 50 Å3) filled with TIP3P (23Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30918) Google Scholar) water molecules imposing a minimum solute-wall box of 10 Å. The system was neutralized with Cl– anions using the AMBER leap module. The resulting total systems were composed by the following: wild type: 1286 protein atoms, seven Cl– counterions, and 5377 water molecules, giving a total of 17424 atoms; mutant: 1290 protein atoms, seven Cl– counterions, and 5634 water molecules, giving a total of 18199 atoms. The system was simulated in periodic boundary conditions, using a cutoff radius of 9 Å for the non-bonded interactions and updating the neighbor pair list every 10 steps. The electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle Mesh Ewald method (24Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21714) Google Scholar, 25Cheatham T.E. Miller J.L. Fox T Darden T.A. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 4193-4194Crossref Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The SHAKE algorithm (26Ryckaert J.-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17344) Google Scholar) was used to constrain all bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms. Optimization and relaxation of solvent and ions were initially performed keeping the solute atoms constrained to their initial position with decreasing force constants of 500, 25, 15, and 5 kcal/(mol Å), whereas the linker N-terminal and C-terminal residues (Pro-636 and Lys-712) were kept constrained on their initial positions for the whole simulation, with a force of 500 kcal/(mol Å). Thereafter the system was minimized without any constraint, simulated for 1 ps at 100 K, and then warmed up to 300 K and equilibrated over 60 ps. A 1.0-ns simulation was carried out at constant temperature of 300 K using the method of Berendsen et al. (27Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gusteren W.F. Di Nola A. Haak J.R. J. Comput. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Google Scholar), at a constant pressure of one bar with a 2-fs time step, on a four-processors UNIX server Origin 200 SGI. Pressure and temperature coupling constants were 0.5 ps. The atomic positions of the last nanosecond of trajectories were saved every 100 steps (0.2 ps) for analysis. To better quantify the mobility of the mutated linker domain we have superimposed the MD conformations over the three-dimensional structure of the DNA-Top1 covalent complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1A36). Deviation of the linker domain from the starting structure has been evaluated by measuring the dihedral angle defined by four geometric points: a, the geometric center (centroid) between nucleotides Thr-22 and Ala-101; b, the centroid between nucleotides Ala-16 and Thr-107; c, the centroid between residues Pro-636 and Lys-712; d, the centroid between residues Leu-658 and Leu-94. The Catalytic Active Mutant hTop1A653P Is Resistant to CPT—We have previously described in Fiorani et al. (9Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) a yeast S. cerevisiae genetic screen for catalytically active CPT-resistant hTop1 mutants. Briefly JN2–134 (rad52Δ) cells tolerate galactose induced hTop1 expression from a single copy vector, but exhibit decreased viability when the enzyme is expressed from pGAL1 on a multicopy vector. The leaky expression from the same multicopy vector is sufficient to render JN2–134 sensitive to CPT. Thus catalytically active CPT-resistant hTop1 mutants may be selected by replica plating CPT-resistant colonies on galactose plates and identifying the inviable cells. Fig. 1 (panel A) shows the result of the yeast screen for the hTOP1 and the htop1A653P and htop1G363C mutants. This latter mutant was used as control, because it was already shown to be CPT-resistant (17Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicate that substitution of Ala-653 with proline confers CPT resistance, and the mutant retains sufficient catalytic activity in vivo to kill yeast strain JN2–134 when is overexpressed in the presence of galactose. Indication of CPT resistance of the mutant was also obtained from a cell viability assay in liquid culture carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in the graph of Fig. 1 (panel B) cells expressing the htop1A653P mutant in the presence of 50 μm CPT exhibit a more than 100-fold resistance, when compared with the cells expressing hTOP1 in the same conditions. To better characterize the catalytic activity of the mutant and to exclude that the cellular resistance to CPT is because of a reduction in catalytic activity a functional assay of hTop1A653Pp was carried out in vitro. Equal protein concentrations of hTop1p and hTop1A653Pp were serially diluted and incubated with supercoiled plasmid DNA to assess their ability to relax a supercoiled plasmid. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (panel C) the mutant hTop1A653Pp is active in vitro although, when compared with hTop1p under standard conditions, a 5- to 10-fold reduction in activity can be estimated. The catalytic activity of hTop1A653Pp is more sensitive to high ionic strength than the wild type enzyme. In fact the activity of hTop1A653Pp drops when the concentration of KCl is higher than 150 mm, whereas hTop1p is able to relax supercoiled DNA up to 300 mm KCl (data not shown), indicating that the single mutation on the linker domain is able to perturb the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme and DNA. Similar ionic strength sensitivity has been reported for the two reconstituted enzymes, topo58/12, in which the linker domain is not covalent bound to the core subdomain III, and topo58/6.3, in which the linker domain is completely deleted (28Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Effect of CPT on the Cleavage-religation Equilibrium—To assess the level and mechanism of camptothecin resistance displayed by the hTop1A653Pp, the stability of the covalent DNA-enzyme complex has been analyzed. Increasing concentrations of hTop1 and hTop1A653P proteins have been incubated with a 3′ end-labeled DNA fragment, in the presence or absence of 100 μm CPT. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the cleavable complexes have been trapped with SDS/proteinase K treatment, and the cleaved DNA fragments were resolved in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). Increasing protein concentrations have been used to be sure that the entire DNA is bound to the enzyme so that the amount of cleavage can be taken as an approximate measure of the cleavage-religation equilibrium (12Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When wild type hTop1p is incubated without CPT (lanes 1–4), a very small level of cleavage of the labeled DNA strand is detected at the preferred DNA cleavage site, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2 (29Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). When hTop1p is exposed to CPT, a dramatic increase in cleaved DNA fragments is observed (lanes 5–8) indicating that the equilibrium is shifted toward cleavage. In the case of hTop1A653Pp in the absence of the drug (lanes 9-12) no cleavage of the labeled DNA strand is observed, indicating that the mutant enzyme is so fast in the religation step that no cleavage can be detected. The low level of cleavage observed in the presence of the CPT (lanes 13–16) confirms this latter hypothesis indicating that the equilibrium is still shifted toward religation. However some cleavage occurs in the presence of CPT for the htop1A653Pp, providing a direct evidence for CPT binding to the mutant and indicating that the cleavage-religation equilibrium of the hTop1A653Pp is close to that of the wild type enzyme in the absence of CPT. Analysis of the Religation Rate Using a Suicide Substrate—To understand how CPT affects the cleavage-religation equilibrium in the case of the hTop1A653Pp an experiment that directly measures the religation rate has been performed. The oligonucleotide substrate CL14 (5′-GAAAAAAGACTTAG-3′), containing a preferred cleavage site for hTop1p, was radiolabeled at its 5′ end and annealed to the CP25 complementary strand (5′-TAAAAATTTTTCTAAGTCTTTTTTC-3′) to generate a suicide cleavage substrate (12Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This suicide cleavage substrate has been incubated with an excess of hTop1 and hTop1A653P enzymes to allow suicide cleavage to proceed to completion. 200-fold molar excess of R11 oligonucleotide (5′-AGAAAAATTTT-3′) was added in the absence and presence of CPT, and aliquots have been removed and analyzed at different times on urea-polyacrylamide gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A typical experiment in the absence and presence of CPT is shown in Fig. 3. The percentage of the remaining covalent complex (cleavage 1) was determined and plotted in Fig. 4. The data show a 3-fold increase in the religation rate kr for the hTop1A653Pp compared with the wild type enzyme, in the absence of CPT. The presence of CPT, as expected, dramatically decreases the religation rate in the wild type protein, whereas an analogous effect is not observed in the case of the hTop1A653Pp, confirming its CPT resistance.Fig. 4Kinetics of religation for hTop1p and hTop1A653Pp. The percentage of the remaining covalent complex [%norm = (%complex) t /(%complex)t = 0] is plotted against time for the hTop1p and hTop1A653Pp (full and dotted line, respectively), in the absence (open symbols) and presence (filled symbols) of 50 μm CPT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the Cleavage Rate Using a Suicide Substrate—A suicide cleavage substrate, identical to the one described in the religation reaction, has been incubated with an excess of hTop1p and hTop1A653Pp in a time course experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2029945172,"Brk (PTK6) is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, which is expressed in over 60% of breast carcinoma tissue samples and breast tumour cell lines, but not normal mammary tissue or benign lesions. Since experimental Brk expression in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells enhances their mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor, it was important to determine the role Brk plays in the proliferation of breast carcinoma cells and validate it as a therapeutic target. We have used RNA interference to efficiently and specifically downregulate Brk protein levels in breast carcinoma cells, and determined that this results in a significant suppression of their proliferation. Additionally, through the expression of a kinase-inactive mutant, we have determined that Brk can mediate promotion of proliferation via a kinase-independent mechanism, potentially functioning as an ‘adapter’. These data identify Brk as a novel target for antiproliferative therapy in the majority of breast cancers, and illustrate the power of RNA interference for rapidly validating candidate therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1981852948,"BAG-1 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with a wide range of cellular targets including heat-shock proteins and some nuclear hormone receptors. BAG-1 exists as three major isoforms, BAG-1L, BAG-1M and BAG-1S. BAG-1L contains a nuclear localization signal, which is not present in the other isoforms, and is predominantly localized in the cell nucleus. Here we have investigated the effects of BAG-1 on function of the oestrogen receptor (ER), a key growth control molecule and target for hormonal therapy in breast cancer. We demonstrate that BAG-1L, but not BAG-1S or BAG-1M, increased oestrogen-dependent transcription in breast cancer cells. BAG-1L interacted with and stimulated the activity of both ER α and β. Although BAG-1L and ERs colocalize to the nucleus, fusing BAG-1S to an heterologous nuclear localization sequence was not sufficient to stimulate transcription. Consistent with an important effect on receptor function, nuclear BAG-1 expression in breast cancers was associated with expression of the progesterone receptor, a transcriptional target of ERα, and was associated with improved survival in patients treated with hormonal therapy. These data suggest that BAG-1L is an important determinant of ER function in vitro and in human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1984386216,"The AP-1 transcription factor is composed of members of the Fos, Jun and ATF families, and plays a key role in tumor progression. We investigated whether Fos proteins regulate cell motility, and if so, whether this capacity is related to their transactivation potential. Two cell lines with different expression profiles of AP-1 were employed focusing on the Fos-family members c-Fos, Fra-1 and Fra-2. Transactivation motifs are found in c-Fos, but not in Fra-1 or Fra-2. The adenocarcinoma CSML0 cells display a low motility and do not express Fra-1 or Fra-2, and only very little c-Fos. In contrast, the fibroblastoid L929 cells express both Fra-1 and Fra-2, but no c-Fos, and these cells display a high motility. Transfection with Fra-1 or c-Fos, but not with Fra-2, strongly enhanced the motility of CSML0 cells. The effect of Fra-1 required the presence of the N-terminal domain of this protein. Conversely, transfection with a Fos dominant-negative mutant or with anti-sense fra-1 or fra-2, strongly reduced the motility of L929 cells. Changes in cell motility correlated with the morphological appearance and the degree of contact with the substratum. We conclude that Fos proteins have distinct roles in the regulation of cell motility."

We document the divalent cation dependence and specificity of SpCdk9/Pch1, its NTP dependence and specificity, the dependence of Spt5-CTD phosphorylation on the number of tandem nonamer repeats, and the specificity for phosphorylation of the Spt5-CTD on threonine at position 1 within the nonamer element. SpCdk9/Pch1 also phosphorylates the CTD heptaptide repeat array of the largest subunit of S. pombe RNA polymerase II (consensus sequence YSPTSPS) and does so exclusively on serine. SpCdk9/Pch1 catalyzes autophosphorylation of the kinase and cyclin subunits of the kinase complex. The distribution of phosphorylation sites on SpCdk9 (86% Ser(P), 11% Thr(P), 3% Tyr(P)) is distinct from that on Pch1 (2% Ser(P), 98% Thr(P)). We conducted a structure-guided mutational analysis of SpCdk9, whereby a total of 29 new mutations of 12 conserved residues were tested for in vivo function by complementation of a yeast bur1Δ mutant. We identified many lethal and conditional mutations of side chains implicated in binding ATP and the divalent cation cofactor, phosphoacceptor substrate recognition, and T-loop dynamics. We surmise that the lethality of the of T212A mutation in the T-loop reflects an essential phosphorylation event, insofar as the conservative T212S change rescued wild-type growth; the phosphomimetic T212E change rescued growth at 30 °C; and the effects of mutating the T-loop threonine were phenocopied by mutations in the three conserved arginines predicted to chelate the phosphate on the T-loop threonine.

II is regulated by phosphorylation of several of the protein components of the transcription apparatus (1Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II has been the focus of much attention because the CTD acts as an essential scaffold for the binding of macromolecular assemblies that regulate mRNA synthesis and cotranscriptional mRNA processing (2Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar). The pol II CTD is composed of a heptapeptide motif of consensus sequence YSPTSPS repeated in tandem. The mammalian pol II CTD has 52 heptad repeats, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe CTD has 29 repeats, and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTD has 26 copies. The pol II CTD undergoes a cycle of extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at positions Ser5 and Ser2, which is coordinated with the transcription cycle (3Prelich G. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Multiple CTD kinases are present in eukaryotic cells, e.g. budding yeast has four CTD kinases, two of which (Kin28 and Bur1) are essential (3Prelich G. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CTD kinases are heteromeric enzymes consisting of a cyclin subunit plus a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) subunit. The essential Bur1 Cdk of budding yeast and its cyclin partner Bur2 are putative orthologs of the Cdk9 and cyclin T subunits of the metazoan protein kinase P-TEFb (4Yao S. Neimann A. Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Murray S. Udupam R. Yao S. Hartzog G. Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is a transcription elongation factor that overrides the negative actions of Spt5 and its associated factors. Metazoan Spt5, with its binding partner Spt4 and a second factor NELF, arrests pol II elongation at promoter-proximal positions (6Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S.

Escape from the elongation delay depends on the kinase activity of P-TEFb, which phosphorylates both the pol II CTD and Spt5 (8Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 312: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Spt5 was initially suggested to have negative and positive effects on elongation (6Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 14Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), but several recent studies underscore a negative role for Spt5 during transcription elongation in vivo which is reversed by Cdk9/cyclin T (8Renner D.B.

One potential role for phosphorylation of Spt5 by Cdk9 may be to modulate Spt5 function, e.g. converting it from a negative elongation factor into a positive factor. Although the rationale for the arrest and Cdk9-dependent restart of pol II elongation is still not clear, recent studies suggest a connection to mRNA 5′-capping, which is coupled to transcription elongation via physical and functional interactions among the cap-forming enzymes, the phosphorylated pol II CTD, and Spt5 (18McCracken S.

Spt5 binds directly to the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of the capping apparatus in mammals and in the fission yeast S. pombe (27Wen Y. Shatkin A.J.

Connections between capping enzymes and Spt5 have also been reported in S. cerevisiae (29Lindstrom D.L. Squazzo S.L. Muster N. Burckin T.A. Wachter K.C. Emigh C.A. McCleery J.A. Yates J.R. Hartzog G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1368-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The interactions of the S. pombe triphosphatase (Pct1) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1) enzymes have been studied in vivo and in vitro using two-hybrid assays and purified recombinant proteins, respectively (28Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19639-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pce1 and Pct1 bind directly and independently to the unmodified CTD domain of Spt5, which consists of tandem repeats of a nonapeptide motif of consensus sequence TPAWNSGSK (28Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19639-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We recently described a physical interaction between S. pombe RNA triphosphatase and SpCdk9, a fission yeast homolog of metazoan Cdk9 and S. cerevisiae Bur1 (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Initial studies of SpCdk9 included the identification of the essential S. pombe cyclin Pch1 as its binding partner. Pch1 is a homolog of metazoan cyclin T and S. cerevisiae cyclin Bur2. Complementation of the S. cerevisiae bur1Δ and bur2Δ mutants by coexpression of SpCdk9 and Pch1 showed that the fission yeast proteins are genuine orthologs of Bur1/Bur2, a putative fungal P-TEFb. Analysis of the recombinant SpCdk9/Pch1 complex produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells showed that the S. pombe proteins comprise a bona fide protein kinase with a heterodimeric quaternary structure (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The capacity of SpCdk9/Pch1 to phosphorylate the CTD arrays of both pol II and Spt5 in vitro echoed the substrate specificity of metazoan P-TEFb (11Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell.

These findings suggested a model whereby Spt5-induced arrest of early elongation ensures a temporal window for recruitment of the capping enzymes, which in turn attract Cdk9 to alleviate the arrest via phosphorylation of one or more components of the pol II elongation complex (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here, we present a biochemical and molecular genetic characterization of the fission yeast SpCdk9/Pch1 kinase complex. The biochemical characterization focuses on delineation of the reaction requirements, optima, and kinetic parameters for SpCdk9/Pch1-mediated phosphorylation of the Spt5-CTD. This event has received less attention from the enzymatic perspective than pol II CTD phosphorylation and is of interest in light of the unique structure of the CTD nonamer array of S. pombe Spt5 and its interaction with mRNA processing enzymes. We exploit budding yeast as a surrogate genetic system to perform an extensive mutational analysis of SpCdk9 guided by the crystal structure of the activated Cdk2/cyclin A-substrate complex (33Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Our results illuminate structure-activity relationships at the active site and a requirement for phosphorylation of the T-loop for SpCdk9 function in yeast. Protein Kinase Assay—The SpCdk9/His-Pch1 kinase complex was isolated from Sf9 insect cells coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing SpCdk9 or His-Pch1 by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kinase reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MnCl2 or 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 4 μg of GST-Spt5(801–990) containing the C-terminal nonapeptide repeat array of S. pombe Spt5, and SpCdk9/His-Pch1 were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C. The reactions were halted by adding SDS to 1% final concentration. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Phosphorylated polypeptides were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 PhosphorImager. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—A kinase reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MnCl2 or 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 60 μg of GST-Spt5(801–898), and 3 μg of SpCdk9/Pch1 complex was incubated for 2 h at 22 °C, then supplemented with 300 μl of binding buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100) and 50 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads. The 32P-labeled GST-Spt5(801–989) was adsorbed to the beads during a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer A to remove the free [γ-32P]ATP. After the third wash, the bound protein was eluted with 100 μl of 10 mm glutathione. The eluted protein was hydrolyzed by adding 100 μl of concentrated HCl and then heating the mixture at 110 °C for 2 h. The acid hydrolysate was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. The sample was resuspended in 10 μl of water. An aliquot was mixed with unlabeled Tyr(P), Thr(P), and Ser(P) markers (Sigma) and spotted onto a cellulose thin layer plate. The phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage electrophoresis in pyridine acetate (pH 3.5) (34van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by staining the plate with ninhydrin; 32P-labeled material was visualized by autoradiography. 32P-Labeled phosphoamino acid analysis of autophosphorylated SpCdk9 and Pch1 was performed as follows. Reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of SpCdk9/Pch1 complex were incubated for 2 h at 22 °C, then supplemented with 300 μl of binding buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm imidazole, and 0.0025% Tween 20) and 50 μl of nickel-agarose beads. The phosphorylated products were absorbed to the beads during a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer B. After the third wash, the bound protein was eluted with 30 μl of binding buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane-bound radiolabeled SpCdk9 and Pch1 polypeptides were localized by autoradiography and excised. The membrane slices were incubated in 6 n HCl for 2 h at 110 °C and then analyzed by high voltage thin layer electrophoresis. Site-directed Mutagenesis of SpCdk9 —Plasmid pYX-SpCDK9 (CEN TRP1) contains the cDNA encoding full-length wild-type SpCdk9 under the control of the S. cerevisiae TPI1 promoter (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitution mutations were introduced into the SpCDK9 gene by two-stage overlap extension PCR. The mutated PCR products were digested with NcoI and HindIII and inserted into NcoI/HindIII-digested pYX-SpCDK9 in lieu of the wild-type gene fragment. The inserts of the mutant plasmids were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes during amplification or cloning. Test of SpCdk9 Activity in Vivo by Plasmid Shuffle in S. cerevisiae— The BUR1 gene was deleted in the S. cerevisiae diploid strain W303 and replaced with a cassette specifying kanamycin resistance as described previously (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sporulation of the BUR1 bur1::kanR diploid that had been transformed with plasmid p360-BUR1 (BUR1 URA3 CEN) yielded viable bur1::kanR haploids that were incapable of growth in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), a drug that selects against the BUR1 URA3 plasmid. A Mat a haploid of the bur1Δ strain was cotransformed with pYX-SpCDK9 (CEN TRP1 SpCDK9) containing wild-type or mutant SpCDK9 alleles and with plasmid pYX-PCH1 (CEN ADE2 PCH1) containing the full-length cDNA encoding Pch1 driven by the TP11 promoter (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Individual transformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan and adenine. Colonies were patched on drop-out medium and then streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-FOA. Lethal mutations were those that failed to support growth after incubation on 5-FOA agar for 7 days 30 °C. The viable 5-FOA-resistant colonies containing mutated SpCDK9 genes were patched to YPD agar at 30 °C and then tested for growth on YPD agar at 18, 23, 30, and 37 °C. Growth was assessed as follows: +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-type SpCDK9; ++ denotes reduced colony size; + indicates that only pinpoint colonies were formed.; – indicates no growth. Spt5-CTD Kinase Activity of the Fission Yeast Cdk9/Pch1 Complex—Recombinant SpCdk9/Pch1 catalyzed the transfer of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP to the CTD of S. pombe Spt5, which spans amino acids 801–990 and consists of 18 tandem repeats of a nonapeptide motif (consensus sequence TPAWNSGSK) (Fig. 1A). SpCdk9/Pch1 phosphorylated the nonamer array of Spt5 in the context of a GST-Spt5 fusion protein (Fig. 1C) or as tag-free Spt5(801–990) (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). No phosphoryl transfer was detected to GST alone (Fig. 1C) or to histone H1 (30Pei Y. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7180-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled GST-Spt5-CTD-PO4 product is detectable by SDS-PAGE analysis and can be quantified by scanning the gel with a PhosphorImager. Initial experiments showed that the extent of the kinase reaction was severalfold higher in the presence of MnCl2 than MgCl2 (Fig. 1C). Divalent Cation Dependence and Specificity—Phosphorylation of Spt5-CTD by SpCdk9/Pch1 required a divalent cation cofactor (Fig. 2A). Protein kinase activity was proportional to magnesium concentration in the range of 0.6–2.5 mm and plateaued at 5–10 mm. Manganese was a superior cofactor at all concentrations tested; activity was optimal at 0.6–10 mm MnCl2 (Fig. 2A). Cobalt (10 mm) supported kinase activity, albeit less effectively than manganese or magnesium (Fig. 2B). Other divalent cations were tested for cofactor activity at 10 mm concentration (Fig. 2B) and for their effects on activity in reactions containing 2.5 mm manganese (Fig. 2C). Whereas calcium neither activated nor inhibited SpCdk9/Pch1, copper and zinc were unable to support activity and were profoundly inhibitory in the presence of manganese. Effect of pH—The phosphorylation of Spt5-CTD by SpCdk9/Pch1 in the presence of manganese was optimal at pH 6.0–7.0 in Tris acetate buffer and at pH 6.0–8.0 in Tris-HCl buffer (Fig. 3A). We calculated that 0.6 pmol of phosphate was incorporated per pmol of input Spt5 protein at optimal pH. The manganese-dependent kinase activity was abolished at pH ≤4.5 or ≥9.0. The activity of SpCdk9/Pch1 in magnesium was also optimal at pH 6.0–7.0 in Tris acetate buffer and declined as the pH was incrementally acidified (Fig. 3B), just as was seen in the manganese-dependent reaction. However, the magnesium-dependent reaction was apparently insensitive to inhibition at alkaline pH, insofar as activity in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 9.5 was ∼65% of the activity in this buffer at the optimal pH of 6.0–6.5 (Fig. 3B). Kinetic Parameters, Nucleotide Specificity, and Inhibition by Salt—The transfer of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP to the Spt5-CTD increased with reaction time up to 80 min; the initial rate was severalfold higher in manganese than magnesium, and the extent of product formation remained severalfold higher in manganese at all times tested (Fig. 4A). Kinase activity was proportional to the amount of Spt5(801–990) phosphate acceptor protein included in the reaction in the range of 0.06–2 μg of Spt5-CTD and began to level off at higher Spt5-CTD concentrations (Fig. 4B). From a double-reciprocal plot of the data in Fig. 4B, we calculated a Km value of 3 μm Spt5-CTD. The kinase activity was proportional to the ATP concentration in the range of 2–12 μm and saturated at 40–50 μm (Fig. 5A). A double-reciprocal plot of the data yielded a Km of 10 μm ATP (Fig. 5B). SpCdk9/Pch1 was also capable of catalyzing the transfer of 32Pi from [γ-32P]GTP to the Spt5-CTD (Fig. 5C). The extent of 32P incorporation was comparable with 50 μm GTP and 50 μm ATP in the presence of manganese. Although both the GTP- and ATP-dependent kinase activities were reduced when magnesium replaced manganese, the GTP-dependent activity was more sensitive to the switch in metal cofactor (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylation of Spt5 was inhibited by increasing the ionic strength of the reaction mixture with either NaCl or NH4Cl (Fig. 4C). Activity was inhibited by 50% at ∼150 mm concentration of either salt; there was 20% residual kinase activity in a reaction containing 500 mm added NaCl and 10% activity in 500 mm NH4Cl (Fig. 4C).Fig. 5ATP dependence and nucleotide specificity of SpCdk9/Pch1 kinase activity.

SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified GST-Spt5 substrates is shown in Fig. 1B and reveals the expected decrements in electrophoretic mobility as the CTD was truncated incrementally. The extent of manganese-dependent phosphorylation of the 10-repeat substrate (43 pmol) was similar to that of the full CTD array (45 pmol), which implies that the amino-terminal half of the CTD sufficed as a phosphate acceptor (Fig. 1C). The extent of phosphorylation of the 6-repeat array (22 pmol) was half that of the 10-repeat array. Taking into account that the number of potential phosphorylation sites within the 10-repeat CTD (10 threonines and 11 serines) is nearly twice that of the 6-repeat array (6 threonines and 6 serines), we surmise that the 6-repeat CTD is also an effective phosphate acceptor on a molar basis. The steep decline in the extent of phosphorylation of the 4-repeat CTD substrate (4 pmol of 32P incorporation) was disproportionate to the reduction in the number of potential phosphorylation sites (4 threonines and 5 serines) compared with the 6-repeat CTD. Thus, we conclude that 6 nonamer repeats suffice for effective phosphorylation of the Spt5-CTD in the presence of manganese. A similar relationship between kinase activity and CTD length was observed with magnesium as the cofactor, except that the decrement in activity between the 10-repeat and 6-repeat substrates was 3-fold instead of 2-fold as with manganese (Fig. 1C). SpCdk9/Pch1 Phosphorylates Spt5 on Threonine within the CTD Nonamer Repeat—GST-Spt5(801–898) phosphorylated in vitro by SpCdk9/Pch1 in the presence of 2.5 mm manganese was isolated free of [γ-32P]ATP and the kinase by adsorption to GSH-Sepharose and elution with GSH. The protein was subjected to acid hydrolysis, and the 32P-labeled phosphoamino acid content of the hydrolysate was gauged by high voltage electrophoresis under conditions designed to separate Tyr(P), Thr(P), and Ser(P) (Fig. 1D). This analysis showed that SpCdk9/Pch1 phosphorylated Spt5 exclusively on threonine and not on serine. SpCdk9/Pch1 also phosphorylated Spt5 exclusively on threonine when the kinase reactions were performed with 10 mm magnesium as the cofactor (data not shown). As noted above, the CTD substrate composed of 10 nonamer repeats contains 10 threonines and 11 serines, but no tyrosines. We surmise that Thr1 of the nonamer consensus sequence 1TPAWNSGSK9 is the target of the SpCdk9/Pch1 kinase. SpCdk9/Pch1 Phosphorylation of the S. pombe pol II CTD on Serine—We compared the kinase activity of SpCdk9/Pch1 with GST-fused phosphate acceptors containing either the CTD nonamer array of S. pombe Spt5 or the complete CTD of S. pombe pol II, which consists of 29 heptapeptide repeats. The extent of phosphorylation of the Spt5-CTD was 5–8-fold higher than that of the S. pombe pol II CTD in the presence of manganese or magnesium (data not shown). Phosphorylation of the S. pombe pol II CTD by SpCdk9/Pch1 was 2-fold more effective with 2.5 mm manganese than with 10 mm magnesium (data not sh"

https://openalex.org/W2148682389,"Sodium butyrate (NaB) inhibits proliferation, stimulates apoptosis, and promotes differentiation of human colon cancer cells along the absorptive phenotype. In vitro, butyrate induces a switch from cells with a secretory to an absorptive phenotype. Here, we report that NaB specifically represses the expression of the MUC2 gene, a differentiation marker of the secretory goblet cell lineage, in forskolin- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced HT29 cells, and Cl.16E cells, a clonal derivative of HT29 cells that spontaneously differentiates into goblet cells. Thus, NaB repression is independent of the nature of the stimulus that triggers MUC2 expression. Further, repression was independent of new protein synthesis. Our results suggest that inhibition of MUC2 is linked to the ability of butyrate to repress histone deacetylase activity, since trichostatin A, another inhibitor of histone deacetylases, also inhibited MUC2 expression in induced HT29 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the NaB effect is specific for this marker of the secretory cell lineage, since carcinoembryonic antigen, which is expressed in both the secretory and absorptive cells, is induced by NaB. Thus, the NaB repression of a definitive function of the secretory cell lineage is a further mechanism, in addition to the effects on proliferation and apoptotic pathways, through which butyrate can regulate intestinal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1981699322,"Aging in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is under the control of multiple pathways. The production and accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) is one pathway that has been proposed to bring about aging in yeast. To test this proposal, we have developed a plasmid-based model system to study the role of DNA episomes in reduction of yeast life span. Recombinant plasmids containing different replication origins, cis-acting partitioning elements, and selectable marker genes were constructed and analyzed for their effects on yeast replicative life span. Plasmids containing the ARS1 replication origin reduce life span to the greatest extent of the plasmids analyzed. This reduction in life span is partially suppressed by a CEN4 centromeric element on ARS1 plasmids. Plasmids containing a replication origin from the endogenous yeast 2 μ circle also reduce life span, but to a lesser extent than ARS1 plasmids. Consistent with this, ARS1 and 2 μ origin plasmids accumulate in ∼7-generation-old cells, but ARS1/CEN4 plasmids do not. Importantly, ARS1 plasmids accumulate to higher levels in old cells than 2 μ origin plasmids, suggesting a correlation between plasmid accumulation and life span reduction. Reduction in life span is neither an indirect effect of increased ERC levels nor the result of stochastic cessation of growth. The presence of a fully functional 9.1-kb rDNA repeat on plasmids is not required for, and does not augment, reduction in life span. These findings support the view that accumulation of DNA episomes, including episomes such as ERCs, cause cell senescence in yeast.

These findings support the view that accumulation of DNA episomes, including episomes such as ERCs, cause cell senescence in yeast. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proved to be a valuable model organism for investigating mechanisms of cellular aging (recently reviewed in Refs. 21Jazwinski S.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 769-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Sinclair D.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, and 48Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Central to the biology of aging in S. cerevisiae is an asymmetric cell division process that gives rise to mother and daughter cells with different characteristics. Mother cells have a limited capacity to produce daughter cells, and the decline in this capacity with each generation is referred to as replicative aging. The limited replicative potential of yeast mother cells has been recognized since the 1950s (35Mortimer R.K. Johnson J.R. Nature. 1959; 183: 1751-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Pioneering studies in the Jazwinski and Guarente laboratories (13Egilmez N.K. Jazwinski S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24Kennedy B.K. Austriaco Jr., N.R. Guarente L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1985-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) postulated the existence of a senescence factor/substance that accumulates in mother cells and is transmissible to daughters. Work in the Guarente laboratory identified a heritable “age” locus that regulates yeast life span (25Kennedy B.K. Austriaco Jr., N.R. Zhang J. Guarente L. Cell. 1995; 80: 485-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). More recent studies have made clear that allelic variation at single genetic loci can markedly affect yeast life span, including extension of life span. This indicates that a process as complex as cellular aging is controlled by a hierarchical regulatory system. As in other model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations that influence yeast life span have been found to exert their effects through different physiological and genetic pathways, including those that participate in caloric restriction, gene silencing, genomic stability, growth regulation, mitochondrial function, and stress response (11Costa V. Moradas-Ferreira P. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21Jazwinski S.M. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 2002; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Replicative aging is undoubtedly a complex process, even in a eukaryote as simple as S. cerevisiae, and different hypotheses have been proposed to explain yeast replicative aging. One hypothesis proposed by Sinclair and Guarente (46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) posits that replicative aging is caused by progressive accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) 1The abbreviations used are: ERC, extrachromosomal rDNA circle; rDNA, ribosomal DNA; rRNA, ribosomal RNA. in yeast mother cells. According to this model, ERCs are produced stochastically by intrachromosomal homologous recombination at the rDNA locus and are inherited asymmetrically by mother cells, which leads to ERC accumulation and replicative senescence. The rDNA locus in S. cerevisiae consists of a tandem array of ∼150 9.1-kb direct repeats, each of which encodes the four rRNAs (18, 5.8, 25, and 5 S) in precursor form. Many aspects of the ERC model have been supported experimentally. Numerous studies support the view that ERCs are produced by homologous recombination, are self-replicating, are inherited asymmetrically, and accumulate in mother cells (reviewed in Refs. 44Sinclair D. Mills K. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 533-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45Sinclair D.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). More controversial is the role ERCs play in the aging process. Are ERCs “mediators” or “markers” of yeast aging? Certain findings link ERC production with regulation of life span and support a “mediator” role for ERCs. One of the first life span-extending mutations characterized in yeast (SIR4–42) was found to redirect Sir (silent information regulator) protein complexes to the rDNA locus and limit recombination (25Kennedy B.K. Austriaco Jr., N.R. Zhang J. Guarente L. Cell. 1995; 80: 485-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 26Kennedy B.K. Gotta M. Sinclair D.A. Mills K. McNabb D.S. Murthy M. Pak S.M. Laroche T. Gasser S.M. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 89: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Expression of SIR2, which encodes a nucleolar NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, correlates with longevity. Sir2p binds to rDNA and suppresses rDNA recombination and ERC production (14Fritze C.E. Verschueren K. Strich R. Easton Esposito R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6495-6509Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 17Gotta M. Strahlbolsinger S. Renauld H. Laroche T. Kennedy B.K. Grunstein M.

Deletion of SIR2 shortens life span, whereas overexpression of SIR2 extends life span (23Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). FOB1 encodes a nucleolar “fork blocking” protein that binds to the replication fork barrier site in rDNA and in so doing halts DNA replication in the direction opposite of pre-35 S rRNA transcription (4Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 637-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 5Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W.L.

The replication fork barrier site and the overlapping HOT1 site promote rDNA recombination (29Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 49Ward T.R. Hoang M.L. Prusty R. Lau C.K. Keil R.L. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mutations in or deletion of FOB1 reduces rDNA recombination, lowers ERC levels, and extends life span (12Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recombination of replication forks stalled at replication fork barrier sites is suppressed by Sir2p (2Benguria A. Hernandez P. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which explains, at least in part, the role of Sir2-dependent silencing in extending life span. Also, the introduction of a plasmid carrying a stretch of rDNA, as an “artificial” ERC, was shown to reduce life span (46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ERCs have been interpreted as a “marker” of aging that are a consequence, not a cause, of aging. Mutations that impair DNA replication, recombination, or repair have been observed to reduce life span without concomitant accumulation of ERCs (31Mays Hoopes L.L. Budd M. Choe W. Weitao T. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4136-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Merker R.J. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell.

However, reduction in life span may be the result of the combined effects of age-dependent and age-independent processes at work in certain mutants. hrm1Δ mutants, which affect rDNA recombination, age prematurely due to a combination of the normal aging process and a G2-like cell cycle arrest (33Merker R.J. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, sgs1 mutants exhibit a shortened life span because of the combined effects of the normal aging process and cell cycle arrest due to defective recombination (32McVey M. Kaeberlein M. Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some petite mutants have been shown to have elevated ERC levels (10Conrad-Webb H. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2420-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but extended life spans (28Kirchman P.A. Kim S. Lai C.Y. Jazwinski S.M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 179-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, both elevated ERC levels and extended life span in petite mutants have not been demonstrated side by side in the same strain. A sir2 mutant with an extended life span was reported to have normal ERC levels (27Kim S. Benguria A. Lai C.Y. Jazwinski S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). More generally, the effects of SIR2 on life span have been attributed to altered patterns of gene expression, including altered transcription of rDNA, which may lead to an imbalance in ribosome synthesis (19Jazwinski S.M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 506-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Jazwinski S.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, although there is agreement that the rDNA locus plays a key role in the yeast aging process, the precise role of extrachromosomal DNAs remains controversial. To shed light on this controversy, we have developed a plasmid-based model system to investigate the role of episomal DNAs in reduction of yeast life span. Here we present the first comprehensive test of the ERC model of yeast aging proposed by Sinclair and Guarente (46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). We have constructed three types of recombinant plasmid for this purpose: ARS plasmids, ARS/CEN plasmids, and 2 μ origin plasmids. ARS plasmids are most like ERCs in that they are circular DNA molecules with a replication origin but lack a cis-acting partitioning sequence. Classic pedigree analysis studies by Murray and Szostak (36Murray A.W. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1983; 34: 961-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) showed that ARS plasmids exhibit a strong bias to be retained in mother cells during mitosis. Thus, ARS plasmids are predicted to accumulate in mother cells like ERCs, but this has not yet been demonstrated. ARS/CEN plasmids contain a centromeric DNA region that acts in cis to attach plasmid DNA to the mitotic spindle and ensure efficient delivery to daughter cells during mitosis. ARS/CEN plasmids should not accumulate in mother cells. 2 μ origin plasmids typically contain a DNA replication origin, a cis-acting REP3/STB element, and one copy of an inverted repeat that regulates plasmid copy number (∼20–40 copies/cell) (6Broach J.R. Volkert F.C. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 297-331Google Scholar). The REP3/STB element actively partitions plasmid DNA to daughter cells during mitosis in cir + yeast strains (i.e. in strains that contain the endogenous 2 μ circle DNA plasmid that encodes proteins that interact in trans with REP3/STB) (6Broach J.R. Volkert F.C. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 297-331Google Scholar). 2 μ origin plasmids are not predicted to accumulate in mother cells, although the 2 μ plasmid partitioning machinery is not predicted to exhibit the fidelity of a centromere-based partitioning machinery. We have also constructed a series of plasmids containing functional rDNA repeat units and tested their effects on life span. This represents a significant improvement over a previously reported experiment (46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), which employed a nonfunctional stretch of rDNA (i.e. rDNA incapable of being transcribed to yield full-length 35 S pre-rRNA; see “Results”). Our studies show that yeast plasmids accumulate in mother cells and reduce replicative life span. The effect of plasmids on life span appears to be a direct effect and not an indirect effect on ERC levels in mother cells. A functional rDNA repeat unit is not required for reduction in life span, and the presence of a functional rDNA repeat does not augment reduction in life span by plasmids. Thus, plasmids containing ARS elements appear to “mimic” ERC-mediated reduction in life span. These findings provide strong evidence that replicative aging in S. cerevisiae is caused by accumulation of episomal DNA. The fact that functional rDNA sequences are not required for reduction in life span argues that expression of rDNA genes present on ERCs is not a causative process in yeast aging. This indicates that accumulation of episomal DNAs, such as ARS plasmids and ERCs, is one mechanism by which yeast life span is regulated. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—W303AR5 (MATa leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 ura3–1 ade2–1 trp1–1 can1–100 RAD5 ADE2::rDNA, [cir +]) (46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) was obtained from D. A. Sinclair. yAF5 and yAF6 were constructed by integrating linearized pRS305 and pRS306 (43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, into the leu2–3,112 or ura3–1 loci of W303AR5, respectively, and genotypes were confirmed by Southern blotting. Plasmids were transformed into W303AR5 using a standard lithium acetate method (16Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). All experiments were done with freshly prepared, independently isolated, colony-purified transformants. Unless otherwise noted, yeast were grown on selective synthetic dextrose “drop in” medium (42Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Descriptions of plasmids are provided in Table I. A 200-bp fragment containing ARS1 was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GGAAGCTTCCAAATGATTTAGCATTATC-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCTGTGGAGACAAATGGTG-3′ using template YRp17. A 200-bp fragment containing the rDNA ARS was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CCAAGCTTGTGGACAGAGGAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCATAACAGGAAAGTAACATCC-3′ using template pJPA102 (rDNA repeat with AhdI end points in pCR4, see below). A 753-bp fragment containing CEN4 was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GCGGATCCCCTAGGTTATCTATGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCCTAGGTACCTAAATCCTC-3′ using template YCp50. A 1346-bp region of 2 μ circle DNA, containing the REP3/STB cis-acting stability element and a single 599-bp repeat region, was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CCGGATCCAACGAAGCATCTGTGCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTTATGATCCAATATCAAAGG-3′ using pRS424 as template. rDNA repeats were amplified by PCR using as template size-selected (8–10 kb), genomic DNA that was digested with the appropriate enzyme (AhdI, PsiI, or XmaI). The following primer pairs were used: AhdI end points, 5′-GGGATCCATGTCGGCGGCAGTATTG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAGCTGTCCCACATACTAAATCTCTTC-3′; PsiI end points, 5′-GGGATCCTAATATACGATGAGGATGATAGTG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAGTAATAGATATATACAATACATGTTTTTACC-3′; XmaI end points, 5′-CCCGGGGCACCTGTCACTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGTAAACCCAGTTCCTCACTAT-3′. PCR was performed for 20 cycles with 15-s denaturation and annealing times using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were purified (Qiagen), digested with restriction enzymes, and ligated directly into recipient vectors, or cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), excised, gel-purified, and ligated into recipient vectors (see Table I). ARS elements were cloned between HindIII and EcoRI sites. CEN4 was cloned between EcoRI and BamHI sites. The 2 μ origin was cloned between HindIII and BamHI sites. rDNA inserts were cloned between PstI and BamHI sites in pAF-15, which is derived from pRS424 and contains LoxP sites that were inserted at EcoRI and SpeI sites using annealed primer pairs: 5′-AATTATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTAT-3′ and 5′-AATTATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTAT-3′ (EcoRI); 5′-CTAGATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTAT-3′ (SpeI). All cloned inserts were sequenced in their entirety. Plasmids pJPA105, pJPA106, and pJPA107 (that contain rDNA inserts) were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α grown in LB medium with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin at 30 °C to avoid insert instability.Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidOrigin, InsertMarkerBackbonepJPA1052 μ, rDNA repeat (XmaI end points)TRP1pAF15aDerived from pRS424 (8), see “Experimental Procedures.”pJPA1062 μ, rDNA repeat (AhdI end points)TRP1pAF15pJPA1072 μ, rDNA repeat (PsiI end points)TRP1pAF15pJPA113ARS1URA3pRS306 (43Sikorski R.S.

McVey M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Six transformants were streaked individually on one side of an SD agar plate, and 10 virgin mother cells from each (n = 60) were positioned in an orthogonal grid pattern. Virgin mothers that failed to give rise to five daughters were not included in the data set. Due to the low mitotic stability of ARS-plasmids, it was necessary to start with ∼250 virgin mother cells from ARS1-plasmid transformants to obtain n = 50–60 for life span determinations. A Zeiss Tetrad microscope equipped with ×16 eyepieces was used for micromanipulations as described (42Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). SD agar plates were weighed at the beginning of each experiment and sterile water was pipetted into four small notches at the edge of each plate on a daily basis to compensate for evaporation and prevent increases in osmolality, which could potentially affect results (22Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8056-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). During life span experiments, plates were incubated at 30 °C during the daytime and stored overnight (∼12 h) at 14 °C. We found that extended periods (≥24 h) at 14 °C reduced life spans of transformants and control strains (data not shown). At the end of a life span experiment, mother cells not having divided for 2 days were transferred to nonselective SD or YPD medium, and cells that resumed mitosis were excluded from the data set. This allowed us to exclude data from mother cells that stopped dividing due to plasmid loss rather than cell senescence. Data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet template file (available on request) that automatically calculated relevant life span data values and performed Wilcoxon two-sample paired signed rank tests. Images of terminal cells were collected using a Spot-2 CCD camera (Diagnostic Imaging) affixed to a Zeiss Tetrad microscope and “terminal” cell morphology analysis was done as described (32McVey M. Kaeberlein M. Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitotic Stability and ADE2 Marker Loss—For each plasmid, five transformants were grown in selective SD liquid medium for 2 days at 30 °C to saturation (A 600 = 1.1–1.5; 0.5–1 × 107 colony-forming units/ml; growth to late log gave results similar to stationary phase). Approximately 200–250 colony-forming units of each transformant were plated on nonselective SD medium, grown for 2–3 days at 30 °C, replica-plated onto selective and nonselective agar media, and grown for 3–4 days at 30 °C. For ADE2 marker loss determinations, saturated liquid cultures were prepared from five transformants, diluted, and spread on 15-cm selective SD agar plates containing 5 μg/ml adenine hemisulfate and 5 μg/ml histidine to enhance red color production. Southern Blot Analysis and Quantitation—DNA was extracted from yeast cells using a glass bead/phenol method, digested with restriction enzymes according to the supplier (New England Biolabs), separated on agarose gels, and capillary-transferred to positively charged nylon membrane under alkaline conditions using standard methods (50Wu P. Brockenbrough J.S. Metcalfe A.C. Chen S. Aris J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16453-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For each plasmid copy number and ERC monomer level determination, five plasmid transformants were analyzed in parallel. Digestion with BamHI or PstI yielded single plasmid-specific or genome-specific bands of different sizes that hybridized to 32P-labeled probe generated by random-primed labeling (New England Biolabs). PstI and BamHI do not cleave rDNA. Genomic bands were used as internal standards for measurements of plasmid levels. Chromosomal rDNA bands were used as internal standards for measurements of ERC monomer levels. Blots were hybridized first to URA3 or LEU2 probe, followed by stripping and hybridization to rDNA probe. Data from the same blots were used to prepare Figs. 2 and 3B. Southern data were acquired with a Typhoon PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).Fig. 3ERC formation in yeast transformants.

Southern blotting analyses of DNA from transformed and control strains grown on selective media were done to quantify chromosomal rDNA and ERC monomer band levels (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown to midlog phase (A 600 < 0.5) in SD liquid medium under selection prior to biotinylation. Following biotinylation, cells were grown overnight in selective SD medium, from which both young and old cells were obtained. Roles for Different Cis-acting Plasmid Sequences in Reduction of Yeast Replicative Life Span—To study the effects of plasmids on yeast replicative life span, we generated two series of plasmids based on commonly used integrating vectors pRS306 and pRS305 (43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each plasmid, we inserted ARS1, or ARS1 and CEN4, or the 2 μ circle origin (see “Experimental Procedures”). ARS1 (autonomous replicating sequence 1) is a nuclear genomic DNA replication origin whose function and domain organization have been studied in detail (reviewed in Ref. 3Bielinsky A.K. Gerbi S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Centromeric DNA from chromosome IV (CEN4) has been mapped and functionally dissected (reviewed in Ref. 7Carbon J. Clarke L. New Biol. 1990; 2: 10-19PubMed Google Scholar). The region of the 2 μ circle plasmid extending from REP3 through the adjacent 599-bp repeat functions as a replication origin as well as a cis-acting plasmid partitioning element (reviewed in Refs. 6Broach J.R.

Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 234-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table I. To evaluate effects on life span, plasmids were transformed into strain W303AR5 (46Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). For each plasmid, six independently isolated transformants were analyzed in parallel, and each life span curve reflects their collective behavior. Selection for the plasmid was maintained during life span analyses. Virgin mother cells unable to give rise to five daughters were discarded to exclude contributions from mother cells without plasmid. To identify mother cells that stopped dividing due to plasmid loss, rather than senescence, cells that had not divided in 2 days were transferred to nonselective medium and monitored for cell division and colony formation. A low percentage (<10%) of mother cells were found to give rise to colonies and were excluded from the life span data set. Life"

The ribose 2′-OH at nucleotide (nt) –1 of ptRNAs is known to contribute to positioning of catalytic Me2+. To investigate the catalytic process, we used ptRNAs with single 2′-deoxy (2′-H), 2′-amino (2′-N), or 2′-fluoro (2′-F) modifications at the cleavage site (nt –1). 2′ modifications had small (2.4–7.7-fold) effects on ptRNA binding to E. coli RNase P RNA in the ground state, decreasing substrate affinity in the order 2′-OH > 2′-F > 2′-N > 2′-H. Effects on the rate of the chemical step (about 10-fold for 2′-F, almost 150-fold for 2′-H and 2′-N) were much stronger, and, except for the 2′-N modification, resembled strikingly those observed in the Tetrahymena ribozyme-catalyzed reaction at corresponding position. Mn2+ rescued cleavage of the 2′-N but also the 2′-H-modified ptRNA, arguing against a direct metal ion coordination at this location.

Bacterial RNase P enzymes are composed of a catalytic RNA subunit (4Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar), ∼400 nucleotides (nt) in length, and a single small protein of typically 120 amino acids (5Brown J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 351-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The only known exception may be the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. Neither genes for RNase P RNA (rnpB) or protein (rnpA) subunits could be identified in the sequenced genome, nor have biochemical studies provided evidence for the presence of a bacterial-like RNase P activity (6Willkomm D.K. Feltens R. Hartmann R.K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Processing of ptRNAs by RNase P results in cleavage products with 3′-OH and 5′-phosphate termini. Studies with the model RNase P RNA ribozymes from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis have indicated that at least two metal ions (the actual number influenced by the nature and concentration of monovalent cations present) play a specific role in productive enzyme-substrate complex formation and cleavage chemistry (7Smith D.

A solvent hydroxide or activated water molecule is assumed to be positioned by a metal ion for nucleophilic attack in an S N2 in-line displacement mechanism (7Smith D. Pace N.R.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A 2′-deoxyribose substitution at the RNase P cleavage site was previously reported to affect binding of catalytically important Mg2+ and to substantially reduce the rate of catalysis by E. coli RNase P RNA (7Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Forster A.C. Altman S.

Altman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent NMR experiments have provided further evidence that the metal ion coordinated with the help of the 2′-OH group at nt –1 is actually “prebound” to ptRNA before complexation with RNase P RNA (19Zuleeg T. Hartmann R.K. Kreutzer R. Limmer S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the role of the 2′-OH group at nt –1 of ptRNA substrates for cleavage by E. coli RNase P RNA (M1 RNA) in more detail by introducing a single 2′-amino (2′-N), 2′-fluoro (2′-F), or 2′-deoxy (2′-H) substitution at this position. We demonstrate that the 2′-OH at nt –1 of the substrate contributes to enzyme-substrate binding in the ground state and to transition state stabilization in particular. 10-fold slower cleavage chemistry of the 2′-F-ptRNA compared with the all-ribose control but a 13-fold rate advantage over the 2′-H-ptRNA suggests a hydrogen-bonding function for the 2′-OH at nt –1 during catalysis. All three 2′ modifications at nt –1 caused a defect in the binding of catalytically relevant Mg2+. Increased miscleavage at position –2/–1 of 2′-N-modified substrate variants at lower pH suggests that the 2′-amino group becomes protonated and promotes electrostatic repulsion of the Me2+ bound in its immediate vicinity. The extent of miscleavage and the pH value at which we observed 50% miscleavage showed a remarkable dependence on the base identities at nt –1 and +73 of ptRNA. We further show that the replacement of Mg2+ with Mn2+ strongly improves processing efficiency for substrates with a 2′-N substitution at nt –1, although there is no convincing evidence for a direct metal ion coordination to the 2′ substituent at nt –1. RNA Synthesis and 5′ 32P-End-labeling—RNA oligonucleotides with and without single 2′-ribose modifications were either synthesized by phosphoramidite chemistry as described (20Persson T. Hartmann R.K. Eckstein F. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or purchased from IBA (Göttingen, Germany). E. coli M1 RNA and the 3′-portion of ptRNAGly missing the first 17 nt of the mature domain (termed tRNA18–79; see also Fig. 1) were synthesized by T7 transcription; the latter as part of a precursor transcript flanked by self-cleaving 5′- and 3′-cis-hammerheads to generate homogeneous 5′- and 3′-ends. 5′-end-labeling was performed as described (21Busch S. Kirsebom L.A. Notbohm H. Hartmann R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RNAs were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Alkaline and Nuclease P1 Hydrolysis—Alkaline and nuclease P1 hydrolysis assays were performed essentially as described (22Hansen A. Pfeiffer T. Zuleeg T. Limmer S. Ciesiolka J. Feltens R. Hartmann R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) Assembly of ptRNA Variants with Single Site Modifications—4.5 nmol of modified or unmodified RNA oligonucleotide (24 nt), covering the 7-nt 5′-flank and the first 17 nt of the mature domain of ptRNAGly (Fig. 1), 3 nmol of 5′-phosphorylated tRNA18- 79, 20 μl of 1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol were combined and adjusted with H2O to a final volume of 160 μl. The mixture was heated for 3 min at 90 °C, followed by incubation for 10 min at 65 °C and slow cooling (45 min) to ambient temperature in a metal block removed from the heating apparatus. The solution was then adjusted to 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 10% (CH3)2SO, and 140 units of T4 RNA ligase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 200 μl, and incubated overnight at 16 °C. The sample and a 100-μl wash of the reaction tube were combined, and RNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation overnight at –20 °C in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen as carrier. RNA pellets were redissolved in 15 μl of H20. Three samples prepared in this way were combined (Σ45 μl), mixed with loading buffer (45 μl; Ref. 23Heide C. Pfeiffer T. Nolan J.M. Hartmann R.K. RNA. 1999; 5: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a 10% PAA/8 m urea gel (gel thickness: 1 mm; pocket width: 20 mm). Ligated pRNAs were detected by UV shadowing, excised from gels, and eluted from crushed gel slices in 200 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) at 4–10 °C overnight, followed by a second elution for several hours. Eluted ptRNAs were concentrated by ethanol precipitation and redissolved in 50 μl of H2O. Kinetics—Standard processing assays were performed under single turnover conditions (5 μm M1 RNA, < 1 nm ptRNA, 1 m NH4OAc, 50 mm MES, or HEPES; metal ion concentration and pH as indicated) as described (21Busch S. Kirsebom L.A. Notbohm H. Hartmann R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Aliquots withdrawn from enzyme-substrate mixtures were desalted by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen before analysis by 20% PAGE/8 m urea. Data analysis and calculation of single turnover rates of cleavage (k obs) was performed as described (21Busch S. Kirsebom L.A. Notbohm H. Hartmann R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The calculation of error bars in Fig. 3 is illustrated with the following representative example: the k obs values for all-ribose ptRNAGlyCU and ptRNAGlyCHU at pH 5.5 and 0.2 m Mg2+ were 5 ± 0.6 and 0.05 ± 0.015 min–1, respectively (each value based on five individual experiments); k rel (OH/H) was calculated as 5/0.05 = 100; the upper and lower limits for k rel were calculated as 5.6/0.035 = 160 and 4.4/0.065 = 68, respectively; thus, k rel is illustrated as 100 with errors of +60 and –32. Spin Column Assays—Spin column assays for the determination of apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (appKD) of enzyme-substrate complexes were performed as described (9Warnecke J.M. Held R.

The 2′ modifications had moderate (2.4–7.7-fold) effects on ptRNA binding, decreasing substrate affinity in the order 2′-OH > 2′-F > 2′-N > 2′-H (Table I). This was measured at pH 6.0 in the presence of 15 mm Ca2+ as the divalent metal ion to prevent substantial ptRNA cleavage during binding assays.Table ISubstrate ground state binding to E. coli RNase P RNAptRNAGly nt -1 modificationappKdΔGΔΔGKd relnmkcal/molkcal/molUnmodified18 ± 5-10.5212′-Fluoro43 ± 7-10.010.512.42′-Amino107 ± 12-9.471.055.92′-Deoxy138 ± 12-9.321.207.7 Open table in a new tab Kinetics—The same substrate variants mentioned above were processed under single turnover conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) at saturating enzyme and varying divalent metal ion concentrations, either at pH 7.0 or pH 5.5. The pH of 7.0 was chosen to provide conditions where the 2′-amino group is mainly deprotonated. The pKa of the 2′-amino group was determined to be 6.2 (25Aurup H. Tuschl T. Benseler F. Ludwig J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and 6.0 (26Miller P.S. Bhan P. Kan L.-S. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1993; 12: 785-792Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the context of dinucleotides. The pH 5.5 allowed us to analyze cleavage at rate-limiting chemistry for all substrates, including the most efficiently cleaved all-ribose substrate. Rate-limiting chemistry for the latter was inferred from the linear relationship of log k obs over pH in the range of pH 5.0–6.5 (8Warnecke J.M. Fürste J.P. Hardt W.-D. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For substrates with inherently slower cleavage chemistry, such as ptRNA with a 2′-deoxy modification at nt –1, the linear relationship of log k obs over pH persisted even up to pH values of about 8.0 in keeping with previous findings (Ref. 27Loria A. Pan T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6317-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5). Cleavage efficiency of all-ribose and 2′-modified ptRNAGly CU variants at pH 7.0 decreased in the order 2′-OH > 2′-F > 2′-N > 2′-H (Fig. 2A). The same hierarchy was seen when Mg2+ was replaced with Mn2+ (Fig. 2B). A similar relationship was evident at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2, C and D), although the ptRNAGlyCNU was as inefficiently cleaved as the ptRNAGlyCHU, suggesting that protonation of the 2′-amino group at pH 5.5 impaired cleavage efficiency (see below). In Fig. 3, we plotted the data of Fig. 2, A and C as relative cleavage rates (k rel) versus Mg2+ concentration. The k rel values for processing at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3A) decreased with increasing [Mg2+], but remained rather constant between 0.04 and 0.1 m Mg2+. At 0.06 m Mg2+, the cleavage rate of the unmodified substrate was ∼3-fold, 16-fold, and almost 40-fold higher than that of ptRNAGlyCFU, CNU and CHU, respectively. At pH 5.5 (Fig. 3, B and C), where the chemical step is rate-limiting, a linear relationship of k rel versus [Mg2+] is clearly evident at [Mg2+] ≥ 0.1 m, with the rate for the unmodified ptRNA exceeding that of the modified substrates by a factor of ∼10 (2′-F) and about 150 (2′-H, 2′-N). We are aware that the unphysiologically high concentrations of Mg2+ used here (up to 0.6 m) may have affected the conformational equilibria of substrate and ribozyme RNAs. However, the steady increase of k obs with increasing [Mg2+] up to 0.6 m (Fig. 2, C and D) did not suggest any obvious defects of processing at such high Mg2+ concentrations. We interpret our results to indicate that (a) the 2′-OH at the RNase P cleavage site is involved in binding of catalytically important Mg2+ as previously suggested (7Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and (b) that cleavage chemistry of the modified substrates is inherently slower. Evidence for (a) is the finding that the reductions in rate are most pronounced at lower Mg2+ concentrations. This is seen for the experiments performed at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3A), because at this pH value cleavage efficiencies were high enough to reliably measure rates for the modified ptRNA variants at Mg2+ concentrations in the lower millimolar range. The relative recovery of catalytic performance (k rel) for the modified substrate versions at high [Mg2+] is more pronounced at pH 7.0 than pH 5.5 (for example, compare the k rel values at 0.1 m Mg2+ in Fig. 3A versus B and C). We think that two factors contributed to this difference. First, the cleavage rates for the most efficient all-ribose substrate were > 10 min–1 at pH 7.0 and Mg2+ concentrations exceeding 0.04 m and thus at the limit of precise rate determinations by manual kinetics. Therefore, we have to consider some underestimation of k rel values at higher Mg2+ concentrations in Fig. 3A. Second, the linear relationship between pH and log k obs for single turnover cleavage of all-ribose ptRNA by M1 RNA starts to level off above ∼pH 6.5. Apparently, another step, possibly a conformational change (28Hardt W.-D. Schlegl J. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), begins to limit the cleavage rate at pH 7.0 for the all-ribose but not for the more slowly cleaved modified substrates. Thus, at pH 7.0 and high Mg2+ concentrations the catalytic defect caused by the 2′ modifications at nt –1 seems to be partially masked, whereas results obtained at pH 5.5 provide a better assessment of the catalytic defect, except for ptRNAGlyCNU whose 2′-amino group was inferred to be substantially protonated at pH 5.5 (see below). Cleavage Site Selection—Next, we analyzed if ptRNAGlyCFU, CNU and CHU were cleaved at the canonical site (–1/+1) by M1 RNA or if the modification directed cleavage to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5′-direction (position –2/–1). As shown in Fig. 4, the 2′-F (Fig. 4A, lane 5), 2′-N (Fig. 4B, lane 10) and 2′-H variant (Fig. 4C, lane 14) were cleaved at –1/+1 at pH 7.5. However, the 2′-N variant showed substantial cleavage at position –2/–1 at pH 5.5 (Fig. 4B, lane 12). No substantial cleavage at –2/–1 was detected at pH 5.5 for ptRNAGlyCU, CFU, or CHU (data not shown). Remarkably, the cleavage site in ptRNAGlyCHU was shifted to position –2/–1 when we used the C292 mutant M1 RNA (Fig. 4D, lane 17), which essentially abolishes base pairing with the tRNA CCA terminus (21Busch S. Kirsebom L.A. Notbohm H. Hartmann R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Kirsebom L.A. Svärd S.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast, the all-ribose substrate was still cleaved at position +1/–1 by the C292 mutant RNA (Fig. 4D, lane 18). This documents the synergistic contributions of the 2′ substituent at nt –1 and the tRNA 3′-CCA base-pairing interaction to transition state complex formation at the canonical cleavage site, particularly in the context of our substrate that is assumed to form only a weak U+73/U294 interaction with E. coli M1 RNA (30Brännvall M. Kirsebom L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Brännvall M. Pettersson B.M.F. Kirsebom L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). pH-dependent Miscleavage of 2′-Amino-modified ptRNA Variants—The pH dependence for processing of ptRNAGlyCNU by M1 RNA revealed substantial miscleavage at pH values < 6.0 (Fig. 5A). The log-linear relationship of the overall cleavage rate and pH with a slope of 1.1 (Fig. 5B) indicates that cleavage chemistry is rate limiting up to pH 8.0 for the ptRNAGlyCNU substrate. As mentioned before, a very similar relationship with the same slope was reported for processing of a ptRNAPhe with a single 2′-H modification at nt –1 by Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA in the pH range between 6.1 and 7.8 (27Loria A. Pan T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6317-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 5A suggests that protonation of the 2′-amino substituent at low pH causes displacement of catalytic Me2+ due to electrostatic repulsion resulting in utilization of the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5′-direction. We then analyzed if pH-dependent miscleavage of ptRNAGlyCNU also pertains to a variant (ptRNAGly CNA) with a U to A+73 exchange. This might stabilize the interaction of nt +73 with U294 of E. coli M1 RNA and thus favor cleavage at –1/+1 (30Brännvall M. Kirsebom L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the similar pH dependence of miscleavage at –2/–1 for ptRNAGlyCNU and ptRNAGlyCNA. Surprisingly, the pH at which 50% miscleavage occurred (termed pH50%), increased by 0.3 pH units from pH 5.3 to 5.6 for ptRNAGlyCNA. Even more surprising, variants with a C to U exchange at nt –1, ptRNAGlyUNA and UNU, showed substantial reductions in miscleavage (Table II). At pH 5.0 and with Mg2+ as the divalent metal ion, these variants were only miscleaved to 53% (UNA) and 14% (UNU), whereas miscleavage amounted to 77% (CNU) and 92% (CNA) for the two other variants. A similar hierarchy of miscleavage was observed in the presence of Mn2+ at pH 5.0 (Table II).Table IIpH- and metal ion-dependent cleavage site selection in the presence of a 2′-amino substituent at nt -1 and different base identities of nt -1 and +73ptRNAGly variantMiscleavage at nt -2/-1100 mm Mg2+ pH 5.0100 mm Mn2+ pH 5.0C-1/U732.12.9C-1(2′-N)/U7376.656.6U-1/U737.57.4U-1(2′-N)/U7313.714.5C-1/A732.43.0C-1(2′-N)/A7392.185.8U-1/A7310.410.3U-1(2′-N)/A7353.045.8 Open table in a new tab Direct Metal Ion Coordination to the 2′ Substituent at nt –1?—We considered the possibility that the 2′ substituent at nt –1 may be involved in direct metal ion coordination, although inner-sphere coordination of 2′-OH ligands to Mg2+ seems to be rare (32Juneau K. Podell E. Harrington D.J. Cech T. Structure. 2001; 9: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Unlike Mg2+, transition metal ions, such as Mn2+ and Zn2+, can form stable inner-sphere complexes with nitrogen-containing compounds, for example with the N7 of purine nucleotides (33Sigel H. Song B. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Vol. 32. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New, York1996: 135-198Google Scholar). A metal ion interaction with the 2′ substituent of the G nucleophile was inferred for the group I self-splicing introns from Mn2+ and Zn2+ rescue of a reaction using a 2′-amino-2′-deoxyguanosine analog instead of guanosine as the nucleophile (34Sjögren A.S. Pettersson E. Sjöberg B.M. Strömberg R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To address the question of a potential direct metal interaction with the 2′ substituent at nt –1, we determined the cleavage rate for the 2′-N-modified substrate variants in the presence of Mn2+ versus Mg2+. The results are summarized in Table III and show that cleavage of the all-ribose ptRNA variants by M1 RNA is 2–3-fold less efficient in 10 mm Mn2+ relative to 10 mm Mg2+ (k rel = 0.34–0.5). This relation is completely inverted for the substrates with a 2′-N substitution at –1, with ptRNAGlyCNU being processed at an 82-fold higher single turnover rate in the presence of Mn2+ versus Mg2+. This was analyzed at pH 6.5, where cleavage occurred predominantly at –1/+1. The Mn2+ rescue effect was again remarkably influenced by the base identities at –1 and +73, decreasing in the order CNU > CNA > UNU > UNA (Table III). An important reason for these differences is the particularly low cleavage efficiency of the 2′-N-modified variants with a C at –1 in the presence of Mg2+. Could the observed Mn2+ rescue effects be interpreted as indicating a direct metal ion coordination to the 2′-amino substituent at nt –1? We argue that this is not the case because a Mn2+ rescue of similar strength (k rel = 52, Table III) was also observed for the ptRNAGlyCHU carrying a 2′-deoxy modification at nt –1, which abrogates a direct metal ion coordination. The absence of a direct metal ion coordination to the 2′-amino substituent at nt –1 is also supported by the inability to stimulate processing of ptRNAGlyCNU by addition of Zn2+ (data not shown).Table IIIMn2+ rescue of ptRNA cleavage in the presence of 2′-ribose modifications at nt -1ptRNAGly modificationkobsk rel (Mn2+/Mg2+)10 mm Mg2+10 mm Mn2+min -1C-1/U734.792.390.5C-1(2′-N)/U731.9 × 10-30.1681.6C-1(2′-H)/U739.0 × 10-40.04752.2U-1/U736.543.090.47U-1(2′-N)/U730.0230.3816.6C-1/A736.562.250.34C-1(2′-N)/A734.7 × 10-30.1634.0U-1/A735.222.350.45U-1(2′-N)/A730.0320.3410.7 Open table in a new tab 2′-Deoxy and 2′-Fluorine Modifications at nt –1—In a previous study by Drew Smith and Norman R. Pace (7Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), a 2′-deoxy modification at nt –1 was calculated to reduce the rate of catalysis by a factor of 3400, which largely exceeds the factor seen in the present study (∼150-fold, Fig. 3B) or in a previous study with the B. subtilis ribozyme (240-fold, Ref. 35Loria A. Pan T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10126-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that, in the previous study (7Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the cleavage rate of an all-ribose ptRNA with a 5′-flank of more than 10 nt and a U residue at nt –1 was compared with the rate for a ptRNA with a single 2′-deoxy A residue as 5′ flank. A ptRNA with a 1-nt 5′-flank was estimated to be cleaved up to 30-fold slower than ptRNA variants with 5′-precursor segments of ≥2 nt in the reaction catalyzed by B. subtilis RNase P; in addition, changing the nucleotide at position –1 from U to G reduced the cleavage rate 70-fold (36Crary S.M. Niranjanakumari S. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9409-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Likewise, B. subtilis RNase P RNA cleaved a ptRNA with a single 2′-deoxy C as the 5′-flank at a ∼30-fold slower rate than a variant thereof with four additional ribonucleotides at the 5′-end (35Loria A. Pan T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10126-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Exchanging the nt upstream of the cleavage site from U to A within an 8–10 nt long 5′-flank reduced k cat in the M1 RNA-catalyzed reaction by a factor of 12- to almost 200-fold, depending on the substrate context (13Brännvall M. Pettersson F. Kirsebom L.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even if one assumes that only a minor proportion of these reported reductions in catalytic rate took effect in the previous study (7Smith D. Pace N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5273-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), such effects on reactivity may easily explain the quantitative differences a 2′-deoxy modification at nt –1 had on the cleavage rate constant in the study by Smith and Pace (3400-fold) relative to the present study (∼150-fold, Fig. 3B). It is instructive to compare the results obtained for M1 RNA with those reported for the second large ribozyme model system, the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme. Both RNA enzymes generate cleavage products with 3′-OH termini, in contrast to the known small ribozymes (hammerhead, hairpin, VS, and HDV ribozyme), which produce 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates (Ref. 37Hartmann R.K. Krupp G. Hardt W.D. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 1995; 1: 215-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, and references therein). A difference between the Tetrahymena ribozyme and RNase P RNA, however, is that the former utilizes an exogenous guanosine nucleophile instead of a solvent hydroxide. A 2′-F modification at U-1 of the substrate for the Tetrahymena ribozyme caused a 2.5-fold increase in the Kd for substrate ground state binding and slowed the chemical step by a factor of 8.5 compared with the all-ribose substrate (38Herschlag D. Eckstein F. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8312-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These values are remarkably similar to the effect of a 2′-F modification observed in our study (2.4-fold Kd effect, 10-fold slower chemistry; Table I, Fig. 3B). In"
https://openalex.org/W2073424135,"Signaling by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activates the Rap1 and Rap2 GTPases, putative antagonists of Ras-mediated signaling. Because Ras can activate the Raf-1/ERK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, we asked whether Rap activation limits the ability of the BCR to signal via these pathways. To do this, we blocked the activation of endogenous Rap1 and Rap2 by expressing the Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein RapGAPII. Preventing Rap activation had no effect on BCR-induced activation of ERK. In contrast, BCR-induced phosphorylation of Akt on critical activating sites was increased 2- to 3-fold when Rap activation was blocked. Preventing Rap activation also increased the ability of the BCR to stimulate Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the FKHR transcription factor on negative regulatory sites and decreased the levels of p27Kip1, a pro-apoptotic factor whose transcription is enhanced by FKHR. Moreover, preventing Rap activation reduced BCR-induced cell death in the WEHI-231 B cell line. Thus activation of endogenous Rap by the BCR limits BCR-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, opposes the subsequent inhibition of the FKHR/p27Kip1 pro-apoptotic module, and enhances BCR-induced cell death. Consistent with the idea that Rap-GTP is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, expressing constitutively active Rap2 (Rap2V12) reduced BCR-induced phosphorylation of Akt and FKHR. Finally, our finding that Rap2V12 can bind PI3K and inhibit its activity in a manner that depends upon BCR engagement provides a potential mechanism by which Rap-GTP limits activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a central regulator of B cell growth and survival.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The BCR activates multiple signaling pathways, including the phospholipase C pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the kinase cascades that lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (1Gold M.R.

Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PI3K produces lipid second messengers that regulate a network of protein kinases, including 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, PKC-ζ, PKC-ϵ, p70 S6 kinase, the Btk tyrosine kinase (1Gold M.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Ting H.C. Christian S.L. Burgess A.E. Gold M.R. Immunol.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The three major classes of MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, phosphorylate a variety of transcription factors, increasing their ability to promote transcription. The activation of distinct combinations of these signaling pathways may account for the ability of the BCR to promote survival, apoptosis, proliferation, or differentiation depending on the maturation state of the B cell and the nature of the antigen (2Healy J.I. Goodnow C.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 645-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A key feature of signaling by the BCR and many other receptors is the use of monomeric GTPases as molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Activated GTPases bind downstream effector proteins and thereby regulate their subcellular localization and activity. Previous work has shown that BCR engagement results in the activation of the Ras and Rac1 GTPases (7Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ras controls the kinase cascade leading to the activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs, whereas Rac1 regulates the kinase cascades leading to the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPKs. We have shown that the BCR also activates the Rap1 GTPase (8McLeod S.J. Ingham R.J. Bos J.L. Kurosaki T. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29218-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and in this report we show that the BCR activates the Rap2 GTPase. Recent work has shown that the Rap GTPases play a key role in receptor-induced integrin activation and, hence, cell adhesion in many cell types (9Shimizu Y. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), including B cells. 2S. J. McLeod, A. Shum, A. E. Burgess, M. Dang-Lawson, A. H. Y. Li, and M. R. Gold, submitted for publication. However, the Rap GTPases were first described as potential antagonists of Ras-mediated signaling. The idea that Rap is an antagonist of Ras-mediated signaling originated with experiments showing that overexpressing Rap1 caused Ras-transformed 3T3 cells to assume a more normal fibroblast-like morphology (10Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Similarly, activated Rap1 can oppose Ras-dependent Xenopus oocyte differentiation (11Campa M.J. Chang K.J. Molina y Vedia L. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because Ras and Rap1 have identical core effector binding domains (residues 32–40) and activated Rap1 can bind in vitro to Ras effectors, including Raf-1 (12Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), it was proposed that activated Rap1 limits Ras-mediated signaling by sequestering Ras effectors in inactive complexes. Although Rap2 has a phenylalanine at position 39 instead of the serine present in Rap1, this substitution does not appear to have any functional consequences (14Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp.

Indeed, several groups have shown that both activated Rap1 and activated Rap2 can inhibit Ras-dependent activation of ERK (15Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y.

Other studies, however, did not find that Rap activation impaired Ras-dependent ERK activation (19Sato K.Y. Polakis P.G. Haubruck H. Fasching C.L. McCormick F. Stanbridge E.J.

Signaling pathways regulated by Ras play an essential role in BCR signaling. Loss-of-function studies have shown that activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is essential for B cell development (22Iritani B.M. Forbush K.A. Farrar M.A. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7019-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and for BCR-induced proliferation of mature B cells (23Richards J.D. Dave S.H. Chou C.H. Mamchak A.A. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition to activating the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway, Ras can also promote signaling via PI3K. Activated Ras can bind directly to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K (24Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Akt plays a critical role in regulating survival versus apoptosis in B cells (6Pogue S.L. Kurosaki T. Bolen J. Herbst R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that Ras regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway in B cells, recent work has shown that expressing constitutively active Ras leads to Akt activation in the A20 B cell line (26Jacob A.

The BCR can also initiate PI3K-dependent signaling by inducing the SH2 domain-dependent binding of PI3K to membrane-associated docking proteins such as CD19, Gab1, BCAP, and Cbl that are tyrosine-phosphorylated after BCR engagement (27Tuveson D.A. Carter R.H. Soltoff S.P. Fearon D.T. Science. 1993; 260: 986-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 28Ingham R.J. Holgado-Madruga M. Siu C. Wong A.J. Gold M.R. J. Biol.

Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3187-3194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus there may be two distinct mechanisms by which the BCR initiates PI3K signaling. Nevertheless, if activated Rap were to act as an antagonist of Ras-mediated signaling in B cells, it could limit the activation of two critical BCR signaling pathways, the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway and the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway. In contrast to the ability of activated Rap to inhibit Ras-dependent ERK activation in some cell types, Rap-GTP can in fact act as a positive regulator of both the ERK and p38 MAPKs in some situations. In neuronal cells such as the PC12 cell line, Stork and colleagues (31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 32York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) have shown that Rap1-GTP activates B-Raf, leading to sustained activation of ERK. Brummer et al. (33Brummer T. Shaw P.E. Reth M. Misawa Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5611-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have recently shown that B-Raf plays a significant role in the activation of ERK by the BCR, suggesting that a Rap/B-Raf pathway could contribute to BCR-induced ERK activation. Thus, depending on the cell type, the Rap GTPases may act as either positive or negative regulators of ERK activation. There is also some evidence that Rap activation is important for activation of the p38 MAPK (34Sawada Y. Nakamura K. Doi K. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Morita K. Komuro I. De Vos K. Sheetz M. Ichijo H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Rap GTPases can act as negative regulators of Ras-dependent signaling and, depending on the cell type, as positive regulators of MAPK signaling pathways, we investigated whether Rap activation in B cells modulates the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway or the MAPK pathways, critical mediators of BCR signaling. We show that Rap is neither a positive nor negative regulator of BCR-induced ERK activation and that Rap activation has no effect on the ability of the BCR to activate the JNK and p38 MAPKs. In contrast, we found that activation of the endogenous Rap GTPases limits the activation of Akt by the BCR. Preventing the activation of endogenous Rap by the BCR enhanced BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas expressing Rap2V12, a constitutively active form of Rap2, inhibited BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with the idea that Rap-GTP opposes Akt activation, we found that Rap activation inhibits Akt-dependent signaling events, in particular phosphorylation of the FKHR transcription factor. We also found that the ability of Rap-GTP to limit BCR-induced signaling via Akt correlated with effects on B cell survival. Finally, we show that Rap2V12-GTP can bind to PI3K and inhibit its enzymatic activity. Thus, the Rap GTPases act as negative regulators of the PI3K/Akt pro-survival signaling pathway in B cells and may do so via a mechanism that involves the binding of Rap-GTP to PI3K, the upstream activator of Akt. Antibodies—Goat antibodies against mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G (γ chain-specific) or mouse IgM (μ chain-specific) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Rabbit antibodies specific for Akt, Akt phosphorylated on serine 473 (anti-P-Ser-473 Akt), Akt phosphorylated on threonine 308 (anti-P-Thr-308 Akt), and p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) as were the antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of ERK, JNK, p38, and the Forkhead-related transcription factor FKHR/FOXO1. The antibodies specific for ERK, JNK, Rap1, and p85α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to Rap2, PDK1, and p27Kip1 were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and the monoclonal antibody to actin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). B Cell Lines—The A20 and WEHI-231 murine B cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 15 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). A20 cells expressing RapGAPII, Rap2V12, or the empty pMSCVpuro vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were generated by electroporation (400 V, 975 microfarads) followed by selection in medium containing 4 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged RapGAPII (35Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or Rap2V12 in pMSCVpuro were gifts from Dr. M. Matsuda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). A20 clones expressing RapGAPII were obtained by single-cell cloning. Expression of FLAG-RapGAPII or FLAG-Rap2V12 was detected by immunoblotting with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. All experiments were performed using clone 16, and results were confirmed using clone 3. The Rap2V12-expressing A20 cells were an oligoclonal population that was not subjected to single-cell cloning. Bulk populations of WEHI-231 cells expressing RapGAPII, Rap2V12, or the empty pMSCVpuro vector were generated by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (36Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J. Gold M.R. Methods Cell Sci. 1999; 21: 57-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) followed by selection in medium containing 0.25 μg/ml puromycin. A20 cells expressing a myristoylated Akt-estrogen receptor fusion protein (mER-Akt) or a non-myristoylated version with a glycine to alanine substitution at position 2 (A2-ER-Akt) were generated by electroporation and single cell cloning in the presence of puromycin. The cDNAs encoding the mER-Akt and A2-ER-Akt proteins (37Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Roth, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) were subcloned into the pMXpuro-IRES-EGFP vector, a derivative of pMXpuro (DNAX, Palo Alto, CA) (38Onishi M. Kinoshita Y. Morikawa A. Shibuya J. Phillips L.L. Lanier D.M. Gorman G.P. Nolan A. Kitamura M.T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). B Cell Stimulation and Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were washed once with modified HEPES-buffered saline (39Gold M.R. Scheid M.P. Santos L. Dang-Lawson M. Roth R.A. Matsuuchi L. Duronio V. Krebs D.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1894-1905PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in this buffer at 1 × 107 or 2 × 107 per ml, and warmed to 37 °C for 10–30 min. The cells were then stimulated with anti-Ig antibodies for the indicated times. Activation of the mER-Akt fusion protein was achieved by treating the cells with 2 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT, Sigma-Aldrich). For stimulation reactions lasting longer than 1 h, the cells were resuspended at 5 × 105 per ml in complete medium and treated with anti-Ig antibodies at 10 μg/ml for the indicated times. The reactions were terminated by adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and then centrifuging the cells for 1 min at 1100 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. For analyzing the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, JNK, and p38, the cell pellets were solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml microcystin-LR). For Rap activation assays, immunoprecipitation assays, PI3K enzyme assays, and detection of p27Kip1 protein levels, the cell pellets were solubilized in Rap lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Igepal (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate). For ERK in vitro kinase assays, the cell pellets were solubilized in ERK assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MoO4, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). In all cases, the samples were left on ice for 10 min, and then insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Immunoblotting—Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1–2 h with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibody. All antibodies were diluted in TBST/1% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). To re-probe membranes, bound antibodies were eluted by incubating the membrane in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 2), 150 mm NaCl for 30 min. The membranes were then re-blocked and probed with antibodies as described above. To quantitate results, scans of ECL exposures were saved as TIFF files and analyzed using ImageQuaNT 1.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). Rap Activation Assays—Cells were stimulated as above, solubilized in Rap lysis buffer, and then assayed for Rap activation as described previously (8McLeod S.J. Ingham R.J. Bos J.L. Kurosaki T. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29218-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the Rap1/2-binding domain of the RalGDS protein (GST-RalGDS(RBD)) was used to selectively precipitate the active GTP-bound forms of Rap1 and Rap2, which were then detected by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for either Rap1 or Rap2. In some experiments the filters were probed with anti-Rap2 antibodies, stripped, and then re-probed with anti-Rap1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were pre-cleared with Sepharose-CL-4B beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 4 °C. For anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were transferred to tubes containing 10 μl of agarose beads covalently coupled with the M2 anti-FLAG-monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 10 μl of Sepharose-CL-4B beads as filler. After mixing for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted and washed three times with Rap lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer. ERK and PI3K in Vitro Kinase Assays—ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ERK in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (40Sutherland C.L. Heath A.W. Pelech S.L. Young P.R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar) using either 30 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 μg of GST-ELK-1 (Cell Signaling Technologies) as the substrate. PI3K enzyme assays were performed on anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates as described by Gold et al. (41Gold M.R. Chan V.W. Turck C.W. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2012-2022PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at room temperature. The resulting 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was separated from the [γ-32P]ATP by thin layer chromatography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-IgM-induced Cell Death—WEHI-231 cells were plated at 2 × 105 per ml in complete medium and cultured for 48–72 h at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum) containing 4 μg/ml 7-AAD (Calbiochem), a membrane-impermeable DNA-binding compound that is excluded from live cells with intact membranes. After staining the cells in the dark for 10 min, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer. Flow cytometry was used to determine the percentage of cells that had taken up significant amounts of 7-AAD. Expressing RapGAPII Inhibits BCR-induced Activation of Rap1 and Rap2—We have previously shown that BCR engagement results in an increase in the amount of active GTP-bound Rap1 (8McLeod S.J.

Because Rap2 has a nearly identical effector region to that of Rap1 (14Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), can bind Ras effectors, and can inhibit Ras-dependent ERK activation (15Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y. Hamaguchi M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6074-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the BCR also activates Rap2. We found that inducing BCR signaling with anti-Ig antibodies resulted in the activation of both Rap1 and Rap2 in the WEHI-231 and A20 murine B cell lines (Fig. 1A). WEHI-231 is an IgM+ B cell line that resembles an immature/transitional B cell that can undergo antigen-induced clonal deletion, whereas A20 is an IgG+ B cell line that resembles a mature B cell that has undergone Ig class switching. The activation of Rap1 and Rap2 occurred with similar kinetics, consistent with the idea that they are regulated by the same exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). To investigate whether activated Rap GTPases modulate BCR-signaling pathways we employed a loss-of-function approach in which we blocked the activation of endogenous Rap1 and Rap2. To do this, we expressed in both WEHI-231 and A20 cells a Rap-specific GAP called RapGAPII (Fig. 1B) that converts Rap1 and Rap2 to their inactive GDP-bound forms. RapGAPII is normally expressed in brain (35Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M.

The mycobacterial PPM synthase (Mt-ppm1) catalyzes the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to polyprenyl phosphates. Based on sequence homology to Mt-ppm1, we have identified the PPM synthase from Corynebacterium glutamicum. In the present study, we demonstrate that the corynebacterial synthase is composed of two distinct domains; a catalytic domain (Cg-ppm1) and a membrane domain (Cg-ppm2). Through the inactivation of Cg-ppm1, we observed a complex phenotype that included altered cell growth rate and inability to synthesize PPM molecules and lipoglycans. When Cg-ppm2 was deleted, no observable phenotype was noted, indicating the clear organization of the two domains. The complementation of the inactivated Cg-ppm1 strain with the corresponding mycobacterial enzyme (Mt-Ppm1/D2) led to the restoration of a wild type phenotype. The present study illustrates, for the first time, the generation of a lipoglycan-less mutant based on a molecular strategy in a member of the Corynebacterianeae family.

Corynebacterial strains are widely distributed throughout nature and represent an important branch of the Actinomycetales family. The human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causal agent of diphtheria, and serious economic losses occur from the infection of animals by corynebacterial strains, such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Corynebacterium matruchotti (2Coyle M.B.

Therefore, it is of no surprise to find that corynebacteria and mycobacteria share a similar cell envelope ultrastructure, which comprises a core mycolyl-arabinogalactan peptidoglycan complex, termed mAGP (6Eggeling L.

An important class of components, found within the cell envelope, are the biosynthetically related glycolipids, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), 1The abbreviations used are: PIM, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside; LB, Luria-Bertani; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; LM, lipomannan; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry; ManLAM, lipoarabinomannan with mannose caps; Manp, mannopyranose; MPI, mannosyl-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphatidyl-myo-inositol; PILAM, lipoarabinomannan with phosphoinositide caps; PPM, polyprenol monophosphomannose; TLC, thin layer chromatography; t, terminal., 2PIM nomenclature is taken from Kordulakova et al.

These glycolipids and lipoglycans are present within the cell envelope of both mycobacteria (8Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-α (23Knutson K.L. Hmama Z. Herrera-Velit P. Rochford R. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 645-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that slow growing mycobacteria possess a virulence factor enabling their persistence within the host. Conversely, PILAM can induce a pro-inflammatory response in a Toll-like 2 receptor (TLR-2) dependent manner (24Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as a consequence PILAM are likely to favor the killing of fast growing mycobacteria. The biological importance of the capping motifs found in ManLAM is now without doubt, reinforcing an emerging paradigm that “capped” LAM molecules possess immunomodulatory type properties (22Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 25Maeda N. Nigou J. Herrmann J.L. Jackson M. Amara A. Lagrange P.H.

Puzo G. Nigou J. Besra G.S. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Rhodococcus equi (28Garton N.J. Gilleron M. Brando T. Dan H.H. Giguere S. Puzo G.

Structurally, these lipoglycans are related to mycobacterial LAM, but are typically smaller in size. Nevertheless, they possess a similar global architecture, with the most significant difference related to the degree of arabinosylation and mannosylation. Thus, it would seem that these close relatives have evolved a specific set(s) of enzymes dedicated to the production of these biosynthetically related PIMs, LM and LAM. As a result, a plethora of information exists to study lipoglycan biosynthesis within the Actinomycetales family, through the use of genomic and metabolomic approaches, linked to the use of more genetically tractable species, such as the industrial important bacilli, C. glutamicum. Although the structure of mycobacterial LAM has been well documented (10Vercellone A. Nigou J. Puzo G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: e149-e163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G.

Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam2001: 113-140Google Scholar), the genetics of its biosynthesis still remain largely ill defined. It involves the addition of Manp residues to phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) to produce both the short PIMs (2–6 Manp residues) and LM, which is further glycosylated with arabinan to form LAM. The biosynthetic relationship of PI → PIMs → LM → LAM has recently been supported by biochemical (30Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D.

The generation of PPM, which results from the transfer of Manp from GDP-Manp to a polyprenyl phosphate, has been studied in M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and is catalyzed by a PPM synthase, now termed Mt-ppm1 (Rv2051c) (35Gurcha S.S. Baulard A.R. Kremer L. Locht C. Moody D.B. Muhlecker W. Costello C.E. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study we have established that C. glutamicum possess both PIMs and lipoglycans, which are reminiscent of M. tuberculosis products, suggesting conserved biosynthetic machineries within the two bacilli. Furthermore, through comparative genomic analyses, we have identified the corynebacterial PPM synthase Cg-ppm1, analogous to Mt-ppm1/D2. The disruption of Cg-ppm1 through homologous recombination led to a lipoglycan-less phenotype. In addition, complementation with Mt-ppm1/D2 led to restoration of lipoglycan biosynthesis in C. glutamicum. These results demonstrate the first biochemical and molecular description of lipoglycan biosynthesis in a non-mycobacterial species and highlight the inherent usefulness of examining related species to probe complex biosynthetic pathways. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli DH5αmcr and C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (the wild type strain, and referred to for the remainder of the text as C. glutamicum) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco) at 37 and 30 °C, respectively. The mutants generated by this study were grown on complex medium LBHIS (which contained per liter: 5 g of tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of yeast extract, 18.5 g of brain heart infusion (Difco Labs Ltd, Surrey, UK), and 90.1 g of sorbitol). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. Growth curves were performed using the minimal medium CGXII (36Keilhauer C. Eggeling L. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5595-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 30 mg/liter protocatechuic acid was included as a chelating agent. Mutants were grown overnight on LBHIS, harvested, washed once with 0.9% NaCl, and inoculated into CGXII to give a starting optical density of 1, harvested again, washed once with 0.9% NaCl, and lyophilized. For lipid and lipoglycan analyses, along with crude cellular extract preparations, cells were grown in an identical manner. For the preparation of membranes, bacterial strains were grown in LB broth, supplemented with antibiotics, grown to mid log phase, harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS (50 mm, pH 7.5), and stored at –20 °C until further use. Plasmids and DNA Manipulation—To enable inactivation of Cg-ppm1 in the chromosome of C. glutamicum, the plasmid pK18mob-Cg-ppm1-int was generated. An internal fragment of Cg-ppm1 was amplified via PCR using primers 5′-CCCTGCGGTCATATCGGTCA-3′ and 5′-GCGTACATGGCTGGCTTCCA-3′. The resulting fragment was purified via gel electrophoresis and ligated with SmaI-cleaved pK18mob (37Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), using the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Overexpression of Mt-ppm1/D2 was obtained with pXMJ19-Mt-ppm1/D2. The primers used were 5′-GCTCTAGA AAGGAGATATAGATATGACCACCGGCCAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTATTCGGTCACGTCGGCGC-3′ (with the cloning sites in bold and the ribosome binding site and start codon, introduced to enable expression of domain D2 of Mt-ppm1, underlined). The amplified fragment was purified, treated with XbaI and EcoRI, and ligated with similarly treated pXMJ19 (38Jakoby M. Burkovski A. Biotechnol. Techniques. 1999; 13: 437-441Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to give pXMJ19-Mt-ppm1/D2. Overexpression of Cg-ppm1 was obtained with pVWEx2-Cg-ppm1. The primers used were 5′-GCTCTAGAAAGGAGATATAGATATGAGCAGTGAGGCAGTAGAT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGAGCCAGGTGTTGCGC-3′. The fragment was cloned with the SureClone ligation kit in pUC18, excised as an XbaI/BamHI fragment from the resulting vector, and ligated with similarly treated pVWEx2. The in-frame deletion of Cg-ppm2 in C. glutamicum was achieved with pK19mobsacB-Cg-ppm2. This plasmid was made using cross-over PCR (39Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) to enable the one-ligation step integration of upstream together with downstream sequences of Cg-ppm2 into pK19mobsacB (37Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). Using the Expand Highfidelity PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in the first PCR round, two separate amplification products were generated with 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGCGCGACGCTGATGTAGAC-3′ (Cg-ppm2-3′-out)/5′-ACAAATTCAAATCACCTACCCGCGAAAAAGGCAGCAACTAATCG-3′ (Cg-ppm2-3′-in) and with 5′-CGCGATCCGCGGGCCAAGCGCATGCGCAGTG-3′ (Cg-ppm2-5′-out)/5′-GGGTAGGTGATTTGAATTTGTAGTTGGGCCCGTGGACATCT-3′ (Cg-ppm2-5′-in). Both PCR products were purified and used as a template to amplify, with primers Cg-ppm2-5′-out and Cg-ppm2-3′-out, a fragment devoid of Cg-ppm2 that was treated with BamHI and ligated with BamHI-cleaved pK19mobsacB to give pK19mobsacB-Cg-ppm2. The inserts in all final constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Construction of Strains—Plasmids were usually introduced via electroporation, but conjugation was used when electroporation failed. Conjugation was done with E. coli S-17-1 as the donor, and its sensitivity to nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml) was used after plating for counterselecting. Selection of recombinant C. glutamicum strains for the presence of the replicative plasmid pVWEx2-Cg-ppm1 used 2 μg/ml tetracycline, and pXMJ19-Mt-ppm1/D2 used 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The ppm1 gene was inactivated in C. glutamicum by transformation with pK18mob-Cg-ppm1-int. A recombinant strain was selected with 15 μg/ml kanamycin and the chromosomal inactivation confirmed by PCR. The resulting strain was termed C. glutamicum::ppm1. To achieve deletion of Cg-ppm2, plasmid pK19mobsacB-Cg-ppm2 was introduced into C. glutamicum by conjugation. Selection for resistance to kanamycin yielded two clones, indicating integration of the vector in the chromosome by homologous recombination. Each of the clones was subjected to the subsequent selection for the second homologous recombination event. In this round the presence of sacB (together with addition of 10% sucrose to the medium) resulted in a positive selection of clones where vector sequences were lost again (37Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). The correct integration of sequences into the chromosome and absence of sequences, respectively, in the resulting strain, C. glutamicumΔppm2, was verified by PCR using two different primer pairs. Extraction of Whole Cell Lipids—Lyophilized C. glutamicum, C. glutamicum::ppm1, and C. glutamicum::ppm1 pMt-ppm1/D2 were extracted by three consecutive overnight extractions in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). These lipidic extracts were combined, dried under reduced pressure, Folch-washed, CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1, v/v/v), and again dried under reduced pressure and analyzed by MALDI-MS. Extraction of Lipoglycans—500 mg of lyophilized cells of C. glutamicum, C. glutamicum::ppm1, and C. glutamicum::ppm1 pMt-ppm1/D2 were delipidated as described above. The delipidated cells were then resuspended in 10 ml of PBS (50 mm, pH 7.5) and 10 ml of phenolsaturated PBS and incubated with stirring at 90 °C for 60 min (40Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Westphal O. Jann K. Whistler R.L. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1965: 83-91Google Scholar). The mixture was then centrifuged at 4500 × g for 10 min and the upper aqueous phase removed and dialyzed for 24 h against water, with frequent changes. The recovered samples, containing lipoglycans and glycans, were dried under reduced pressure and resuspended in 500 μl of 15% propan-1-ol in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer and loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma UK, 30 × 1.5 cm) and eluted with 3 column volumes of the same buffer at 5 ml/h, enabling the removal of non-lipidic moieties (22Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The retained lipoglycans were eluted with 3 column volumes of 50% propan-1-ol in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer. The resulting lipoglycans were either analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by periodic acid-silver nitrate staining, or subjected to further purification using gel filtration chromatography, as described by Gibson et al. (29Gibson K.J.C. Gilleron M. Constant P. Puzo G. Nigou J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), for glycosidic linkage analysis. Glycosidic Linkage Analysis—Glycosyl linkage composition was performed according to the modified procedure from Ciucanu and Kerek (42Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). The per-O-methylated lipoglycans were hydrolyzed using 500 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h, reduced using 350 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of NaBD4 (1 m ammonium hydroxide/ethanol; 1:1, v/v) and per-O-acetylated using 300 μl of acetic anhydride for 1 h at 110 °C. The resulting alditol acetates were solubilized in cyclohexane before analysis by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Preparation of Enzyme Fractions—C. glutamicum, C. glutamicum::ppm1, and C. glutamicum::ppm1 pMt-ppm1/D2 were grown (10 g wet weight), washed, and re-suspended in 30 ml of buffer A, which contained 50 mm MOPS (adjusted to pH 8.0 with KOH), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm MgCl2, at 4 °C and subjected to sonication (Soniprep 150, MSE Sanyo Gallenkamp, Crawley, Sussex, UK; 1-cm probe) for a total of 10 cycles in 60-s pulses and 90-s cooling intervals. The sonicates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Membrane fractions from the three strains were obtained by further centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed and the membranes gently resuspended in buffer A. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce Europe, Oud-Beijerland, Netherlands). Mannosyltransferase Assays—Membrane fractions from C. glutamicum were assayed and compared with C. glutamicum::ppm1 and C. glutamicum::ppm1 pMt-ppm1/D2 for in vitro mannosyltransferase activity, using methods adapted from Besra et al. (31Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 95 μg of membranes (total protein), buffer A, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm CaCl2 either with or without 5 μg of amphomycin (a lipopeptide antibiotic that specifically inhibits polyprenyl-P-requiring synthases and the subsequent synthesis of polyprenol-P-Man) in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 0.25 μCi of GDP-[14C]Man (Amersham Biosciences; 303 mCi/mmol) and held at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of 1.75 ml of CHCl3 and 0.75 ml of H2O. The lower organic layer of the biphasic mixture was washed three times with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48, v/v/v), dried under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in 200 μl of CHCl3/CH2OH (2:1, v/v). The transfer of [14C]Man from GDP-[14C]Man to the in vitro synthesized PI/PIMs was quantified by scintillation counting using 5 ml of Ecolume™ (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) and the materials analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC)/autoradiography as described previously (34Schaeffer M.L.

Analysis of Reaction Products—Large scale reaction mixtures containing unlabeled GDP-Man (80 mm) and the other components were prepared and processed as described above. The reaction products were dried, applied to preparative TLC plates (plastic-backed plates of Silica gel 60 F254; E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) along with radiolabeled material (50,000 cpm) to trace the cold enzymatically synthesized products and developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6, v/v/v/v). Autoradiography was performed as described previously (34Schaeffer M.L. Khoo K.H. Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T. Inamine J.M. J. Biol.

Polyprenol Monophosphomannose Synthase Assays—Reaction mixtures assessing [14C]Man incorporation consisted of 0.25 μCi of GDP-[14C]Man (Amersham Biosciences; 303 mCi/mmol), 62.5 μm ATP, 10 μm MgCl2, and 90 μg of membrane preparations, prepared as described previously, in a final volume of 50 μl (35Gurcha S.S.

In some cases, exogenous lipid monophosphate substrates (C35, heptaprenyl monophosphate; C40, octaprenyl monophosphate; C50, decaprenyl monophosphate; C55, undecaprenyl monophosphate; and C60, dodecaprenyl monophosphate) were added to reaction mixtures at a final concentration of 0.25 mm in 0.25% CHAPS. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Extraction and Characterization of [14C]Mannose-labeled Products from PPM Reaction—The above enzymatic reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/0.8 m NaOH (10:10:3, v/v/v) followed by further incubation at 50 °C for 20 min. The mixtures were then allowed to cool to room temperature, and 1.75 ml of CHCl3 and 0.75 ml of H2O were added. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged, and the upper aqueous phase discarded. The organic phase was washed three times with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48, v/v/v), dried under a stream of nitrogen to yield an organic fraction, which contained exclusively the mild-alkali stable family of PPMs. The resulting PPMs were resuspended in 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v), and aliquots (20 μl) were dried under a stream of nitrogen in a scintillation vial prior to scintillation counting using 5 ml of Ecolume™ (ICN Biomedicals).

https://openalex.org/W2106209900,"Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is an abundant nuclear protein that participates in RNA processing, alternative splicing, and chromosome maintenance. hnRNP A1 can be proteolyzed to unwinding protein (UP1), a 22.1-kDa protein that retains a high affinity for purine-rich single-stranded nucleic acids, including the human telomeric repeat (hTR) d(TTAGGG)n. Using the structure of UP1 bound to hTR as a guide, we have incorporated the fluorescent guanine analog 6-MI at one of two positions within the DNA to facilitate binding studies. One is where 6-MI remains stacked with an adjacent purine, and another is where it becomes fully unstacked upon UP1 binding. The structures of both modified oligonucleotides complexed to UP1 were determined by x-ray crystallography to validate the efficacy of our design, and 6-MI has proven to be an excellent reporter molecule for single-stranded nucleic acid interactions in positions where there is a change in stacking environment upon complex formation. We have shown that UP1 affinity for d(TTAGGG)2 is ∼5 nm at 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, and our binding studies with d(TTAGG(6-MI)TTAGGG) show that binding is only modestly sensitive to salt and pH. UP1 also has a potent G-tetrad destabilizing activity that reduces the T m of the hTR sequence d(TAGGGT)4 from 67.0 °C to 36.1 °C at physiological conditions (150 mm KCl, pH 7.0). Consistent with the structures determined by x-ray crystallography, UP1 is able to bind the hTR sequence in solution as a dimer and supports a model for hnRNP A1 binding to nucleic acids in arrays that may make a contiguous set of anti-parallel single-stranded nucleic acid binding clefts. These data suggest that seemingly disparate roles for hnRNP A1 in alternative splice site selection, RNA processing, RNA transport, and chromosome maintenance reflect its ability to bind a purine-rich consensus sequence (nYAGGn) and destabilize potentially deleterious G-tetrad structures.

Although hnRNPs were among the first eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins isolated, their role in vivo is complex and not fully delineated. hnRNP A1 is tightly associated with DNA polymerase II transcripts, and recent work has suggested that they may play an important role in the retention of intron-containing pre-mRNA within the nucleus (1Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) as well as already established roles in alternative splicing (2Marchand V. Mereau A. Jacquenet S.

In addition, hnRNP A1 has been demonstrated to bind purine-rich DNAs such as the human telomeric repeat (hTR) d(TTAGGG)n (15Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell.

Nakagama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12685-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The observation that UP1 binds with high affinity to these repeat sequences has suggested an in vivo role for hnRNP A1 and its proteolytic derivative UP1 in chromosome maintenance (16Dallaire F. Dupuis S. Fiset S. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14509-14516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Fiset S. Chabot B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2268-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human hnRNP A1 is a 319-amino acid protein (34 kDa) made up of three domains (20Cobianchi F. SenGupta D.N.

Protein Res. 1987; 29: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The first two-thirds of the protein contain two canonical RNA recognition motifs (RRM) that have been shown to bind tightly to ssRNA (22Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Roberts W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of hnRNP A1 is composed largely of small, highly flexible residues (40% glycine) and several RGG motifs that contribute to hnRNP A1 cooperativity and affinity for ssRNA (22Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Roberts W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization signal of hnRNP A1 is in the flexible C-terminal domain, as are several potential phosphorylation (25Cobianchi F. Calvio C. Stoppini M. Buvoli M. Riva S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and methylation sites that mediate hnRNP A1 localization and affinity for ssRNA (26Kim S. Merrill B.M. Rajpurohit R.

Partial proteolysis studies of hnRNP A1 showed that the C-terminal 124 residues could be removed readily to produce UP1. UP1 is made up of residues 1-195 and includes both RRMs as well as a short basic region just C-terminal of RRM2 that is important to nucleic acid binding (23Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pellegrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike most RRM-containing proteins, UP1 is able to bind with high affinity to either ssDNA or ssRNA (22Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Roberts W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H.

The structure of UP1 has been determined alone (28Shamoo Y. Krueger U. Rice L.M. Williams K.R. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Xu R.M. Jokhan L. Cheng X. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R.

Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The arrangement of protomers in the crystal structures showed that the nucleic acid binding groove of UP1 is made by two copies of UP1 that bind ssDNA such that the two DNA strands bind in an anti-parallel fashion (Fig. 1). The ssDNA in the crystal structure of Ding et al. (30Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) has an extended conformation (average interatomic phosphate distance of 6.6 Å) with each RRM making a network of stacking, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions to about four nucleotides in excellent agreement with prior estimates of DNA-binding site size based on polynucleotide binding studies (23Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pellegrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structures indicate an extended DNA conformation upon UP1 binding, it has been shown that hTR sequences form stable quadruplex structures under a wide range of solution conditions (31Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 32Phan A.T. Mergny J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and we have shown, consistent with the work of Fukuda et al. (19Fukuda H. Katahira M. Tsuchiya N. Enokizono Y. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Nakagama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12685-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), that UP1 destabilizes G-tetrad structures in vitro, an activity that may provide an important clue for the in vivo activities of hnRNP A1. We have used the available high resolution structures of UP1 to incorporate the fluorescent guanosine analog 6-methyl-8-(2-deoxy-β-ribofuranosyl)isoxanthopteridine (6-MI) into the oligonucleotide d(TTAGGG)2 as a probe for studying UP1 interactions to hTR DNA (33Hawkins M.E. Pfleiderer W. Balis F.M. Porter D. Knutson J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Hawkins M.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previous fluorescence studies using either the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence or the fluorescent nucleotide riboethanoadenylic acid have shown that UP1 binds promiscuously to single-stranded nucleic acids as part of its in vivo role in RNA processing and transport (22Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Roberts W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4063-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SELEX experiments originally identified UAGGG(A/U) repeats as potential high affinity sites for hnRNP A1 (9Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). More recent work using gel mobility shift assays and surface plasmon resonance imaging have shown that UP1 and intact hnRNP A1 bind with high affinity to hTR sequences (19Fukuda H. Katahira M. Tsuchiya N. Enokizono Y. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Nakagama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12685-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Incorporation of 6-MI into hTR sequences as a reporter for UP1 binding has allowed us to perform equilibrium binding studies and evaluate the utility of 6-MI as a potential probe for other protein/single-strand nucleic acid interactions. The available structure and prior characterization of UP1 as a prototypical ssRNA binding protein provide an excellent framework for these studies. Although crystallographic studies indicate that UP1 may bind as a dimer to single-stranded nucleic acids, previous solution studies have not supported such a model. hnRNP A1, but not UP1, has been shown to have a modest cooperativity upon binding to RNA polynucleotides. By using light scattering, we have shown that UP1 is able to specifically bind hTR sequences as a dimer, but only in the presence of a sufficiently long single-stranded nucleic acid. Taken together, our equilibrium binding studies, light scattering, x-ray studies, and DNA melting experiments support a model for hnRNP A1 activity that includes the destabilization of adventitious G-tetrad-stabilized quadruplexes using a preference for purine-rich (nYAGGn) sequences. Purification of UP1—Plasmid pYS45 was used for the overexpression of UP1 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and purification of UP1 was based upon Shamoo et al. (23Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pellegrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the crude cell lysate was passed over a DE52 anion exchange column (UP1 flows through) and an ssDNA cellulose column connected in series that had been equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)). UP1 was eluted from the ssDNA cellulose column with a step gradient using buffer A + 1.0 m NaCl and dialyzed into Buffer B (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 35 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)). UP1 was then bound to a HiTrap heparin affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by using a linear gradient from 0.035 to 1.0 m NaCl. UP1 was again dialyzed against buffer B and then passed over a HiTrap Sepharose SP FF cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient extending to 1.0 m NaCl. Purified UP1 was dialyzed against 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) and concentrated to 40 mg/ml using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff concentrator (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience) and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Oligonucleotides—All oligonucleotides (TR2-6F, d(TTAGG(6-MI)TTAGGG); TR2-11F, d(TTAGGGTTAG(6-MI)G) were obtained commercially (IDT, MWG Biotech Inc., and TriLink Biotechnologies for 6-MI) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C4 reverse phase column. Crystallization of the UP1·TR2-6F and UP1·TR2-11F Complexes—Crystals were grown with the vapor diffusion method at 10 °C at an initial starting UP1 concentration of 0.83 mm. 1.5 μl of UP1·TR2-6F (1:1.5 stoichiometry) was incubated on ice for 1.5 h prior to being mixed with 2.5-3.75 μl of precipitant. The precipitant contained 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 15% glycerol (v/v), and 1.8-2.2 m dibasic ammonium phosphate. Crystals took 3-5 days to grow. Data Collection and Structure Solution—UP1·TR2-6F and UP1·TR2-11F diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis IV++ detector with Osmic mirrors at -170 °C. Both crystals grew in space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 51.8 Å, c = 172.3 Å (TR2-6F), and a = b = 51.6 Å, c = 171.5 Å (TR2-11F), with two copies of UP1 per asymmetric unit. For TR2-6F, reflections were 96% complete to 2.1 Å and had an average I/σ = 2.4 in the highest resolution bin (2.09-2.05 Å) and an overall redundancy of 3.9. For TR2-11F, reflections were 95% complete to 2.6 Å and had an average I/σ = 4.4 in the highest resolution bin (2.64-2.60 Å) and an overall redundancy of 5.4. Diffraction data were collected using CrystalClear (Rigaku/MSC) and processed with DENZO, and intensities were scaled with SCALEPACK (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structures were solved with Crystallography NMR System by molecular replacement using the structure of Ding et al. (30Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) (2UP1) as a search model (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Reed R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). 6-MI was built starting from an energy-minimized structure (37van Aalten D.M.F.R. Bywater R. Findlay J.B.C. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 38Kleywegt G.J. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar) and parameterized for Crystallography NMR System using the software XPLO2D (38Kleywegt G.J. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar). The final models fit the data, with R calc = 0.23 and R free = 0.26 for TR2-6F (1PO6) and R calc = 0.24 and R free = 0.27 for TR2-11F (1PGZ). Equilibrium Fluorescence Titrations—Equilibrium binding experiments were performed with an SLM 8100 spectrometer (SLM Instruments) as a “forward titration” by titrating UP1 into a cuvette containing oligonucleotides incorporating 6-MI and measuring the gain of signal as a function of complex formation (39Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). An excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission of 430 nm was used at 25 °C with 1-cm path length cuvettes (33Hawkins M.E. Pfleiderer W. Balis F.M. Porter D. Knutson J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Ten measurements were taken 450 s after each addition of UP1, and the average was taken as one data point. A control of oligonucleotide alone was also used to correct for changes in the detector base-line and photobleaching. For titrations with varying NaCl concentrations, TR2-6F concentration was 250 nm in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 4-nm band-passes were used for both the excitation and emission monochromators without polarizers. Competition binding experiments were performed at 0.5 μm TR2-6F in 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. Titrations with variable pH used 10 nm TR2-6F in 20 mm MES (pH 6.0, 6.5) or 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0, 7.5, 8.0) in 300 mm NaCl, and 8-nm band-passes were used for both monochromators. Titration curves were fitted using Dynafit (BioKin Ltd., Pullman, WA). Thermal Denaturation of Quadruplex Nucleic Acids—Melting assays were performed in either 150 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.0, or 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Experiments were carried out with 3 μm d(TAGGT)4, 3 μm mouse MN d(GGCAG)4, and 6 μm UP1. The melting assays were run on a Lambda 20 UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that included a Peltier model PTP-6 temperature controller. All melting data were collected at 295 nm as a function of temperature over the range of 5-85 °C, with a fixed heating rate of 1.0 °C/min. Prior to melting, the DNA was incubated at 85 °C for 5 min and then allowed to anneal to room temperature. For the protein/DNA complexes, the annealed DNA was chilled on ice before UP1 was added. For data collected at temperatures less than 20 °C, the chamber of the spectrometer was sparged with nitrogen to reduce humidity. Static Light Scattering—A miniDAWN three-angle light-scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) was used to determine the molecular weight of individual proteins and complexes. 150-300-μg samples were injected onto a Shodex KW803 gel filtration column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and their elution was monitored by Shimadzu SPD-10Avp UV-visible and Waters R401 refractive index detectors. All measurements were made in 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm potassium cacodylate (pH 6.5) at 20 °C. The miniDAWN was calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wyatt Technology), and BSA was used as a standard to evaluate the accuracy of the system. A dn/dc value of 0.184 was used for BSA and single proteins (40Sun S. Shamoo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3876-3881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). dn/dc values for complexes were determined by using both UV-visible detector (280 nm) and differential refractometer. UV calibration constants used were calculated from the known extinction coefficients of the components and confirmed empirically by using their absorbance at 280 nm. The Zimm method was used to determine the molecular masses for all samples (41Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1099-1116Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Structure of UP1 Complexed to TR2-6F and TR2-11F—X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine the structure of UP1 bound to oligonucleotides incorporating 6-MI. The UP1·TR2-6F co-crystals diffracted to 2.1 Å, and composite omit maps of the region around the sixth position clearly indicated that substitution of 6-MI for guanine had no significant effect on the overall structure. A least squares superposition of Cαs from the structures of UP1 bound to TR2-6F and TR2 (d(TTAGGG)2) showed no significant differences (root mean square deviation = 0.23 Å). Electron density for the fully refined structure of UP1 bound to TR2-6F showed only very weak density (Fig. 1B) for 6-MI at position 6 and is consistent with high mobility resulting from complete destacking upon complex formation. The wild-type structure showed comparably weak electron density for Gua-6, which further supports the conclusion that positioning of 6-MI led to no substantive changes in the co-structure. The substitution of Gua-11 with 6-MI was also determined and compared with the wild-type structure (Fig. 1C). Unlike the Gua-6 substitution, Gua-11 makes a hydrogen bond through the O-6 position to a main chain amide and is proximal to the aliphatic portion of the side chain for Lys-183. The UP1·TR2-11F co-crystals were small and diffracted to 2.6 Å on a conventional rotating anode source. The overall root mean square deviation from the superposition of the wild-type and TR2-11F Cαs was 0.29 Å, suggesting that there were no larger global changes to the complex structure upon substitution of 6-MI at position 11. We observed that the structure of TR2-11F bound to UP1 shows that Gua-12 is disordered, whereas in the native structure, Gua-12 stacks with Gua-11. However, inspection of the native structure suggests that there are no direct contacts between Gua-12 and UP1. 6-MI Gain-of-signal Depends Strongly upon Change of Environment during Complex Formation—Fig. 2 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of TR2-6F and TR2-11F at a concentration of 10 nm during UP1 binding. TR2-6F shows a 3- to 4-fold increase in fluorescence emission at 430 nm upon complex formation, whereas TR2-11F shows only a modest 1.2-fold increase in intensity. The differences in magnitude of the changes in intensity for the TR2-6F and TR2-11F are consistent with their structures when bound to UP1, in which 6-MI in TR2-6F is completely solvent-accessible and 6-MI in TR2-11F remains stacked with Gua-10. Fluorescence Binding Studies of UP1 to TR2-6F and TR2-11F—Estimates of equilibrium dissociation rates were made for both oligonucleotides by using a forward titration of 10 nm TR2-6F and TR2-11F with increasing amounts of UP1 (Fig. 2). Binding isotherms were fitted to the data (“Materials and Methods”) and displayed stoichiometric binding to TR2-6F (∼50 nm) at salt concentrations approximating those found in vivo (100-200 mm). To determine accurate dissociation constants, it was necessary to evaluate binding as a function of salt concentration and pH. Fluorescence Binding Studies of UP1 to TR2-6F as a Function of Salt Concentration and pH—Fig. 3A shows the binding of UP1 to TR2-6F as a function of NaCl concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 m (Table I). The binding of UP1 is moderately sensitive to salt concentration and is consistent with its role in both specific and non-sequence-specific binding of single-stranded nucleic acids. The slope of the log K a versus log salt (NaCl) concentration (Fig. 3B) was used to estimate the electrostatic contribution for TR2-6F binding to UP1 (42Record Jr., M.T. Woodbury C.P. Lohman T.M.

Polysaccharide B of this complex contains a 2-aminoethylphosphonate functional group. This functional group is synthesized in three steps, one of which is catalyzed by phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase. In this paper, we report the cloning and overexpression of the B. fragilis phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase gene (aepY), purification of the phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase recombinant protein, and the extensive characterization of the reaction that it catalyzes. The homotrimeric (41,184-Da subunit) phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase catalyzes (k cat = 10.2 ± 0.3 s–1) the decarboxylation of phosphonopyruvate (Km = 3.2 ± 0.2 μm) to phosphonoacetaldehyde (Ki = 15 ± 2 μm) and carbon dioxide at an optimal pH range of 7.0–7.5.

The zwitterionic charge motif plays an essential role in the induction of the host defense response, which leads to abscess formation. The 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) 1The abbreviations used are: AEP, 2-aminoethylphosphonate; P-enolpyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate; Ppyr, phosphonopyruvate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; TAPS, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid; Pald, phosphonoacetaldehyde; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: AEP, 2-aminoethylphosphonate; P-enolpyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate; Ppyr, phosphonopyruvate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; TAPS, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid; Pald, phosphonoacetaldehyde; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. unit of polysaccharide B contributes the positive and negative charges that form the zwitterionic motif (see Fig. 1). AEP is the phosphonate counterpart to phosphoethanol amine, a common lipid polar head-group. The P-C bond of AEP is resistant to both chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis. The AEP unit is found in proteins (7Heise N. Raper J. Buxbaum L.U. Peranovich T.M. de Almeida M.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 262: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) located at the cell surfaces in certain parasitic organisms. These AEP conjugates either participate in host infection, as in the case of the B. fragilis polysaccharide B, or they are responsible for the persistence of the parasite within the host. The presence of AEP in the B. fragilis polysaccharide B was first demonstrated by NMR structural analysis (3Tzianabos A.O. Pantosti A. Baumann H. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18230-18235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the polysaccharide B biosynthetic pathway gene locus was sequenced (13Coyne M.J. Kalka-Moll W. Tzianabos A.O. Kasper D.L. Comstock L.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6176-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Three genes, aepX, aepY, and aepZ, which encode proteins that share significant sequence identity with the three enzymes of the AEP biosynthetic pathway, are included within this locus (Fig. 2). To our knowledge, this is the first known example of the AEP biosynthetic pathway gene cluster in a bacterium. Moreover, the opportunity now exists for the isolation of the three pathway enzymes for mechanistic study and inhibitor design. Because the AEP pathway enzymes are not present in humans, they are excellent candidates for drug targeting. What is presently known about the AEP biosynthetic pathway and the three enzymes that catalyze it has resulted from a “patch-work” effort. The AEP biosynthetic pathway was first discovered in Tetrahymena pyriformis (14Barry R.J. Bowman E. McQueney M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Liang C.R. Rosenberg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 156: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Warren W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 156: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). In this organism, AEP is incorporated into phosphonolipids, which form the plasma membrane. The AEP pathway was shown to consist of the three steps depicted in Fig. 3. In the first step of the reaction, P-enolpyruvate is converted to phosphonopyruvate (Ppyr). P-enolpyruvate mutase, the enzyme that catalyzes this step, has been isolated from several different organisms and characterized (18Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10270-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The conversion of P-enolpyruvate to Ppyr is thermodynamically unfavorable (K eq ∼ 1 × 10–3), and thus, the ensuing decarboxylation step catalyzed by Ppyr decarboxylase is required to drive the Ppyr-forming reaction forward. The T. pyriformis Ppyr decarboxylase is membranebound and difficult to isolate for characterization (21Kim J.B. Investigations of 2-Aminoethylphosphonate Biosynthetic Enzymes in Tetrahymena Pyriformis. Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, MD1994Google Scholar). What we do know about this enzyme derives from the study of the bacterial enzyme which functions in biosynthetic pathways leading to bialaphos, fosfomycin, and phosphinothricin tripeptide in Streptomyces hygroscopicus (22Nakashita H. Kozuka K. Hidaka T. Hara O. Seto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Streptomyces wendmorensis (23Thompson C.J. Seto H. Biotechnology. 1995; 28: 197-222PubMed Google Scholar, 24Seto H. Kuzuyama T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and Streptomyces viridomogenes (25Schwartz D. Recktenwald J. Pelzer S. Wohlleben W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In these pathways, P-enolpyruvate mutase and Ppyr decarboxylase collaborate to form the common precursor phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald). The S. hygroscopis Ppyr decarboxylase has been isolated and its native size and its cofactor requirement (viz. thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg(II)) have been defined (26Nakashita H. Watanabe K. Hara O. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 212-219Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As with the Ppyr decarboxylase of Tetrahymena pyriformis, the third enzyme of the pathway, Pald transaminase proved to be membrane-bound and difficult to isolate. Using partially purified enzyme, Kim (21Kim J.B. Investigations of 2-Aminoethylphosphonate Biosynthetic Enzymes in Tetrahymena Pyriformis. Ph.D. thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, MD1994Google Scholar) was able to demonstrate catalysis of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination of Pald with l-alanine functioning as the ammonium group donor. A related transaminase can be found in bacteria adapted for the use of AEP as an alternate source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Because the physiological reaction is catalyzed in the direction of Pald formation, this enzyme has become known as AEP transaminase (27Cassaigne A. Lacoste A.M. Neuzil E. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. Ser. D Sci. Nat. 1976; 282: 1637-1639PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jiang W. Metcalf W.W. Lee K.S. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Parker G.F.

It, too, is dependent on pyridoxal phosphate; however, the ammonium group acceptor is not pyruvate but rather l-glutamate (32Kim A.D. Baker A.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Metcalf W.W. Wanner B.L. Martin B.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4134-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the bacterial AEP transaminase shares sufficient sequence identity with the B. fragilis Pald transaminase to indicate that the two enzymes share common ancestry. The AEP pathway enzymes of B. fragilis have not been isolated for characterization. Our goal was to express the B. fragilis AEP pathway genes in Escherichia coli for purification and study of the three pathway enzymes. In this paper, we report the cloning and overexpression of the B. fragilis Ppyr decarboxylase gene (aepY), purification of the protein, and for the first time, an in-depth study of the Ppyr decarboxylase. Materials—Thiamine pyrophosphate chloride (TPP), dihydro-β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NADH), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, and the buffers used in protein purification and kinetic assays were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Phosphonopyruvate and sulfopyruvate were synthesized according to the published methods (33Anderson V.E. Weiss P.M. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2779-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34White R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5304-5308Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant Bacillus cereus phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase was purified as described previously (35Baker A.S. Ciocci M.J. Metcalf W.W. Kim J. Babbitt P.C. Wanner B.L. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9305-9315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). B. fragilis genomic DNA was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 25285D). The primers used in PCR-based DNA amplification were custom synthesized at Invitrogen. For the cloning of the phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase gene, the sequence of the 5′ to 3′ primer was ATTCAGACGCATATGGTAAGTGTA and that of the 3′ to 5′ primer was TCTTTCTTTGGATCCTCATGAATGCGT, with the introduced restriction sites underlined. The enzymes used in DNA manipulation were purchased from Invitrogen and used with the buffers provided. PCR-based Cloning of Phosphonopyruvate Decarboxylase Gene—The genomic DNA template was denatured (30 min at 94 °C) before adding Pfu DNA polymerase. The target gene was amplified by 20 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 1 min, 55 °C annealing for 50 s, and 73 °C elongation for 3.5 min. The PCR product was purified by electrophoresis and digested using NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes. The digest was ligated to an NdeI- and BamHI-cut pET 3a vector. The resulting clone, named bf-Pyrdecarb-pET 3a, was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. The gene sequence was verified by DNA sequencing carried at the Center for Genetics in Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM. Protein Purification—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, transformed with the named bf-Pyrcarb-pET 3a clone, were grown to 1 A 600 nm at 22 °C in 1.2 liters × 4-LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Following an 8-h induction period with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6500 rpm, 4 °C (all purification steps were carried out at 4 °C except where noted). The cell pellet was suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm K+HEPES containing 5 mm MgCl2 and1mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (referred to as buffer A, hereafter). Cells were lysed at 1000 p.s.i. in a French pressure cell and then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 40–85% fraction was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in buffer A for overnight dialysis against buffer A. The dialysate was chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose column (3.0 × 60 cm) (equilibrated with buffer A) using a 1.4-liter linear gradient of KCl (0.15–0.60 m) in buffer A as eluant. The Ppyr decarboxylase-containing fractions (eluted at ∼0.35–0.40 m KCl) were identified using the spectrophotometric activity assay (described in the following section) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The desired Ppyr decarboxylase-containing fractions were combined and chromatographed on a hydroxylapatite column (3.0 × 40 cm) equilibrated with buffer A, using a 1.4-liter linear gradient of phosphate (0–0.25 m) in buffer A as eluant. Column fractions containing the Ppyr decarboxylase (eluted at ∼0.08–0.12 m phosphate) in >95% purity (as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) were combined and concentrated in 50 mm K+HEPES buffer containing 5mm MgCl2,1mm MnCl2,and1mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (buffer B) for storage at –80 °C. Yield: 3.7 mg/g wet cell (or 22 mg of cell culture/liter). Site-directed Mutants—The site-directed mutants E213A, D258A, and D260A were prepared by PCR and commercial primers using the clone bf-Pyrdecarb-pET 3a as a template. The PCR product was purified by electrophoresis and digested using NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes. The digest was ligated to an NdeI- and BamHI-cut pET 3a vector and then used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The gene sequence was verified by DNA sequencing carried out at the Center for Genetics in Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine. The mutant proteins were prepared in the same manner as the wild-type Ppyr decarboxylase. The yield of the homogenous mutant proteins (as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) are: 4 mg/g wet cell (or 20 mg of cell culture/liter) E213A, 5 mg/g wet cell (or 25 mg of cell culture/liter) D258A, and 3.5 mg/g wet cell (or 16 mg of cell culture/liter) D260A. Ppyr Decarboxylase Molecular Size Determination—The molecular mass was calculated from the amino acid composition, derived from the gene sequence, by using the EXPASY Molecular Biology Server program Compute pI/MW (36Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The molecular mass was measured by mass spectrometry (Biopolymer Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, Weill Medical College of Cornell University) and by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel and 12% separating gel). Commercial protein molecular weight standards were used to generate a plot of log M r versus distance traveled on the gel. The size of native Ppyr decarboxylase was estimated by gel filtration column chromatography (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences Biotech Superdex 200-column, eluted at 4 °C with 25 mm K+HEPES, 0.15 M KCl, pH 7.5). Commercial protein molecular weight standards were used to generate a plot of log M r versus elution volume from the column. Metal Ion Activation—The metal ion-free protein (3 mg/ml) was prepared by exhaustive dialysis against 50 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.5, 4 °C) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20 mm EDTA. The dialyzed protein was then concentrated to 10 mg/ml for kinetic study. The 1-ml reaction mixture contained 50 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.3, 25 °C), 50 μm Ppyr, 0.15 mm NADH, 1.5 mm TPP, 1 μm wild-type phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, 10 units of alcohol dehydrogenase, 0.02 μm metal-free Ppyr decarboxylase, and various concentrations of metal ions. The reactions were monitored at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6,200 m–1 cm–1). The initial velocity data were fitted to Equation 1 to obtain the dissociation constant (Km) for the enzyme-metal ion complex, V0=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) where [S] is the metal ion concentration, V 0 is the initial velocity, V max is the maximum velocity, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (or in this case the Kd). Thiamine Pyrophosphate Activation—The 1-ml reaction mixture contained 50 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.3, 25 °C), 50 μm Ppyr, 0.15 mm NADH, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 μm wild-type phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, 10 units of alcohol dehydrogenase, 0.02 μm of dialyzed Ppyr decarboxylase (prepared as described above), and various concentrations of TPP. The reactions were monitored at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6,200 m–1 cm–1). The initial velocity data were fitted to Equation 1 to obtain the dissociation constant for the TPP-enzyme complex. Steady-state Kinetic Constant Determination—The Km and k cat values for wild-type and mutant Ppyr decarboxylase catalysis were determined from the initial velocity data measured as a function of phosphonopyruvate concentration. The 1 ml of reaction solution contained varying concentrations of phosphonopyruvate (0.5–10 Km),5mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.15 mm NADH, 1.5 mm TPP, 1 μm wild-type phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, and 10 units of alcohol dehydrogenase in 50 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.3, 25 °C). Reactions were monitored at 340 nm. The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1, wherein [S] is the phosphonopyruvate concentration. The k cat was calculated from V max and the enzyme concentration using the equation k cat = V max/[E]. The enzyme concentration was determined using the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). pH-Rate Profile Determination—The initial velocity data were measured as a function of the reaction pH by using the following buffers at the indicated pH values: 50 mm MES (pH 6.0–6.8), 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.8–8.0), and 50 mm TAPS (pH 8.0–8.7). Each buffer solution contained 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2 at a total chloride concentration of 75 mm (adjusted with 2 m KCl). At pH values where the reaction buffers were switched, the kinetic measurement was made with each of the two buffers to test for a possible buffer effect on the reaction rate. The k cat and k cat/Km values were determined as described in the previous section and fitted to Equation 2 using the computer program KaleidaGraph, logY=log(C/(1+[H]/Ka+Kb/[H]))(Eq. 2) where Y is k cat or k cat/Km , [H] is the hydrogen ion concentration, C is the k cat or k cat/Km value where it does not change with pH. Ka is the acid dissociation constant, and Kb is the base dissociation constant. Screening of Alternative Substrates and Inhibitors—Substrate activity was observed with pyruvate and sulfopyruvate. The pyruvate reaction was monitored at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6,200 m–1 cm–1) by using the alcohol dehydrogenase/NADH coupling system. The 1 ml of reaction mixture contained 50 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.3, 25 °C), 5 mm MgCl2,1mm MnCl2, 0.15 mm NADH, 1.5 mm TPP, 1.8 μm Ppyr decarboxylase, 10 units of alcohol dehydrogenase, and various concentrations of pyruvate (3–50 mm). The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1. The sulfopyruvate reaction was monitored by 1H NMR. Sulfopyruvate (1 mm) was incubated for 1.5 h in 1 ml of D2O containing 0.5 μm Ppyr decarboxylase, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm TPP, and 10 mm K+HEPES (pD 7.6, 25 °C) before recording the NMR spectrum. 1H NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker Advance 500-MHz NMR spectrometer using D2O as the solvent and at a probe temperature of 24–26 °C. The chemical shift data are reported with respect to the external reference (trimethysilyl)-propanesulfonic acid for 1H NMR. Control reactions were carried out under the same conditions, except that Ppyr decarboxylase was omitted. Pald Inhibition of Ppyr Decarboxylase Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Pyruvate—The 1-ml reaction mixtures contained 50 mm K+HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm pyruvate, 10 units of alcohol dehydrogenase, 0.15 mm NADH, 1.5 mm TPP, 1.8 μm decarboxylase, and various concentrations of Pald (0–300 μm). Initial velocities were measured at 340 nm and analyzed using Dixon Equation 3 for a competitive inhibition pattern, 1v=KmVmax[S]Ki[I]+1Vmax1+Km[S](Eq. 3) where v is the initial velocity, V max is the maximum velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration (here it is 10 mm pyruvate), Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant of pyruvate, [I] is the inhibitor concentration and Ki is the inhibition constant. Protein Purification and Size Determination—The DNA sequence of the cloned gene agreed with the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF285774_6). The recombinant Ppyr decarboxylase was purified to homogeneity (see Fig. 4) by using the 4-step protocol summarized in Table I in an overall yield of 3.7 mg/g wet cells. The steady-state kinetic constants for catalyzed decarboxylation of phosphonopyruvate are:k cat = 10.2 ± 0.3 s–1; Km = 3.2 ± 0.2 μm; and k cat/Km = 3.2 × 106 s–1m–1, as determined at 25 °C under optimal reaction conditions (viz. pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 200 μm TPP).Table IExperimental protocal for purification of B. fragilis Ppyr decarboxylase from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, transformed with the bf-Pyrcarb-pET 3a clonePurification stepsTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityActivity recoveryPurificationgunits aOne activity unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 μmol of Pald/min in 50 mm K+HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm TPP at 25 °C.units/mg%activity-foldExtract from 30 g of wet cells1062000.62100Ammonium sulfate (40-85%)235001.8603DEAE-Sepharose0.20220010.53517Hydroxylapatite0.11134412.12020a One activity unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 μmol of Pald/min in 50 mm K+HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm TPP at 25 °C. Open table in a new tab The theoretical molecular weight of the phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase calculated from the amino acid sequence was 41,184, which agrees with the experimental molecular weight of 41,199, measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The subunit size estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis was 40 kDa compared with the native protein size of 120 kDa determined by gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the quaternary structure of Ppyr decarboxylase appears to be homotrimeric. (The S. hygroscopicus native Ppyr decarboxylase molecular size was reported as 135 kDa (26Nakashita H. Watanabe K. Hara O. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 212-219Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). Sequence Homologs—At the time of this writing, there are a total of seven Ppyr decarboxylase sequences listed in the Protein Data Bank. The Ppyr decarboxylase-encoding genes in B. fragilis (NCBI protein data bank ID code AAG26466) (378 amino acids), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (NCBI protein data bank ID code NP_810632) (374 amino acids), Amycolatopsis orientalis (NCBI protein data bank ID code CAB45023) (371 amino acids), and Clostridium tetani E88 (NCBI protein data bank ID code NP_782297) (376 amino acids) are positioned between the genes encoding homologs of P-enolpyruvate mutase and AEP transaminase. Pairwise sequence alignments made with the B. fragilis Ppyr decarboxylase (which activity has been demonstrated in this work) demonstrated 76, 35, and 43% sequence identity, respectively. The other three Ppyr decarboxylases (401, 384, and 397 amino acids long, respectively) function in the bialaphos, fosfomycin, and phosphinothricin tripeptide biosynthetic pathways of S. hygroscopicus (22Nakashita H.

Recktenwald J. Pelzer S. Wohlleben W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. A pairwise sequence alignment of these three Ppyr decarboxylases with the Ppyr decarboxylase from B. fragilis identified 34, 50, and 32% sequence identities, respectively. A ClustalW-based sequence alignment of the seven Ppyr decarboxylase sequences identified 61 stringently conserved residues (16%). A total of 26 of the 61 stringently conserved residues are polar and, thus, are potential candidates for catalytic residues and for substrate- or cofactor-binding residues. The B. fragilis Ppyr decarboxylase sequence was used as the query in a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search of the gene data bank for protein homologs. The sulfopyruvate decarboxylase of the coenzyme M pathway, found in methane-forming bacteria (38DiMarco A.A. Bobik T.A. Wolfe R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 355-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), was identified as the closest homolog. Studies of the sulfopyruvate decarboxylase from Methanococcus jannaschii (39Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4862-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that the native enzyme is a dodecamer of 6 α-subunits (ComD 169 amino acids long; 34% sequence identity with the N-terminal half of the Ppyr decarboxylase) and 6 β-subunits (ComE 169 amino acids long; 39% sequence identity with the C-terminal half of Ppyr decarboxylase). It may be inferred that the α- and β-subunits of the sulfopyruvate decarboxylase correspond to N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the Ppyr decarboxylase. Sulfopyruvate decarboxylase (39Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4862-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Ppyr decarboxylase are more distant members of a family of TPP- and Mg(II)-dependent decarboxylases that includes acetohydroxy acid synthase/acetolactate synthase (40Chipm"
https://openalex.org/W2089420008,"We have previously shown that the clinically relevant polyamine analog N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) causes rapid apoptosis in human melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells via a series of events that include mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of the caspase cascade. Upstream to these events, DENSPM downregulates polyamine biosynthesis and potently upregulates polyamine catabolism at the level of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). In searching for downstream effectors that either contribute to or abrogate the apoptotic response, we observed that DENSPM treatment of SK-MEL-28 cells for 30 h led to cytosolic release of Smac/Diablo, a mitochondrial protein known to bind and inhibit the function of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Subsequently, we found that DENSPM markedly lowered survivin and ML-IAP protein (but not XIAP) levels by 18 h via an apparently Smac/Diablo-independent pathway. Proteasome inhibitors fully prevented survivin and ML-IAP protein loss as well as apoptosis, suggesting that the proteasome-mediated degradation of survivin and ML-IAP is causally linked to the cellular outcome. We also observed that structural analogs of DENSPM which differentially induced SSAT and apoptosis lowered survivin and ML-IAP levels in a manner that correlated with enzyme activity. The linkage between IAPs and SSAT was more directly established by the finding that selective prevention of SSAT induction by small interfering RNA prevented survivin and ML-IAP loss as well as apoptosis during DENSPM treatment. Among the melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-28, MALME-3M, A375 and LOX), survivin degradation correlated temporally with the onset of DENSPM induced apoptosis or growth inhibition. By contrast, ML-IAP degradation occurred only during rapid apoptosis seen in SK-MEL-28 cells. These data suggest a sequence of events whereby DENSPM induction of SSAT leads to loss of IAP proteins and a more fulminate apoptotic response. The findings implicate survivin and ML-IAP as important determinants of polyamine analog drug action in melanoma cells."

Circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a predominant surface antigen on sporozoite surface, has been associated with the binding and invasion of liver cells by the sporozoites. Although CSP across the Plasmodium genus has homology and conserved structural organization, infection of a non-natural host by a species is rare. We investigated the role of CSP in providing the host specificity in P. falciparum infection. CSP from P. falciparum, P. gallinaceum, P. knowlesi, and P. yoelii species representing human, avian, simian, and rodent malaria species were recombinantly expressed, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. The recombinant proteins were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human liver cell line HepG2 and to prevent P. falciparum sporozoites from invading these cells. The proteins showed significant differences in the binding and sporozoite invasion inhibition activity. Differences among proteins directly correlate with changes in the binding affinity to the sporozoite receptor on liver cells. P. knowlesi CSP (PkCSP) and P. yoelii CSP (PyCSP) had 4,790- and 17,800-fold lower affinity for heparin in comparison to P. falciparum CSP (PfCSP).

Malaria infection in humans is initiated with the bite of an infectious female mosquito, which inject sporozoites of Plasmodium species into the circulation. These sporozoites rapidly bind and invade liver cells and undergo rapid multiplication, leading to the release of thousands of infective merozoites (1Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B.

Out of more than 20 well documented and characterized species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in various vertebrates, only four species viz., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale infect humans. It is intriguing that, although numerous parasite surface antigens involved in infectivity and pathogenesis possess inter-species homology and have been identified in numerous humans, rodents, and simian Plasmodium species (2Dame J.B.

Most of these infections have been induced by inoculating erythrocytic stage parasites or salivary gland-isolated sporozoites in splenectomized animals and with a parasite load not seen in malaria endemic areas (7Schmidt L.H.

Initiation of a human malaria infection by sporozoites in Aotus monkeys through the natural course (bites of infected mosquitoes) has not been successful. Maintenance of host specificity is an important aspect of pathogenicity and sustenance of an infection. It generally involves a complex interplay between pathogen and host factors, which are influenced by various evolutionary and genetic determinants. Understanding which parasite components play a role in host specificity can provide information about the pathogenesis and can also help in disease control.

The protein can be divided into three regions of roughly equal sizes; the amino terminus, a central repeat segment, and a carboxyl terminus region containing a conserved TSR domain (schematic in Fig. 1). The TSR domain is present in a large number of proteins and performs diverse functions (14Naitza S. Spano F. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. Parasitol.

We have recently demonstrated that in P. falciparum amino terminus of the CSP is involved in the binding and invasion process of the sporozoites. The amino terminus has regions of homology that are conserved across the species (3McCutchan T.F. Kissinger J.C. Touray M.G. Rogers M.J. Li J. Sullivan M. Braga E.M. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. Proc.

In the present study we have investigated the role of CSP in maintaining the host specificity during the invasion of liver cells by the P. falciparum parasite, a critical step in initiating the malaria infection in humans. The sensor chip used in the SPR studies was a Pioneer Chip C1, which was obtained from Biacore (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) along with N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N-(dimethyaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and the sodium acetate immobilization buffer. Bovine serum albumin was from Amresco (Solon, OH). The albumin-heparin conjugate, HEPES, NaCl, Tween 20, EDTA, glycine, and guanidine were acquired through Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant CS protein of P. falciparum (16Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect.

DNA encoding P. gallinaceum mature CS protein was amplified as a NdeI-EcoRI fragment by PCR and cloned in pET11a, a T7 promoterbased Escherichia coli expression vector. Protein expression was done using E. coli strain BL21(λDE3). Cells were transformed and grown in super broth (pH 7.2), containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C with shaking. At an A 600 of 2.0, the cells were induced with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 4 h later, they were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min. Total cell pellet was resuspended in washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA) containing lysozyme at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Cell suspension was incubated at room temperature, for 1 h with intermittent shaking. NaCl and Triton X-100 were added to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 m and 2.5%, respectively, and the suspension was further incubated at room temperature for 30 min, with vigorous shaking. This suspension was then spun at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, for 50 min, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in washing buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, using a Tissuemizer, and spun at 13,000 × g for 50 min. The pellet was washed repeatedly in washing buffer, without Triton X-100. After four washings, the pellet containing inclusion bodies was dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and incubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g at 4 °C, for 30 min. Supernatant, containing denatured protein, was collected, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Denatured protein was reduced by adding dithioerythritol, to a final concentration of 65 mm, and incubating at room temperature for 2 h. Protein was renatured by diluting 100-fold, in refolding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 ml-arginine-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.9 mm oxidized glutathione) (18Rathore D. Nayak S.K. Batra J.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After incubating at 10 °C for 36 h, renatured material was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm urea. The renatured protein was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column, and eluted by a salt gradient using a fast-protein liquid chromatography system. Relevant fractions were pooled and purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography on a TSK 3000 column. DNA encoding PyCSP was cloned in a Yeast expression vector with a histidine tag at its 3′-end. 2S. Kumar, unpublished data. The construct was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell line VK1. The protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column using imidazole followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Circular dichroism polarimetry was utilized to investigate the secondary structure of recombinant CSP. Equimolar amounts of recombinant CSP in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were separately scanned in the far-UV range, at 25 °C, using a JASCO J710 spectropolarimeter. This secondary structure was calculated using Yang's reference parameters (19Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 186: 208-269Crossref Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Hepatoma cell line HepG2, maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 2 mm glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was used, and the assay was performed as described previously (1Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at a density of 100,000 cells per well were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by blocking with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Proteins were incubated with cells for 1 h followed by anti-CS antibody for 45 min and alkaline phosphatase-coupled conjugate for 30 min. Because anti-CS antibody for each protein is different, a dilution of each of these antiserum giving an optical density of 1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the analysis. 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate was used as substrate, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorometer with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 460 nm. HepG2 cells were treated with log dilutions of heparinase I or buffer (100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm calcium chloride) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed thrice with Tris-buffered saline followed by addition of 50 nm recombinant protein and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence was measured as described above. HepG2 cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in complete medium. 50,000 cells were added to each well of ECL-coated Labtek slides and incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow them to adhere. P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoites were isolated from infected Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. 20,000 sporozoites were added to the HepG2 cells immediately followed by the addition of different concentration of recombinant CS protein and incubated for 3 h. Cells were subsequently washed and fixed with cold methanol. P. falciparum CS anti-repeat region monoclonal antibody (NFS1) was added followed by anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate to stain the sporozoites. Intracellular sporozoites were identified and counted, and the percent inhibition of invasion was calculated with the following formula [(control–test)/control] × 100. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed using a Biacore® 3000 biosensing system, which was operated with Biacore Control 3.2 software. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Buffers were filtered and degassed prior to use in each experiment. Preparation of the Sensor Chip—Albumin-heparin was immobilized to the sensor surface using a previously published procedure (20Zhang F. Fath M. Marks R. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sensor chip surface was activated with an equimolar mix of N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N-(dimethyaminopropyl)carbodiimide followed by the immobilization of albumin-heparin conjugate and blocking of unreacted sites with ethanolamine. The albumin-heparin conjugate was immobilized in two flow cells, one of which contained 80 response units (RUs) of material and the other, 200 RU. Bovine serum albumin was immobilized to the sensor surface in a similar fashion to serve as a control. The sensor surface in the fourth flow cell was activated, and then deactivated, and it served as the reference surface for detecting changes in the bulk refractive index, injection noise, baseline drift, and nonspecific binding. Interaction Studies—Concentrated CS protein samples were serially diluted with HBS buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4) yielding concentrations ranging from 5 nm to 8 μm. Samples were injected over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 1 to 2 min. The sensor surface was regenerated using a glycine-NaOH mixture (5 mm glycine, pH 11.5, 15 s) and an 80-μl injection of 2 m NaCl. Each prepared sample was injected over the sensor chip three times in random order to prevent bias in the data. All experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Evaluation of Data—The binding of CS protein to heparin was determined using double referencing (21Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Although the albumin-CS protein interactions were small (∼ 2 RU), the data were further corrected for this component of the interaction. The kinetic rate constants (ka and kd) and the affinity constant (K = ka /kd) were determined by applying global analysis to both the association and dissociation phases simultaneously according to a two stage reaction (A + B = AB = AB*) using BIAevaluation software, version 3.1 (1999). Selection of a reasonable model for evaluating the interaction data was based on the ability to return consistent values for the estimated parameters for the two different levels of surface immobilized albumin-heparin conjugate. Only the two-stage reaction model proved to meet this criterion. The equilibrium constants (KD values) were calculated by taking the inverse of the estimated affinity constants (KD = 1/K = (kd 1/ka 1) * (kd 2/ka 2)), and the reported KD values are the averaged values obtained from both heparin-coated surfaces. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant CS Proteins—Recombinant CSP from four different species of Plasmodium representing human, rodent, simian, and avian malaria species were recombinantly expressed, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. DNA encoding PfCSP, PkCSP, and PgCSP were in pET11a, a T7 promoter-based E. coli expression vector. Both PfCSP and PkCSP were secreted into the periplasm, which was used as a source to obtain the purified protein, as previously described (16Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Rogers W.O. Weiss W.R. Kumar A. Aguiar J.C. Tine J.A. Gwadz R. Harre J.G. Gowda K. Rathore D. Kumar S. Hoffman S.L. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both the proteins were initially purified on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column followed by gel filtration chromatography, to obtain the purified protein (see online supplemental data). Recombinant PgCSP was predominantly present in the spheroplast as inclusion bodies (data not shown). Inclusion bodies were isolated from the spheroplast, solubilized using guanidine hydrochloride and reduced by adding dithioerythritol. The protein was subsequently renatured in vitro in a redox system using oxidized glutathione (18Rathore D. Nayak S.K. Batra J.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein was purified to homogeneity by successive chromatography on anion exchange and gel filtration columns. PyCSP was initially purified on a nickel column followed by gel filtration chromatography. Structural Analysis of Purified CS Proteins—The secondary structure of the recombinant proteins was evaluated by CD polarimetry. The far-UV CD spectra of purified CS proteins was obtained and compared. All four recombinant CS proteins had similar profiles with a major peak at 200 nm, suggesting a weakly ordered structure due to the predominant presence of random coil structures in the protein (see online supplemental data). Estimation of the secondary structure revealed that the all the four different CS proteins have inherently similar folding patterns. More than 50% of each of the protein has a random coil confirmation, whereas the remainder was primarily folded into beta sheet and turns (Table I). Similar results have been obtained by analyzing the CS polypeptides from several species (22Fasman G.D. Park K. Schlesinger D.H. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23Roggero M.A. Filippi B. Church P. Hoffman S.L. Blum-Tirouvanziam U. Lopez J.A. Esposito F. Matile H. Reymond C.D. Fasel N. Corradin G. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which suggests that the proteins are able to obtain a proper conformation.Table ISecondary structure estimation of CS protein from different speciesP. falciparumP. gallinaceumP. knowlesiP. yoeliiHelical0.010.00.00.0β-Sheet27.337.147.029.6Turn7.40.00.015.8Coil65.353.053.054.6 Open table in a new tab Binding Analysis of CS Proteins on HepG2 Cells—The binding activity of the four CS proteins was evaluated on HepG2 cells. An equimolar concentration of four different CS proteins was added onto the HepG2 cells followed by the addition of respective anti-CS antibodies. PfCSP was then bound to HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Like P. falciparum CSP, PgCSP, the CS protein from avian malaria parasite P. gallinaceum, also showed dose-dependent binding onto these cells, although its activity was 50% lower in comparison to PfCSP. In contrast, PkCSP and PyCSP from simian and rodent malaria parasites, respectively, showed significantly reduced binding even at the highest concentration (Fig. 2). Specificity of PgCSP Binding to HepG2 Cells—PfCSP interacts with HSPG-based receptors on liver cells (24Pancake S.J. Holt G.D. Mellouk S. Hoffman S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One possible reason for the binding of PgCSP to HepG2 cells could be the involvement of a different cell surface component that by coincidence can serve as a receptor. To investigate whether PgCSP utilized HSPG-based receptors on HepG2 cells for its interaction, binding was assayed on liver cells devoid of HSPG. HepG2 cells were pretreated with heparinase I, an enzyme that cleaves heparin and highly sulfated domains in heparan sulfate, and the binding activity of PfCSP and PgCSP was investigated. Binding of both PgCSP and PfCSP was completely inhibited on heparinase I-treated HepG2 cells, indicating that the receptor specificity is maintained and, like PfCSP, PgCSP binding was also mediated through heparinase I-sensitive liver cells receptors (Fig. 3). Inhibition of Sporozoite Invasion by Recombinant Proteins—To evaluate whether the differences in binding capacity of the CSP from four species toward the human liver cells is a mode of maintaining the biological specificity, the potential of these proteins to putatively compete for receptors and prevent the invasion of HepG2 cells by live P. falciparum sporozoites was investigated. P. falciparum sporozoites were freshly isolated from A. stephensi mosquitoes and were immediately incubated with HepG2 cells in the absence or presence of different concentrations of each of the four CSP. HepG2 cells closely mimics the in vivo environment, because sporozoites are able to successfully invade and develop intracellular hepatic stages of the life cycle. PfCSP inhibited sporozoite invasion by 70% at the lowest concentration tested and showed complete inhibition (>90%) at the higher concentration (Fig. 4). PgCSP corroborated the results of the binding assay and showed significant (60–70%) sporozoite invasion inhibition activity, which was comparable to the invasion inhibition activity of PfCSP. In contrast, PkCSP and PyCSP showed minimal inhibition (20–30%) even at the highest concentration. These results suggested that a difference in the liver cell invasion potential of different CSP is directly involved in maintaining the species specificity of infection. Binding Affinity of CS Proteins Toward Its Receptor—To facilitate binding and invasion of liver cells, sporozoites exploit HSPG-based receptors on liver cells. We have recently quantified the binding affinity of PfCSP toward different glycosaminoglycans and shown that the protein has the highest affinity for heparin (26Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Garboczi D.N. Toida T. Hernaiz M.J. LeBrun L.A. Lang S.C. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11518-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The differences in the binding and sporozoite invasion inhibition activities of the four CSP proteins could be due to differences in binding affinity toward heparin. We investigated and quantified the interactions of CSP with heparin by surface plasmon resonance. An albumin-heparin chip was constructed by linking the primary amino groups in albumin to the activated carboxyl groups on the chip, to mimic a cell surface proteoglycan. PfCSP showed the highest affinity with significant binding at a concentration of 5 nm. At a concentration of 100 nm, the general shape of the binding curve changed, which suggested that protein-protein interactions became a significant contributing factor. For this reason, sample concentrations ranging up to 40 nm were selected for evaluation of the heparin and PfCSP interaction to minimize the contribution from PfCSP-PfCSP interactions. The apparent KD for this interaction was determined as 0.34 ± 0.437 nm (Fig. 5A and Table II). PgCSP demonstrated a similar, but lower, affinity for heparin with an estimated KD of 15.3 ± 7.28 nm (Fig. 5B and Table II). Association of PkCSP with heparin was measurable only at higher concentrations (>100 nm) (Fig. 5C) with a binding affinity of 1690 ± 537 nm (Table II). PyCSP showed minimal association with heparin (Fig. 5D) and consequently its binding affinity was 6060 ± 2475 nm (Table II). This clearly suggested that the differences in the binding affinity of these proteins toward the liver cell receptor are contributing toward maintaining the specificity of malaria infection.Table IIBinding affinity of CSP from different species to heparinCSPk a1k d1k p2k d2KKDK DaverageChi2I/m-sI/sI/sI/sI/mmmP. falciparumLCS543,000 ± 2,3709.14E - 04 ± 8.08E - 060.00153 ± 1.39E - 052.83E - 05 ± 2.60E - 053.21E + 103.12E - 113.40E - 10 ± 4.37E - 1012HCS318,000 ± 2,3300.00170 ± 2.07E - 040.00725 ± 7.84E - 048.78E - 04 ± 8.09E - 059.95E + 076.49E - 1041.6P. gallinaceumLCS31,500 ± 1660.01110 ± 2.73E - 040.01620 ± 1.71E - 040.00105 ± 1.16E - 054.89E + 072.04E - 081.53E - 08 ± 7.28E - 097.91HCS26,800 ± 87.51.87E - 03 ± 3.5E - 056.05E - 03 ± 1.18E - 048.74E - 04 ± 3.27E - 059.95E + 071.01E - 0818.3P. knowlesiLCS24,100 ± 19.30.00114 ± 9.88E - 072.30E - 05 ± 2.63E - 080.00101 ± 1.17E - 064.83E + 052.07E - 061.69E - 06 ± 5.37E - 0719.6HCS24,400 ± 1024.78E - 04 ± 2.80E - 061.36E - 06 ± 5.84E - 069.06E - 05 ± 7.16E - 057.64E + 051.31E - 0621.6P. yoeliiLCS24,700 ± 6260.0665 ± 0.002840.0128 ± 0.0008980.0198 ± 9.55E - 042.32E + 054.31E - 066.06E - 06 ± 2.47E - 060.107HCS5,870 ± 1070.0339 ± 0.001050.00909 ± 4.88E - 040.0123 ± 3.87E - 041.28E + 057.81E - 060.235 Open table in a new tab Malaria sporozoite enters into a human body by the bite of an infected mosquito. Numerically, the sporozoite stage is the weakest link in the parasite lifecycle, because a very small population of the parasite enters into the host, makes its way to the host liver cells, and interacts with a specific host receptor for subsequent invasion and intra-hepatocytic development. One therefore assumes that this process of invasion must go efficiently in a natural environment to produce an infection. We investigated the role of CSP from four well characterized species of Plasmodium genus viz. P. falciparum (human), P. gallinaceum (avian), P. knowlesi (simian), and P. yoelii (rodent) in determining the host specificity of malaria infection in P. falciparum model. The proteins were expressed recombinantly, purified to homogeneity, and evaluated for their propensities to bind to HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, and stop the invasion of live P. falciparum sporozoites. PfCSP, being a human-parasite protein, effectively bound to HepG2 cells (Fig. 2) and completely prevented P. falciparum sporozoites from invading them (Fig. 4). PgCSP, although being an avian CSP, also bound to HepG2 cells (Fig. 2) and stopped P. falciparum sporozoites from invading these cells (Fig. 4), with an activity comparable to the PfCSP. PgCSP bound these cells using HSPG-based cell surface receptor, suggesting a receptor specificity identical to PfCSP (Fig. 3). In contrast, PkCSP and PyCSP were deficient in binding to these cells (Fig. 2) and showed low activity in sporozoite invasion inhibition assay (Fig. 4). Although these differences in binding and invasion inhibition activities were measured in vitro on a hepatic cell line, they most likely represent a true in vivo scenario as non-natural host infections are rare. We quantified the binding affinity of each of the CSP toward heparin by SPR analysis. The result corroborated the outcome of binding and invasion assay, because binding affinity of PkCSP and PyCSP was considerably lower, 4,790- and 17,800-fold, respectively, in comparison to PfCSP (Fig. 5). CSP-heparin interactions are charge-dependent, involving positively charged residues of the CSP and negatively charged sulfates and carboxylates groups on the sugar. We have recently shown that the CSP binds to the liver cells through its amino terminus, and the tertiary structure of the binding domain is extremely important for its activity (10Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Within the Plasmodium genus, the amino terminus of the CSP shows 20–25% sequence identity (3McCutchan T.F. Kissinger J.C. Touray M.G. Rogers M.J. Li J. Sullivan M. Braga E.M. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11889-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and, although all the four CSP have a preponderance toward beta sheets and turns, a structural conformation commonly found in heparin binding proteins (e.g. fibroblast growth factor) (27Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), we propose that sequence changes incorporated during the course of evolution have resulted in significant differences in the spatial arrangement of residues constituting the binding domain, without causing any significant change in the overall conformation. These changes have caused differences in binding affinities toward the receptor to provide a CSP-based mechanism for maintaining species specificity of infection. This CSP-based selection mechanism seems to work even at the mosquito stages as replacement of P. berghei CSP gene with P. falciparum CSP in P. berghei sporozoites results in a 90% decrease in the salivary gland sporozoite population in comparison to the wild type parasites (28Tewari R. Spaccapelo R. Bistoni F. Holder A.A. Crisanti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47613-47618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously, using in silico phylogenetic analysis with numerous parasite DNA and protein sequences, we and others have proposed that P. falciparum and P. gallinaceum parasites have originated from a common progenitor, whereas the rodent and simian parasites have substantially diverged and form distinct phylogenetic clades (3McCutchan T.F.

Parasitol. 2001; 114: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results from our study not only provide the first biological evidence of the close relationship between the P. gallinaceum and P. falciparum species; it also provides a biological correlation to the distribution of major phylogenetic divisions in the Plasmodium genus. While changes in the CSP sequence between different species could contribute in maintaining the specificity, the host, on its part, could also be contributing by maintaining differences in the sulfated glycosaminoglycans component of the liver cell receptor across different species. It is known that every tissue of a mammalian species has a characteristic heparin composition, differing from other tissues, within and outside the species, in the relative amount, type, and molecular size (32Gomes P.B.

Myocardial ischemia causes intracellular energy depletion, leading to loss of cellular Na+/K+ homeostasis through inhibition of the sarcolemmal (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, resulting ultimately in cellular Ca2+ overload (1Jennings R.B.

All NOS isoforms, including neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOSμ (nNOSμ), have been identified in cardiac muscle (6Kelly R.A. Balligad J.L. Smith T.W.

NO. generated at the sarcolemma by SL NOSs could modulate the activity of SL-associated ion pumps, but whether ischemic dysfunction of SL NOSs directly affects SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity and SL ion active transport has not been studied. The functional relationships among SL NOSs, (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, NO., and SL Na+/K+ ion active transport in normal and diseased hearts have remained open questions. In this study, we show that, like eNOS, nNOS is also tightly associated with the SL membrane in several species. Using an assay of NOS activity, we demonstrate that global ischemia causes a time-dependent irreversible injury to the SL NOSs and a disruption of SL NO. generation. Pretreatment of isolated rat hearts with an NO. donor prior to global ischemia markedly protects SL NOSs and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activities and ion binding to the SL membrane, suggesting that SL NO. may play a crucial role in regulating SL membrane ion active transport. Materials—An NOS-detect assay kit, including reduced NADPH, 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(N-3-methyl-aminopropyl)-3-methyl-1-triazene (NOC-7), calmodulin, FAD, FMN, and tetrahydrobiopterin, was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals; l-arginine and EDTA were from Fluka; [3H]l-arginine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences; anti-eNOS (catalog no.

The anti-nNOSα antibody (specifically recognizing the major α-isoform of nNOS and not the β- or γ-isoforms) and the homozygous mutant nNOS (nNOS –/–) knockout mouse model were from the laboratory of Dr. Ted W.

Isolated Rat Heart Ischemia and Reperfusion—Female Sprague-Dawley retired breeder rats (Harlan Company, Boston, MA) were used for the study, and all experiments were carefully conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. The heart was excised after complete anesthesia (65 mg/kg pentobarbital), and the ascending aorta was rapidly cannulated and the heart perfused. Following an equilibrium period of 15 min to allow for functional stabilization, baseline values of coronary flow left ventricular end diastolic pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and heart rate were measured. After 15 min of baseline coronary flow, the hearts were then subjected to global (no-flow) ischemia in different time courses with or without 45 min of reperfusion. The perfusate solution contained 17 mm glucose, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA. All perfusate solutions were routinely filtered and bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture at 37 °C (13Li H. Xu K.Y. Zhou L. Kalai T. Zweier J.L. Hideg K. Kuppusamy P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar). A side arm in the perfusion line located just proximal to the aortic cannula allowed infusion of drug solutions using a Harvard infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). A balloon was connected via a hydraulic line to an MLT844 physiological pressure transducer with pressures amplified to a Gould four-channel strip chart recorder as well as a personal computer equipped with MacLab data acquisition software. The balloon volume was adjusted to achieve an initial left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 8–12 mm Hg, and all subsequent measurements were performed with the same balloon volume.

Bredt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2424-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This NOC-7 compound spontaneously and non-enzymatically releases NO. at physiological pH with a half-life time of 10 min. Isolation of Cardiac Sarcolemmal Vesicles—Cardiac SL vesicles were isolated from rat, rabbit, and mouse hearts as reported previously (15Xu K.Y. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. The hearts were removed immediately and rinsed in an ice-cold solution containing 10 mm histidine (free base) and 0.75 m NaCl. The hearts were cut into 5-mm pieces and homogenized for 5 s at 14,000 rpm. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 mm NaHCO3 and 5 mm histidine (free base). The pellets were resuspended, homogenized, and centrifuged three times as described above, and the supernatant was discarded to remove the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of the cardiac tissue for the ultimate isolation of SL vesicles free of significant SR contamination. The pellets obtained from the third centrifugation were resuspended in 10 mm NaHCO3 and 5 mm histidine and homogenized three times for 30 s at 15,000 rpm. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant containing partially purified SL vesicles was centrifuged again for 30 min at 20,000 rpm. The pellets were resuspended and layered on top of the 0.6 m sucrose in each tube. The sample was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 54 min in a Beckman Ti70 rotor. After the run, the SL vesicles were observed as distinct snow white protein bands at the interfaces of the 0.25/0.6 m sucrose layers. SL vesicle fractions were then sedimented at 40,000 rpm for 40 min. The final SL membrane suspension was stored frozen at –80 °C. SL vesicles were tested with saponin (16Kyte J. Xu K.Y. Bayer R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8350-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and were predominately right-side-out in orientation. Both anti-phospholamban and anti-ryanodine receptor antibodies were further utilized to test the purity of SL vesicles. No detectable contamination of SR (7Xu K.Y. Huso D.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Becker L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) membrane in isolated cardiac SL vesicles was found by Western blotting under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1, lanes J and L). Western Blotting—An alkaline phosphatase Immun-Blot kit (Bio-Rad) was used for the Western blotting experiments. Three different antibodies were used for nNOS and eNOS immunodetection. The anti-nNOSα antibody was raised against an N-terminal fusion protein encoded by exon 2 of nNOS and specifically recognizes the nNOSα, which is the major isoform of nNOS and dimerizes with itself (17Roskams A.J. Bredt D.S. Dawson T.M. Ronett G.V. Neuron. 1994; 13: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The anti-eNOS antibody showed no cross-reactivity with other NOS isoforms. The anti-uNOS antibody reacts with all three isoforms, iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS. Briefly, samples were dissolved by the Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and separated by electrophoresis on a gel of 5% polyacrylamide (12% gel for phospholamban). The separated polypeptides were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with anti-nNOSα, anti-eNOS, anti-iNOS, or anti-uNOS antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) to which alkaline phosphatase was attached. The distribution of bound antibody was determined by alkaline phosphatase-dependent staining. Determination of NOS Activity—NOS activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline. For routine assays (7Xu K.Y. Huso D.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Becker L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), 0.1 mg of vesicles and 10 μl of 100 nm [3H]arginine were added to 40 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm reduced NADPH, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 μm calmodulin, 2 μm FAD, 2 μm FMN, and 3 μm tetrahydrobiopterin. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 0.4 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, and2mm EGTA, and the reaction mixture was applied to a 1-ml column of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Na+) and eluted with 2 ml of water. The [3H]citrulline, being ionically neutral at pH 5.5, flows through the column completely. Determining the radioactivity in the flow-through quantitated the NOS activity. Determination of (Na + + K + )-ATPase Activity—Sealed SL vesicles were premixed for 12 min at room temperature with 0.5% saponin (16Kyte J. Xu K.Y. Bayer R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8350-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and portions were removed and assayed. Enzymatic activity was defined as the strophanthidin-sensitive hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of Na+ and K+ (18Kyte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 246: 4157-4165Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained enzyme and 3 mm Mg2+ in a final volume of 0.5 ml and was maintained at 37 °C in a water bath. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP (3 mm) and stopped after 30 min by adding 0.75 ml of quench solution and 0.02 ml of developer. The color was allowed to develop for 30 min at room temperature, and the phosphate (reaction product) was determined at 700 nm using a spectrophotometer. EPR Measurements—Spin-trapping measurements of NO radicals were performed in a flat cell at room temperature (7Xu K.Y. Huso D.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Becker L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate, Fe2+, SL vesicles, Ca2+, calmodulin, NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and l-arginine were 5 mm, 1mm, 0.6 mg/ml, 0.2 mm, 0.1 μm, 1 mm, 2 μm, 2 μm, 3 μm, and 2 mm, respectively. The EPR spectrum was recorded immediately after the spin trap solution was infused using an IBM-Bruker ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM110 cavity. The spectrometer settings were as follows: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1 G; scan time, 1.0 min; microwave power, 80 milliwatts; and microwave frequency, 9.7 GHz. Both nNOS and eNOS Are Associated with Cardiac SL Membrane—We first determined the specific isoforms of NOS that are associated with cardiac SL membrane. Using an anti-uNOS antibody, which recognizes all three isoforms of NOS, i.e. iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS, Western blotting revealed that only nNOS (155 kDa) and eNOS (140 kDa) are present in rat, rabbit, and mouse cardiac SL membrane vesicles (Fig. 1, lanes A, B, and C), whereas iNOS was not detected (data not shown). Anti-nNOSα and anti-eNOS antibodies detected nNOS and eNOS from control mouse (wild-type) SL vesicles (Fig. 1, lanes E and G). No immunodetection of nNOS or eNOS was observed in cardiac SL vesicles isolated from knockout nNOS, eNOS, or nNOS/eNOS double knockout mouse models (Fig. 1, lanes D, F, and H). Anti-RyR and anti-PLB recognized RyR (Fig. 1, lane I) and PLB (Fig. 1, lane K) in isolated rat cardiac SR vesicles but failed to detect RyR (Fig. 1, lane J) and PLB (Fig. 1, lane L) in SL vesicles, indicating a high purity of our isolated SL vesicles and suggesting a specific molecular expression of nNOS and eNOS in cardiac SL membrane. Effect of Global Ischemia on SL NOS Function—Next, we examined the effect of ischemia on total SL NOS function. Ca2+-dependent chemical conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline was performed in the presence of the NOS coenzyme and cofactors. Total cardiac SL NOS enzymatic activity decreased significantly from 100% (control) to 52 ± 11%, 30 ± 8%, and 5 ± 3% (Fig. 2A) following 30, 60, and 120 min of ischemia, respectively. The loss of enzymatic activity during ischemia was accompanied by a reduction of SL NO. generation from 100% (control) to 59 ± 29%, 35 ± 18%, and 2 ± 1.5% (Fig. 2B), respectively, following 30, 60, and 120 min of ischemia. To determine whether ischemia affects the binding of nNOS and eNOS to the SL membrane and whether the low NOS activity following ischemia is due to loss of enzyme from the SL membrane, Western blotting experiments were performed using SL vesicles isolated from rat cardiac muscle under various ischemic conditions as shown in Fig. 3. The results demonstrated similar concentrations of SL nNOS and eNOS proteins in the SL membrane vesicles isolated from normal and ischemic hearts following 30, 60, and 120 min of ischemia. This demonstrates the structural stability of NOS isoforms in SL vesicles. To investigate the potential reversibility of ischemic dysfunction of cardiac SL NOS enzymes, ischemia/reperfusion experiments were performed to test the recovery of depressed total SL NOS activity. Fig. 4 shows that ischemia-injured cardiac SL NOS activity did not recover following 45 min reperfusion after 30 or 60 min of ischemia. Global ischemia appeared to cause a time-dependent irreversible injury to cardiac SL NOS function. Role of NO in SL Membrane Enzyme Function—To investigate whether ischemic dysfunction of SL NOSs could affect SL membrane ion active transport, we tested whether NO. selectively protects SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity under various ischemic conditions. We first examined the effect of NOC-7 on cardiac SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase function without ischemia. Isolated rat hearts were perfused with the NO. donor NOC-7 at different concentrations as shown in Fig. 5A. No inhibitory effect of NOC-7 (from 10 ng/kg/min to 150 ng/kg/min) on SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase function was observed as shown in Fig. 5A. We then tested whether perfusion with 10 ng/kg/min NOC-7 would affect enzyme functions under different ischemic conditions. Experimental data show that pretreatment of 10 ng/kg/min NOC-7 provided modest protection to both SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and SL NOS activities; SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was 105 ± 43%, 85 ± 28%, and 71 ± 24% (Fig. 5B) compared with control hearts and 88 ± 37%, 73 ± 48%, and 56 ± 19% for SL NOSs (Fig. 5C) after 20, 40, and 60 min of no-flow ischemia, respectively. However, pretreatment with 30 ng/kg/min NOC-7 markedly protected SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity against ischemia-induced inactivation; enzyme activities remained at 103 ± 36%, 102 ± 22%, and 91 ± 21% following 20, 40, and 60 min of ischemia, respectively. In contrast, (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity decreased to 45 ± 15%, 32 ± 10%, and 15 ± 6% in the absence of the NO. donor under the same ischemic conditions. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that 40 min of global ischemia disrupted the ion binding sites on the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase by reducing the optimal binding of Na+ and K+ ions to the enzyme. The Na+ and K+ binding sites were completely protected by pretreatment of NO-donor NOC-7, further suggesting that NO. generation in cardiac muscle may be crucial to the SL membrane ion active transport. In addition, pretreatment of NOC-7 markedly maintained SL NOS activity at 100 ± 20%, 99 ± 18%, and 94 ± 13% after 20, 40 and 60 min ischemia, respectively, presumably by scavenging toxic oxygen free radicals that were generated during ischemia.Fig. 6(Na+ + K+)-ATPase hydrolysis of ATP as a function of Na+ plus K+ concentrations. Cardiac SL vesicles were isolated from the hearts of control (no ischemia, black circles) and 40 min of ischemia with (open circles) or without NO.-donor NOC-7 (black triangles). Enzyme activity was tested in the presence of 3 mm Mg-ATP under different Na+/K+ concentrations as indicated in the figure. The data show that pretreatment by NOC-7 (30 ng/kg/ml) significantly protected SL Na+/K+ ion binding and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase function against ischemia-induced inactivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The studies reported here show immunochemically that nNOS, as well as eNOS, is tightly associated with cardiac SL membrane vesicles (Figs. 1 and 3). The fact that anti-nNOS and anti-eNOS antibodies recognized nNOS and eNOS in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, lanes E and G) but failed to recognize nNOS and eNOS (Fig. 1, lanes F and H) in SL vesicles from knockout nNOS or eNOS mice and that no immunodetection of nNOS or eNOS were observed in cardiac SL vesicles isolated from nNOS/eNOS double knockout mouse model (Fig. 1, lane D) further confirm our observation that these two NOS isoforms are localized on the cardiac SL membrane. RyR and PLB are SR membrane protein markers. Anti-RyR and anti-PLB anti-bodies recognized RyR (Fig. 1, lane I) and PLB (Fig. 1, lane K) in isolated rat SR vesicles but failed to detect RyR (Fig. 1, lane J) and PLB (Fig. 1, lane L) in isolated SL vesicles, suggesting a specific molecular expression of nNOS and eNOS in cardiac SL membrane. It is generally accepted that eNOS is closely associated with SL on endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes through binding with caveolin-1 and caveolin-3, respectively (19Feron O. Smith T.W.

Miethke et al. detected nNOS in rat atrial cardiomyocyte SL but not in ventricular myocytes (21Miethke A. Feussner M. Planitzer G. Richter H. Gutsmann M. Gossrau R. Acta Histochem. 2003; 105: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hare and co-workers (22Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A.

Nature. 2002; 416: 337-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques of mouse heart homogenates, reported that eNOS precipitated with caveolin-3, whereas nNOS precipitated with the ryanodine receptor. Subcellular localization was not reported (22Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A. Burnett A.L. O'Rourke B. Rodriguez E.R. Huang P.L. Lima J.A. Berkowitz D.E. Hare J.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 337-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that rat skeletal muscle sarcolemma contains an nNOS and synthesizes NO (8Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 23Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Our experimental results extend these reports by identifying subcellular localization of nNOS in cardiac SL membrane from several animal species. In addition, we also detected eNOS resides in SL membrane, which is consistent with previous observations (24Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have examined the effect of ischemia on myocardial function, none have focused on whether ischemia may injure cardiac SL NOS function. Our results show that there is a time-dependent loss of SL NOS activity and SL NO. generation (Fig. 2, A and B) during global ischemia. Thirty minutes of ischemia resulted in an ∼50% loss of SL NOS activity and NO. generation. Similar protein concentrations of SL NOSs from control and ischemic rat hearts were observed by Western blots (Fig. 3), suggesting that decreased SL NOSs activity was not due to loss of NOS binding to the SL membrane. The fact that SL NOS activity did not recover after 45 min of reperfusion (Fig. 4) suggests that global ischemia may induce a time-dependent irreversible injury to SL NOS function. Cardiac SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase (25Skou J.C. Biosci. Rep. 1998; 18: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) is an integral membrane protein that couples the hydrolysis of ATP directly to the vectorial transport of Na+ and K+ ions across the SL membrane. This enzyme controls the contractility of myocardium by regulating intracellular sodium concentration and membrane potential. Dysfunction of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in ischemic myocardial injury may contribute to intracellular calcium overload and persistent depression of heart function. We hypothesized that endogenous NO. generated from cardiac SL NOSs may be a critical protector of SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase function and SL Na+ and K+ ion transport. If the hypothesis is correct, the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity should be resistant to myocardial ischemia when pretreated with a NO. donor. To test our hypothesis, we utilized the NO. donor NOC-7 in isolated rat hearts prior to global ischemia. We do not know what local concentration was achieved by the infusion of the NO. donor, but we chose to use very low concentrations (in the nanogram range) in the hope of achieving a concentration of NO. at the SL membrane, which may have been in the range of what occurs under physiological conditions. Pretreatment with 10 ng/kg/min NOC-7 (61.7 nm; Fig. 5B) completely protected SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase function against 20 min of ischemia-induced injury. Loss of cardiac SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity during 40 min of ischemia was completely prevented by pretreatment with 30 ng/kg/min NOC-7 (185 nm), and significant protection of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was also detected during 60 min of global ischemia. These results suggest that NO. generated from SL NOSs might provide protection in vivo of SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase against oxidative stresses. Cardiac SL (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is responsible for SL membrane Na+ and K+ active transport. Its catalytic activity depends on the hydrolysis of ATP, which relies on the binding of Na+ and K+. Fig. 6 shows that 40 min of ischemia disrupted ion binding sites on the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase by decreasing SL Na+ and K+ binding affinity to the enzyme. In contrast, pretreatment with NOC-7 markedly prevented this injury. These results further support the hypothesis that NO. may play an important role in protecting Na+ and K+ binding and influencing Na+/K+ membrane active transport. Endogenously generated oxygen free radicals can attack cellular structures, resulting in metabolic and structural changes and leading ultimately to dysfunction of the myocardium (26O'Neill C.A. Fu L.W. Halliwell B. Longhurst J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H660-H667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bolli and co-workers have demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals are generated in vivo after myocardial ischemia (27Sun J.Z. Kaur H. Halliwell B. Li X.Y. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1993; 173: 534-549Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exposure of isolated rabbit interventricular septa, isolated rat or rabbit papillary muscles, and isolated rat or rabbit hearts to free radical generating solutions or H2O2 has uniformly resulted in decreased mechanical function and ATP levels (28Kukreja R.C. Hess M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These important observations suggest that toxic oxygen free radicals may be responsible for injury to the SL NOSs and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase during myocardial ischemia. Kukreja et al. found that O2·¯ causes relatively little damage to the cardiac SR (29Kukreja R.C. Kearns A.A. Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Hess M.L. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and SL (30Kukreja R.C. Weaver A.B. Hess M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1330-H1336PubMed Google Scholar), but hydroxyl (OH.) radicals disrupt cardiac SL function by inhibiting the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity and ouabain binding sites (31Kim M.S. Akera T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H252-H257PubMed Google Scholar) following ischemia-reperfusion. Our previous studies also show that OH. radicals inhibit nNOS activity (32Xu K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and damage SR Ca2+-ATPase function by direct attack on the ATP binding sites (15Xu K.Y. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These important findings suggest a latent inactivation mechanism for both SL NOSs and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in which OH. radicals, generated during the global ischemia, may attack ATP and substrate or cofactor and ion binding sites of the enzymes, resulting in loss of SL NOSs and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase function. KO2·¯ It has been reported that NO. reacts with both OH. and O2·¯ radicals at rate constants of K OH. = 1 × 1010m–1 s–1 and KO2·¯=6.7×109M-1S-1 , respectively (34Buxton G.V. Greenstock C.L. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1998; 17: 513-530Crossref Scopus (9945) Google Scholar, 35Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we tested the effect of NO. in scavenging OH. radicals. EPR spin trapping measurements revealed that when purified nNOS was added to an OH. generating system, endogenous NO. from nNOS markedly quenched OH. radicals (32Xu K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrated that NO. scavenges toxic OH. radicals. The scavenger effect of NO. was further tested using the NO. donor NOC-7 (32Xu K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Exogenous NO., generated from NOC-7, completely eliminated OH. from an OH. radical generation system (H2O2 plus the ferric iron chelate Fe3+-NTA) (32Xu K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and prevented OH. radical-induced inactivation of both purified nNOS and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. These in vitro studies further confirm the interaction between NO. and OH. radicals and provide a potential mechanism for NO.-mediated protection of SL NOS and SL membrane ion active transport function during ischemia. Because both SL NOSs and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase are bound to the SL membrane, endogenously produced NO. may be particularly effective in scavenging toxic free radicals within the microenvironment of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. Whether pretreatment of NO.-donor affects NO.-mediated signaling pathways is not known. We do not exclude the involvement of this possible process that may also contribute to the NO. protective effect (33Nandagopal K. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 474-478PubMed Google Scholar). More detailed investigations of functional links between the pretreatment of NO. donor and signaling pathways, including activation of guanylate cyclase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase, should increase our understanding of the mechanisms of bioprotective role of NO.. The studies reported here reveal a significant inactivation of cardiac SL NOSs function following global ischemia. Dysfunction of cardiac SL NOSs may contribute to the mechanisms of ischemic injury by removing a source of NO., generated at the SL membrane, resulting in reduced scavenging of toxic oxygen radicals. Our findings that NO. protects cardiac SL NOSs and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase against ischemia-induced inactivation suggest that locally generated NO. may serve to regulate SL membrane Na+/K+ ion active transport in the heart.

https://openalex.org/W2167869880,"Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) is a proton/divalent cation antiporter exclusively expressed in monocyte/macrophage cells with a unique role in innate resistance to intraphagosomal pathogens. In humans, it is linked to several infectious diseases, including leprosy, pulmonary tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, meningococcal meningitis, and human immunodeficiency virus as well as to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Here we demonstrate that the restricted expression of Nramp1 is mediated by the macrophage-specific transcription factor IRF-8. This factor exerts its activity via protein-protein interaction, which facilitates its binding to target DNA. Using yeast two-hybrid screen we identified Myc Interacting Zinc finger protein 1 (Miz-1) as new interacting partner. This interaction is restricted to immune cells and takes place on the promoter Nramp1 in association with PU.1, a transcription factor essential for myelopoiesis. Consistent with these data, IRF-8 knockout mice are sensitive to a repertoire of intracellular pathogens. Accordingly, IRF-8–/– mice express low levels of Nramp1 that can not be induced any further. Thus, our results explain in molecular terms the role of IRF-8 in conferring innate resistance to intracellular pathogens and point to its possible involvement in autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2086944843,"The 8-kDa light chain of dynein (DLC8) is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types. Other than serving as a light chain of the dynein complexes, this highly conserved protein has been shown to bind a larger number of proteins with diverse biological functions. DLC8 forms a homodimer via three-dimensional domain swapping of an internal β-strand (the β2-strand) at neutral pH. The protein undergoes non-reversible dimer-to-monomer dissociation when the pH value of the protein solution decreases. The three-dimensional structure of the DLC8 monomer determined by NMR spectroscopy at pH 3.0 showed that the protein is well folded. The major conformational change accompanied by dimer dissociation is in the β2-strand of the protein, which undergoes transition from a β-strand to a nascent α-helix. The monomer form of DLC8 is not capable of binding to target proteins. Insertion of two flexible amino acid residues in the tight β1/β2-loop dramatically stabilized the monomer conformation of the protein. NMR studies showed that the mutation altered the conformation as well as the three-dimensional domain swapping-mediated assembly of the DLC8 dimer. The mutant DLC8 was unable to bind to its targets even at physiological pH. The three-dimensional structure of the mutant protein in its monomeric form provides the structural basis of the mutation-induced stabilization of the monomer conformation. Based on the experimental data, we conclude that the formation of the β2-strand swapping-mediated dimer is mandatory for the structure and function of DLC8.

Dyneins are microtubule-based molecular motors that provide forces for various motility processes in eukaryotic cells (1Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev.

The dynein superfamily proteins are divided into two major classes based on their distinct cellular functions. Cytoplasmic dyneins are involved in membrane-bound organelle transport, Golgi localization, spindle formation and orientation, and nuclear localization. Axonemal dyneins are largely responsible for providing motive force for ciliary and flagellar beating. All known dyneins contain multiple subunits, and the complexes have molecular masses of >1 MDa. Typically each dynein contains two or three heavy chains, each with molecular mass ∼500 kDa (the globular heads of heavy chains contain ATPase activity); two or more intermediate chains (molecular mass, 70–80 kDa) that are apparently involved in attachment of the motor to some of its cargoes; and several light chains (molecular mass, 8–22 kDa) of which the precise functions are still largely unknown (1Holzbaur E.L.

Cytoplasmic dyneins also contain multiple copies of light intermediate chains that are distantly related to ABC transporters (5Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol.

The 8-kDa light chain of dynein (DLC8) 1The abbreviations used are: DLC8, 8-kDa light chain of dynein; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; TOSCY, total correlation spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square. is the smallest subunit in the motor complex. DLC8 was originally identified as a light chain of Chlamydomonas outer arm axonemal dynein (7Piperno G. Luck D.J. J. Biol.

The protein was subsequently shown to be a stoichiometric component of cytoplasmic dyneins (9King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cellular fractionation of mammalian brain extracts revealed that only a minor fraction of DLC8 exists as a dynein-bound form, and the majority of the protein is not associated with microtubules (9King S.M.

The extremely high amino acid sequence conservation throughout evolution and the existence of multiple pools of the protein suggest that DLC8 may be involved in conserved functions in various biological processes. Indeed a growing number of proteins have been identified to interact with DLC8, and these DLC8-binding proteins are apparently involved in diverse biological processes. For example, DLC8 was found to specifically interact with neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (12Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 13Fan J.S.

Upon complex formation, a DLC8-bound peptide assumes a β-strand structure and augments the antiparallel β-sheet of DLC8 by pairing with the β2-strand of the protein (19Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W.

In Drosophila, partial mutation of DLC8 gene leads to defects in fly's bristle and wing development, female sterility, and abnormal sensory axon projections; total loss-of-function mutations are lethal due to apoptosis (23Phillis R.

DLC8 functions as a regulator of apoptosis by sequestering the proapoptotic proteins Bim and Bmf on cytoskeletal structures via dynein and myosin V complexes (14Puthalakath H. Huang D.C.

Mammalian cells contain two 8-kDa light chains, and these two light chains are encoded by two different genes (17Naisbitt S. Valtschanoff J. Allison D.W. Sala C. Kim E. Craig A.M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the two gene products share extremely high sequence identity (83 of a total of 89 residues are identical). Among six different amino acid residues, only three are not homologous replacement. The three non-homologous residues are located in the unstructured N terminus (residue 2) and solvent-exposed α-helices (residues 21 and 41). Both of the light chains appear to be able to interact with dynein and myosin V motors as well as known DLC8-binding proteins. The functional significance of having the two light chains is still unknown. For nomenclature consistency, DLC8 (also called PIN, DLC1, and LC1) is named as DLC8a, and the other light chain (also called LC2) is referred as DLC8b throughout this study. We use DLC8 to refer to both light chains. In this work, we studied the pH-dependent dimer-monomer equilibrium of DLC8b. The structure of DLC8b in its monomeric form was determined by NMR spectroscopy. We further addressed structural and functional basis of the three-dimensional domain swapping-mediated DLC8 dimer assembly. We chose to use DLC8b, instead of DLC8a, as the monomeric form of DLC8b is more stable and amenable for detailed NMR structural characterization. Sample Preparation—The recombinant rat DLC8b was expressed, purified, and isotope-labeled with essentially identical methods as those described in our previous studies of DLC8a (20Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Tochio H. Ohki S. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mutants of DLC8b used in this study were generated by standard PCR-based techniques. All NMR samples were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 99.99% D2O. To obtain pure monomeric DLC8b, the sample pH was adjusted to 3.0. The concentrations of the DLC8b monomer of the NMR samples for structural determination were ∼1.0 mm. The concentrations of the NMR samples for 1H,15N HSQC-based pH titrations and target peptide binding experiments were in the range of 0.3–0.5 mm. Pull-down Binding Assay—Direct interaction between DLC8b and GST-fused proteins were assayed in the phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). An equal molar amount of DLC8 and one of the GST fusion proteins (0.6 nmol each) were mixed in 100 μl of the assay buffer. The GST fusion protein-DLC8b complexes were pelleted by 30 μl of a slurry of GSH-Sepharose beads. The pellets were washed three times with 0.5 ml of the assay buffer and subsequently boiled with 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The intensity of the DLC8b band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was used to judge the strength of the interaction between DLC8b and its target proteins. Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—The molecular masses of various forms of DLC8b at different pH values were determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on Varian Inova 500 and 750 MHz spectrometers. NMR spectra were processed with the NMRpipe software package (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed with PIPP (28Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and Sparky. Sequential backbone resonance assignment of the DLC8b monomer was obtained by standard heteronuclear correlation experiments including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCO and confirmed by a three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY experiment (29Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 30Kay L.E. Gardner K.H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The non-aromatic non-exchangeable side chain assignments were obtained using an HCCH-TOCSY experiment. The side chains of the aromatics were assigned by 1H two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments with an unlabeled DLC8b sample in D2O (32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Structural Calculation—The interproton distance restraints were derived from NOESY spectra (a 1H two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY, a 15N-separated NOESY, and a 13C-separated NOESY for the wild type DLC8b). NOEs were grouped into three distance ranges: 1.8–2.7 Å (1.8–2.9 Å for NOEs involving HN protons), 1.8–3.3 Å (1.8–3.5 Å for NOEs involving HN protons), and 1.8–5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs. Hydrogen bond restraints (two per hydrogen bond where r NH-O = 1.8–2.2 Å and r N-O = 2.2–3.3 Å) were generated by a combination of the standard secondary structure of the protein based on NOE patterns and backbone secondary chemical shifts. Backbone dihedral angle restraints (ϕ and ψ angles) were derived from the backbone chemical shift analysis program TALOS (33Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated using the program CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The calculated structures were assessed with PROCHECK-NMR (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

GRASP: Graphical Representation and Analysis of Surface Properties. Columbia University, New York1992Google Scholar). Protein Data Bank Coordinates—The coordinates of the DLC8b monomer and the DLC8bInsSG monomer structures have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (accession code 1PWJ and 1PWK, respectively) with the designation of immediate release upon publication (HPUB). pH-dependent Dissociation of DLC8b—It has been well characterized that DLC8a exists as a homodimer at the physiological pH, and the two monomers of DLC8a form a domain-swapped dimer by exchanging the β2-strands (19Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Due to the extreme high amino acid homology between the two dynein light chains, DLC8b exists as a dimer with the structure nearly identical to that of DLC8a at pH 7.0 (data not shown). Similar to what was observed in DLC8a (19Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Barbar E. Kleinman B. Imhoff D. Li M. Hays T.S. Hare M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), DLC8b also displays a pH-dependent dimer-monomer equilibrium. At pH 7.0, DLC8b is entirely dimeric (Fig. 1, A and B). When the pH value of the protein solution decreases, the monomeric population of DLC8b gradually increases. At pH 3.0, the protein completely dissociates into a monomeric form (Fig. 1, A and B). Judging from the uniformity of the peak intensities and the large chemical shift dispersion of the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of the protein at pH 3.0, we conclude that the monomeric form of DLC8b is stably folded (Fig. 1B). We further noted that this pH-dependent dimer-to-monomer dissociation is not reversible as the dimer peaks were never observed to reappear when the solution pH values were raised back to neutral. Fig. 2 summarizes the backbone 13Cα chemical shift differences between the dimer and the monomer forms of DLC8b. It is clear that the amino acid residues in the Arg60–His72 region of the protein show large chemical shift differences between the two forms. The rest of the protein displays relatively small chemical shift changes when the protein dissociates from a dimer to two monomers. The chemical shift data shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the Arg60–His72 region of DLC8b undergoes major conformational changes when the protein dissociates into the monomeric form. The rest of the protein shares the similar structure in both the dimer and the monomer forms. Since the amino acid residues that undergo prominent chemical changes (thus, the conformational changes) upon dimer dissociation are in the β2-strand of the DLC8b dimer and the β2-strand of DLC8b (as in DLC8a) is known to be responsible for target binding in its dimer form, we sought to determine whether the DLC8b monomer retains its target binding capacity.Fig. 2Plot of the 13Cα chemical shift differences as a function of amino acid residue number of DLC8b at pH 7.0 and 3.0. The 13Cα chemical shift differences were expressed as the absolute value for each amino acid residue. The secondary structure of DLC8b in its dimer form is shown at the top of the figure. The β2-strand is drawn as a dashed arrow to highlight the conformational differences of this region at the two pH values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate this point, we titrated the 15N-labled DLC8b monomer (pH 3.0) with several DLC8 dimer-binding peptides. A 1H,15N HSQC spectrum was recorded for each peptide/DLC8b mixture. The peptides that we used include the DLC8-binding motif of dynein intermediate chain, DLC8-binding domain of Bim, and the DLC8-binding peptide of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (13Fan J.S. Zhang Q.

Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All of these peptides were shown to bind to the DLC8b dimer in a fashion similar to that previously reported for the DLC8a dimer (data not shown). In contrast, none of these peptides were able to interact with the DLC8b monomer based on our NMR experiment as the HSQC spectrum of the DLC8b monomer showed no observable chemical shift changes upon the addition of these peptides (data not shown). Overall Structure of the DLC8b Monomer—To obtain a definitive picture of the conformational changes of DLC8b upon the dimer dissociation, we decided to determine the three-dimensional structure of DLC8b monomer at pH 3.0 using standard multidimensional NMR spectroscopic techniques. We chose DLC8b, instead of DLC8a, due to the superb stability of DLC8b monomer (pH 3.0) at concentrations suitable for NMR structural determination. At pH 3.0, DLC8a does not completely dissociate into monomer. Further decreases in solution pH lead to partial denaturation and precipitation of DLC8a (data not shown). A total of 1,852 experimental restraints were used to calculate the solution structure of the DLC8b monomer (Table I). Fig. 3A shows the superposition of the final 20 simulated annealing structures of DLC8b, and Fig. 3B shows a ribbon diagram representation of the DLC8b monomer. For the convenience of structural comparison, we use the same nomenclature for the secondary structure elements of the DLC8b monomer as that used for the DLC8a dimer (20Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Except for the N-terminal four residues and the amino acids 61–71 (the β2-strand and the β2/β3-loop in the DLC8 dimer), the structure of the rest of DLC8b monomer is well defined (Fig. 3A). The DLC8b monomer contains two α-helices (α1 and α2) and four β-strands (β0, β1, β3, and β4). The four β-strands forms an antiparallel β-sheet with a topology of β0-β3-β4-β1. The β-sheet is sandwiched on one side by the two α-helices and on the other by a loop-like structure connecting β1 and β3 (see below for more details). The DLC8b monomer adopts a globular overall structure in solution. Except for the loop connecting the β1- and β3-strands, the rest of the DLC8b monomer has a conformation remarkably similar to the corresponding segments in the dimer form of DLC8a (Fig. 3), a result that is entirely consistent with the chemical shift perturbation data shown in Fig. 2 and earlier CD and fluorescence studies (40Barbar E. Kleinman B. Imhoff D. Li M. Hays T.S. Hare M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Structural comparison between the DLC8b monomer and a subunit of the DLC8a dimer using the two helices and the four β-strands (β0, β1, β3, and β4) gives rise to an r.m.s. deviation value of 1.38 Å (Fig. 3C).Table IStructural statistics for the family of 20 structures of the DLC8b and DLC8bInsSG monomerDLC8bDLC8bInsSGDistance restraintsIntraresidue (i - j = 0)621290Sequential (i - j = 1)393370Medium range (2 < i - j < 4)270223Long range (i - j > 5)428178Hydrogen bonds6666Total17781129Dihedral angle restraintsΦ3737Ψ3737Total7474Mean r.m.s. deviations from the experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.012 ± 0.0010.022 ± 0.001Dihedral angle (Å)0.021 ± 0.0180.116 ± 0.054Mean r.m.s. deviations from idealized covalent geometryBond (Å)0.002 ± 0.0000.003 ± 0.000Angle (Å)0.380 ± 0.0150.435 ± 0.010Improper (Å)0.281 ± 0.0180.337 ± 0.014Mean energies (kcal mol-1)E NOEaThe final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 200 kcal mol-1 radian-2, respectively.19.25 ± 2.6241.19 ± 2.97E cdihaThe final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 200 kcal mol-1 radian-2, respectively.0.00 ± 0.000.07 ± 0.07E L - J-194.89 ± 14.37-124.79 ± 22.63Ramachandran plot, secondary structurePercentage of residues in the most favored regions82.078.8Percentage of residues in additional allowed regions16.015.4Percentage of residues in generously allowed regions2.03.8Percentage of residues in disallowed regions01.9Atomic r.m.s. differences (Å)bThe precision of the atomic coordinates is defined as the average r.m.s. difference between the 20 final structures and the mean coordinates of the protein., secondary structureBackbone heavy atoms (N, Cα, and C′)0.460.51Heavy atoms1.121.12a The final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 200 kcal mol-1 radian-2, respectively.b The precision of the atomic coordinates is defined as the average r.m.s. difference between the 20 final structures and the mean coordinates of the protein. Open table in a new tab Conformational Changes Accompanying Dimer Dissociation—The largest conformational changes that occur in DLC8b upon dimer dissociation are found in the β2-strand. In the dimer, the β2-strand crosses over to the neighboring subunit and forms an antiparallel β-sheet with the β1-strand within that subunit (19Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acid residues in the DLC8b monomer do not form a stable regular secondary structure, although the whole segment protrudes from the main antiparallel β-sheet. We refer to this segment of the DLC8b monomer as the β2-loop for convenience and nomenclature consistency. NOE connectivities of the backbones of the β2-loop residues showed characteristics of a nascent α-helical structure (i.e. continuous medium-to-strong backbone d NN and weak d αN(i, i + 3) NOEs connectivities, data not shown). The chemical shift index data also show that the Cα/Cβ chemical shifts of the residues in the β2-loop systematically shift toward an α-helical conformation, although the scale of the shift is considerably smaller than that of a stable α-helix such as α1 or α2 (Fig. 4). In addition to the β2-loop, the amino acid residues at the end of the β1-strand and the β1/β2 linker also undergo significant conformational changes. Specifically the β1-strand is one residue shorter than that in the dimer. The shortening of the β1-strand appears to be essential for the β2-loop to form a relatively loose, nascent α-helix structure (instead of extended β-strand structure in the dimer) (19Liang J.

In riboflavin biosynthesis ribulose 5-phosphate is converted into 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate while its C4 atom is released as formate in a sequence of metal-dependent reactions. Here, we present the crystal structure of Methanococcus jannaschii 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase in complex with the substrate ribulose 5-phosphate at a dimetal center presumably consisting of non-catalytic zinc and calcium ions at 1.7-Å resolution. The carbonyl group (O2) and two out of three free hydroxyl groups (OH3 and OH4) of the substrate are metal-coordinated. We correlate previous mutational studies on this enzyme with the present structural results. Residues of the first coordination sphere involved in metal binding are indispensable for catalytic activity. Only Glu-185 of the second coordination sphere cannot be replaced without complete loss of activity. It contacts the C3 hydrogen atom directly and probably initiates enediol formation in concert with both metal ions to start the reaction sequence. Mechanistic similarities to Rubisco acting on the similar substrate ribulose 1,5-diphosphate in carbon dioxide fixation as well as other carbohydrate (reducto-) isomerases are discussed.

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is biosynthesized in plants and numerous microorganisms but not in animals, which depend on nutritional sources. Its derivatives, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavinadenine dinucleotide (FAD), are indispensable in all cells where they serve a variety of redox reactions (1Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). They have also been shown to serve a variety of other functions in cells such as DNA photorepair (2Sancar A.

Gram-negative bacteria are absolutely dependent on endogenous synthesis of riboflavin, because they are devoid of an uptake system for flavins or flavocoenzymes. Hence, riboflavin-deficient mutants e.g. of Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. require extremely high concentrations of exogenous riboflavin for growth. The same is true for yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida guilliermondii (for review see Refs. 1Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3.

Thus, these organisms should be vulnerable to inhibitors of the riboflavin biosynthesis, which could therefore qualify as novel anti-infective agents. The absence of the riboflavin pathway in the human host appears advantageous in this context, because host/parasite selectivity of inhibitory agents would not constitute a problem. The mechanistic and structural analysis of the riboflavin pathway could serve as the basis for the rational design of riboflavin pathway inhibitors. 3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase supplies the building blocks for the assembly of the xylene ring of the vitamin (14Volk R.

The reaction product, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, undergoes a highly unusual dismutation catalyzed by riboflavin synthase, which involves the exchange of a 4-carbon fragment between two identical substrate molecules. The dismutation affords riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, which is recycled as a substrate of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (27Plaut G.W.E. J. Biol.

Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is initiated by the formation of the endiol 1, which resembles a postulated intermediate of ribulose-diphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) (31Peach C.

Protonation of the position 1-hydroxy group could then be conducive to the formation of the hypothetical diketone 4 via the enol 3. A sigmatropic rearrangement could afford the branched carbohydrate 5, which could subsequently fragment under formation of the endiol 7, which could afford the enzyme product, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. The structure of Escherichia coli 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase has been determined by x-ray crystallography (34Liao D.-I. Calabrese J.C. Wawrzak Z. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B.

Prior to crystallization 2 mm ZnCl2 was added, and the buffer was exchanged to 2 mm ZnCl2 and 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, by a NAP-10 column. Addition of higher zinc concentrations resulted in precipitation of the enzyme, which could be reversed by addition of zinc-free enzyme or EDTA. Orthorhombic crystals of space group C222(1Müller F.

Crystals of about 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 appeared within 1 day with freshly prepared protein. Storage of the protein at 4 °C resulted in significantly impaired crystallization behavior after 1-2 weeks. The mutant His-147 → Ser was crystallized under identical condition as long plates belonging to the monoclinic space group P2(1Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3.

These were transferred in about ten steps into a buffer containing 30% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400 as cryoprotectant in addition to the components of the reservoir solution. The Ortho and derivative data sets were collected at 12 °C, whereas the data set Mono was collected at 100 K under cryogenic conditions using an Oxford cryostream. Derivatives were prepared by soaking orthorhombic crystals for 2 h (Hg and Hg2 with identical soaking conditions) or overnight (Ta, HgTa) in the reservoir solution containing 2 mm thiomersal, saturated Ta6Br14 (<1 mm), or both, respectively.

The coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1PVW and 1PVY. Structure Solution—Recombinant enzymatically active M. jannaschii 3,4-dihydroxy 2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (DBPS) was crystallized in the orthorhombic space group C222(1Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar) with three monomers in the asymmetric unit. This crystal form was extremely sensitive to buffer changes, and therefore no cryoprotectant could be found. However, crystals were stable enough at room temperature to allow collection of a complete data set to 2.45-Å resolution and the preparation of heavy atom derivatives. The structure was subsequently solved by multiple isomorphous replacement (Tables I and II). The point mutant His-147 → Ser that showed only ∼10% of the wild type enzymatic activity yielded a monoclinic crystal form under identical conditions. This crystal form with a dimer in the asymmetric unit was less sensitive to buffer changes and could be soaked with the substrate ribulose 5-phosphate in a suitable cryoprotectant. Diffraction data could be collected at cryogenic conditions to 1.7-Å resolution. Both structures were refined to crystallographic R-factors of 22.9% (R free 28.9%) and 21.3% (R free 25.9%), respectively (Table III). The three monomers of the orthorhombic crystal form showed ordered residues Asn-2 to Tyr-220. In monomer A the acidic active site loop was completely ordered, whereas it has weak side-chain densities for Tyr-20, Glu-24, Arg-25, and Glu-26 in monomer B, and weak side-chain densities for Glu-26 and Glu-28 in monomer C. Asp-30 of the acidic loop is well ordered in all subunits. The acidic active site loops were not engaged in crystal contacts in monomers B and C, but in monomer A the turn region around Asp-23 and Glu-24 had a long van der Waals contact to Arg-201 of a neighboring monomer, however, with distances larger that about 4.5 Å. The active site in monomer A clearly shows two metal and a phosphate ion assembled around His-164 in a well defined dimetal cluster that can be readily interpreted. The other two subunits, however, show extensive broken densities that can not readily be interpreted besides the metal binding to His-164 in accordance with the significant disorder of the acidic active site loop. In addition, residues Lys-109 to Thr-112 (monomer A), residues Tyr-89 to Glu-98 (monomer B), and residues around Tyr-95 (monomer C) are disordered or have very weak electron densities. Although refined without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, the monomers were very similar showing r.m.s. deviations of only 0.66 Å for 217 Cα atoms (monomer A to B) and 0.40 Å for 218 Cα atoms (monomer A to C), respectively.Table IIIRefinement statisticsOrthoMonoResolution range (Å)20.0-2.4520-1.70Reflections (working set)23,705 (93.1%)40,421 (88.7%)Reflections (test set)1,210 (4.8%)2,141 (4.7%)R cryst (%)aRcryst=Σhkl⊂W||Fabs|-k|Fcalc||/Σhkl⊂W|Fabs| .22.921.3R free (%)bRfree=Σhkl⊂T||Fabs|-k|Fcalc||/Σhkl⊂T|Fabs| .28.925.9Non-hydrogen protein atoms5,2203,472Total number of metal ions2 zinc, 1 calcium3 zinc, 4 calciumSolvent molecules—352B-factors (Å2)Protein43.929.3Solvent—36.2Active site metals31.331.0Ru5P—28.4r.m.s. deviationBond length (Å)0.00830.0109Bond angle (°)1.241.48a Rcryst=Σhkl⊂W||Fabs|-k|Fcalc||/Σhkl⊂W|Fabs| .b Rfree=Σhkl⊂T||Fabs|-k|Fcalc||/Σhkl⊂T|Fabs| . Open table in a new tab The monoclinic crystal form showed ordered residues Asn-2 to Tyr-220 and Asn-3 to Leu-221, respectively, for both asymmetric monomers and 347 solvent molecules. Both monomers showed an r.m.s. deviation of only 0.39 Å for 214 Cα atoms without imposing non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. In addition, each active site had one molecule of ribulose 5-phosphate and two metal ions, presumably zinc and calcium, from the crystallization buffer bound at the active site with each metal ion binding an additional water ligand. The average temperature factors of Ru5P (28.4 Å2) were slightly lower than for the protein (29.3 Å2) and both metal ions 31.0 (Å2) at the active site, which indicates full occupancy and ordering. The Tyr-95 loop is observed in two conformations. The acidic active site loop from Tyr-20 to Asp-30 was well ordered in both monomers. Calcium and zinc ions were involved in crystal contacts in both crystal forms. Overall Structure and Active Site Entrance—DBPS from Escherichia coli (34Liao D.-I. Calabrese J.C. Wawrzak Z.

Each monomer is composed of an α+β structure with a rather complex topology for the β-strand connectivity. It has a prominent internal active site cavity mainly formed from one monomer with one side being lined by residues of the neighboring subunit (Thr-112 loop and His-147 loop) (Fig. 2b). This cavity appears open due to the disorder of the acidic active site loop in the absence of metals and substrate (34Liao D.-I. Calabrese J.C. Wawrzak Z. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but is closed by this loop upon binding of the substrate ribulose 5-phosphate or glycerol in the presence of divalent metals. In addition, the loop around Tyr-95 is observed in two conformations in the asymmetric dimer of the monoclinic crystal form. In an open conformation the Tyr-95 loop points away from the active site, whereas in the closed the phenolic OH group of Tyr-95 is a direct ligand to metal II. This region is not conserved between different DBPS and is part of an insertion of the M. jannaschii enzyme compared with M. grisea (30Fischer M. Römisch W. Schiffmann S. Kelly M. Oschkinat H. Steinbacher S. Huber R. Eisenreich W. Richter G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41410-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Tyr-95 ligand is not essential for the formation of the dimetal center, because it can be replaced by a water molecule. In addition, in the well ordered two-metal center of the orthorhombic crystal form, the Tyr-95 loop is observed in yet another conformation resembling the closed state, however the phenolic OH only hydrogen-bonds to a water molecule on metal II. We conclude that the Tyr-95 loop contributes to active site access in M. jannaschii DBPS but is not essential for assembly of the dimetal center. In contrast, the Thr-112 loop and the His-147 loop (which bears the mutation His-147 Ser yielding the monoclinic crystal form) from the neighboring subunit are found in almost identical conformations in all available structures. The same is true for the acidic active site loop in Mn2+·glycerol·sulfate complex of M. grisea (36Liao D.-I. Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the substrate·dimetal complex of the present study. In the absence of substrate this loop may either be completely disordered (34Liao D.-I. Calabrese J.C. Wawrzak Z. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or it may adopt deviating conformations. The M. grisea (36Liao D.-I. Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the M. jannaschii DBPS monomers superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.22 Å for 171 Cα atoms reflecting this similarity. Active Site Architecture and Metal-mediated Binding of Ribulose 5-Phosphate—The active site is formed on one side of the central β-sheet of DBPS and the N terminus of the α-helix from Gly-163 to Ala-175, which contributes His-164 as a central active site residue. The acidic active site loop from Val-19 to Asp-30 as well as loop structures around Tyr-95, Thr-112, and His-147 constitute the other parts of the active site (Fig. 2b). Most of these regions reside within one monomer with exception of the loops around Thr-112 and His-147, which belong to the neighboring monomer. Both the available E. coli structures (34Liao D.-I. Calabrese J.C. Wawrzak Z. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Kelly M.J. Ball L.J. Krieger C. Yu Y. Fischer M.

A. 2001; 98: 13025-13030Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the present study indicate high flexibility at the active site. Ordering of the acidic active site loop is concomitant to binding of two divalent metal ions and a phosphate/sulfate ion or the substrate ribulose 5-phosphate, respectively. The phosphate moiety of the substrate ribulose 5-phosphate is anchored by four hydrogen bonds (side chain and backbone amide of Thr-165, backbone amide of His-164) and four salt bridge interactions (Arg-25 and Arg-161). In addition, each of the two metal ions is coordinated by a phosphate oxygen (Fig. 3). The carbohydrate chain of ribulose 5-phosphate is fixed by four metal coordination bonds, two of which are formed by zinc (metal I) to O3 and O4 and two by calcium (metal II) to O2 and O3. Only one direct protein substrate interaction is observed between O4 and the side chain of Asp-30 from the acidic loop. The O1 hydroxyl group appears in two conformations and has a somewhat weaker electron density, which can be explained by the lack of direct contacts. Both metal ions show one water ligand in addition to the protein and substrate contacts. A prominent water molecule is found near O3 that is coordinated by Glu-28 of the acidic loop and Glu-185. DBPS proteins of different organisms have been shown to require Mg2+ or Mn2+ for catalytic activity. The previous structural characterization of the M. grisea DBPS (36Liao D.-I. Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) provides insight into metal binding in the presence of sulfate ions. Mg2+ and Mn2+ can assemble into a dimetal center in the presence of sulfate in a geometry that is very similar to that observed for Zn2+ ions. However, at concentrations of 200 mm of the metal ions used for formation of these complexes, four zinc ions were found at the active site. These complexes revealed His-153 and Glu-37 (M. grisea) as metal ligands where Glu-37 bridges both metal. Insight into substrate binding has been gained from a fortuitous Mn2+·glycerol·sulfate complex that, however, showed only the histidine-liganded metal I. In that complex metal I binds two hydroxyl groups of glycerol, one oxygen of the sulfate ion, Glu-37, as monodentate ligand and a water molecule. The present study extends this information to a true substrate complex that was obtained by soaking the monoclinic crystals of the His-147 → Ser mutant of M. jannaschii DBPS in the presence of non-functional divalent metal ions, zinc and calcium, at con"

Treatment of CD44 wild-type lymphocytes with IL-2 led to increased gene expression of CD44 v6 and v7 variant isoforms and to significant induction of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). CD44v6-v7 knockout (KO) and CD44v7 KO mice showed markedly reduced levels of IL-2-induced VLS. The decreased VLS in CD44v6-v7 KO and CD44v7 KO mice did not result from differential activation and expansion of CD8+ T cells, NK, and NK-T cells or from altered degree of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration in the lungs. LAK cells from CD44v7 KO mice showed a significant decrease in their ability to adhere to and mediate lysis of EC but not lysis of P815 tumor cells in vitro. CD44v7-mediated lysis of EC by LAK cells was dependent on the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, IL-2-activated LAK cells expressing CD44hi but not CD44lo were responsible for EC lysis. Furthermore, lysis of EC targets could be blocked by addition of soluble or enzymatic cleavage of CD44v6-v7-binding glycosaminoglycans. Finally, anti-CD44v7 mAbs caused a significant reduction in the adherence to and killing of EC and led to suppression of IL-2-induced VLS. Together, this study suggests that the expression of CD44v7 on LAK cells plays a specific role in EC injury and that it may be possible to reduce EC injury but not tumor cell killing by specifically targeting CD44v7.

However, IL-2 therapy is also accompanied by severe life-threatening toxicity characterized by EC injury leading to capillary or vascular leak syndrome (VLS) (11Rosenberg S.A. Lotze M.T. Muul L.M. Leitman S. Chang A.E. Ettinghausen S.E. Matory Y.L. Skibber J.M. Shiloni E. Vetto J.T. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 15Bechard D.E.

Drug Saf. 1995; 13: 371-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CD44 is a widely distributed cell surface glycoprotein expressed by a variety of lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. CD44 is involved in a number of processes including lymphocyte migration and extravasation, lymph node homing, and lymphocyte activation (17Christ O. Gunthert U. Haas R. Zoller M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). CD44 is coupled to at least two tyrosine kinases, suggesting that it can directly act as a signaling molecule (19Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that ligation of CD44 triggers lytic activity in activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as in double-negative T cells that accumulate in lpr/lpr mice (20Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D665-D671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Seth A. Gote L. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1993; 178: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that treatment with anti-CD44 mAbs increases the lytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells (23Galandrini R. De Maria R. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4399-4407PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sconocchia G. Titus J.A. Segal D.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 716-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, reports suggest that CD44 plays an important role in adherence of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells to tumor targets (25Matsumoto G. Nghiem M.P. Nozaki N. Schmits R. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5781-5789PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies from our laboratory examining the role of CD44 in IL-2-induced VLS revealed that the induction of VLS in CD44 KO mice was significantly reduced when compared with CD44 wild-type (WT) mice (10Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Chen D. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Grayson R.L. Sponenberg D.P. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1619-1627PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggested that activation through CD44 can enhance the effector functions of T lymphocytes and NK cells and that this may lead to the increased EC injury leading to VLS as well as effective killing of tumor cells. However, the precise nature of CD44 isoforms involved in EC injury and the cytotoxicity of tumor cells is not clear. The standard form of CD44, designated CD44s, is the most common form and has a size of 85–95 kDa (26Goodison S. Urquidi V. Tarin D. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 52: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In addition to CD44s, a number of larger CD44 isoforms, ranging in size from 80 to 250 kDa, develop as a result of alternative splicing of variant exons (27van Weering D.H. Baas P.D. Bos J.L. PCR Methods Appl. 1993; 3: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that expression of specific isoforms may play a role in the regulation of the immune response as well as in the development of autoimmune disorders. For example, CD44v7 has been shown to be involved in the production of cytokines by B cells and to play a role in the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells, and progenitor cells with stromal cells (17Christ O. Gunthert U. Haas R. Zoller M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar, 28Seiter S. Schmidt D.S. Zoller M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Other isoforms of CD44, such as CD44v6 and CD44v9, were shown to be involved in B cell adhesion to stromal cells (29Van Driel M. Gunthert U. van Kessel A.C. Joling P. Stauder R. Lokhorst H.M. Bloem A.C. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Treatment with anti-CD44v7 antibodies can inhibit the production of IL-2 and interferon-γ by CD8+ cells (28Seiter S. Schmidt D.S. Zoller M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, studies have shown that trinitrobenzene sulfonate-induced colitis can be prevented and cured by treatment with anti-CD44v7 mAbs (30Wittig B.M. Johansson B. Zoller M. Schwarzler C. Gunthert U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that specific CD44 variant isoforms play a role in mediating EC damage seen in disorders such as VLS. In the current study, we examined whether specific CD44 isoforms play a role in mediating IL-2-induced VLS and tumor cytotoxicity. To this end, we screened splenocytes from mice treated with high doses of IL-2 for the expression of various CD44 isoforms and used CD44 variant knockout (KO) mice to examine whether the absence of specific isoforms would lead to reduced level of VLS. The results from this study demonstrated that CD44v7 plays an important role in the induction of vascular leak and EC damage following IL-2 treatment and that antibodies directed against CD44v7 can block IL-2-induced EC damage and VLS. Interestingly, CD44v7 did not play a role in the cytotoxicity of P815 tumor cells mediated by LAK cells. Together, the information in this study suggests that strategies designed to target the expression of CD44v7 may help to prevent EC damage seen in a variety of disorders. Mice—Adult female C57BL/6 (CD44 WT) mice were purchased from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). CD44 KO mice represent those in which the entire CD44 gene is deleted; therefore, such mice fail to express all CD44 isoforms (10Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Chen D. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Grayson R.L.

CD44v7 KO and CD44v6-v7 mice are those with targeted deletion of CD44v7 or CD44v6 and -v7 exon products, respectively. Such mice, therefore, fail to express CD44 isoforms bearing the variant exon v7 or v6 and v7, respectively (30Wittig B.M. Johansson B. Zoller M. Schwarzler C. Gunthert U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All these strains were on C57BL/6 background. The CD44 KO, CD44v6-v7 KO, and CD44v7 KO mice were bred in the animal facilities at the Medical College of Virginia Campus, Virginia Commonwealth University, and screened for the CD44, CD44v6-v7, and CD44v7 deletion, respectively. TIE2-GFP mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2) promoter (32Motoike T. Loughna S. Perens E. Roman B.L. Liao W.

Cell Lines—TME (an endothelial cell line; H-2K), SVC3H (a fibroblast cell line; H-2K), and P815 (a mastocytoma) were maintained in vitro by serial passage in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS as described (33Hammond-McKibben D.M. Seth A. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from single cell suspension of splenocytes using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, and the integrity of the each preparation was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 50 ng of total RNA using the SensiScript RT Kit (Qiagen). All PCR reactions were prepared using MasterAmp PCR Premix F (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) according to the recommendations from the manufacturer, and using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A half-nested RT-PCR approach was used to amplify CD44 isoforms, as endogenous isoform expression is too low to be detected directly by RT-PCR (data not shown). An initial amplification using primers CD44 U and CD44 L, homologous to the 5′ and 3′ standard regions of the CD44 gene, was used to amplify both CD44 standard form and all isoforms. The products of this reaction were used as template in a second reaction using a CD44 isoform-specific primer in conjunction with the appropriate CD44 standard region primer (CD44 L and CD44 isoform U).

After overnight incubation at 37 °C on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), positive (white) colonies were subcultured in 300 μl of LBamp100 medium at 37 °C for 4 h. Two μl of each culture was used as template in a PCR reaction to confirm the presence of an insert. Cultures containing CD44 isoform products were grown overnight in 3 ml of LBamp100 medium. Plasmids were isolated using the Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were sequenced using the M13 Reverse and M13 Forward (-40) primers, and using ABI BigDye terminator (version 2) chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Antibodies—PE- or FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD16 (Fc block), anti-CD19, anti-CD25, anti-CD44, Mac-3, and anti-NK1.1 mAbs were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-CD44v7 mAbs (LN7.1) were prepared as previously described (34Wittig B. Schwarzler C. Fohr N. Gunthert U. Zoller M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1069-1073PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CD44v6-v7 KO mice were immunized with 100–200 μg of CD44v4-v10/glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, three times over a 12-day period. Two days following the last immunization, the cells from the regional lymph nodes were fused using the X63-Ag8 cell line. The epitope recognized by LN7.1 was mapped and was shown to recognize the following peptide located within the CD44v7 region: QEDVSWTDFFDPISHP (30Wittig B.M. Johansson B. Zoller M. Schwarzler C. Gunthert U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The mAbs were purified from cell culture supernatants using protein G-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences), and isotypes of the mAbs were determined using commercially available kits (Serotec, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (30Wittig B.M. Johansson B. Zoller M. Schwarzler C. Gunthert U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Isotype control mAbs (mouse IgG1) were purchased from Pharmingen. Interleukin-2—Recombinant IL-2 was provided by the NCI Biological Resources Branch (Rockville, MD). Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface Markers and Cell Sorting— Splenocytes from mice treated with high dose IL-2, as described below, or splenocytes stimulated with IL-2 in vitro were analyzed for the expression of various cell surface markers. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubation of the cells with Fc block (Pharmingen) for 15 min. The expression of various cell surface markers were determined by staining the cells with FITC- or PE-conjugated mAbs for 30 min on ice, followed by washing three times. The cells (5000) were analyzed by flow cytometry. In experiments in which CD44 cell expressing low (CD44lo) and high (CD44hi) levels of CD44 were separated, nonspecific staining was blocked by incubation of the cells with Fc block (Pharmingen) for 15 min. Next, the cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD44 mAbs (IM7) for 30 min on ice and washed twice with PBS. The CD44lo and CD44hi cells were separated using an Epics 753 cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Quantification of Vascular Leak Syndrome—Vascular leak was studied by measuring the extravasation of Evan's blue, which, when given intravenously, binds to plasma proteins, particularly albumin, and following extravasation can be detected in various organs as described previously (10Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Chen D. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Grayson R.L. Sponenberg D.P. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1619-1627PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mustafa A. McKallip R.J. Fisher M. Duncan R.

Med. 1970; 133: 1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Vascular leak was induced by injection of IL-2 as previously described (9Rafi A.Q. Zeytun A. Bradley M.J. Sponenberg D.P. Grayson R.L. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3077-3086PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Chen D. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Grayson R.L. Sponenberg D.P. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1619-1627PubMed Google Scholar). Groups of five mice were injected intraperitoneally with 75,000 units of rIL-2 or PBS as a control, three times a day for 3 days. On day 4, the mice received one injection and 2 h later were injected intravenously with 0.1 ml of 1% Evan's blue in PBS. After 2 h, the mice were exsanguinated under anesthesia, and the heart was perfused with heparin in PBS as described previously (37Li L. Elliott J.F. Mosmann T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3967-3978PubMed Google Scholar). The lungs were harvested and placed in formamide at 37 °C overnight. The Evan's blue in the organs was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 650 nm with a spectrophotometer. In experiments examining the effect of anti-CD44v7 mAbs on IL-2-induced VLS, mice were treated with isotype control mAbs or anti-CD44v7 mAbs (100 μg/mouse daily). In adoptive transfer experiments, CD44 WT and CD44v7 KO mice were injected intravenously with splenocytes (5 × 107) isolated from CD44 WT or CD44v7 KO mice (10Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Chen D. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Grayson R.L. Sponenberg D.P. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1619-1627PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the recipient mice received IL-2 treatment (75,000 units, three times a day for 3 days) or PBS as described above, and on day 4, the mice were studied for VLS induction. The VLS seen in IL-2-treated mice was expressed as percentage of increase in extravasation when compared with that of PBS-treated controls and was calculated as: [(optical density of dye in the lungs of IL-2-treated mice) - (optical density of dye in the lungs of PBS-treated controls)]/(optical density of dye in the lungs of PBS-treated control) × 100. Each mouse was individually analyzed for vascular leak, and data from five mice were expressed as mean ± S.E. percentage increase in VLS in IL-2 treated mice when compared with that seen in PBS-treated controls (9Rafi A.Q.

Sponenberg D.P. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1619-1627PubMed Google Scholar). Histological Analysis—Groups of three mice were injected with IL-2 or PBS as described earlier, and on day 4, the lungs were fixed in 10% formalin solution. The organs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, as described (9Rafi A.Q. Zeytun A. Bradley M.J. Sponenberg D.P. Grayson R.L. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3077-3086PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rafi-Janajreh A.Q. Chen D. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Grayson R.L. Sponenberg D.P. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. J.

Perivascular infiltration was scaled by counting the number of lymphocytes infiltrating the vessel and averaging the minimum and maximum range for each group. Four samples per mouse were analyzed, and a minimum of four mice were included. Mitogen Stimulation and Cell Proliferation—Spleen cells (5 × 105) from CD44 WT, CD44v6-v7 KO, or CD44v7 KO mice were cultured for 48 h in the presence of ConA (5 μg/ml), IL-2 (100 units/ml), or hyaluronic acid (HA; 0–0.5 mg/ml) in 0.2 ml of medium containing 10% FCS. The cells were pulsed with 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine during the final 8 h of culture. The cells were then harvested using a cell harvester, and the labeled DNA was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Generation of LAK Cells—Spleens were harvested from CD44 WT and CD44v7 KO mice and were prepared into a single cell suspension using a laboratory homogenizer (Stomacher, Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH). Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by resuspending the cells in 3 ml of red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma) for 5 min and then washing three times in RPMI containing 10% FBS. After the third wash, the viable spleen cells were quantified by trypan blue dye exclusion and counting using a hemocytometer. The splenocytes were adjusted to 5 × 106/ml and were cultured in vitro for 48 h with 1000 units/ml IL-2 in RPMI containing 10% FBS. The cells were harvested, and viable cells were purified by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma). Such cells will be referred to as LAK cells. For generation of LAK cells in vivo, CD44 WT and CD44v7 KO mice were treated with IL-2 as described above. On day 4, the spleens from IL-2-treated mice were harvested and prepared into a single-cell suspension, as described above. LAK cells generated in vitro and in vivo were tested for cytotoxicity against P815 tumor, SVC3H fibroblast, or TME EC targets using the 51Cr release assay. Briefly, 1 × 106 target cells were labeled with 51NaCrO4 at 37 °C for 1 h. The LAK cells were plated in triplicate into 96-well round-bottomed plates at varying effector to target ratios and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. In these experiments the LAK cells are defined as the effector cells that mediate lysis of the 51NaCrO4-labeled EC or tumor cells, which are defined as the target cells. In experiments examining the effect of anti-CD44v7 mAbs on the LAK activity, soluble anti-CD44v7 mAbs or isotype control mAbs were added to the LAK cells 1 h prior to the addition of the EC targets. In experiments examining the effects of soluble glycosaminoglycans on LAK activity, the various glycosaminoglycans including chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, heparin, hyaluronate, and hyaluronate (Sigma) were added to the cultures at the initiation of the 4-h assay. In experiments examining the effects of wortmannin (Sigma) and herbimycin (Sigma) on LAK activity, the inhibitors were added at the initiation of the 4-h assay. Spontaneous release was determined by culturing the target cells alone, and the total release was determined by incubating the target cells with 1% Triton X-100. The supernatants were harvested after 4 h, and the radioactivity was measured using a γ counter. HA Binding Studies—HA was bound to Covalink NH plates using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce) (29Van Driel M. Gunthert U. van Kessel A.C. Joling P. Stauder R. Lokhorst H.M. Bloem A.C. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of HA (100 μg/ml) mixed with 50 μl of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 50 μl of HCl (0.4 mm) were added to individual wells of a 96-well plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed and stored at 4 °C before use in adhesion assays. To determine the level of adherence following stimulation with IL-2, splenocytes from untreated and IL-2-treated lymphocytes were labeled for 4 h with [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml). The labeled splenocytes (105/well) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by gently pipetting with PBS. The percentage of cells adhering to the plate was determined using the following formula: [(counts/min (cpm) of cells adhering to HA-coated plates - cpm of cells adhering to non-coated plates)/total cpm (non-adherent cells plated on non-coated plates)] × 100%. Enzymatic Treatment—To examine the effect of enzymatic cleavage of glycosaminoglycans on LAK activity, chondroitinase AC (0.02 units/ml), chondroitinase B (0.02 units/ml), chondroitinase C (0.02 units/ml), heparinase (0.02 units/ml), or hyaluronidase (100 rTRU/ml) was added at the initiation of the 4-h 51Cr release assay. The enzymes were purchased from Sigma. In assays in which EC and LAK cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase (100 rTRU/ml), the"
https://openalex.org/W2043999454,"We have isolated several peptides from random peptide phage display libraries that specifically recognize the cell cycle regulatory transcription factor E2F and inhibit DNA binding of E2F/DP heterodimers (E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4 or E2F-5, and DP-1). The inhibitory efficiency could be strongly enhanced by generating branched tetravalent molecules. To analyse the biological consequences of peptide-mediated E2F inhibition, we fused two of these branched molecules to a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the HTV-Tat protein. Incubation of human tumor cells with these branched Tat-containing peptides led to an inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. These results provide new insights into the function of E2F and further validate E2F as a potential therapeutic target in proliferative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1979567023,"About 95% of the bile phospholipids are phosphatidylcholine. Although the fractions of phosphatidylcholine and of both aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the canalicular membrane are in the same order of about 35% of total lipids, both aminophospholipids are almost absent from the bile. To rationalize this observation, we studied the intracellular uptake of various fluorescent phospholipid analogues and their subsequent enrichment in the bile canaliculus (BC) of HepG2 cells. Diacylaminophospholipid analogues but not phosphatidylcholine analogues became rapidly internalized by an aminophospholipid translocase (APLT) activity in the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells. We observed only low labeling of BC by diacylaminophospholipids but extensive staining by phosphatidylcholine analogues. In the presence of suramin, known to inhibit APLT, a strong labeling of BC by diacylaminophospholipid analogues was found that declined to a level observed for control cells after removal of suramin. Unlike diacylphosphatidylserine, diether phosphatidylserine analogue, which is not an appropriate substrate of APLT, accumulated in the BC. The correlation between low labeling of BC and an APLT-mediated transbilayer movement suggests the presence of an APLT activity in the canalicular membrane that prevents exposure of aminophospholipids to the bile. About 95% of the bile phospholipids are phosphatidylcholine.

The correlation between low labeling of BC and an APLT-mediated transbilayer movement suggests the presence of an APLT activity in the canalicular membrane that prevents exposure of aminophospholipids to the bile. An important function of the liver is the synthesis and secretion of bile fluid by the hepatocytes. The plasma membrane of hepatocytes is organized into distinct domains, the basolateral and the apical (or canalicular) membrane, separated by tight junctions. The basolateral membrane faces the blood vessel in vivo. The apical domains of hepatocytes form small tubuli, the bile canaliculi (BC), 1The abbreviations used are: BC, bile canaliculi(us); APLT, aminophospholipid translocase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CGamF, cholylglycylamidofluorescein; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; NBD, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl); NBD-cholan, 3α-OH-7β-NBD-cholan-24-oil acid; PBS, Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine. into which the bile constituents are secreted. A major component of bile fluid are phospholipids. Their uptake from the canalicular membrane into the BC requires the solubilizing activity of bile salts (1Yousef I.M. Fisher M.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1976; 54: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Oude Elferink R.P.J. Tytgat G.N.J. Groen A.K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) accounts for about 95% of the bile phospholipids (3Coleman R. Rahman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 113-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas it constitutes only 35% of the canalicular membrane phospholipids (4Rigotti A. Marzolo M.P. Nervi F. Curr. Top. Membranes. 1994; 40: 579-615Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In agreement with the composition of mammalian plasma membranes, the aminophospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) represent about 24 and 11%, respectively (4Rigotti A. Marzolo M.P. Nervi F. Curr. Top. Membranes. 1994; 40: 579-615Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), of the canalicular membrane lipids. However, PS is virtually absent from the bile, and PE represents only 4.5% of biliary phospholipids. Because previous work has shown that the interaction of bile salts with phospholipids is independent of the phospholipid head group (5Wüstner D. Herrmann A. Müller P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), other mechanisms that prevent specific phospholipids located in the apical membrane from being solubilized into BC must ensure the characteristic phospholipid composition of the bile fluid. We hypothesized that the absence of the aminophospholipids PS and PE from bile is a consequence of their almost exclusive localization on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane (6Wüstner D. Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Müller P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17093-17103Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This asymmetric localization could be the result of the activity of aminophospholipid translocase (APLT), a protein shown to be ubiquitous in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. APLT rapidly transports the aminophospholipids PS and PE from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet at the expense of ATP (8Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Employing spin-labeled lipid analogues, the half-time of APLT-mediated inward transport in red blood cells was found to be in the order of 2-5 min and 30 min for PS and PE, respectively (13Morrot G. Hervé P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although the molecular identity of APLT is awaiting, it is very likely to be a member of the P-type ATPase family (14Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 15Beleznay Z. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Ott P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To address the presence of an APLT activity in the canalicular membrane we studied the enrichment of fluorescent phospholipid analogues in the BC of HepG2 cells. This human hepatoma cell line is able to polarize and form a biliary vacuole that resembles the tubular BC of the liver (16Zegers M.M.P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Lian W.-N. Tsai J.-W. Yu P.-M. Wu T.-W. Yank S.-C. Chau Y.-P. Lin C.-H. Hepatology. 1999; 303: 748-760Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although we suggested recently the presence of an APLT activity in the plasma membrane of nonpolarized HepG2 cells by employing spin-labeled phospholipid analogues (18Müller P. Pomorski T. Porwoli S. Tauber R. Herrmann A. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Buton X. Hervé P. Kubelt J. Tannert A. Burger K.N.J. Fellmann P. Müller P. Herrmann A. Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13106-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), this approach did not allow us to address whether the canalicular membrane itself harbors an APLT activity. Here, using a panel of fluorescent phospholipid analogues with differing affinities toward APLT, we found that analogues that are efficiently transported by APLT are essentially excluded from the BC, whereas those that are not transported by APLT were enriched in the BC. These observations provide strong evidence for an APLT activity in canalicular membrane which prevents aminophospholipids from accumulating on the luminal side of BC. Chemicals—NBD-Labeled phosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (diacyl-NBD-PC), phosphatidylserine 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (diacyl-NBD-PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine (1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (diacyl-NBD-PE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Synthesis of 1-octadecanoxy-2-[6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoxy]-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (diether NBD-PS) and of 1-octadecanoxy-2-[6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoxy]-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (diether NBD-PC) was described previously (20Fellmann P.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Collagen A, penicillin/streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and Dulbecco's modified phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were from Seromed (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). HBSS+ refers to HBSS supplemented with 1.25 mm CaCl2·2H2O and 0.5 mm MgCl2·2H2O. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) was obtained from Fluka (Feinchemikalien GmbH, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Cholylglycylamidofluorescein (CGamF) and 3α-OH-7β-NBD-cholan-24-oil acid (NBD-cholan) were a generous gift from Alan F. Hofmann (University of California, San Diego). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely passaged in 25-cm2 plastic culture flasks coated with collagen A; the medium was changed every 3-4 days. For preparation of cell suspensions, cells were cultured in 175-cm2 plastic culture flasks coated with collagen A; the medium was changed on the day before the experiment. Cell suspensions were prepared in that cell monolayers were rinsed twice with HBSS and harvested by incubation with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in 50 ml of culture medium. After keeping the suspension for 30 min on ice the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS+ (PBS supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES to prevent ATP depletion and pH shift) for labeling. For microscopic observations, cells were grown on microcover glasses (18 × 18 mm, BRAND, Germany) coated with poly-l-lysine (21Salzmann N.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2097-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After 3 days, where the highest degree of polarization was obtained (16Zegers M.M.P. Hoekstra D. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), cells were used for experiments. Cell Labeling—Polarized cells on cover glasses were incubated with the label (final concentration 4 μm in HBSS+) for 20 min on ice, washed with HBSS+, and incubated for 30 min at 37 or 14 °C (7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taking into account the less efficient incorporation of diacyl-NBD-PE into membranes compared with the diacyl analogues of PS and PC (20Fellmann P. Hervé P. Pomorski T. Müller P. Geldwerth D. Herrmann A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4994-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Colleau M. Hervé P. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 57: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), labeling with the analogues was performed by incubating the cells for 30 min with the analogue at 37 °C followed by washing with HBSS+ and further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. For measurements in suspensions, cells (4 × 107 cells) were incubated with 600 μl of PBS+ containing the respective lipid analogue. Labeling was performed for 5 min with 12 nmol of diacyl analogues or 15 min with 24 nmol of diether analogues on ice to achieve comparable extent of labeling. To prevent hydrolysis of the diacyl lipid analogues 5 mm DFP was added in parallel and was present in all following steps. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS. Double Labeling of Polarized Cells—HepG2 cells were double labeled with the green fluorescent NBD-PS analogue and the red fluorescent diacyl-β-BODIPY-PC. For double labeling, polarized cells on cover glasses were incubated with 4 μm diacyl-NBD-PS for 20 min on ice or 4 μm diether NBD-PS for 30 min at 37 °C. After removing the NBD-PS analogue the cells were labeled with 10 μm β-BODIPY-PC bound to BSA for 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated further for 30 min at 37 °C. Because of its higher hydrophobicity compared with NBD-labeled analogues, β-BODIPY-PC was bound to fatty acid-depleted BSA before labeling the cells (7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Internalization by Suramin—Inhibition of APLT by suramin was performed as described earlier (15Beleznay Z. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Ott P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 200 μm suramin in respective incubation buffer for 30 min at 37 °C prior to labeling. The inhibitor was present during all following steps. For adherent cells, in some cases, cells were labeled and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow internalization of analogues and subsequently incubated with suramin for 30 min at 37 °C. Measurements of Analogue Internalization in Cell Suspensions—Labeled cells were incubated at 37 or 14 °C. After various times aliquots were transferred into a fluorescence cuvette containing 2.4 ml of ice-cold PBS+. NBD fluorescence was monitored at 540 nm (λex = 470 nm) (Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorometer) at 4 °C while continuously stirring of the suspension. Dithionite was added from a freshly prepared 1 m stock solution in 100 mm Tris (pH 9.5) to give a final concentration of 50 mm as described earlier (24McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 25Pomorski T. Müller P. Zimmermann B. Burger K. Devaux P.F. Herrmann A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 687-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dithionite quenches the fluorescence by chemical reaction with the NBD group. Because dithionite permeates very slowly across membranes at low temperature (25Pomorski T. Müller P. Zimmermann B. Burger K. Devaux P.F. Herrmann A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 687-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see“Results”), only the fluorescence of analogues on the exoplasmic leaflet is quenched. Indeed, upon addition of dithionite, we observed for labeled HepG2 cells an initial rapid decline of fluorescence intensity corresponding to reduction of the analogues on the exoplasmic leaflet (not shown). Subsequently, only a very slow fluorescence decline was observed which, very likely, is because of slow permeation of dithionite and reduction of analogues on the cytoplasmic side. Reduction of intracellular localized analogues did not exceed 2% during dithionite assay measurements, which regularly took about 5 min. After the fluorescence intensity was reduced by dithionite to a plateau value, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 2%, making the NBD-phospholipids on the cytoplasmic side accessible to dithionite. The amount of phospholipids on the cytoplasmic side (PLi) was determined according to: PLi=Fp-FeFs-Fe(Eq. 1) with F p being the fluorescence of the plateau after dithionite reduction, F e the background fluorescence after the addition of Triton X-100, and F s the fluorescence intensity before the addition of dithionite. Fluorescence Microscopy—Labeled cells grown on cover glasses were analyzed with an inverted Axiovert 100 standard epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc. Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a PlanApo 100×/1.3 numerical aperture objective and a green fluorescence filter set (BP 450-490 nm excitation filter, FT 510 nm dichroic mirror, and LP 515 nm emission filter) (Carl Zeiss) as described previously (7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Canalicular vacuoles (BC) were identified by phase-contrast microscopy. The percentage of BC containing the fluorescent lipid analogue was quantified by counting labeled and nonlabeled BC. BC having a fluorescence intensity in the BC as low as cellular autofluorescence levels were defined as nonlabeled BC. Localization of the fluorescent lipid analogues in the BC was confirmed by the addition of dithionite, which can diffuse into BC and react with NBD-labeled analogues in the lumen and on the luminal membrane leaflet of BC (22van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Zegers M.M.P. Kok J.W. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The remaining fluorescence of the canalicular membrane originates of phospholipid analogues located on the cytoplasmic side of this membrane. Cells were covered with HBSS supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to prevent any pH shift and were incubated with 30 mm sodium dithionite (added from a fresh 1 m stock solution in 100 mm Tris, pH 9.5) for 10 min on ice (7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of cells labeled with diacyl-NBD-PS a Leica Confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with NPL Fluotar 40×/1.3 oil and PL Fluotar 100×/1.32 oil objectives (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany) and an argon/krypton ion laser emitting at 488 nm was used. Photographs were taken using Kodak Ektachrome Panther P1600 films, which were push-processed to 3200 ASA and scanned using a CanoScan 2700F scanner (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) or by a cooled CCD camera (Coolsnap fx, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). Image analysis was carried out using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Enrichment of Fluorescent Bile Salt Analogues in the BC—After washing HepG2 cell layers three times with HBSS+, cells were labeled with 10 μm fluorescent bile salt analogues CGamF or NBD-cholan by the addition of respective amounts of 10 mm stock solutions of analogues in ethanol (7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After incubation for 15 min at 4 or 37 °C, cells were washed on ice with HBSS+ and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Measurement of Metabolism of Diacyl-NBD Analogues—To measure hydrolysis of cell-associated lipid analogues, cells in suspensions or in monolayers were labeled as described above. Subsequent to labeling, suspensions were incubated for 60 min, monolayers for 30 min at 37 °C (see above and“Results”). For lipid extraction, monolayers were scraped from the dish and resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS. Lipids were extracted as described previously (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42863) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.2 ml of methanol/chloroform (2.2:1) was added to 1 ml of cells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After phase separation by adding 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 40 mm acetic acid, lipids in the chloroform phase were collected. The aqueous phase was washed with 1 ml of chloroform, the two combined chloroform phases were dried under a nitrogen stream, and the lipids were resuspended in a small volume of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and applied to a TLC plate. Plates were developed in two dimensions using chloroform:methanol:ammonia (13:5:1) as basic solvent and aceton:chloroform:methanol:glacial acetic acid:water (8:6:2:2:1) as acidic solvents. Spots on the dried TLC plates were analyzed using a Fluorescence Image Analyzer FLA-3000 (Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH, Germany) and AIDA image analysis software. To identify and characterize APLT activity in the canalicular membrane, we used diacyl and diether analogues of PS and PC and a diacyl analogue of PE, each bearing the fluorescent NBD moiety at the short sn2 fatty acid chain (C6). These analogues differ in their affinity to and transport by APLT which is primarily determined by the head group as well as the glycerol backbone of phospholipids (13Morrot G. Hervé P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown for various mammalian cells, PC analogues are not transported by APLT (20Fellmann P. Hervé P. Pomorski T. Müller P. Geldwerth D. Herrmann A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4994-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Colleau M. Hervé P. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 57: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Pomorski T. Müller P. Zimmermann B. Burger K. Devaux P.F. Herrmann A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 687-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Connor J. Pak C.H. Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19412-19417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PC, diacyl-NBD-PS and, to a lesser extent diacyl-NBD-PE, are transported by APLT. However, the transport of the diether analogue of PS by APLT is very slow compared with diacyl-NBD-PS (20Fellmann P. Hervé P. Pomorski T. Müller P. Geldwerth D. Herrmann A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4994-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). First, we characterized the transbilayer redistribution of these analogues across the plasma membrane of suspended HepG2 cells to verify that the respective analogues behave in a manner similar to that found for other mammalian cells (see above). Subsequently, we studied the enrichment of aminophospholipid analogues in BC of polarized HepG2 cells in monolayer cultures. Internalization of Diacyl-Lipid Analogues in Suspended HepG2 Cells—In Fig. 1 the kinetics of internalization of NBD-lipid analogues in suspended HepG2 cells is shown. To differentiate between uptake by endocytic activity and by transbilayer movement from the exo- to the cytoplasmic leaflet, internalization was measured not only at 37 °C (Fig. 1, A and B), but also at 14 °C (Fig. 1, C and D), where endocytosis is strongly reduced (28van Meer G. Stelzer E.H. Wijnaendts-van-Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 29Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). During the labeling procedure a low amount of NBD analogues was lost from the exoplasmic leaflet, indicated by the offset at t = 0 of the respective plots. At 37 °C the internalization of diacyl-NBD-PS was rapid, about 75% of the analogue was internalized with a half-time of about 5 min (Fig. 1A). We also observed a rather rapid uptake of the analogue with respect to the other analogues at 14 °C (Fig. 1B). Although the internalization of diacyl-NBD-PE was slower compared with diacyl-NBD-PS, it was still faster with respect to the PC analogue (see below). The internalization of diacyl-NBD-PS and -PE across the plasma membrane was diminished by preincubation of the cells with suramin, an inhibitor of APLT (Fig. 1, A and C); the plateau of redistribution kinetics was about 3-4-fold lower compared with that in the absence of suramin. These results are consistent with an APLT activity in HepG2 cells. The fraction of diacyl-NBD-PC localized in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane was much higher compared with that of the diacylaminophospholipid analogues (Fig. 1A). At 37 °C only about 20% were found nonaccessible to dithionite after 1 h of incubation. Again, the internalization was significantly reduced upon lowering the temperature (cf. Fig. 1C). At 14 °C, about 10% of PC analogues redistributed to cytoplasmic side within 1 h. Preincubation of cells with suramin did not affect the transbilayer dynamics of diacyl-NBD-PC (data not shown). Internalization of Diether Lipid Analogues in Suspended HepG2 Cells—Internalization kinetics of diether NBD-PC was very similar to that of the diacyl analogue (Fig. 1). However, the internalization of diether NBD-PS was slower with respect to the diacyl analogue (Fig. 1, B and D), which is consistent with our previous observation on fibroblasts and red blood cells, indicating a very low affinity of APLT for diether NBDPS. In agreement with this, suramin only had a marginal influence on the inward reorientation of this analogue (data not shown). However, the amount of internalized diether NBD-PS was still higher compared with both PC analogues (Fig. 1, B and D). Enrichment of Fluorescent NBD-Phospholipid Analogues to the BC of Polarized HepG2 Cells—We next compared the enrichment of various fluorescent lipid analogues in BC of polarized HepG2 cells by fluorescence microscopy. Subsequent to labeling of the basolateral membrane on ice, the accumulation of lipid analogues in the BC was monitored after incubation of cells for 30 min at 37 °C (Fig. 2) or at 14 °C (see Fig. 4). For diacyl-NBD-PC, an extensive labeling of BC was found at 37 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). About 80% of the BC were labeled with the analogue (Fig. 3). The punctuate intracellular staining observed originates from endocytic uptake of the analogue (7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Sleight R.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found the same pattern of intracellular labeling for diether NBD-PC, in particular the enrichment of the analogue in the BC (Fig. 2, C and D). The amount of labeled BC was similar to that of diacyl-NBD-PC (Fig. 3).Fig. 4Transport of diacyl- and diether NBD-PC and -PS to the BC of polarized HepG2 cells at 14 °C. The basolateral membrane of HepG2 cells was labeled with 4 μm diacyl-(A, B, E, and F) or diether NBD-phospholipid analogues (C, D, G, and H) for 20 min on ice. After washing and incubation for 30 min at 14 °C, cells were again washed and twice incubated with 5% (w/v) BSA (in HBSS+) for 10 min on ice to remove remaining label from the exoplasmic leaflet of the basolateral cell membrane (see Ref. 7Wüstner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Müller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Bright labeling almost exclusively of BC was found for diacyl-NBD-PC (arrow), punctuate staining was strongly reduced compared with 37 °C (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W1968569311,"The mechanisms underlying compartmentalization of prokaryotic DNA replication are largely unknown. In the case of the Bacillus subtilis phage ϕ29, the viral protein p1 enhances the rate of in vivo viral DNA replication. Previous work showed that p1 generates highly ordered structures in vitro. We now show that protein p1, like integral membrane proteins, has an amphiphilic nature. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy studies reveal that p1 has a peripheral subcellular location. By combining in vivo chemical cross-linking and cell fractionation techniques, we also demonstrate that p1 assembles in infected cells into multimeric structures that are associated with the bacterial membrane. These structures exist both during viral DNA replication and when ϕ29 DNA synthesis is blocked due to the lack of viral replisome components. In addition, protein p1 encoded by plasmid generates membrane-associated multimers and supports DNA replication of a p1-lacking mutant phage, suggesting that the pre-assembled structures are functional. We propose that a phage structure assembled on the cell membrane provides a specific site for ϕ29 DNA replication.

We propose that a phage structure assembled on the cell membrane provides a specific site for ϕ29 DNA replication. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the use of large organizing structures to bring together replication factors seems to be a general mechanism to enhance the efficiency of the replication process. In eukaryotes, chromosomal DNA replication occurs at numerous locations within the nucleus. Each site constitutes a replication factory containing many polymerizing machines working on different templates (1Newport J. Yan H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Replication factories fixed to a nucleoskeleton have been visualized by electron microscopy techniques (2Hozák P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This finding supports a replication model in which DNA polymerases are immobilized by attachment to larger structures, and DNA is pulled through (stationary replisome model) (3Cook P.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Nuclear substructures also appear to have a central role in replication of DNA viruses, like the nuclear matrix in adenovirus DNA replication (4Fredman J.N. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3384-3395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bridge E. Petterson U. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 99-117PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Attachment of replication complexes to specific structures has also been reported for eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses. In this case, replication occurs in close association with intracellular membranes of diverse origin (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, chloroplast) (7Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the discovery that chromosomal DNA replication in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli takes place at a centrally located, stationary replication factory has led to the proposal that the bacterial replisome might be anchored to an underlying structure, presumably the bacterial membrane (8Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Science. 1998; 282: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 9Koppes L.J. Woldringh C.L. Nanninga N. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, despite these observations, little is known on the mechanisms that position the replication complexes at specific structures. In the case of the B. subtilis phage ϕ29, cell fractionation studies showed that parental viral DNA-membrane complexes are formed near the onset of viral DNA replication. Moreover, formation of these complexes required the synthesis of early viral-encoded proteins (11Ivarie R.D. Pène J.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, viral proteins appear to be involved in the attachment of ϕ29 DNA to the bacterial membrane. The genome of ϕ29 is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule with a terminal protein (TP) 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. covalently linked at each 5′-end. Its replication starts at either DNA end, where the replication origins are located, by a protein-priming mechanism. In vitro, this initiation mechanism requires the formation of a heterodimer between a free molecule of TP, which acts as a primer, and the ϕ29 DNA polymerase (12Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). The viral protein p1 (85 residues) enhances the rate of in vivo ϕ29 DNA replication, playing a critical role when bacteria are growing at high, rather than low, temperatures (13Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that p1 is present in about 104 molecules per cell at early stages of infection, and it increases up to 105 molecules per cell at late stages (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein p1 has interesting features such as the following. (i) It is recovered in membrane fractions of infected cells (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). (ii) It assembles into highly ordered structures in vitro (13Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and (iii) its N-terminal region binds to primer TP in vitro (15Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although p1 has no sequence homology to cytoskeletal elements, we found that a truncated p1 protein that lacks the N-terminal 33 amino acids assembles in vitro into large polymers that show a parallel array of longitudinal protofilaments (13Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These structures, examined by negative-stain electron microscopy, resemble polymers formed under particular in vitro conditions by FtsZ, which forms a ring-like structure that mediates bacterial cell division (16Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 17Rothfield L.I. Justice S.S. Cell. 1997; 88: 581-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, unlike FtsZ, p1 polymerization is not regulated by GTP hydrolysis. The ability of protein p1 to generate highly ordered structures in vitro, and its presence in membrane fractions of infected cells, led us to propose that p1 could assemble in vivo to form a multimeric structure in close association with the bacterial membrane. Verification of this hypothesis is essential to understand the role of p1 in ϕ29 DNA replication. In this work, we show that p1, like integral membrane proteins (18Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has an amphiphilic nature. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy studies reveal that protein p1 is located at or close to the bacterial membrane. By combining in vivo chemical cross-linking and cell fractionation techniques, we also show that during ϕ29 DNA replication there are large homomeric p1 complexes associated with the bacterial membrane. Furthermore, protein p1 encoded by plasmid generates membrane-associated multimers and supports DNA replication of a p1-lacking mutant phage, suggesting that the pre-assembled structures are functional. We discuss the possible role of the p1 structures in the formation of ϕ29 DNA replication compartments. Bacterial Strains, Bacteriophages, and Plasmids—B. subtilis 110NA, a non-suppressor (su -) strain, and B. subtilis MO-99, a suppressor strain (su +3), were used (19Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ϕ29 sus4 (56), sus3 (91) and sus2 (513) mutant phages were isolated by Moreno et al. (19Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ϕ29 sus1 (629) mutant phage was isolated by Reilly et al. (20Reilly B.E. Zeece V.M. Anderson D.L. J. Virol. 1973; 11: 756-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pPR55.p1, a HincII-HincII DNA fragment from ϕ29 (coordinates 1447–850) (21Yoshikawa H. Ito J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 17: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which contains the p1-encoding gene, was inserted into the T4 DNA polymerase-treated SphI site of the B. subtilis expression vector pPR55 (22Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmid-containing cells were grown in LB medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.1Google Scholar) supplemented with phleomycin (0.8 μg/ml). Phage Growth under One Step Conditions—Cultures were exponentially grown to ∼108 cells/ml, and then infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. After 10 min of incubation with gentle shaking, unadsorbed phages were eliminated by centrifugation of the infected culture. Cells were resuspended in the same volume of medium and incubated with vigorous shaking for the indicated time. Synthesis of Viral DNA—The method used to measure synthesis of viral DNA under one step phage growth conditions was as described (22Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Basically, total intracellular DNA was isolated at different times after infection, and analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide. Images were obtained with the UVITec UV/WL 23 system. Bands corresponding to unit length ϕ29 DNA were quantified using the Image quant v1.1 program. The relative amount of viral DNA refers to the intensity of the intracellular ϕ29 DNA band with respect to that of proteinase K-treated ϕ29 DNA (50 ng) used as internal marker. In Vivo Chemical Cross-linking—Bacteria were washed with 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and concentrated 20-fold in buffer P (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, pH 8.0). The cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce) was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, just before use and added to the concentrated culture at different final concentrations. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added at a final concentration of 150 mm to quench the reaction. Membrane Preparations—Membrane vesicles of B. subtilis cells were prepared as described (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This method is based essentially on the procedure described by Konings et al. (24Konings W.N. Bisschop A. Veenhuis M. Vermeulen C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-114 Phase Partitioning—Triton X-114 is a non-ionic detergent with a low cloud point (23 °C) enabling protein solubilization with phase partitioning of hydrophilic from amphiphilic proteins (18Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were concentrated 4-fold in 50 mm glucose, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Lysozyme was added at a final concentration of 120 μg/ml. After 10 min at room temperature, cells were sedimented by centrifugation. Detergent extraction of proteins was carried out overnight at 4 °C using 2% (v/v) Triton X-114 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described (25Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C prior to phase separation. For phase partitioning, the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting aqueous and detergent phases were supplemented with Triton X-114 or PBS, respectively, and washed three times by repeating the phase separation step. Prior to SDS-Tricine-PAGE (26Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), proteins from the phases were precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone at -20 °C for 1 h. Western Blots—Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using either a Trans Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 100 mA and 4 °C for 80 min, or a Mini Trans Blot (Bio-Rad) at 100 mA and 4 °C for 60 min. Transfer buffer contained 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. Membranes were probed with the indicated serum for 60 min. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity Purification of anti-p1 Antibodies—Protein p1 was transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, which were probed with anti-p1 serum for 16 h at 4 °C. Antibodies against p1 were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3. The eluted fraction was neutralized by adding 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Cells were washed with Sörensen's buffer (0.1 m dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 6% sucrose) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in Sörensen's buffer at 4 °C for 4 h. Cells were cryoprotected with 15% glycerol, in 0.1 m dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 30 min and 30% glycerol, in 0.1 m dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 30 min. Then, cells were pelleted and immediately layered onto a sterile cellulose ester membrane filter (Whatman). Wedge-shaped portions of this filter were cryofixed by plunging into liquid propane in a KF80 cryofixation unit (Reichert Jung). Freeze substitution was performed with pure methanol containing 0.5% uranyl acetate in an automatic freeze-substitution unit (AFS, Leica) at -85 °C for 54 h. The temperature was gradually increased (5 °C/h) to -35 °C and held constant for 24 h. Samples were washed with pure methanol three times for 1 h each at -35 °C and then were infiltrated in a graded series of Lowicryl K4M/methanol mixtures (1:2 for 1 h, 1:1 for 2 h, 3:1 for 2 h). Cells were embedded in Lowicryl K4 M at -35 °C for 24 h and polymerized for 24 h under ultraviolet irradiation. During the polymerization step, the temperature was gradually increased to 22 °C. Infiltration, embedding, and polymerization steps were carried out in an automatic freeze-substitution equipment (AFS, Leica). Thin sections (70 nm) were obtained by cutting the specimen on a Reichert Jung ultracut E ultramicrotome and placed on collodion carbon-coated grids for immunogold labeling. Thin sections on the grids were blocked with TBS (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5 min. Then, they were incubated with affinity-purified p1 antibodies (diluted 1:10 in 0.1% acetylated BSA in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with 0.1% acetylated BSA in TBS, sections were incubated with 10 nm colloidal gold-labeled protein A (Biocell) (diluted 1:25 in 1% BSA in TBS) for 45 min. The grids were washed in TBS and double-distilled water and air-dried. Finally, sections were stained with 2% of aquous uranyl acetate for 7 min and 0.2% lead citrate for 25 s. Electron micrographs were taken in a Jeol 1010 electron microscope at 80 kV. Protein p1 Has an Amphiphilic Nature—To perform experiments during in vivo viral DNA replication, B. subtilis nonsuppressor (su -) cells were infected with the ϕ29 sus4 (56) mutant phage. As shown in Fig. 1A, protein p1 and ϕ29 sus4 (56) DNA accumulated throughout the course of infection. At 30 min of infection, the intracellular level of p1 was similar to that previously measured in B. subtilis cells infected with the wild-type phage (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In ϕ29 sus4 (56) infected cells, the ϕ29 regulatory protein p4 is not synthesized and, consequently, late viral transcription is not activated. The late genes encode components of the viral capsids, proteins involved in phage morphogenesis and those required for cell lysis (27Salas M. Rojo F. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1993: 843-857Google Scholar). Hence, ϕ29 sus4 (56) DNA is replicated but it cannot be packaged into capsids. The C-terminal sequence of p1 spanning residues Tyr68 to Ala84 is highly hydrophobic (Fig. 1B). Cell fractionation studies, performed with ϕ29 sus4 (56) infected cells, showed that p1 is recovered in membrane fractions during viral DNA replication (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unlike the wild-type p1, a truncated p1 protein that lacks the C-terminal 43 amino acids neither associates with membranes in vivo nor self-interacts in vitro, although it interacts with the primer TP in vitro (15Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now investigated the nature of the association between protein p1 and membranes by phase partitioning with Triton X-114, a nonionic detergent widely used for the isolation of integral membrane proteins. This technique accurately predicts membrane localization of proteins (18Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To this end, at 30 min of ϕ29 sus4 (56) infection, when viral DNA replication was taking place (Fig. 1A), whole cells were solubilized with Triton X-114, and the soluble material was subjected to phase separation. An immunoblot analysis of the aqueous and detergent phases using polyclonal antibodies against the viral proteins p1 and p6 is shown in Fig. 2. Protein p1 was found exclusively in the detergent phase, whereas the hydrophilic protein p6, used as a control, was recovered in the aqueous phase. The nucleoid-associated protein p6 is essential for in vivo viral DNA replication (28Carrascosa J.L. Camacho A. Moreno F. Jiménez F. Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, this biochemical analysis shows that p1 has an amphiphilic nature, suggesting that it associates with membranes as an integral protein. Peripheral Location of p1 in Infected Cells by Immunoelectron Microscopy—In a complementary approach to localize p1 in infected cells, we used immunoelectron microscopy. To increase the signal of p1, cells were fixed and processed for immunolabeling at 45 min of ϕ29 sus4 (56) infection. At this time, the intracellular level of p1 was ∼3-fold higher than at 30 min, and synthesis of viral DNA was still taking place (see Fig. 1A). Cell sections were incubated with affinity-purified p1 antibodies and then incubated with colloidal gold-labeled protein A. As control, non-infected cells were processed. In both infected and non-infected cells, 1800 cross-sections on different grids were examined. In infected cells, 38.4% of the sections had one, two, or three gold particles (Fig. 3A). This percentage was 3.3-fold higher than in non-infected cells. In addition, the number of gold particles counted was 4.1-fold higher in infected than in non-infected cells. We also determined the number of gold particles located at cytoplasm and periphery on the cross-sections (Fig. 3B). Gold particles at the membrane and within ∼35 nm of the membrane were scored as being at the periphery. The most noticeable feature of the distribution of label was the high number of gold particles at the periphery of infected cell sections (out of 899 particles counted, 690 were at the periphery). This distribution reflects the positioning of p1, because in non-infected sections, out of 219 particles counted, 102 were at the periphery. Thus, the ratio between peripheral and cytoplasmic gold particles was 3.8-fold higher in infected than in non-infected cells. Cross-sections of infected cells with peripheral gold particles are shown in Fig. 3C. These results indicate that protein p1 is located at or near the cell membrane, rather than being randomly dispersed, and are consistent with its copurification with membranes on cell fractionation (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein p1 Forms Membrane-associated Multimeric Structures during in Vivo Viral DNA Replication—Protein p1 was shown to be able to self-interact into highly ordered structures in vitro (13Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The COILS prediction program (29Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) revealed that the region of p1 spanning residues Glu38 and Asn65 has a high probability (0.98) of forming a α-helical coiled-coil structure (Fig. 1B). Such a sequence functions to assemble an N-terminal truncated p1 protein (p1ΔN33) into two-dimensional sheets (30Bravo A. Serrano-Heras G. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21250-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To investigate whether p1 assembles in vivo into multimers that associate with the bacterial membrane, we carried out in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments followed by cell fractionation. At 30 min of ϕ29 sus4 (56) infection (see Fig. 1A), cells were incubated with different concentrations of BS3. This homobifunctional cross-linker reacts significantly with the ϵ-amine of lysine residues, which are frequent in p1 (12 residues out of 85). Following this treatment, membrane fractions were obtained by a method that yields almost exclusively “right-sideout” membrane vesicles (24Konings W.N. Bisschop A. Veenhuis M. Vermeulen C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total proteins from the membrane preparations were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-p1 serum (Fig. 4). As control, membrane preparations from non-infected cells were analyzed. The anti-p1 serum cross-reacted with a host membrane-associated protein that migrated at ∼50 kDa (protein X). This protein provided an internal control of specificity in the cross-linking reaction. In infected cells and in the absence of BS3, a product migrating as the p1 monomer (8.5 kDa) was detected. At low concentrations of BS3 (0.25–0.5 mm), two products migrating at 18 kDa and 30 kDa appeared (referred to as II and III in Fig. 4). These products are likely cross-linked p1 dimers and trimers, respectively, taking into account the MW of the BS3 cross-linker (572.43 Da). At 2 mm BS3, cross-linked p1-containing material that migrates between 43 kDa and 203 kDa was also detected. According to the regular pattern, they are presumably p1 homo-complexes. At 5 mm BS3, the p1 monomeric form was not detected, and the amount of p1 complexes smaller than 70 kDa drastically decreased. This decrease correlated with an increase in the amount of higher molecular weight complexes, which were specific of infected cells. Thus, we conclude that protein p1 assembles in vivo into large membrane-associated multimers. These multimeric structures are present during viral DNA replication. Assembly of p1 into Membrane-associated Multimers Also Occurs in the Absence of Viral Components—The ϕ29 replisome is constituted at least by a free molecule of the TP (primer protein) and the ϕ29 DNA polymerase. In vitro studies showed that this heterodimer interacts with the ends of the genome, where the replication origins are located. Then, replication starts by a protein-priming mechanism in which the ϕ29 DNA polymerase catalyzes the linkage of dAMP to the primer TP (12Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). We have analyzed whether membrane-associated p1 multimers are formed when initiation of in vivo ϕ29 DNA synthesis is blocked. To this end, B. subtilis su - cells were infected with the ϕ29 sus2 (513) mutant phage. Under these conditions, initiation of phage DNA replication is blocked due to the lack of the ϕ29 DNA polymerase. After 30 min of infection, cells were treated with BS3 and then fractionated. Immunoblot analysis of the membrane fractions using anti-p1 serum showed a pattern of cross-linked p1 complexes (not shown) similar to that observed during viral DNA replication (Fig. 4). The same result was obtained when B. subtilis su - cells were infected with the ϕ29 sus3 (91) mutant phage (not shown). In this case, ϕ29 DNA synthesis is blocked due to the lack of the primer TP. Thus, membrane-associated p1 multimers are also assembled in the absence of viral replisome components. We next studied whether other viral components are required for the formation of membrane-associated p1 multimers. To this end, the p1-encoding gene was inserted into the constitutive expression vector pPR55 (plasmid pPR55.p1). The amount of p1 was ∼2-fold higher in cells carrying the recombinant plasmid than in 45 min ϕ29 sus4 (56) infected cells, as determined by immunoblotting (not shown). When pPR55.p1-carrying cells were fractionated, p1 was recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5A). Moreover, after extraction with Triton X-114, p1 was exclusively found in the detergent phase (Fig. 5B). We also examined whether p1 formed multimeric structures by treatment of pPR55.p1-carrying cells with BS3. Cells harboring pPR55 were used as control. Fig. 5C shows an immunoblot analysis of the membrane fractions using anti-p1 serum. In pPR55.p1-carrying cells, the pattern of cross-linked p1 complexes was indistinguishable from that observed in ϕ29 sus4 (56) infected cells (Fig. 4). Immunoelectron microscopy studies using affinity-purified p1 antibodies confirmed the peripheral location of p1 in pPR55.p1-carrying cells (Fig. 6). Again, cells harboring pPR55 were used as control. In both cases, 1800 cross-sections on different grids were examined. In vector-carrying cells, only 8.5% of the sections were labeled, and 164 gold particles were counted (Fig. 6A). In pPR55.p1-carrying cells, the percentage of labeled sections increased 4.8-fold. Moreover, the total number of gold particles increased 9.7-fold. Most of the labeled sections (83.3%) had one, two, or three gold particles, although sections with 4 to 8 gold particles were also found. Fig. 6B shows the distribution of the gold particles on the cross-sections. In vector-carrying cells, out of the 164 particles counted, 69 were at the periphery, whereas in pPR55.p1-carrying cells, out of the 1596 particles counted, 1252 were at the periphery. Thus, the ratio between peripheral and cytoplasmic gold particles was 5-fold higher in pPR55.p1-containing cells. Cross-sections of pPR55.p1-carrying cells with peripheral gold particles are shown in Fig. 6C.Fig. 6Localization of p1 in pPR55.p1-carrying cells by immunoelectron microscopy. Affinity-purified p1 antibodies were used. A, histogram of the number of cross-sections with the indicated number of gold particles. B, number of gold particles found at the indicated position.

If these p1 structures were similar to those assembled in infected cells, we reasoned that they should support replication of a p1-lacking mutant phage. To assess this prediction, we analyzed replication of the ϕ29 sus1 (629) mutant phage in different genetic backgrounds: plasmid-free suppressor (su +) cells and non-suppressor (su -) cells carrying either pPR55 or pPR55.p1 (Fig. 7). When pPR55-carring su - cells were infected with the ϕ29 sus1 (629) mutant phage, no synthesis of viral DNA was detected. In contrast, phage DNA replication took place in pPR55.p1-carrying su - cells. In these cells, the kinetics of accumulation of viral DNA was even faster than that obtained in su + cells infected with the sus1 (629) mutant, and the amount of viral DNA accumulated at 35 min was ∼2-fold higher. Hence, these results suggest that the membrane-associated p1 structures formed in pPR55.p1-carrying cells are functional in trans. Assembly of p1 into Membrane-associated Multimeric Structures—A remarkable finding of this study is that protein p1 of phage ϕ29 assembles in vivo into large multimeric structures. Furthermore, these structures interact with the bacterial membrane, as supported by the following results. (i) Protein p1 has an amphiphilic nature, as determined by Triton X-114 phase partitioning. (ii) p1 copurifies with membranes on cell fractionation (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and (iii) immunoelectron microscopy studies show that p1 has a peripheral subcellular location. In infected cells, membrane-associated p1 structures exist both when viral DNA replication takes place and when initiation of ϕ29 DNA synthesis is blocked due to the lack of viral replisome components. Membrane-associated p1 structures are also generated in cells harboring a p1-encoding plasmid, indicating that their formation does not require other viral components. The ability of p1 to self-associate has also been demonstrated in vitro. For example, protein p1 functions as a polymerization domain when it is fused to the maltose-binding protein, leading to the formation of long filamentous structures (13Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, a truncated p1 protein that lacks the N-terminal 33 amino acids self-interacts into two-dimensional protofilament sheets. This assembly is mediated by a short α-helical coiled-coil sequence (30Bravo A. Serrano-Heras G. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21250-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil motif is also the main structural element in eukaryotic lamins, a class of nuclear intermediate filament proteins (31Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 32Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In vivo, different lamin proteins form the nuclear lamina, a thin fibrous structure immediately underlying the inner nuclear membrane of most eukaryotic cell nuclei (33Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Lopez-Soler R.I. Yoon M. Goldman A.E. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined what kind of structures p1 would form in vivo. Role of the Membrane-associated p1 Structures in ϕ29 DNA Replication—Parental ϕ29 DNA-membrane complexes have been isolated from infected cells. Formation of these complexes, which were detected near the onset of viral DNA replication, required the synthesis of early ϕ29-encoded proteins (11Ivarie R.D. Pène J.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our present results support an in vivo replication model in which a p1 structure assembled on the bacterial membrane provides a specific site for ϕ29 DNA replication (15Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, the ϕ29 DNA replication machinery, constituted at least by the primer TP-ϕ29 DNA polymerase heterodimer, would be targeted to the membrane-associated p1 structure. This association could be achieved by protein-protein interactions between protein p1 and primer TP, since the N-terminal 42 amino acid residues of p1 are sufficient for binding to the primer TP in vitro (15Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once ϕ29 DNA replication starts by a protein-priming mechanism, the primer TP remains covalently bound to the newly synthesized DNA and thereby, viral DNA becomes membrane-associated when it is replicated. This compartmentalization model also accounts for the presence of p1, primer TP and ϕ29 DNA polymerase in membrane fractions of infected cells when initiation of phage DNA replication is blocked due to the lack of the nucleoid-associated protein p6 (14Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role proposed for the membrane-associated p1 structure resembles the function of the eukaryotic nuclear matrix in adenovirus DNA replication. Like phage ϕ29, the genome of adenovirus is a linear double-stranded DNA with a TP covalently attached to each 5′-end. Therefore, its replication proceeds via a protein-priming mechanism (34de Jong R.N. van der Vliet P.C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation studies indicated that adenovirus DNA is tightly bound to the nuclear matrix throughout the course of infection (35Younghusband H.B. Maundrell K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bodnar J.W. Hanson P.I. Polvino-Bodnar M. Zempsky W. Ward D.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that this attachment is mediated by the TP covalently bound to the DNA (37Schaack J. Ho W.Y. Freimuth P. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1197-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the precursor of the TP, which interacts with the viral DNA polymerase and primes DNA replication, binds to the nuclear matrix both in vivo and in vitro (4Fredman J.N. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3384-3395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the nuclear matrix is thought to provide the structural framework on which the replication factors and DNA can bind and interact. Comparison with other Viral Systems—Replication of eukaryotic viral genomes does not occur randomly in the infected cell but is localized to specific sites. Replication of most DNA viruses occurs within the cell nucleus. In this case, nuclear substructures seem to be involved in the formation of DNA replication compartments (5Bridge E. Petterson U. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 99-117PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 38Verheijen R. Van Venrooij W. Ramaekers F. J. Cell Science. 1988; 90: 11-36PubMed Google Scholar). For example, as mentioned above, adenovirus replicates at distinct subnuclear sites on the nuclear matrix (39Pombo A. Ferreira J. Bridge E. Carmo-Fonseca M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5075-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 40Angeletti P.C. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, the docking to specific intracellular membranes seems to be essential for the assembly of active replication complexes. Membranes appear to function not just as a way of compartmentalizing virus RNA replication, but also appear to have a central role in the organization and function of the replication machinery (7Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some progress has been made in understanding how the viral RNA replication apparatus is fixed to specific types of membranes. In Semliki Forest virus, binding of the viral replicase to endosomal/lysosomal membranes is likely mediated by the RNA-capping protein Nsp1, which has affinity for negatively charged phospholipids (41Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 42Lampio A. Kilpeläinen I. Pesonen S. Karhi K. Auvinen P. Somerharju P. Kääriäinen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37853-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tobacco etch potyvirus 6-kDa protein is thought to be necessary for targeting viral RNA replication complexes to endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes. This protein associates with membranes as an integral protein via a 19 amino acid hydrophobic domain (43Schaad M.C. Jensen P.E. Carrington J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4049-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In contrast to those viruses, a host-encoded protein seems to act as a membrane anchor of the tobamoviruses replication complexes. This protein associates with membranes and interacts with the helicase domain of virus-encoded replication proteins (44Yamanaka T. Ohta T. Takahashi M. Meshi T. Schmidt R. Dean C. Naito S. Ishikawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10107-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In poliovirus, electron microscopy revealed that purified RNA-dependent RNA polymerase forms planar and tubular oligomeric arrays. In addition, membranous vesicles isolated from infected cells contain structures consistent with the presence of two-dimensional polymerase arrays on their surfaces during infection (45Lyle J.M. Bullitt E. Bienz K. Kirkegaard K. Science. 2002; 296: 2218-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, as it happens in eukaryotic viral genomes, replication of the B. subtilis phage ϕ29 occurs at specific subcellular localizations. We suggest that the p1 structure assembled on the cell membrane provides an anchoring site for the ϕ29 replication complexes. We thank M. T. Rejas for help with immunoelectron microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2001231205,"We previously developed a system to investigate the mechanism of repeat sequence expansion during eukaryotic Okazaki fragment processing. Upstream and downstream primers were annealed to a complementary template to overlap across a CAG repeat region. Annealing by the competing primers lead to structural intermediates that ligated to expand the repeat segment. When an equal number of repeats overlapped on the upstream and downstream primers, a 2-fold expansion was expected, but no expansion occurred. We show here that such substrates do not expand irrespective of their repeat length. To reveal mechanism, we tested different hairpin loop intermediates expected to form and facilitate ligation. Substrates configured to form large loops in either the upstream or downstream primer alone allowed expansion. Large or small fixed position single loops allowed expansion when located at least six nucleotides up- or downstream of the nick. Fixed loops in both primers, simulating a double loop intermediate, allowed expansion as long as each loop was nine nucleotides from the nick. Thus, neither the double loop configuration required to form with equal length overlaps nor the large single loop configuration are fundamental structural impediments to expansion. We propose a model for the expansion mechanism based on the relative stabilities of single loop, double loop, hairpin, and flap intermediates that is consistent with the observed expansion efficiency of equal and unequal overlap substrates. The model suggests that the equilibrium concentration of double loop intermediates is so vanishingly small that they are not likely contributors to sequence expansion.

Repeat sequences are distributed widely in all organisms, forming the micro- and mini-satellite regions of their chromosomal DNAs (1Bennett P. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 53: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Triplet repeat sequences have attracted particular attention, because they are involved in pathogenesis of at least 14 neurological disorders (2Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Of interest are the CAG, CGG, and GAA repeat tracts that are present in the normal population in lengths of 10–25 triplets and show significant length polymorphisms. In a subset of the population repeat lengths reach the relatively stable pre-mutational length of 30–50 repeats, which then undergo large intergenerational expansion by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Repeat sequences present in coding regions expand to a smaller extent than repeats that are located in 3′-untranslated region or regulatory regions that show expansion into thousands of repeats (2Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Locus-specific expansion of CAG/CTG and CGG/CCG sequences suggests that the instability is an inherent property of repeat DNA (3Goellner G.M. Tester D. Thibodeau S. Almqvist E. Goldberg Y.P. Hayden M.R. McMurray C.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 879-890PubMed Google Scholar). One characteristic of such DNA is the ability of repeat sequences to slip and mispair because of partial self-complementarity in the region. This gives rise to secondary structures in DNA (4Chastain P.D. Sinden R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Pearson C.E. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although slip mispairing can occur at all repeat sequences, only GAA, CGG, and CTG repeats exhibit expansion in vivo (6Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These sequences have the additional quality that they can form secondary structures with high stability. Single strands of CTG and CGG repeats have higher melting temperatures than repeats of the other triplets (7Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12803-12811Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the single strands of these sequences form more stable hydrogen-bonded fold-back structures than those of the other triplets, as determined by NMR (7Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9426-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and yeast, CTG and CGG repeats show significantly higher propensity for expansions and deletions than repeat tracts of non-structure-forming sequences, indicating that DNA structure plays a role in instability in vivo (11Ohshima K. Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1853-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Miret J.J. Pessoa-Brandao L. Lahue R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Slip mispairing can occur when DNA is in a single stranded form during replication, repair, and recombination (13Ohshima K. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. Petruska J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examination of imperfect repeat sequences in patients showed that repeats were most frequently added on the 3′ end of the segment (15Eichler E.E. Holden J.J. Popovich B.W. Reiss A.L. Snow K. Thibodeau S.N. Richards C.S. Ward P.A. Nelson D.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This polarity in expansion suggested that the mechanism is associated with synthesis of DNA. Moreover, synthesis by DNA polymerase in vitro was found to pause frequently across repeat sequences indicating the presence of secondary structures (13Ohshima K. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This decreased rate of synthesis was expected to further facilitate structure formation. Additional orientation dependence was observed for repeat instability first in yeast and E. coli and more recently in mammalian cell extracts and cell lines (17Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13926-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expansion and deletion of CTG repeats occurred mostly on the lagging strand, implicating lagging strand synthesis as a source of instability (12Miret J.J. Pessoa-Brandao L. Lahue R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell.

Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). CTG sequences tended to expand when present on the Okazaki fragment strand, whereas they underwent deletions when present on the lagging strand template (12Miret J.J. Pessoa-Brandao L. Lahue R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell.

This correlates with the particular stability of secondary structure in CTG hairpins, which were found to be more stable than CAG hairpins. Based on the ability of repeat sequences to form stable secondary structure and their propensity to expand when present on the lagging strand, Gordenin et al. (23Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) proposed a model for repeat sequence expansion. They hypothesized that during lagging strand synthesis, strand displacement within the repeat sequence will result in generation of a flap that could form stable secondary structure. Such secondary structures, they proposed, would be resistant to processing by the structure-specific 5′ flap endonuclease (FEN1) that is involved in resolution of Okazaki fragments (23Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Re-annealing of the flap without the removal of repeats within the flap sequence would then result in generation of sequence expansion in the daughter strand. Indeed yeast FEN1 null mutants show an increased propensity to expand repeat sequences (20Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 25Ireland M.J. Reinke S.S. Livingston D.M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, CTG and CGG containing flaps were found to be resistant to FEN1 cleavage in vitro (26Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1079-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have previously described a model system designed to recapitulate strand displacement within a CAG/CTG repeat region in vitro, to study the cis and trans factors that influence sequence expansion (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide model consists of a template strand containing 10 CAG repeats that are flanked by random sequences. To its 3′ end we annealed a complementary downstream primer with CTG repeats at its 5′ end. An upstream primer with a varying number of CTG repeats at its 3′ end was also annealed, such that it strand-displaced varying lengths of downstream primer into a 5′ flap or caused slip mispairing that could result in formation of expansion intermediates (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that the repeat sequence substrate and DNA ligase I alone were sufficient to allow expansion by ligation of the overlapping strands (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Addition of FEN1 to this reaction resulted in a decrease in expanded product and increase in correctly sized DNA segment. However, as the number of repeats on the upstream primer was increased such that more repeats were displaced into a 5′ flap on the downstream primer, FEN1 cleavage of these flaps and the subsequent formation of correct sized product were greatly decreased (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with the proposed model for sequence expansion resulting from decreased processing of repeat containing flaps. Surprisingly, whereas flap cleavage decreased with increase in primer overlap, ligation of the overlapped segments did not concomitantly increase. On the contrary, as the repeat number on the upstream primer approached that on the downstream primer, ligation efficiency dropped precipitously. This suggested that repeat sequence expansion to lengths of 2-fold or greater may not occur by simple joining of unprocessed flaps that re-anneal to ligatable intermediates. In the current study, we examine why ligation efficiency of triplet repeat sequences decreases with increase in the length of overlap. To establish mechanism, we determined the properties of slipped DNA intermediates that can mediate ligation-based expansion during lagging strand synthesis and processing. We find that very few slipped DNA intermediates are refractory to ligation-based expansion. The factor limiting expansion of certain length overlaps during Okazaki fragment processing is a feature of the DNA itself and not of the transacting factors. We propose a model that is based on the propensity of repeat DNA to form certain types of intermediates and the stability of these intermediates as the basis for sequence expansion. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or by Genosys Biotechnologies (Woodlands, TX). Radionucleotides [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (labeling grade) were from Roche Diagnostics. Recombinant N-terminal His-tagged human DNA ligase I was cloned into the pHIS expression vector and was expressed and purified from E. coli as reported previously (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yeast FEN1 expression and purification was performed as described previously (28Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Oligonucleotide Substrates—Repeat sequence model substrates were generated as described previously (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides were designed to mimic the last steps of Okazaki fragment processing. Each substrate consisted of a template strand annealed with a downstream primer at its 5′ end and an upstream primer at its 3′ end. The sequences of oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. The template and downstream primers contained CAG/CTG repeats, having complete complementarity. Upstream primers containing varying number of repeats, which overlap with the CTG repeats of the downstream primer, are added to complete substrate formation. The (CTG) n substrates each contained n number of CTG repeats at the 3′ ends of the upstream primer. In the final substrate, the upstream and downstream primers contain sequences complimentary to the template and overlap across the repeat region. These overlapping regions should result in a dynamic equilibrium between the primers. This would produce intermediates involving strand displacement of one primer to form flap and loop structures involving one or both primers. A nick substrate that lacked overlapping CTG repeats was used as a control for ligation efficiency.Table IOligonucleotide sequence Fixed CTG bubbles on downstream or upstream primer were configured by annealing a primer with six internal CTG repeats, flanked by non-repeat sequences, to a template complementary to the non-repeat sequences. Such primers were aligned to create a nick with an adjacent primer. This annealing configuration would result in the formation of a six-CTG repeat hairpin at varying distances from the nick. Prior to annealing the downstream primer was radiolabeled at its 3′ end. The downstream primer (10 pmol) was annealed to labeling template T1 (25 pmol) generating a recessed 3′ end and was then extended with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow polymerase at 37 °C for 3 h. Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed using Micro Bio-spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Upstream primers were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP in an end labeling reaction with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled primers were isolated and purified on a 10% 7 m urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Substrates were generated by annealing the downstream primer, template, and upstream primer at a molar ratio of 1:2:4, respectively. Downstream, template, and upstream primers were diluted into 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction was placed at 70 °C and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. Enzyme Assays—Assays contained indicated amounts of substrate, DNA ligase I, or yeast FEN1 in reaction buffer in a final volume of 20 μl. Reaction buffer contained 30 mm Hepes, pH 8.0 (diluted from a 1 m stock), 40 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% inositol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Assays were assembled on ice and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of termination dye (95% formamide (v/v), 1 mm EDTA with 0.5% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel and detected by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was done using ImageQuant v1.2 software from Amersham Biosciences. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. Analysis for Stability of Structural Intermediates—Free energies for various structural intermediates formed by overlapping CTG repeats was calculated using M-fold, a software used to determine structures formed by single stranded DNA. The software calculates the free energy of formation for various structures formed by user specified sequences because of intra-strand base pairing (29Zuker M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The free energy estimates predict the stability of various intermediates and the abundance in solution of these structures (30SantaLucia Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). The algorithm allows users to force the formation of specific base pairs and therefore various structures formed by a given sequence. This makes possible the estimation of free energy of various intermediates expected to form by overlapping repeats. The three primers used to form the overlapping repeat substrate were entered into M-fold as one single stranded DNA molecule. The 5′ end of the downstream primer was used as the 5′ end of the single stranded DNA. To its 3′ end, the 5′ end of the template followed by the 5′ end of the upstream primer was linked using a six-nucleotide random sequence designated the N string. The N string allows for the formation of hairpin loops at the junction of upstream and downstream primer to the template sequence. The structures formed by overlap of 10 CTG repeats on the downstream and upstream primers competing to base pair to the complimentary CAG repeat on the template was obtained at 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2. 1J. SantaLucia, Jr., M. Zuker, A. Bommarito, and R. J. Irani, unpublished results. Double loop and flap-loop intermediates were formed by forcing specific bases in the sequence to base pair as permitted by the software. The free energy of flap formation was obtained by subtracting the free energy of structure formed by a string of 10 CTG repeats from the free energy of the fold-back flap structure. We set out to test the hypothesis that equal length overlapping repeat segments lead to the formation of intermediates unfavorable for ligation. The intention was to use the results of that analysis to discern the intermediates and mechanisms that favor expansions. To assess expansion efficiency, complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to simulate the template, downstream, and upstream fragments in the configuration formed during Okazaki fragment synthesis and processing (27Henricksen L. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The template oligonucleotide included an internal repeat segment of 10 CAG repeats, to which a complementary 3′ downstream primer containing a 10-CTG repeat and 5′ upstream primers with varying numbers of repeats were annealed such that they overlapped within the repeat segment (Fig. 1a). The overlapping configuration of upstream and downstream primer results in transient strand displacement of the downstream primer into a 5′ flap. However, as the substrates contain sequence repeats, they can slip and mispair to generate a nick that can be joined by DNA ligase to expand the daughter strand. Our experimental design does not address the potential effects of template folding. Such folding might be expected to promote repeat sequence contraction. Decreased Expansion Efficiency with Increase in Overlap Length—In the presence of increasing amounts of human DNA ligase I, overlapping repeat segments on the upstream and downstream primers were joined, resulting in expansion of the daughter strand (Fig. 1b). The ligation efficiency increased as the repeat number on the upstream primer was increased to six CTGs (Fig. 1b, lanes 1–24). However, as the repeat length on the upstream primer was increased to seven, there was a sharp decline in the formation of expanded product. Expansion by ligation was completely suppressed as the overlap length was increased from 8 to 10 repeats even at large enzyme excess (Fig. 1b, lanes 29–36). The same decrease in ligation efficiency with length of overlap also occurred when the number of repeats was fixed for the upstream primer and varied on the downstream primer (data not shown). This indicates some form of symmetry in the phenomenon. Both results would appear to be inconsistent with the acceleration of repeat expansion with increasing repeat length observed in vivo (2Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Further, this result suggests a size limitation on expansions based on direct ligation of DNA replication intermediates. Overlapping repeat segments of equal length must form double loop intermediates to be joined by DNA ligase I for expansion. For example, in a 10-10 repeat overlap, a 9-1 intermediate will carry a 9-repeat loop on one primer and a 1-repeat loop on the other. Theoretically, many such loop intermediates may be formed. The lack of expansion products with 8-10 or 10-10 overlap (Fig. 1b, lanes 29–36) indicates that either the formation of a suitable double loop intermediate or the position of these loops might interfere with ligation and limit expansion. This issue lead us to examine the substrate structures that influence ligation. Suppressed Ligation Is Independent of Repeat Length—We first determined whether the decrease in ligation efficiency correlated with size of the repeat segment on the template. Templates were designed to contain either 5 or 20 CAG repeats, and each was annealed to a downstream primer containing 5 or 20 CTG repeats, respectively. These substrates were then annealed to upstream primers with 3′ repeats of varying lengths and tested for expansion by DNA ligase (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the substrates with both 5 and 20 repeat-containing templates showed results similar to those with the 10-CAG substrate. Upstream primers producing small overlaps allowed formation of expanded products on both the 5- and 20-repeat substrate (Fig. 2, a and b, lanes 1–15). However, increasing the overlap length to 5 repeats on the (CAG)5 substrate resulted in complete prevention of expansion, as did increasing the repeat length to 18 in the case of (CAG)20 substrate (Fig. 2, a, lanes 16–20, and b, lanes 21–25). Again this phenomenon was independent of the enzyme concentration. These results verified that expansion does not occur when overlap regions contain about equal numbers of repeats, irrespective of the size of the repeat segment. This suggests that an equal length overlap across a repeat region, when produced during lagging strand DNA replication, would also inhibit ligation. A Mechanism for 2n Expansion—Lack of 2n expansion when repeat segments overlap suggested that the position or size of a loop on either upstream or downstream primer is inhibitory to the activity of DNA Ligase I. To manipulate the size and position of the loop in a systematic manner, we employed primers such that all of the additional repeats for expansion (up to 2n) were contributed by only one primer. In different experiments the extra repeats would be only on either the upstream or the downstream primer. For example, in the substrate used in Fig. 3a, we annealed downstream primers with 10, 15, 18, and 20 CTG repeats to a template with 10 CAG repeats and an upstream primer that has no repeats. The upstream primer is complementary to the random sequence on the 3′ end of the template. We tested repeat loops of various sizes on both up- and downstream primers that were annealed to (CAG)5 and (CAG)10 templates. We observed that on these substrates DNA ligase could join the two primers irrespective of the size and site of the loop relative to the nick (Fig. 3). Interestingly, a 2n expanded product was readily formed, resulting from joining of primers when (CTG)10 and (CTG)20 primers were annealed to a (CAG)5 and (CAG)10 template, respectively (Fig. 3, a, lanes 16–20, and b and c). Apparently, template size-independent 2n expansion can occur in our system when there is slip mispairing on only one of the fragments and may occur by a similar mechanism in vivo. A possible reason for the observed lack of 2-fold expansion in the previous experiments is the overlapping configuration in which the substrates were annealed across the repeat region. The overlapping segments may interact with the template and each other in a way that prevents the formation of stable double loop intermediates that could be substrates for expansion. Comparing the efficiency of ligation of the loops formed on upstream and downstream primers on (CAG)5 and (CAG)10 substrates, there were some subtle but noteworthy differences. We observed lower levels of ligation on the (CAG)5 template (Fig. 3b). Downstream and upstream (CTG)10 repeat-containing primers ligated, but at less than 30% efficiency, whereas the nick substrates were joined at 80% efficiency. Ligation efficiency of upstream and downstream (CTG)20 primers annealed to the (CAG)10 template was about 50%. Slip mispairing can result in formation of either a single large loop comprising the entire excess repeat, anywhere relative to the nick, or multiple smaller loops distributed across the repeat region. The fact that (CTG)20 primers ligated with comparatively high efficiency (about 50%) suggested that a single large loop is formed, as smaller loops would be equally as inhibitory as larger ones, in both smaller and larger repeat segments, if located at the same distance from the adjacent DNA fragment. Further, the lower ligation efficiency on the smaller repeat segment suggests that a relatively large loop, formed closer to the nick on smaller repeat segments, interferes with the ligase or is unstable so as not to form ligatable intermediates. Loop Position and Not Size Modulates DNA Ligase Activity— The substrates used thus far in the study are dynamic in that they allow the formation of multiple loop intermediates. The effect of any one intermediate is indistinguishable from that of the others. To study the effect of a specific intermediate on the activity of DNA ligase, we designed substrates that cont"
