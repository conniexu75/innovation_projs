https://openalex.org/W2056472979,"Microbes that couple growth to the reduction of manganese could play an important role in the biogeochemistry of certain anaerobic environments. Such a bacterium, Alteromonas putrefaciens MR-1, couples its growth to the reduction of manganese oxides only under anaerobic conditions. The characteristics of this reduction are consistent with a biological, and not an indirect chemical, reduction of manganese, which suggest that this bacterium uses manganic oxide as a terminal electron acceptor. It can also utilize a large number of other compounds as terminal electron acceptors; this versatility could provide a distinct advantage in environments where electron-acceptor concentrations may vary."

However, the reason for one of the fundamental characteristics of this phenomena, its quasi-periodicity, has remained unclear. Recently available evidence from a number of sources now suggests that the ENSO ""cycle"" operates as a natural oscillator based on relatively simple couplings between the tropical atmospheric circulation, the dynamics of the warm upper layer of the tropical ocean, and sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This concept and recent field evidence supporting the natural coupled oscillator hypothesis are outlined."

https://openalex.org/W2009152647,"The rate of accumulation of seismic moment in Wadati-Benioff zones is used to estimate strain rates in subducting slabs that are sinking through the asthenosphere. Between depths of 75 and 175 kilometers a typical down-dip strain rate is about 10(-15) per second, which implies that slabs in this depth range typically accumulate strain of order 10(-1). This result is in accord with geometrical arguments that subducted slabs must experience large membrane strains to deform to their observed shapes. Mantle seismicity (repeated catastrophic shear failure) is apparently a primary mechanism by which large membrane strains accumulate in the cold cores of subducting slabs. Slabs are penetratively deformed, and they have low flexural rigidity compared to oceanic plates at the earth's surface."

The particles are Feulgen-positive, they are fluorescent under ultraviolet light when stained with acridine orange, and they appear in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in radioautographic preparations."

X-ray diffraction patterns showed that it was in the form of calcite. The calcite was inside the trichomes, and its depositional pattern conformed to the shape of the trichomes. A small amount of opal was present in the trichomes."

https://openalex.org/W2012032476,"ship to other entomogenous fungi has not been clearly understood up to the present time, and, like many other entomogenous forms, it is worthy of especial consideration because it attacks an insect of some economic importance. Although the organism was apparently first observed by Leidy (1850), the first description of it was published by Peck (I879). It seems probable that Peck observed the resting spores of the fungus as well as its conidia, but apparently he did not observe the processes associated with the formation of either of these types of reproductive bodies, and, lacking the information that a study of such stages would have afforded him, the organism was erroneously placed near Protomyccs among the Coniomycetes. Thaxter (I888) almost simultaneously with Forbes (I888), published a brief note in which the fungus was considered as a member of the Entomophthorales, but as only a few old dried specimens were available for study at the time, none of which showed the resting spores, he apparently did not feel fully justified in assigning it to this family of fungi. In addition to the above mentioned papers, several others have appeared such as those of Butler (I886) and Marlatt (I907), in which the gross appearance of the fungus and of the diseased cicadas was briefly described, but with the exception of the above 72"
