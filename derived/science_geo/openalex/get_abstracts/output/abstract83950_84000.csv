https://openalex.org/W2024964870,"We have identified a transcriptional control region of the herpes simplex virus tk gene. This finding results from in vivo transcription assays of specific deletion mutants constructed in vitro. A region located between 40 and 100 nucleotides upstream from the putative transcription start site of the tk gene can promote transcription by RNA polymerase form II in the complete absence of the mRNA-coding component of the gene. When the region is deleted enzymatically from a 5′ direction, accurate transcriptional expression is reduced by a factor of 50. The small remaining level of accurate transcription is eliminated by deletion of sequences from 32 to 16 nucleotides upstream from the structural gene. It appears that the sequences between 16 and 32 nucleotides upstream from the 5′ terminus of the tk gene are required to specify the exact start site of transcription. Control of both the efficiency of transcription and rough specification of the position of initiation, however, depends on sequences 40–100 nucleotides upstream from the tk structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W2015152309,"We describe the isolation of a cloned DNA segment carrying unique sequences from the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Sequences within the cloned segment are shown to hybridize in situ to the white locus region on the polytene chromosomes of both wild-type strains and strains carrying chromosomal rearrangements whose breakpoints bracket the white locus. We further show that two small deficiency mutations, deleting white locus genetic elements but not those of complementation groups contiguous to white, delete the genomic sequences corresponding to a portion of the cloned segment. The strategy we have employed to isolate this cloned segment exploits the existence of an allele at the white locus containing a copy of a previously cloned transposable, reiterated DNA sequence element. We describe a simple, rapid method for retrieving cloned segments carrying a copy of the transposable element together with contiguous sequences corresponding to this allele. The strategy described is potentially general and we discuss its application to the cloning of the DNA sequences of other genes in Drosophila, including those identified only by genetic analysis and for which no RNA product is known."
https://openalex.org/W1966824234,"The genome sizes of mitochondrial DNA from darkgrown (etiolated) shoots of several higher plants were determined by reassociation kinetics and restriction analysis. Kinetic complexities obtained from reassociation kinetics measured spectrophotometrically indicate a mitochondrial genome size of 1600 Md for muskmelon, 1000 Md for cucumber, 560 Md for zucchini squash and 220 Md for watermelon (four species in the cucurbit family), as well as 240 Md for pea and 320 Md for corn. The kinetic curves also reveal the presence (except in corn) of sequences of a few magadaltons of complexity, reiterated about 10-50 times and representing 5%- 10% of the DNA in each mitochondrial genome. Molecular weight summation of fragments resulting from digestion with restriction endonucleases Sal I and Kpn I give genome size estimates similar to those obtained from reassociation kinetics, except for muskmelon and cucumber, for which the large number of fragments of similar size limits our estimate to at least 500 Md. The number of mitochondrial genomes per diploid cell is estimated to be about 110 to 140 for muskmelon, zucchini and watermelon. We consider the possible evolutionary mechanisms by which the mitochondrial genome has grown within the cucurbit family and the possible reasons for the existance of a seven to eight-fold range in mitochondrial genome size among such closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W1969049566,"When SV40-infected cells are placed into hypertonic medium, newly synthesized DNA accumulates as form C catenated dimers. These molecules consist of two supercoiled monomer circles of SV40 DNA interlocked by one or more topological inter-twinings and are seen as transiently labeled inter-mediates during normal replication. Form C catenated dimers represent pure segregation intermediates, replicative DNA structures in which DNA synthesis is complete but which still require topological separation of the two daughter circles. Hypertonic shock seems to block selectively a type II topoisomerase activity involved in disentangling the two circles. This is reflected in the fact that form C catenated dimers that accumulate during the block are highly intertwined with catenation linkage numbers up to C(L) = 20. While initiation of replication is also inhibited by hypertonic treatment, ongoing SV40 DNA synthesis is not affected, and replication is free to proceed from the earliest cairns structure through to form C catenated dimers. The block to segregation is rapidly and completely released by shifting the cells back to normal medium. A much slower recovery of DNA segregation takes place on prolonged incubation in hypertonic medium, perhaps because of some cellular homeostatic mechanism. The results of this work lead to a detailed view of the final stages of SV40 DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1967847292,"We analyzed the DNA binding properties of wild-type simian virus 40 large T antigen and found that the protein binds cooperatively to three tandem sites at a regulatory region of SV40 DNA. One consequence of this T antigen:DNA interaction is the specific repression of SV40 early RNA synthesis in vitro. We mapped a region of 85 base pairs that is necessary and sufficient to initiate early SV40 transcription in vitro. This promoter region lies directly adjacent to the third T antigen binding site but does not include the “TATA” sequence. To determine how T antigen interacts with its binding sites to repress RNA synthesis, we analyzed transcription directed by a variety of wild-type, mutant and hybrid template DNAs. Our findings suggest that the cooperative binding of T antigen to its sites is directly responsible for inhibiting the initiation, rather than blocking elongation, of early RNA synthesis. A model is presented to explain the role of T antigen binding in the regulation of viral transcription and DNA replication during SV40 lytic infection."

https://openalex.org/W2157114921,"Abstract We demonstrate that the interaction of polypeptide ligands with cells under physiological conditions can be described by a set of steady state equations. These equations include four new rate constants: V r , the rate of insertion of receptors into the cell membrane; K e , the endocytotic rate constant of occupied receptors; K t , the turnover rate constant of unoccupied receptors; and K h , the rate constant of hydrolysis of internalized ligand. Several simple procedures are described for determining these constants. In experiments in which epidermal growth factor and human fibroblasts were used, the cell-ligand interactions followed the predictions of the steady state model. The utility of the steady state equations is demonstrated by establishing the kinetic basis of the commonly observed down regulation phenomenon and by quantitating the effect of methylamine on the endocytotic and degradation rates of epidermal growth factor. We also show that the slope of a Scatchard of steady state binding data is a complex constant including terms for the endocytotic rate of both occupied and unoccupied receptors. The X-intercept of such a plot is a function of the insertion rate of new receptors, the internalization rate of occupied receptors and the degradation rate of the internalized ligand. The steady state equations allow one to predict changes in cellular ligand binding resulting from alterations in the four rate constants. They also provide a foundation for computer simulations of ligand-cell interactions, which closely correspond to experimental data. These approaches should facilitate studies on the control of cellular activities by these polypeptide ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2038120548,"Transposition of the insertion element gamma delta is thought to involve formation of intermediates in which the element is present at each junction between donor and target replicons. In vivo these cointegrate structures are rapidly converted to the end products of transposition by site-specific recombination at a defined sequence, res, that is present in each directly repeated gamma delta element. Resolvase, an element encoded protein of molecular weight 21,000 is required for cointegrate resolution. I have demonstrated site-specific recombination in vitro using purified resolvase and a cointegrate analog substrate. The required components of the system described here are resolvase, negatively supercoiled substrate DNA, buffer and Mg2+. Neither host-encoded products nor high energy cofactors appear to be required for resolution in vitro. Catenated, resolved molecules are the major products of the reaction. Elimination of Mg2+ from the reaction yields different product molecules. The in vitro system described here provides an opportunity for detailed study of the resolution reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1607116311,"Gelsolin complexes with calcium (gelsolin-Ca2+) binds to the ends of actin filaments to which monomers add preferentially during elongation. It forms a stable complex with actin in a low ionic strength solution which does not normally favor the polymerization of actin. Gelsolin-Ca2+ increases the rate of nucleation of actin which precedes polymerization, but decreases the rate of elongation of the filaments. The final average length of filaments formed in the presence of gelsolin-Ca2+ is shorter and the equilibrium monomer concentration increases relative to actin polymerized in the absence of gelsolin-Ca2+. Gelsolin-Ca2+ also increases the number of actin filaments because the magnitude of the increase in monomer concentration is disproportionately small compared with the reduction in polymer length. In these respects, the population of actin filaments formed during polymerization in the presence of gelsolin-Ca2+ is similar to that resulting from the action of gelsolin on previously assembled actin filaments (Yin, H. L., Zaner, K. S., and Stossel, T. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9494-9500). The calcium-dependent shortening of ects, the population of actin filaments formed during polymerization in the presence of gelsolin-Ca2+ is similar to that resulting from the action of gelsolin on previously assembled actin filaments (Yin, H. L., Zaner, K. S., and Stossel, T. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9494-9500). The calcium-dependent shortening of ects, the population of actin filaments formed during polymerization in the presence of gelsolin-Ca2+ is similar to that resulting from the action of gelsolin on previously assembled actin filaments (Yin, H. L., Zaner, K. S., and Stossel, T. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9494-9500). The calcium-dependent shortening of actin filaments is the primary mechanism for the dissolution of an actin gel by gelsolin. Therefore, the ability of gelsolin to produce short filaments irrespective of the initial state of assembly of the actin offers flexibility for controlling the network structure of the cytoplasm in which either the monomeric or polymeric form of actin molecules might predominate at different times."
https://openalex.org/W1998044848,"Resolvase, the product of the tnpR gene of the transposable element gamma delta, mediates a site-specific recombination between two copies of the element directly repeated on the same replicon. The resolution site, res, at which resolvase acts lies in the intercistronic region between the tnpA and tnpR genes. We have studied this site-specific recombination in vitro. In the absence of Mg2+, a resolvase-res complex is formed, which contains DNA molecules that have been cleaved at res. Our data suggest that in this complex resolvase is covalently attached to the 5' ends of the cleaved DNA, leaving free 3' hydroxyl groups. DNA cleavage is stimulated by the interaction of two res sites on the same substrate molecule and appears to be an intermediate step in normal res site recombination. We show that the DNA is cut within a region previously identified as containing the crossover point at the palindromic sequence 5'- (see formula in text) to generate 3' extensions of two bases."
https://openalex.org/W1933411091,"In addition to its known effect in suppressing the deacetylation of the nucleosomal core histones, sodium butyrate in the concentration range 0.5 to 15 mM causes a selective inhibition of [32P]phosphate incorporation into histones H1 and H2A of cultured HeLa S3 cells. No commensurate general inhibition of phosphorylation is seen in the non-histone nuclear proteins of butyrate-treated cells, but phosphorylation patterns are altered and 32P-uptake may be stimulated, as well as inhibited, depending upon the protein fraction analyzed. The degree of inhibition of histone phosphorylation in intact cells increases progressively as the butyrate concentration is raised from 0.5 to 15 mM. The effect is time-dependent and fully reversible. Butyrate has no effect on the kinetics of phosphate release from previously phosphorylated histones of cultured cells, nor does it significantly alter the rate of dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled histone H1 by endogenous phosphatases in vitro. Despite the suppression of [32P]phosphate incorporation into histones H1 and H2A of butyrate-treated cells, Na-butyrate does not inhibit the in vitro activities of either type I or type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, or the cAMP-independent H1 kinase associated with cell cycle progression. This suggests that the butyrate effect on histone phosphorylation in vivo is indirect and may involve an alteration in substrate accessibility or a modulation of systems affecting kinase activities. The poly(ADP)-ribosylation of HeLa histones is not inhibited by 5 mM Na-butyrate. Cells exposed to butyrate show an impaired methylation of lysine and arginine residues in their histones and nuclear hnRNP particles, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1484714673,"The Ca2+-ATPase of dog heart sarcolemma (1, 2) is affected by phosphorylation. As normally prepared, sarcolemmal vesicles are phosphorylated to a high degree, resulting in a relatively low additional incorporation of hydroxylamine resistant [32P]phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP. The 32P incorporation is increased up to 20-fold by pretreating the vesicles with phosphorylase phosphatase and is inhibited by an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. The phosphatase treatment inhibits markedly the Ca2+-ATPase and the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake. The inhibition is more evident at relatively higher levels of free Ca2+ and is reversed by preincubation with ATP. The Ca2+-pumping activity is stimulated markedly by phosphorylase b kinase and inhibited by the (cAMP-dependent) protein kinase inhibitor. Both the protein kinase inhibitor and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid prevent the rephosphorylation of sarcolemmal vesicles, but the effects are not additive. The Ca2+ dependence curve of the Ca2+ uptake in phospho- and dephosphorylated vesicles suggests that the phosphorylation might affect the efficiency of the enzyme (turnover rate) rather than its affinity for Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1528261036,"Cellular oxygen consumption was monitored during stimulation and inhibition of the Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase in a suspension of intact tubules isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. Respiratory rates were compared to the ADP-stimulated respiratory rate (state 3 rate) obtained in mitochondria released directly from the renal tubules by digitonin shock. At 37 degrees C, in the presence of NADH-linked substrates and fats, isolated renal cells respire at 50 to 60% of the state 3 rate. Inhibition of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase with the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, results in a decline in respiration to 25 to 30% of the state 3 rate. Stimulation of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase produced as a result of nystatin-mediated dissipation of plasma membrane Na+ and K+ gradients results in increased respiration with an oxygen consumption rate characteristic of optimal ATP synthesis (state 3). The relationship between metabolic substrate regimen, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and cellular energy demand is examined in the context of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1564953704,"Membranes from adult rabbit superior cervical ganglia, cross-linked to membrane-bound 125I-labeled nerve growth factor (NGF) by the photoreactive agent hydroxysuccinimidyl-p-azidobenzoate, were found to contain two labeled components with apparent Mr = 143,000 and Mr = 112,000. At high concentrations of the cross-linker, minor amounts of a Mr = 300,000 affinity labeled product were also observed. The affinity labeled species exhibit the characteristics expected of membrane receptors for NGF. The inhibition of specific 125I-NGF binding to membranes by increasing concentrations of unlabeled NGF parallels the inhibiton of the affinity labeling of these components. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, multiplication stimulating activity, and epidermal growth factor do not inhibit the affinity labeling reaction. Membrane preparations of various non-neuronal tissues do not show any detectable specific cross-linking to 125I-NGF. The affinity labeled species of superior cervical ganglia are proteins and contain intrapeptide disulfide bridges compacting their molecular structure. Peptide mapping experiments indicate a close structural relationship between the Mr = 143,000- and the Mr = 112,000-labeled proteins, suggesting a transformation of the former into the latter by limited proteolysis. The results suggest that the Mr = 143,000 affinity labeled protein represents a native NGF receptor component."
https://openalex.org/W2071066452,"Mating-type switches of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae occur by unidirectional transposition of copies of unexpressed mating-type genetic information, residing at HML and HMR loci, into the expressed MAT locus. The HML and HMR loci remain unchanged. In contrast, in appropriate strains where the silent loci are also allowed to express, for example in mar mutants, efficient switches of HML and HMR are shown to occur at rates equivalent to those observed for MAT. Thus the position-effect control on the direction of transposition is affected by the state of expression of the locus under study; the expressed loci switch regardless of their location."
https://openalex.org/W2090628750,"The chromatin of wild-type polyoma virus displays a unique DNAase I highly sensitive region in situ in the infected nuclei, extending for about 260 nucleotides from the origin of replication to the beginning of the late region. We show that this highly sensitive region is not homogeneous. It displays a well defined pattern of differential sensitivity along its 260 nucleotides, including one protected subregion and two hypersensitive sites, which concern a unique residue or very few nucleotides. All these features were mapped to a precision of ±5 by relative to the DNA nucleotide sequence. In parallel, we studied a PyEC mutant, whose sequence is grossly rearranged in this very region. This allows the PyEC to overcome the block in the expression of the early genes in the mouse embryonal carcinoma PCC4 cell line. We show that this mutant, however, displays an identical highly sensitive region with the same fine structure. The mapping of this structure on the mutant nucleotide sequence coincides with that of the wild-type relative to any arbitrary point on the late side of the rearrangement; however, 60% of the mutant molecules display this unique local chromatin structure, instead of 20% for the wild-type ones. Finally, the sequence determinism of this singularity is discussed, as well as its possible role in the control of the early transcription and the establishment of the PyEC phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2038267709,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the promoter for aB. subtilis gene (the 0.4 kb gene) whose transcription is under developmental control. Transcription of the 0.4 kb gene is turned on at the onset of sporulation; this RNA synthesis depends on the products of the B. subtilis regulatory genes (the spoO loci) that control the initiation of development. Recognition of the 0.4 kb gene promoter in vitro is dictated by novel species of B. subtilis RNA polymerase sigma factor known as sigma 37 and sigma 29 but not by the principal B. subtilis sigma factor sigma 55. Using S1 nuclease mapping, runoff transcription and dinucleotide priming, we have identified dual startpoints (separated by about 10 bp) for sigma37-directed transcription of the 0.4 kb gene These start-points correspond closely to the 5' termini of 0.4 kb RNA synthesized in vivo during the course of sporulation. Two forms of sigma37 containing RNA polymerase were distinguished that preferentially utilize either the upstream or the downstream startpoint in vitro. We investigated the requirements for sigma37-directed transcription by constructing in vitro deletion mutations that extend from the upstream direction into the 0.4 kb promoter region. One such deletion, which terminates 40 and 51 bp upstream from the transcription startpoints (thereby removing a highly AT-rich 26 bp sequence), completely eliminates transcription from the downstream startpoint but only partially inhibits transcription from the upstream startpoint. A second deletion that terminates at the upstream startpoint completely prevents transcription from both initiation sites. The implications of 0.4 kb gene promoter structure for developmentally regulated transcription of B, subtilis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1583633034,"The possible role of cyclic AMP-mediated phosphorylation events in the regulation of exocrine secretion after beta-adrenergic stimulation was examined in vitro in dispersed acinar cell aggregates from rat parotid gland. l-Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulated endogenous activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, alterations in the 32P content of 3 parotid phosphoproteins (increased 32P in 2, Mr = 27,000 and 14,000; decreased 32P in the remaining, Mr = 13,600), and amylase secretion in a dose-dependent manner. All responses were half-maximal within a range of l-isoproterenol concentrations of approximately 4 X 10(-8) to 5 X 10(-7) M. Examination of the time course of these 3 processes revealed that by 30 s after addition of l-isoproterenol, significant elevations in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity and alterations in the 32P content of the 3 parotid proteins had occurred, whereas secretion of amylase from cells was first detected 1-2 1/2 min after hormonal stimulation. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (2 mM) elicited the same changes in parotid protein 32P content as l-isoproterenol. Our results support the concept of a role for cyclic AMP-regulated protein phosphorylation in the sequence of cellular events leading to exocrine protein secretion from the rat parotid gland following beta-adrenergic stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1504844653,"Ribonucleotide reductase is responsible for the production of the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis. The enzyme is composed of two dissociable subunits, proteins M1 and M2, which are inactive alone, but are fully active when combined. From mouse S49 T lymphoma cells we have isolated and separated the two subunits and used each for determining the activity of the complementary subunit in extracts from cells of different phases in the cell cycle. Treatment of S49 cells with cAMP analogs (e.g. Bt2cAMP) results in the protein kinase-dependent arrest of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Ribonucleotide reductase (holoenzyme) activity fell in S49 cells treated for more than 16 h with Bt2cAMP but was unchanged during short term treatments. The activity of protein M2 was decreased in parallel to the overall activity of ribonucleotide reductase, while protein M1 activity changed less. Removal of bt2cAMP after 24 h exposure resulted in increased holoenzyme and protein M2 activities. Centrifugal elutriation of exponentially growing S49 cells separated cells into a 90% pure G1 cell population a mixture of G1 and early S phase cells and a 95% pure S phase/G2 cell population. The specific catalytic activity of protein M1 was the same in all these fractions while that of protein M2 was decreased 60% in the G1 cell population. These results demonstrate that the ribonucleotide reduction necessary for DNA synthesis is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion by the activity of the protein M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase."

Although the two procedures consistently produced FC preparations that showed very similar polyacrylamide gel patterns, the specific activity of the purified enzymes varied considerably. The preparations characterized by a rather low specific activity could be stimulated up to 10-fold when a titrated amount of inhibitor-2 was included during the FA and ATP-Mg-mediated activation.

The purification involves the preparation of a crude membrane pellet, detergent solubilization, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-chromatography. We are able to obtain an essentially pure preparation (greater than 95% pure) after only a 52-fold purification, demonstrating that the protein is a major protein in cells fully induced for proline utilization. Both proline oxidase and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid dehydrogenase activities co-purity throughout our purification. Velocity sedimentation of the purified protein demonstrates that both proline oxidase and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid dehydrogenase activities co-sediment. Early in the purification procedure we are able to detect two species of protein which have both proline oxidase and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid dehydrogenase activities. Our procedure purifies only the larger molecular weight species. The purified protein is a dimer composed of identical 132,000-dalton subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2008146083,"Sequences homologous to the type 1 ribosomal DNA insertion occur in the chromocenter and in one location on the fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Ribosomal insertion-like elements frequently occur in the form of tandem repeats and are often interspersed with nonhomologous DNA. Sequences that interrupt of flank insertion-like elements are members of diverged repeated DNA families. Members of five of these interspersed sequence families are located at multiple euchromatic sites as well as in the chromocenter. The euchromatic sites differ greatly in the gt-1 and gt-X11 stocks of D. melanogaster, suggesting that these sequence families are mobile in the genome. No long inverted repeats were detected in any of these interspersed sequences. One sequence, called 101F, interrupts a ribosomal insertion-like element; the nucleotide sequences across the boundaries between 101F and ribosomal insertion have been determined. A stretch of 13 base pairs that is present once in the ribosomal insertion is repeated at the ends of the 101F sequence, suggesting a target site duplication. Within the 101F element, no extended direct or inverted repeat sequence exists. The interspersed repeated sequences studied are transcribed into rare, heterogeneous, poly(A)-lacking nuclear RNA molecules. In one case, we showed that both strands of a flanking sequence are transcribed, but to a different extent. With respect to structural features and the nature of their transcripts, the sequences described here are distinct from other known transposable elements in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2346198580,"ence of compactin, which blocks de novo synthesis of dolichol, the labeling of dolichyl [32P]monophosphate was still 25% of control values. This finding suggested the possibility that endogenous, reserve pools of preformed dolichol were being phosphorylated. To study this possibility membrane preparations were prepared from embryos at various stages of development. In vitro experiments utilizing these membranes and [y-”P] CTP revealed the presence of a dolichol kinase that catalyzes formation of dolichyl [32P]monophosphate from both endogenous and exogenous dolichol. Enzymological studies provided information on a number of properties of this enzyme, and showed that under conditions of saturating substrate concentrations the level of the enzyme increased at least 3.5- to 4.0-fold over the course of development to the mesenchyme blastula stage. At later stages of development the kinase activity decreased to very low levels. These results indicate that both de nouo synthesis of dolichol, as well as its phosphorylation, may play an important role in the observed increase in glycoprotein synthesis prior to gastrulation. The possible role of dolichol kinase in the activation of stored dolichol, and perhaps in the pathway for its de novo biosynthesis in this and other biological systems, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2091972651,"Recombinant DNA techniques have been used to isolate the integrated viral DNA, together with flanking cellular sequences, from three independently isolated lines of SV40-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells. We have determined the structures of these cloned segments and their relationships to one another by restriction enzyme mapping, electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis and transfer hybridization experiments. Our data indicate that the structure of the integrated viral DNA is consistent with the idea that integration involves a tandemly repeated intermediate, that extensive amplification and rearrangement of viral and adjacent cellular sequences occurs after integration and that the majority of viral DNA insertions do not contain an intact early transcription unit. The altered templates presumably encode the truncated and super T antigens found in these cells. Either they are interrupted in the middle of the early region, in which case they generally retain the region in which tsA mutations map, or they contain tandem duplications of the tsA region. Further structural analysis will allow the prediction of the precise structures of these unusual T antigens, and the availability of the corresponding templates opens the way to an analysis of the functions of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W22471135,"In the previous paper (Menzel, R., and Roth, J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9755-9761) we have described the purification of a protein, the putA gene product, which has both proline oxidase and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid dehydrogenase activities. In this paper we demonstrate that these enzyme activities are distinct with respect to a number of characteristics. The oxidase activity proceeds by a ping-pong mechanism involving the reduction of an enzyme-bound flavin. The dehydrogenase activity utilizes an ordered reaction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W59624682,"A rat genomic DNA clone containing the 5’ flanking region, three exons, two introns, and a portion of a third intron of the rat prolactin gene was isolated and characterized. Sequence determinations were used to identify the exon-intron boundaries and analyze the DNA region upstream from the initiator methionine codon. Another genomic DNA clone that we previously characterized (Gubbins, E. J., Maurer, R. A., Lagrimini, M., Erwin, C. R., and Donelson, J. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8655-8662) contains two additional exons and the 3’ flanking region of the prolactin gene. These five exons account for the complete coding sequence of rat preprolactin. Their relative locations in the two genomic DNA clones indicate that the five exons and four intervening sequences (introns) of the rat prolactin gene comprise approximately 10 kilobases of DNA. The sequence at the Intron A-Exon I1 boundary was found to contain two separate splicing sites offset by three nucleotides. These two splicing sites can explain a discrepancy of one codon in two published preprolactin cDNA sequences. The 5’ terminus of prolactin mRNA was mapped using the S1 nuclease protection procedure. The results suggest that transcription is initiated 54 nucleotides upstream from the initiator methionine codon. Analysis of the sequence preceding this site reveals (i) the sequence TATAAA at positions -21 to -22 which, by analogy with other systems, is likely involved in initiation of prolactin gene transcription and (ii) the palindrome, TGATTATATATATATTCA, at positions -62 to -45 which may be a site involved in the regulation of prolactin gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1487420141,"The anterior, intermediate, and neural lobes of porcine pituitaries contain different molecular forms of gastrin. In the anterior lobe, unsulfated large gastrins, component I, and gastrin-34 constitute the main forms. In contrast in the intermediate and neural lobes, gastrin-17, sulfated as well as unsulfated, predominates. Since component I and gastrin-34 are biosynthetic precursors of gastrin-17, the findings indicate that proteolytic processing and amino acid derivatization (sulfation) differs between the lobes. This difference, together with the localization of anterior lobe gastrin in corticotrophs and intermediate lobe gastrin in melanotrophs, emphasizes the close relation and parallelism of the biosynthesis of gastrin and corticotropin peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1665920110,"Abstract The lower eukaryote Ustilago maydis contains a topoisomerase that removes supercoils from negative and positive superhelical DNA. The enzyme may be a multimeric protein or an aggregate of polypeptides with a native molecular weight of 270,000 as estimated by gel filtration. No cofactors are required by the enzyme, but activity is enhanced by Mg2+. Dependence of activity upon enzyme concentration is not linear. Below a threshold level where topoisomerase cannot ordinarily be detected, addition of H1 histone sharply stimulates activity. ATP and a number of structural analogues inhibit the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1600683109,"To identify a parathyroid hormone-binding component in renal membranes, a biologically active photoaffinity radioligand of parathyroid hormone was designed using chemical strategies based on the experience of earlier structure-activity studies. The sulfur-free, oxidation-resistant, synthetic analogue of bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH), (Nle-8,Nle-18,Tyr-34) bPTH-(1-34) amide, was radiolabeled with /sup 125/iodine. Two photolabile moieties, 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl azide and N-succinimidyl-6(4' -azido-2' -nitrophenyl amino)-hexanoate, were separately conjugated to iodinated peptide under conditions favoring coupling through lysine side chains rather than the NH/sub 2/-terminal amino group. Concurrent studies established that a photolabile analogue was fully active in the renal adenylate cyclase assay. After incubation of both photolabile analogues in darkness with renal membranes in the presence or absence of competing hormone, exposure to light covalently linked the analogues to membrane components. Membranes were then solubilized, reduced, and fractionated on sodium dodecyl sulfate poly- acrylamide gels. Radioautographs of the gels showed four to six labeled membrane components for each analogue in the absence of competing hormone, but only one band failed to label in the presence of competing hormone. This band labeled in the presence of inactive synthetic fragments of parathyroid hormone, and was not identified in membrane preparations derived from a renal cell line that is notmore » parathyroid hormone-responsive. The migration of the band (M/sub r/ approx. = 70,000) was identical regardless of the photolabile analogue employed. These studies provide a technique useful for further study of the interactions of parathyroid hormone and receptor in various target tissues and for receptor purification and characterization.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1509544598,"The reaction between N-ethylmaleimide and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, performed under ligand conditions which produce each of the kinetic states of the enzyme and their associated conformational forms, was examined through an analysis of the inhibition of enzymatic activity and the incorporation of radiolabeled reagent into the enzyme. The inactivation reactions displayed pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to the concentration of active enzyme, indicating that the loss of activity is associated with the alkylation of a unique sulfhydryl group. In the absence of enzyme phosphorylation, the nucleophilicity of this sulfhydryl group is affected primarily by the nature of the monovalent cation present and does not correlate with the conformational state. A method for determining the actual concentration and specific radioactivity of radiolabeled N-ethylmaleimide during the reaction with (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was developed, allowing the measurement of the total reactive sulfhydryl groups of native (Na+ + K+)-ATPase under conditions identical with those of the inactivation studies. The labeling of the enzyme complex is associated almost exclusively with the large polypeptide, which contains four sulfhydryl groups which react with this reagent. One of these residues is presumably the sulfhydryl responsible for inactivation of the enzyme. Two react stoichiometrically and rapidly with N-ethylmaleimide under all conditions. The nucleophilicity of the fourth sulfhydryl group is governed by the conformational state of the enzyme, but the alkylation of this residue does not result in loss of enzymatic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2134986841,"The maturing rat reticulocyte was used as a model system in which to study developmental changes in the protein components of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase. Plasma membranes from rat erythrocytes display 10 to 20% of the adenylate cyclase activity and 30 to 50% of the beta-adrenergic receptors which are measured in membranes from rat reticulocytes, as noted by others. Reticulocyte membranes also display equal activities in response to (-)-isoproterenol in the presence of either GTP or GTP gamma S, whereas erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase is twice as active in the presence of isoproterenol plus GTP gamma S as in the presence of isoproterenol plus GTP. We have studied this system in greater detail by developing or applying independent assays for the catalytic protein (C) and the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G/F) of adenylate cyclase. C was assayed in membranes by its intrinsic Mn2+-stimulated activity. It was also measured by reconstituting membranes with saturating amounts of GTP gamma S-activated G/F, yielding an operationally defined Vmax for the catalyst. By either assay, reticulocytes display about 3-fold greater C activity than do erythrocytes. G/F was assayed by its ability to confer GTP gamma S-stimulated activity upon C (which was supplied by membranes of cyc- S49 lymphoma cells). This assay indicates that reticulocyte membranes contain about 3 times as much G/F as do erythrocyte membranes. Cholera toxin and [32P]NAD were used to [32P]ADP-ribosylate the 45,000- and 52,000-dalton subunits of G/F. Total incorporation of 32P into these subunits decreased 3- to 4-fold with reticulocyte maturation. The ratio of label in the 52,000-dalton peptide to that in the 45,000-dalton peptide decreased from 0.29 in reticulocyte membranes to 0.14 in erythrocyte membranes. The apparently coordinate decrease in the amounts of C, G/F, and beta-adrenergic receptors suggest that the stoichiometry between these components is maintained during maturation, and may account for the decrease in adenylate cyclase in the membranes. However, the qualitative changes in responsiveness to hormones in the presence of GTP or GTP gamma S may be related to loss or proteolysis of the 52,000-dalton subunit of G/F."
https://openalex.org/W1653108815,"ATP-citrate lyase was phosphorylated by highly purified cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase (ATP-citrate lyase kinase) or the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Each kinase phosphorylated ATP-citrate lyase equally but the combination of both kinases increased ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation additively. When ATP-citrate lyase was phosphorylated with each kinase and partially digested with either L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylmethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus protease followed by electrophoresis of the proteolytic products on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels or when the phosphorylated lyase was completely digested by these proteases followed by chromatography and electrophoresis, the results showed that the site phosphorylated by ATP-citrate lyase kinase was different from that phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Only phosphoserine was found in lyase phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase whereas phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were found in ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylated by lyase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1516851775,Abstract A simple method of purification of equine follicle-stimulating hormone is described by which two forms of the hormone are obtained. The acid dissociation of the most active preparation was studied and a pKa of 5.8 was determined at 37 degrees C. This value is 2 pH units higher than that observed for pregnant mare serum gonadotropin suggesting that the binding areas between subunits are not identical in the two hormones. We also describe an homologous radioreceptor assay of equine follicle-stimulating hormone which is highly specific for this hormone in contrast to the heterologous systems described so far. The analysis of the properties of equine gonadotropins in homologous and heterologous radioreceptor assays suggests that all glycoprotein hormones share a common high affinity binding site and that specificity of binding is due to binding prohibition sites preventing fixation of each hormone to the receptors of the other glycoprotein hormones. This specific hindering is defined as negative specificity.

Its production in the liver of the maturing female chick is developmentally synchronized with vitellogenesis. The apoVLDLII gene is normally dormant in males but can be activated by the administration of estrogen. In these studies, we describe the isolation of three recombinant bacteriophages that contain apoVLDLII genes. The genes appear to be identical from preliminary restriction analyses, although heterogeneity in flanking sequences is evident. The structure of the gene has been characterized and its organization correlated with the structure of the apoVLDLII polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1606108027,"Cobalt-substituted leghemoglobin (CoLb) was prepared from cobaltous protoporphyrin IX and apo-leghemoglobin a, and its functional and spectroscopic properties were examined. The oxygen affinity of CoLb was pH-dependent. The partial oxygen pressure at half-saturation was decreased from 14.3 torr at pH 8 to 3.5 Torr at pH 3.5 with a pK value of 5.8 at 15 degrees C. The oxygen association and dissociation rates were determined by the temperature jump-relaxation technique. The association rate was essentially pH-independent, and the relatively high oxygen affinity of CoLb was found to be due to the fast oxygen association rate in comparison with cobalt myoglobin. The oxygen dissociation rate was pH-dependent with a pK value of 5.7 at 15 degrees C, suggesting that the pH dependence of the oxygen dissociation rate is responsible for the pH-dependent change in the oxygen affinity of CoLb. The EPR spectrum of oxyCoLb exhibited a pH-dependent change with a pK value of 5.7 at 15 degrees C. The EPR spectrum at 77 K of oxyCoLb at neutral pH exhibited a small effect upon the replacement of H2O with D2O, but it was drastically altered in the acidic pH region. The deoxy EPR spectrum was pH-independent between pH 4 and 9. These observations indicate that in oxyCoLb, the bound oxygen is interacting with the distal amino acid group with a pK value of 5.7 and that this interaction is responsible for the increased oxygen affinity in the acidic pH region."
https://openalex.org/W1524771961,"The physiological roles played by hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells of rat liver in the metabolism of vitamin D3 have been investigated. Tritium-labeled vitamin D3 dissolved in ethanol was administered intravenously to two rats. Isolation of the liver cells 30 and 70 min after the injection showed that vitamin D3 had been taken up both by the hepatocytes and by the nonparenchymal liver cells. The relative proportion of vitamin D3 that accumulated in the nonparenchymal cells increased with time. Perfusion of the isolated rat liver with [3H] vitamin D3 added to the perfusate confirmed the ability of both cell types to efficiently take up vitamin D3 from the circulation. By a method based on high pressure liquid chromatography and isotope dilution-mass fragmentography it was found that isolated liver cells in suspension had a considerable capacity to take up vitamin D3 from the medium. About 2.5 fmol of vitamin D3 were found to be associated with each hepatocyte or nonparenchymal cell after 1 h of incubation. 25-Hydroxylation in vitro was found to be carried out only by the hepatocytes. The rate of hydroxylation was about the same whether the cells were isolated from normal or rachitic rats (3.5 and 4 pmol of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 formed per h per 10(6) cells, respectively). The possibility that the nonparenchymal cells might serve as a storage site for vitamin D3 in the liver is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1552862209,"Reaction of vesicular stomatitis virus with pardaxin, the hydrophobic toxin of the Red Sea flatfish, resulted in a profound morphological change of many virions and dissociation of their membrane and nucleocapsid into components readily separable by density gradient centrifugation. The basic matrix protein and acidic pardaxin segregated largely with the high density nucleocapsid. The dissociated virion membrane formed lipoprotein vesicles which retained glycoprotein spikes and a certain amount of N protein but no appreciable amounts of other nucleocapsid proteins and little if any RNA. Iodination of the tyrosine residue of the glycoprotein tail fragment provided supporting evidence that the COOH terminus of the glycoprotein extends beyond the inner layer of the membrane into the interior of the virion. These data indicate that pardaxin may serve as a probe for studying the organization of viral membranes, and, hopefully, other biological membranes."

A molar ratio of lambda H eta G1 to chi 1 DNA of 3:1 was used. Four of the eleven stable transformants obtained contained intact delta- and beta-globin genes as determined by Southern blot analysis. To assess methylation in the segment of human DNA introduced into mouse cells, digestion with Hpa II or Msp I alone or with a second restriction enzyme was performed. The sites examined near the human delta- and beta-globin genes in transformed cells were not methylated. RNA extracted from the transformed cells was analyzed by RNA-cDNA hybridization; no more than 100 copies of human beta-globin mRNA/cell were found. Although hypomethylation of sites surrounding expressed globin genes in erythroid cells has been described, this property is not sufficient to ensure a high level of expression in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1529219634,"Three mutant strains of Neurospora crassa, previously characterized as cytochrome c oxidase deficient, were found to possess this respiratory enzyme. The mitochondrial cytochrome contents of logarithmic phase cells of wild type (74A) and the respiration-deficient strains mi-3, cya-4-23, and cya-5-34 were investigated with low temperature difference spectrophotometry; two of the strains were found to possess cytochrome a. Cytochrome c oxidase catalytic activity measurements performed on isolated mitochondria showed that all three mutant strains contained significant amounts of active enzyme which was subsequently found to be active in vivo. However, activity of the cyanide-insensitive, alternate electron transport pathway was responsible for most of the oxygen consumed by the logarithmic phase cells of these mutant strains. Electrophoretic analysis of the polypeptide subunits of cytochrome c oxidase radiolabeled in vivo during logarithmic phase growth showed that, in contrast to previous reports, the respiration-deficient strains appeared to contain all seven subunits of the enzyme."
