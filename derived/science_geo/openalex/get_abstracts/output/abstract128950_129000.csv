https://openalex.org/W1979819215,"The proteins eIF-4E BP1 and p70 S6 kinase each undergo an insulin/mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation in situ that is partially inhibited by rapamycin. Previous work has established that the protein known as mTOR/RAFT-1/FRAP is the target through which the rapamycin·FKBP12 complex acts to dephosphorylate/deactivate the p70 S6 kinase; thus, some mTOR mutants that have lost the ability to bind to the rapamycin·FKBP12 complex in vitro can protect the p70 S6 kinase against rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation/deactivationin situ. We show herein that such mTOR mutants also protect eIF-4E BP1 against rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation, and for both p70 S6 kinase and eIF-4E BP1, such protection requires that the rapamycin-resistant mTOR variant retains an active catalytic domain. In contrast, mutants of p70 S6 kinase rendered intrinsically resistant to inhibition by rapamycin in situ are not able to protect coexpressed eIF-4E BP1 from rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation. We conclude that mTOR is an upstream regulator of eIF-4E BP1 as well as the p70 S6 kinase; moreover, these two mTOR targets are regulated in a parallel rather than sequential manner.

Rapamycin is an immunosurpressive macrolide whose major cellular receptor is the cytosolic 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) 1The abbreviations used are: FKBP12, 12-kDa FK506-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CHO-IR, Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: FKBP12, 12-kDa FK506-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CHO-IR, Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.

Rapamycin binds to FKBP12 at a single site, identical to the site bound by the structurally related drug FK506, and both agents, acting in situ as a drug-protein complex, are immunosurpressive through inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Despite these similarities, the two drugs operate through distinct mechanisms. The FK506·FKBP12 complex blocks T-cell receptor signal transduction by directly inhibiting protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin. The rapamycin·FKBP12 complex does not inhibit T-cell receptor signal transduction or calcineurin activity but rather inhibits interleukin-2-stimulated signal transduction, concomitant with a potent (>95%) and selective inhibition in situ of the p70 S6 kinase (3Price D.J.

Rapamycin, acting indirectly in situ, causes a partial dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70; the direct target of rapamycin·FKBP12 complexes in situ relevant to the rapamycin-inhibition of the p70 S6 kinase is the protein known variously as RAFT-1/FRAP/RAPT-1 or mTOR.The TOR proteins were first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where rapamycin (but not FK506) is growth-inhibitory. The TOR proteins are the product of one class of mutant genes that confer resistance to rapamycin-induced growth inhibition as a dominant phenotype (7Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U.

Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The rapamycin/FKBP12 complex binds directly to TOR, and the TOR mutations that confer rapamycin resistance in situ result in a loss of rapamycin/FKBP12 binding (15Cardenas M.E. Heitman J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The role of TOR as the rapamycin target responsible for inhibition of p70 S6 kinase has been established by the work of Brown et al. (17Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), who showed that coexpression of p70 with certain mutant TORs, which lack the ability to bind rapamycin/FKBP12 complexes, confers partial resistance to the rapamycin-induced inhibition of coexpressed p70; a further mutation that inactivates the TOR catalytic domain abrogates this rescue of p70.PHAS-1/eIF-4E BP1 is another rapamycin-sensitive protein; this 12-kDa polypeptide binds to the 7-methylguanosine cap-binding protein, eIF-4E, and prevents eIF-4E binding to p220/eIF-4G (18Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The assembly of eIF-4E with the RNA helicase eIF-4A and the RNA binding protein eIF-4B on the p220 eIF-4G polypeptide creates a functional eIF-4F complex. Mitogens stimulate the phosphorylation of eIF-4E BP1 resulting in its disassociation from eIF-4E; the latter can then interact with p220/eIF-4G (19Sonenberg N. Hershey W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation eIF-4E BP1 is potently inhibited by rapamycin (20Alarcon C.M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Suitkein Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Biochem J. 1996; 315: 146-162Google Scholar); inasmuch as eIF-4F activity is limiting for the translation of certain mitogen-sensitive mRNAs (e.g. ornithine decarboxylase), it is likely that TOR controls the expression of these mRNA at least in part by regulating eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylation (19Sonenberg N. Hershey W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). The identity of the kinases operating upstream of eIF-4E BP1 in situ is not known. Although eIF-4E BP1 is phosphorylated by p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in vitro, the MEK inhibitor PD098059 does not inhibit mitogen-stimulated eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylation. Recombinant eIF-4E BP1 is not a substrate for the p70 S6 kinase in vitro; however, the activity of p70 S6 kinase and the phosphorylation of eIF-4E BP1 respond in a parallel fashion to a variety of inhibitors (wortmannin, SQ20006, cAMP congeners) (20Alarcon C.M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Suitkein Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Biochem J. 1996; 315: 146-162Google Scholar). We therefore inquired whether 1) TOR is the rapamycin-sensitive element that regulates eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylation, and if so, whether 2) TOR signals to eIF-4E BP1 through the p70 kinase. We find that, as with p70, a rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR (S2035T) substantially overcomes the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the phosphorylation of eIF-4E BP1; in contrast, rapamycin-resistant variants of p70 are unable to rescue eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylation from inhibition by rapamycin. We conclude that TOR regulates the phosphorylation of both eIF-4E BP1 and the p70 S6 kinase; however, p70 is not upstream of eIF-4E BP1 but is regulated in parallel.MATERIALS AND METHODSDulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium and fetal calf serum were purchased from Sigma. Protein G-agarose was from Life Technologies, Inc. Radioisotopes were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and ECL reagents from Amersham Corp. The antibodies used were: 12CA5, a monoclonal antibody against influenza virus hemagglutinin (24Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rogers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar); a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Eastman Kodak Co.); and a polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 337–352 of p70α1 S6 kinase (25Grove J.R. Banerjee P Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).cDNA Cloning and ConstructionsA cDNA fragment encoding mammalian TOR was isolated by PCR, using first strand cDNA from mouse brain and degenerate oligonucleotide 5′-GAIGA(C/T)ITI(A/C)GICA(A/G)GA and 5′-ICC(A/G)AAA/GTCIAT(A/G)TG based on two short sequences that are well conserved in the catalytic domains of bovine p110 PI-3 kinase and yeast TOR-1 and TOR-2 ((E/D)D(L/I)RQD and HIDFG). Two major DNA products, 500 and 600 bp, were generated, purified, subcloned into pUC vectors, and subjected to DNA sequencing. The 500-bp product was found to be identical to the kinase domain of human p110β (26Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and the 600-bp product was 76% identical to the kinase domain of yeast TOR2. The 600-bp PCR product was used to screen a λ Zap rat brain cDNA library (a gift from Dr. Ivan Gout, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London). A set of overlapping clones were obtained of which the two largest clones contained an open reading frame of 2549 amino acids (289 kDa), 43% identical to yeast TOR-2 and identical in DNA sequence to RAFT-1 (11Sabatini D.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). To facilitate recovery after transient expression in mammalian cells, the mTOR cDNA was modified by insertion of epitopes at its amino terminus; a 9-amino acid epitope from the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (24Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rogers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) was introduced immediately after the initiator methionine using PCR, and the HA-tagged mTOR was ligated into the vector pCDNA1 (Invitrogen) to give pCDNAI-HA-mTOR. The mTOR cDNA was also ligated into vector pCMV-FLAG so as to introduce a FLAG epitope at the amino terminus (pCMV-FLAG-mTOR). Mutants of mTOR were constructed by insertion of aKpnI-XbaI fragment, encoding bp 5897–8434, into the M13 vector; site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) method. Mutagenesis primers for each mutant were as follows: 5′-GTACAAGCGAGTGGCCTCTTC-3′ for Ser2035 → Thr, 5′-GTACAAGCGAGCGGCCTCTTC-3′ for Ser2035 → Ala, 5′-CCCCAAAGTACAAGCGACGGGCCTCTTCTAGGCC-3′ for Ser2035 → Arg, 5′-GGTCCAGCATAAGCTTGGATGGGTGC-3′ for Asn2343 → Lys. After performing mutagenesis, the KpnI-XbaI fragment of pCDNAI-HA-mTOR and pCMV-FLAG-mTOR was replaced by the mutant KpnI-XbaI fragment from M13. Each mutation was verified by DNA sequence analysis.A cDNA encoding PHAS-1/eIF-4E BP1 was isolated by PCR using a human B cell cDNA library as template and the oligonucleotides: 5′-CGCGAATCCATGTCCGGGGGCAGCAGC (forward) and 5′-TGCTCTAGATTAAATGTCCATCTC (reverse). The eIF-4E BP1 cDNA was verified by DNA sequence analysis and inserted into pCMV-FLAG.The cDNA encoding the wild-type α1 p70 S6 kinase and the Δ2–46/ΔCT104 mutant was described in Weng et al. (28Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), tagged at the amino terminus with an HA or FLAG epitope, and introduced into the vector pMT2. A cDNA encoding FKBP12 (a gift from G. Crabtree) was ligated into the pGEX vector and expressed inEscherichia coli as a GST fusion protein.Cell Culture and cDNA ExpressionChinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors (CHO-IR) (29Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Matsuba H. Shii K. Yokono K. Fukui Y. Calas B. Grigorescue F. Dhand R. Gout I. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25958-25966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HEK293, and COS7 cells were maintained and cultured as described previously (28Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the recombinant proteins in mammalian cells (COS7, HEK293, or CHO-IR cells) employed transfection of plasmids by the lipofection method using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). When multiple plasmids were co-transfected and subjected to different treatments prior to harvest, the cells were split 24 h after transfection, replated on the number of plates appropriate to that experiment, and harvested 24–48 h later.Immunoprecipitation and AutophosphorylationCells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mmEGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin), and the extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were adsorbed to protein G-agarose beads, washed twice with buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl, and twice with the buffer consisting of 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The autophosphorylation reactions were initiated by addition of 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mmDTT, and 100 μm ATP (6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography.Immunoblot and p70 S6 Kinase Assayp70 S6 kinase activity was determined in immunoprecipitates by using 40 S ribosomal subunits (25Grove J.R. Banerjee P Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) or a synthetic S6 peptide KRRRLSSLRASTSKSESSQK as substrates. The immobilized immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, twice with 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The S6 peptide kinase reaction was initiated by adding the reaction mixture I (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 100 μm ATP(2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and 0.1 mm S6 peptide). The 40 S S6 protein kinase assay used reaction mixture II (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 12 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 0.5 A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunits, and 60 μm ATP (5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was continued for 20 min at 30 °C. The S6 peptide kinase assay was terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA and 1.5 mm adenosine. The reaction mixtures were spotted on P81 phosphocellulose paper, followed by washes in 0.5% phosphoric acid; 32P-labeled peptides were measured by Cerenkov counting. The 40 S kinase assay was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoblot was performed using the ECL method as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.).In Vitro Binding of mTOR to GST-FKBP12Prokaryotic recombinant GST or GST-FKBP12 (15 μg) were incubated with 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (60 min at 4 °C), washed three times with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, once with PBS. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated in 1 ml of PBS with or without 500 ng/ml rapamycin; after 1 h at 4 °C, the PBS was discarded, and the cell lysate expressing mTOR was added, with or without 200 ng/ml rapamycin, as indicated in Fig. 2 A. In Fig. 2 B, all GST proteins and lysates contained rapamycin at the concentrations indicated above. COS7 cells or HEK293 cells expressing FLAG- or HA-tagged wild-type or mutant mTOR were extracted, 72 h after transfection, with buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 300 μl/10-cm plate) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were diluted by adding 700 μl of buffer B without detergent; aliquots from each extract were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody to verify the expression of mTOR variants. The remaining supernatant was incubated with the immobilized GST proteins at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with buffer B containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, once with 50 mmHepes (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. In Fig.2 A, the bound proteins were eluted directly into SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. The GST proteins were identified by Coomassie Blue stain. Alternatively, GST fusion proteins were eluted twice by the incubation in buffer that contained 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, and 20 mm glutathione. One-quarter volume of the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 14% acrylamide gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining to verify that the eluted GST proteins were almost equal. Three-quarters volume of the eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody to detect retained HA-TOR polypeptides.RESULTSThe mTOR cDNA was tagged at its amino terminus with an HA or FLAG epitope and expressed transiently after transfection into CHO-IR and COS cells. Anti-epitope immunoblot of anti-HA immunoprecipitates revealed a recombinant polypeptide of the expected size (Fig.1, upper panel). Incubation of the immunoprecipitated HA-mTOR with Mg2+ and [γ-32P]ATP was accompanied by 32P incorporation into the 290-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1, lower panel, WT). The CHO-IR cells express approximately 106 recombinant human insulin receptors per cell; pretreatment of the cells with insulin (10−7m) for 15 min prior to harvest did not alter the extent ofin vitro phosphorylation of HA-mTOR (Fig. 1, lower panel). Evidence that the 32P incorporation into mTORin vitro reflected mTOR autophosphorylation was obtained by mutation of Asn2343 in the mTOR catalytic domain to Lys. This mutation corresponds in location to one previously reported to cause inactivation of the yeast VPS34 PI kinase (30Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The mTOR mutant N2343K, which is expressed at levels comparable to wild-type mTOR (Fig.1, upper panel, compare WT to NK), exhibits a complete loss of 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into the recombinant polypeptide in vitro, whereas mutation of Ser2035 → Arg, which corresponds to the mutation which confers rapamycin resistance to yeast TOR2 (7Kunz J.

These results demonstrate that the recombinant wild-type mTOR is expressed and is catalytically active. In agreement with Sabatiniet al. (31Sabatini D.M. Pierchala B.A. Barrow R.K. Schell M.J. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

In contrast, an antiserum raised to an amino-terminal 100-amino acid fragment of mTOR, which precipitates endogenous mTOR, coprecipitated PI kinase activity (data not shown).Figure 1Expression and in vitroautophosphorylation of mTOR variants. CHO-IR cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 80% confluence and transfected with 12 μg of pCDNA vector encoding HA-tagged mTOR wild type (WT), Asn2343 → Lys (NK), Ser2035 → Arg (SR), or pCDNA1 vector alone; 24 h later, each plate was split into three 60-mm dishes. At 60 h after transfection, media were replaced with Ham's F-12 medium without fetal calf serum. 72 h after transfection, cells were treated with carrier or insulin (10−7m) for 15 min as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with the anti-HA antibody, 12CA5. One set of immunoprecipitates was subjected to anti-HA immunoblot to verify mTOR expression (upper panel). The immunoprecipitates from control and insulin treated cells were subjected to in vitroautophosphorylation as described under “Materials and Methods”; the32P-labeled immunoprecipitates were subjected to autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of recombinant TOR to associate in vitrowith GST-FKBP12 was determined. COS cell extracts containing recombinant FLAG-mTOR were incubated in vitro with purified prokaryotic recombinant GST or GST-FKBP12 immobilized on GSH-Sepharose. Little or no binding of FLAG-mTOR to GST-FKBP12 is detected, unless rapamycin (200 ng/ml) is present (Fig.2 A). Thus recombinant mTOR binds to FKBP12 in vitro in a rapamycin-dependent way. Previous work has defined the FKBP12 binding domain in yeast and mammalian TOR and shown that most mutations at Ser2035 (Ser1972/1975 in yeast TOR 1/2) can block the binding of mTOR to FKBP12/rapamycin (15Cardenas M.E.

The catalytically inactive HA-mTOR N2343K mutant also binds to the GST-FKBP12·rapamycin complex to an extent comparable to wild-type HA-mTOR.Inasmuch as the biochemical function of mTOR relevant to its biologic role(s) is not known, we attempted to establish the functionality of recombinant mTOR in situ by its ability to confer resistance toward the rapamycin inhibition of p70 kinase in situ. The activity of recombinant, wild-type HAp70 kinase toward an S6 peptide substrate (and 40 S subunits, see Fig. 5), assayed in vitroafter transient expression in COS cells, is inhibited >95% by pretreatment of cells with rapamycin prior to extraction (>20 nm, 15 min). Half-maximal p70 inhibition is observed at approximately 2 nm (3Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E.

Coexpression of p70 with wild-type FLAG-mTOR does not alter p70 activity in vitro as compared with FLAG vector control, 2In five experiments, the activity of p70 coexpressed with wild-type FLAG-mTOR was 93.4 ± 13% that of p70 coexpressed with FLAG vector. nor does the coexpressed wild-type mTOR alter the 95% inhibition induced by a supramaximal concentration of rapamycin (Fig.3). The mTOR mutant S2035A, which is unimpaired in its binding to GST-FKBP12·rapamycin, like wild-type mTOR, is also unable to protect p70 against rapamycin inhibition. In contrast FLAG-mTOR S2035T, despite comparable polypeptide expression to wild-type and S2035A mTOR, does provide substantial protection against rapamycin inhibition of p70 kinase activity. The ability of mTOR S2035T to protect p70 from rapamycin inhibition requires a functional TOR catalytic domain; mutation of mTOR Asn2343 → Lys, which abolishes mTOR autophosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 1), also abolishes the ability of mTOR S2035T to rescue p70 from rapamycin inhibition (Fig. 3).

We previously found that Aβ1–40 is rapidly precipitated in vitro by physiological concentrations of zinc, a neurochemical that is highly abundant in brain compartments where Aβ is most likely to precipitate. We now present evidence that the zinc-induced precipitation of Aβ is mediated by a peptide dimer and favored by conditions that promote α-helical and diminish β-sheet conformations. The manner in which the synthetic peptide is solubilized was critical to its behaviorin vitro. Zinc-induced Aβ aggregation was dependent upon the presence of NaCl, was enhanced by α-helical-promoting solvents, but was abolished when the peptide stock solution was stored frozen. The Aβ aggregates induced by zinc were reversible by chelation, but could then be reprecipitated by zinc for several cycles, indicating that the peptide's conformation is probably preserved in the zinc-mediated assembly. In contrast, Aβ aggregates induced by low pH (5.5) were not resolubilized by returning the pH milieu to 7.4. The zinc-Aβ interaction exhibits features resembling the gelation process of zinc-mediated fibrin assembly, suggesting that, in events such as clot formation or injury, reversible Aβ assembly could be physiologically purposive. Such a mechanism is contemplated in the early evolution of diffuse plaques in Alzheimer's disease and suggests a possible therapeutic strategy for the resolubilization of some forms of Aβ deposit in the disease."

To identify type VI collagen binding proteins, the amino-terminal domains of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains and a part of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the α3(VI) chain were used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human placenta library. Eight persistently positive clones were identified, two coding the known matrix proteins fibronectin and basement membrane type IV collagen and the rest coding new proteins. The amino-terminal domain of α1(VI) was shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of type IV collagen. The specificity of this interaction was further studied using the yeast two-hybrid system in a one-on-one format and confirmed by using isolated protein domains in immunoprecipitation, affinity blots, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding studies.

The strong interaction of type VI collagen filaments with basement membrane collagen provided a possible molecular pathogenesis for the heritable disorder Bethlem myopathy. Type VI collagen filaments are ubiquitous. They are present in all connective tissues that contain type I and type III collagen fibers and in cartilage, a tissue that contains predominantly type II collagen. The major functions that have been suggested for type VI collagen filamentous networks are as a substrate for cell attachment and as an anchoring meshwork that connects collagen fibers, nerves, and blood vessels to the surrounding matrix (1Keene D.R. Engvall E. Glanville R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Bonaldo P. Russo V. Bucciotti F. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This implies that not only is there an interaction, either direct or indirect, with the type I/III collagen fibers but also that there is an interaction with components of endothelial basement membranes. Matrix components that have been shown to interact with type VI collagen in vitro include proteoglycans, collagens, hyaluronan, heparin, and integrins. Proteoglycans appear to be particularly important, since cell surface-, basement membrane-, and collagen fibril-associated proteoglycans have all been reported to bind to various forms of type VI collagen. Decorin is a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that binds to fibrillar collagens (3Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was shown that the leucine-rich module of the core protein bound to type VI and that the binding could be inhibited by the core proteins of fibromodulin and biglycan (4Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell surface-associated membrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 was originally detected in cells from the rodent central nervous system but subsequently was also detected in blood vessels and cartilaginous structures of the head, neck, and spine. It interacts via its core protein with type VI collagen and is thought to provide machinery for transmembrane signaling (5Stallcup W.B. Dahlin K. Healy P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3177-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since α1β1 and α2β1 integrins also bind type VI collagen (6Pfaff M. Aumailley M. Specks U. Knolle J. Zerwes H.G. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Perris R. Kuo H.-J. Glanville R.W. Leibold S. Bronner-Fraser M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the cell signaling potential of this molecule would appear to be significant. The interaction with the basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan appeared to be via the type VI collagen triple helix, since pepsin-solubilized type VI collagen, but not recombinant α1(VI) and α2(VI) globular domains, showed binding to perlecan (8Tillet E.

However, unlike decorin and NG2, perlecan interacts via its heparan sulfate side chains. Recombinant segments of the amino-terminal globular domain of the α3 chain, which contain a series of von Willebrand factor A domains, were used by two groups. One group reported no binding to types I, III, and IV collagens or fibronectin (9Specks U. Mayer U. Nischt R. Spissinger T. Mann K. Timpl R. Engel J. Chu M.-L.

Colombatti A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Other experiments using pepsin-solubilized type VI collagen, which only contains a small remnant of the globular domains, showed binding to fibronectin (8Tillet E. Wiedemann H. Golbik R. Pan T.-E.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).In vivo studies of GP140 (α1(VI) + α2(VI)) indicated that there was an interaction of type VI collagen with fibronectin in the pericellular matrix of fibroblasts (11Carter W.G.

Data concerning the interaction of type VI with hyaluronan are also inconsistent. Intact type VI isolated from bovine cartilage (13McDevitt C.A. Marcelino J. Tucker L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), fetal bovine skin (14Kielty C.M. Cummings C. Whittaker S.P. Shuttleworth C.A. Grant M.E. J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were reported to bind hyaluronan. Furthermore, Kielty and co-workers (15Kielty C.M. Whittaker S.P. Grant M.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Cell. Biol. 1992; 118: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) presented evidence for hyaluronan being required as a template for the assembly of type VI collagen tetramers into filaments and for the stability of the filaments once they are formed (15Kielty C.M. Whittaker S.P. Grant M.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Cell. Biol. 1992; 118: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results of Specks et al. (9Specks U. Mayer U. Nischt R. Spissinger T.

Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 499-505Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and their new data and our own data indicate that hyaluronan is not involved in the assembly or stability of type VI filaments (17Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The interaction spectrum of type VI collagen is clearly very complex. The results described here indicate a newly discovered direct interaction of intact native type VI collagen with type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes. This interaction is significant because it is the first type VI collagen protein-protein interaction with a basement membrane component that has been characterized, and it provides an plausible explanation for the Bethlem myopathy phenotype, a genetic disease caused by mutations in type VI collagen (18Jöbsis G.J.

The type VI collagen monoclonal antibodies N3-VI-2, C1-VI-1, and C12-VI-2 have been described previously (7Perris R. Kuo H.-J. Glanville R.W. Leibold S. Bronner-Fraser M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Type VI collagen mouse monoclonal antibody 5C6 (1Keene D.R. Engvall E. Glanville R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Eva Engvall (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, CA). The amino-terminal domains of the α1(VI) (positions 1–237) and α2(VI) (positions 1–237) chains and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the α3(VI) (positions 2365–2943) chain were amplified from human fibroblast cDNA. The primer set for α1(VI) (26-mers) was 5′-AAGAATTCCAGGATGAGCCGGAGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AACTGCAGTCTTGCAGGCTGGCATTC-3′ (antisense). The primer set for α2(VI) (26-mers) was 5′-AAGAATTCCAGCAGCAGGAGGTCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGTCGACAGGGATTTCCAGGCAGCT-3′ (antisense). The primer set for α3(VI) (26-mers) was 5′-AACCCGGGGGATTTGGCAGTTGGAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGTCGACGGTTCCCATCACACTGAT-3′ (antisense). The standard PCR buffer contained 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 nmol of dNTP, 0.5 nmol of primer set, and 1 ng of human fibroblast cDNA. The program used for 30 cycles of amplification was denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Recombinant plasmid constructs for the “bait” consisting of the inserts described above cloned into the vector pGBT9 supplied with the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) were prepared using standard methods (20$$Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme pairs used to construct the recombinant plasmids were EcoRI and PstI for α1(VI), EcoRI and SalI for α2(VI), andSmaI and SalI for α3(VI). The Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used according to the supplied protocol, with the amino-terminal domains of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains, and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the α3(VI) chain fused to the GAL4 binding domain as bait, to screen a human placenta cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Vector pGBT9 containing the bait and the amplified library in vector pGAD10 were sequentially transformed into yeast strain HF7C and grown in synthetic media without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Approximately 1.8 × 106 clones, one library equivalent, were screened with each of the bait constructs. Colonies that grew successfully in the selective media were further screened for reporter gene β-galactosidase expression. The β-galactosidase assays were done using replicas of colonies on filter papers. Colonies that were positive for β-galactosidase activity in less than 30 h. were selected for further analysis. The positive colonies were restreaked several times on selective media, and individual isolated colonies were rescreened for β-galactosidase activity, eliminating most of the false positives that initially passed through the dual selection. Persistent positive clones were grown on selective media that segregates the plasmids, thereby isolating the activation domain (“target”) plasmid. Additional selection against false positives was done by performing β-galactosidase assays on yeast clones that only contain the target plasmid (similar assays were done with the bait constructs), thus eliminating any clones that have activation function in the absence of an interacting partner. Also, the bait and positive target vectors were switched so that the bait was in pGAD10 and the target in pGBT9, and these constructs were again subjected to the dual selection for interactions as an additional check for false positives. The target and bait constructs were also assayed for activation function in the presence of the partner vector without an insert. To avoid unnecessarily analyzing duplicate positive clones, they were further characterized by determining insert size using PCR amplification of the pGAD10 inserts with vector-specific primers (CLONTECH). The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes, and the restriction digestion patterns were compared. To determine the identity of the interacting clones, the PCR-amplified pGAD10 inserts were sequenced using standard techniques. The identities of the inserts were determined by comparing the cDNA sequences with GenBankTM, release 97, using the computer programs of the Wisconsin Package, version 8 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). To demonstrate the specificity of the α1(VI)-α1(IV) interaction, one-on-one two-hybrid analyses were done to compare the interaction potential of α1(VI)versus α2(VI) with α1(IV). The vectors containing the yeast GAL4 binding domain (pGBT9), with or without the insert for the amino-terminal domain of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains, were individually cotransformed into yeast HF7C with a vector containing the GAL4 activation domain (pGAD424) fused with the carboxyl-terminal domain of α1(IV). Positive interactions were detected and analyzed as described above. A Northern blot with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from eight adult human tissues (CLONTECH) and an additional Northern blot with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from human skin fibroblasts were hybridized with probes made from purified PCR products from the activation domain inserts of positive clones. For the fibroblast Northern blot, human skin fibroblast poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and blotted using standard techniques (20$$Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and the resulting high specific activity probes (>1 × 109 dpm/μg) were hybridized to the blots in a neutral hybridization solution at about 1 × 106 dpm/ml at 42 °C for 16–20 h. Following hybridization, the blots were washed under stringent conditions to remove unbound probe (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 68 °C). The resulting signals were visualized by standard autoradiography. Type VI collagen tetramers and globular domains were prepared as described previously (17Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen native hexameric globular domains were isolated from human amniotic membranes using a method based upon a previously described procedure (21Weber S. Engel J. Wiedemann H. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Placental membranes were collected from approximately 60 full-term placentas. The amnion was stripped from the chorion, rinsed briefly with water, and stored at 4 °C in water containing 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmbenzamidine until used. The amnion was homogenized into ice-cold water containing the above inhibitors and centrifuged, and the tissue pellet was washed once more in 6 liters of the same solution. Finally, the tissue was washed in 6 liters of cold 10% NaCl solution containing the same inhibitors. One kilogram of washed tissue was suspended into 3 liters of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing the inhibitors and 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.5m NaCl. Bacterial collagenase (12,500 units CLSPA, Worthington) was added to the stirred tissue suspension, which was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h and then at room temperature for a further 24 h. The digest was centrifuged, and the supernatant was fractionally precipitated at NaCl concentrations of 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 1.7 m, 1.9 m, and 2.1m. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10–20 ml of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate solution. Western blot analysis showed that the 1.7 and 1.9m NaCl pellets contained type IV collagen. These solutions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and treated with bacterial collagenase (2 units/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.2 m EDTA to final concentration 10 mm, and the products were separated on a Sephacryl S-400 column (0.8 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.4 mNaCl and 10 mm EDTA. The NC1 fractions collected contained native hexameric globular domains, which appear on SDS-PAGE as a mixture of dimers and monomers (21Weber S. Engel J. Wiedemann H. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Purified type VI collagen tetramers and globular domains were biotinylated according to the method of Hnatowichet al. (22Hnatowich D.J. Virzi F. Ruschowski M. J. Nucl. Med. 1987; 28: 1294-1302PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. To modify the primary amino groups of type VI collagen and its fragments, the purified samples were dissolved into 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA at a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl. A 50-fold molar excess of NHS-LC-biotin was added to each sample. The samples were gently shaken for 2 h at room temperature and dialyzed against PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 to remove excess biotin. Biotin-labeled type VI collagen tetramers and globular domains were used as soluble ligands for affinity blots (17Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen samples were separated on 8–12% SDS-PAGE gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blotted membranes were incubated with 4% BSA or 1% nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1 h to block any nonspecific binding and then with biotinylated ligands for 3 h followed by a 2-h incubation with avidin-horseradish peroxidase. The membranes were developed with color reagent as for standard Western blots. Control membranes were developed only as Western blots using chain-specific antibodies N3-VI-2 and C1-VI-1 to type IV collagen. The ligands used in each experiment were type IV collagen and type VI collagen in a bacterial collagenase digest of human amnion and purified NC1 domain of type IV collagen with purified type VI collagen globular domains. Type VI collagen polyclonal antibody 4104; type VI monoclonal antibody mixture containing N3-VI-2, C1-VI-1, and C12-VI-2; or type IV collagen polyclonal antibody (Southern Biotechnology) was used to precipitate the type VI-type IV complex. Preimmune serum was used to control for nonspecific precipitation. Mixtures of the proteins were incubated in PBS at room temperature for 2 h, and then antibody was added with gentle rotation for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight. PBS-washed protein G-Sepharose (1:3, v/v) was added and mixed for another 2 h at room temperature. The antigen-antibody-protein G-Sepharose complex was collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 three times (5 min each). The complex was eluted from the protein G with 0.5 m acetic acid. The identity of the interacting ligands was determined by Western blots analysis. Five micrograms of pepsin-solubilized and purified type I, II, V, and XI collagens, purified intact type VI collagen tetramers, type IV collagen NC1 domain, fibronectin, and BSA were coated onto microtiter plates at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min followed by a 3-h incubation at room temperature with varying amounts of biotinylated intact type VI collagen tetramers (0–5 μg). Bound type VI collagen was detected by further incubation with extravidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (100,000 dilution) for 2 h, three PBS/Tween 20 washes, and a 30-min incubation with Sigma 104 substrate. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. All analyses were done in duplicate, and the values were averaged. Human skeletal muscle was trimmed and quickly frozen in hexane with liquid nitrogen. The frozen muscle was sectioned in an ultracryotome, and 5-μm sections were collected on glass slides, treated with cold (−20 °C) acetone for 3 min, and allowed to air dry at room temperature. Double immunofluorescence staining was performed at room temperature on unfixed tissue. Tissue was briefly washed with PBS (5 min, twice) incubated with normal rabbit serum followed by PBS washes (3 × 5 min), and incubated for 3 h in mixtures of type IV collagen polyclonal antibody and type VI collagen monoclonal antibody VI-1. After PBS washes, they were incubated with mixtures of anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (50 × dilution) and anti-rabbit IgG Texas Red (500 × dilution) conjugates for 30 min followed by PBS washes. Sections were covered with 25% glycerol in PBS buffer and viewed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. The method used in this study has been described previously (24Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, en blocimmunolocalization of type VI collagen in human skeletal muscle from a 16-year-old individual was accomplished by immersing the tissue overnight at 4 °C in monoclonal antibody 5C6 diluted 1:5 in PBS, rinsing extensively in PBS, and then incubating overnight at 4 °C in goat anti-mouse 5-nm colloidal gold conjugate. Immunolabeled tissue was then rinsed, fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in Spurrs epoxy prior to ultramicrotomy and examination using a Philips 410 LS transmission electron microscope. Screening with the amino-terminal domain of the α1(VI) chain identified four clones from the placenta library that coded protein domains that potentially interact with type VI collagen (TableI). Sequencing the activation domain insert of the positive yeast clones revealed that two of them were from the proteins fibronectin and type IV collagen. Clone 1N-9 contained a 1107-base pair insert that included the coding sequence for the carboxyl-terminal 50 amino acids of fibronectin (positions 2399–2449), and clone 1N-52.4 contained a 1343-base pair insert that included the coding sequence for the carboxyl-terminal 233 amino acids of the α1(IV) chain (positions 1447–1669) (25Brinker J.M.

Insert 1N-14 was from a 200-kDa protein encoded by a gene on chromosome 20 called KIAA0181 (GenBankTM accession number D80003) (26Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tanaka A. Nomura N.

Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The remaining positive clone insert 1N-5 contained an new sequence. Screening with the amino-terminal domain of the α2(VI) chain identified only one positive clone, 2N-36, with a 984-base pair insert. The α3(VI) chain screening identified three positive clones, 3C-30.1, 3C-45.6, and 3C-110, all containing inserts coding new protein sequences. All inserts were further characterized by multiple tissue Northern blot analysis. The tissue distribution is shown in Table Ialong with the approximate mRNA sizes. The tissue distributions are quite distinctive, ranging from 3C-30.1, with an apparently placenta-specific distribution, to 1N-5, which was in all tissues tested.

Parenthesis indicate tissues with the strongest signal. ND, not determined. An interaction between type VI and type IV collagens is likely to be physiologically significant, since type VI filaments and endothelial basement membranes are in close association in tissues. Therefore, this interaction was confirmed using isolated protein domains. The globular NC1 domain of type IV collagen was isolated from human amnion and purified by molecular sieve chromatography under native conditions (Fig. 1). The indicated fraction contained NC1, and the SDS-PAGE gel showed its purity and presence of both α1 and α2 chain dimers and monomers as previously reported (21Weber S. Engel J. Wiedemann H. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the interaction to be physiologically significant, the native amino-terminal globular domain of type VI collagen must have an affinity for the native carboxyl-terminal domain of type IV collagen. This was demonstrated by specifically immunoprecipitating a type VI-type IV complex from a bacterial collagenase digest of human amnion with either a polyclonal antibody specific to type IV collagen or a monoclonal antibody specific for the amino-terminal domain of the α3 chain of type VI collagen. In this digest, due to incomplete digestion by bacterial collagenase, both type VI tetramers and filaments are present together with type IV collagen in the form of a mixture of 7s domains (28Qian R.G.

D88492) (Katahira, J., Inoue, N., Horiguchi, Y., Matsuda, M., and Sugimoto, N. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 136, 1239–1247) were cloned. They were classified into two groups, the Vero cell CPE receptor homologues and rat androgen withdrawal apoptosis protein (RVP1; accession no. M74067) homologues, based on the similarities of primary amino acid sequences. L929 cells that were originally insensitive to CPE became sensitive to CPE on their transfection with cDNAs encoding either the CPE receptor or RVP1 homologues, indicating that these gene products are not only structurally similar but also functionally active as receptors for CPE. By binding assay, the human RVP1 homologue showed differences in affinity and capacity of binding from those of the human CPE receptor. Northern blot analysis showed that mouse homologues of the CPE receptor and RVP1 are expressed abundantly in mouse small intestine. The expression ofCPE-R mRNA in the small intestine was restricted to cryptic enterocytes, indicating that the CPE receptor is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. These results are consistent with reports that CPE binds to the small intestinal cells via two different kinds of receptors. High levels of expression of CPE-R and/orRVP1 mRNA were also detected in other organs, including the lungs, liver, and kidneys, but only low levels were expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. These results indicate that CPE uses structurally related cellular proteins as functional receptors in vivo and that organs that have not so far been recognized as CPE-sensitive have the potential to be targets of CPE.

Since the cytotoxic action of CPE to target cells requires its binding to specific receptors (14Horiguchi Y. Uemura T. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. FEMS Microbiol.

Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes a highly hydrophobic transmembrane protein of ∼22 kDa, the physiological functions of which have not yet been elucidated. The amino acid sequence of the Vero cell CPE receptor showed close similarity to that of the rat androgen withdrawal apoptosis protein RVP1 (17Briehl M.M. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Vero cell CPE receptor corresponds to the reported high affinity binding site for CPE. CPE-R was found to be expressed in CPE-sensitive cell lines from different origins;i.e. Vero cells from monkey kidneys, Henle intestine 407 cells from human small intestine, and Hep3B cells from human liver. In contrast to these sensitive cells, CPE-insensitive cells, such as the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and human lymphoblastoid cell line JY, were found not to express CPE-R, suggesting that the expression of CPE-R is tissue- and/or organ-specific.In this study, to obtain further insight into the receptors for CPEin vivo, we sought for human and mouse cDNAs similar to the Vero cell CPE-R. Here we report that these gene products can be classified into two groups homologous to the CPE receptor and RVP1, based on their similarities in structure to the Vero cell CPE receptor and RVP1 and differences in their affinities and binding capacity to CPE, and that they both have the ability to confer CPE sensitivity to the insensitive L929 cell line. We also found that the expressions of CPE-R and RVP1 were observed in a wide variety of organs, including the small intestine.

Microbiol. 1983; 37: 277-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and 1.5 g of NH4Cl/liter (8Meyer O. Schlegel H.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1983; 37: 277-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) at 65 °C. Fermentors of 70 liters total volume were flushed with a gas mixture composed of (v/v) 78% air, 13% CO, and 9% CO2 at a flow rate of 3 liters/min. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until use. Crude extracts were prepared by passing bacterial suspensions (200 g of wet weight in 200 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and few crystals of DNase I) about 20 times through a French pressure cell under anoxic or oxic conditions. Solutions were made anoxic by evacuation, sparging with N2, and the addition of sodium dithionite (100 mg/liter). Cytoplasmic fractions were obtained from crude extracts by ultracentrifugation. Cytoplasmic fractions were loaded onto a DEAE-52 cellulose column (height, 10.6 cm; diameter, 6.2 cm; bed volume, 250 ml) and eluted with 250 ml of phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5), followed by a linear gradient of 0 to 1m NaCl in phosphate buffer. Fractions were analyzed for nitrogenase activity. The St2 1The abbrevations used are: St1, dinitrogenase ofS. thermoautotrophicus; St2, superoxide oxidoreductase, functioning as dinitrogenase reductase; St3, CO dehydrogenase; INT, 1-phenyl-2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium chloride; SOD, superoxide dismutase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. protein appeared after elution in 100–125 ml of phosphate buffer; the St1 protein eluted at 0.3 mm NaCl. St1 protein was then subjected to centrifugation in a linear gradient of 8 to 35% (w/v) sucrose in phosphate buffer for 18 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. The St1 protein appeared at 19% sucrose. Fractions with nitrogenase activity were pooled, applied to a Sephadex G-150 gel filtration column (height, 44 cm; diameter, 2.5 cm; bed volume, 200 ml) and chromatographed with 200 ml of phosphate buffer. Unless otherwise stated, a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was employed throughout this study. The St2 protein from DEAE cellulose chromatography was subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 with phosphate buffer as the eluent. The purity of native proteins was examined by PAGE (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) at different pH values. Isoelectric focusing was performed with commercially available Isogel agarose isoelectric focusing plates (FMC Bio-Products). Nitrogenase was assayed in serum-stoppered 37-ml Wheaton vials containing 2 ml of phosphate buffer supplied with 2.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Na2S2O4, 0.1 mg of St2 and 0.8 mg of St1. The gas atmosphere was pure N2 or pure helium. Assays were kept unshaken at 65 °C. Ammonium formation (10Gadkari D. Zentralbl. Mikrobiol. 1984; 139: 623-631Crossref Google Scholar) was followed with time (for 2 h if not otherwise indicated) in samples withdrawn from the vials. Calculations of specific activities of nitrogenase were based on the total amount of protein (St1 plus St2) present in the assay. Nitrogenase activity in the experiments of Table IV was assayed in Wheaton vials of 100 ml of total volume, containing 15 ml of phosphate buffer, 2.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 30 mg of the cytoplasmic fraction. To this basic assay the additions specified in Table IV were made. The anoxic assays were amended with cysteine and dithiothreitol (4 mg each) and O2-free gases, and the vials were equipped with a central cylinder containing 50 mg of sodium dithionite in 1 ml of phosphate buffer to trap traces of potentially contaminating O2.Table IVNitrogenase activities in cytoplasmic fractions of S. thermoautotrophicus under different assay conditionsConditionsNitrogenase activity4-aSpecific activities are in nmol NH4+/mg of cytoplasmic protein/h.

Open table in a new tab CO dehydrogenase was assayed spectrophotometrically using 1-methoxyphenazine methosulfate and INT as the electron acceptor (11Kraut M. Hugendieck I. Herwig S. Meyer O. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Formation of superoxide was assayed by the reduction ofp-nitro blue tetrazolium as described previously (12Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from St2 to physiological or artificial electron acceptors (50 μm acceptor in phosphate buffer) was assayed spectrophotometrically. H2O2 was analyzed colorimetrically with the iron-sensitive dye xylenol orange (13Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of MgATP during the reduction of N2 to ammonium as shown in Fig. 5 was examined in Wheaton vials containing 0.625 mm ATP, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 6.25 mmNa2S2O4, 6 mg of St1, and 0.75 mg of St2 in 8 ml of phosphate buffer under a gas atmosphere of pure N2 at 65 °C. Analysis of ammonium was as described above for the conventional nitrogenase assay. ATP hydrolysis was analyzed by isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an anion exchange column (ET 250/4 NUCLEOSIL 100–10 SB, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) using 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column outflow was continuously analyzed in a diode array detector (Waters 991, Waters, Eschborn, Germany). Protein samples were wet-ashed with concentrated sulfuric acid and H2O2 and analyzed for molybdenum with the dithiol method (14Cardenas J. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and for iron with the bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid method (15Schade A.L. Oyama J. Reinhart R.W. Miller J.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1954; 87: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Manganese, as well as molybdenum and iron, were also analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The methylene blue method (16Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1333-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed for the determination of acid-labile sulfide. Sulfhydryl groups of native or SDS-treated proteins were estimated with 5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (17Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25B: 457-464Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein followed conventional methods (18Bradford M.M. Anal.

N-terminal sequencing was by automated Edman degradation in a pulsed liquid-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (20Löw A. Sprinzl M. Faulhammer H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Molecular weight determinations by gel filtration were on Superdex 200 prep grade (Pharmacia). Densitometric analysis of gels were carried out with DucoGelIV (MWG, Ebersberg) in combination with RFLPscan software (Scananalytic, Billerica). Polyacrylamide gels were calibrated with commercially available kits: ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) (Pharmacia), and a protein ladder ranging from 10 to 120 kDa (Life Technologies, Inc.). H2 in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 was analyzed by HgO to mercury conversion in a trace analytical RGD2 reduction gas detector (Techmation, Düsseldorf) after gas chromatographic separation on molecular sieve (5 Å). Centrifugation of cytoplasmic fractions of CO grownS. thermoautotrophicus in linear sucrose density gradients revealed three distinct protein bands of brown color with approximate molecular masses of 115, 49, and 147 kDa, designated protein St1, protein St2, and protein St3, respectively. The St3 protein was identified as CO dehydrogenase on the basis of the ability to catalyze the reduction of INT with CO, a molecular mass ∼123 kDa (Fig.1) and the presence of the polypeptides CoxL (molecular mass ∼87 kDa), CoxM (molecular mass ∼32 kDa) and CoxS (molecular mass ∼17 kDa) (Fig. 1). Previous studies had identified the CO dehydrogenase of S. thermoautotrophicus as a molybdo-iron-sulfur-flavoprotein containing the MCD type of molybdenum cofactor (21Meyer O. Frunzke K. Tachil J. Volk M. Stiefel E.I. Coucouvanis D. Newton W.E. Molybdenum Enzymes, Cofactors, and Model Systems. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 50-68Google Scholar). Mixtures of the proteins St1 and St2 catalyzed the reduction of N2 to NH4+ with dithionite as electron donor, whereas the individual components did not, suggesting a two-component type of nitrogenase. In four independent preparations under anoxic conditions, the St1 protein was purified 8-fold with a yield of 11% and a mean specific activity for the reduction of N2 of 109 nmol of NH4+/mg of protein/h (TableI). The St2 protein was purified about 20-fold, with a yield of 15% and a mean specific activity of 278 nmol of NH4+/mg of protein/h (Table I). The isoelectric point of St1 or St2 was 4.6. Nondenaturating PAGE revealed a single protein band of the St1 protein, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 129 kDa (Fig. 1). Denaturating PAGE revealed subunits of 93, 33, and 18 kDa, designated L, M, and S, respectively (Fig. 1). They were noncovalently bound and occurred in a molar ratio of 1(L):0.8(M):0.9(S), suggesting a heterotrimeric subunit structure.Table IPurification of the components from S. thermoautotrophicusStepProteinTotal activity1-aTotal activities in μmol NH4+/h.Specific activity1-bSpecific activities are in nmol NH4+ formed per mg of total protein/h.

The N termini of St1-L and the dinitrogenase β-subunit of Anabaena 7120 orKlebsiella pneumoniae showed 42.1 or 44.4% sequence similarity and 26.3 or 16.7% identity, respectively. The N termini of St1-M and the dinitrogenase α-subunit of Anabaena 7120 orK. pneumoniae showed 55.2 or 52.4% sequence similarity and 38.1 or 20.7% identity, respectively. The N terminus of St1-S revealed no significant sequence similarity to the α- or β-subunits of other nitrogenases or to the δ-subunit of alternative dinitrogenases. Upon nondenaturating PAGE, the St2 protein revealed a single 40-kDa band at pH 6.5 or pH 7.5 (Fig. 1), or a single 98-kDa band at pH 8.5. Other methods revealed masses of 49 kDa (sucrose density gradient centrifugation) or 41.5 kDa (gel filtration). Denaturating PAGE showed a single noncovalently bound 24-kDa subunit, designatedD (Fig. 1), suggesting a homodimeric subunit structure. The N terminus 2C. Schmidt, D. Gadkari, and O. Meyer, unpublished data. MFELPPLPYPYDALEPYFDAKKMEIHYYGGHGA of the St2-D polypeptide revealed no significant sequence similarity to sequenced nitrogenase polypeptides. Instead, St2-D showed 96.0% sequence similarity and 72.0% identity to the N terminus of the manganese-containing SODs ofBacillus stearothermophilus (22Bowler C. Van Kaer L. Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Dhaese P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Bacillus caldotenax (23Chambers S.P. Brehm J.K. Michael N.P. Atkinson T. Minton N.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 91: 277-284Crossref Google Scholar). In assays containing xanthine oxidase, xanthine, and O2 for the production of superoxide anion radicals (O·̄2) the St2 protein revealed O·̄2 oxidizing activity of 126 units/mg of protein (1 unit equals 50% inhibition of NBT reduction). The reaction was insensitive to 3.5 mmpotassium cyanide, 60 mm sodium azide, or 10 mmH2O2. Although the St2 protein displays many properties similar to a manganese SOD (24Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 189: 317-322Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) it actually functions as a superoxide oxidoreductase transferring the electrons to the St1 protein (see below). In the presence of CO and O2, CO dehydrogenase produced H2O2 and O·̄2. The addition of commercial E. coli SOD effected an approximately 15% increase in H2O2 formation. When SOD was replaced by St2 protein, H2O2 formation decreased by 13%, indicating the inability of the St2 protein to convert O·̄2 to H2O2. Dithionite reduced St2 protein could transfer 2.3 ± 0.7 electrons to oxidized phenazine methosulfate with an activity of 77 nmol/mg of protein/min. Another suitable electron acceptor was 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (112 nmol/mg of protein/min), whereas viologen dyes, methylene blue, ferricyanide, INT, nitro blue tetrazolium, NAD(P), FAD, FMN, and riboflavin were ineffective. The UV-visible spectrum of air-oxidized St1 protein revealed a protein peak at 274 nm and a broad nondistinct band in the region from 400 to 800 nm (Fig.2). The dithionite-reduced spectrum was relatively featureless (Fig. 2). The visible spectra of oxidized and reduced St1 protein were similar to those of Kp1 (25Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Cook K.A. Postgate J.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 655-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and different from those of Cp1 (26Dalton H. Morris J.A. Ward M.A. Mortenson L.E.

St1 is a molybdo-iron-sulfur protein which contains molybdenum, iron, and acid-labile sulfide in a 1:17:11 molar ratio (Table II).Table IIContents of metals, acid-labile sulfide, and sulfhydryls of St1 and St2 protein from S. thermoautotrophicusProteinMetalsAcid-labile sulfideSulfhydrylsMoFeZnMnVAvailable2-aNumber of sulfhydryl groups available for 5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid at the surface of native protein.Total2-bTotal number of sulfhydryl groups of denaturated protein.mol/mol proteinSt10.7 ± 0.112 ± 13.4ND2-cNot determined.<0.068 ± 14 ± 0.112 ± 1St2<0.04<0.070.10.24 ± 0.03<0.02<0.0200Molecular masses of 144 kDa (St1) and 48 kDa (St2) have been used for calculations.

The St2 protein exhibited a pale yellow-greenish color and contained substoichiometric amounts of manganese and zinc (Table II). Other components could not be demonstrated. In its overall shape the UV-visible spectrum of St2 was similar to that reported for the “SOD active” protein P1 from Euglena gracilis (28Lengfelder E. Elstner E.F. Z. Naturforsch. 1979; 34c: 374-380Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The spectrum revealed a protein absorption at 276 nm and a broad absorption extending from 310 to 700 nm with a small maximum at 411 nm and a broad shoulder around 474 nm. TableIII summarizes the requirements of the nitrogenase system for various components. The complete reaction mix for the in vitro reduction of N2 to NH4+ by nitrogenase required St1, St2, MgATP, N2, and dithionite (Table III, lines 1 and 5–13). The proteinaceous nature of the nitrogenase is demonstrated by the lability to boiling or proteases (Table III, lines 2–4). MgADP cannot replace MgATP in the reduction reaction of N2 or H+ (Table III, line 14). Table III also demonstrates that in the complete nitrogenase assay CO dehydrogenase cannot replace St1, St2, or both for the reduction of N2 or H+(lines 15–17).Table IIIRequirements of nitrogenase for the reduction of N2 or H+LineAssay componentsActivitiesSt1St2St3Mg2+ATPADPDithioniteN2reduction3-aN2 reduction is in nmol NH4+/mg protein/h.Proton reduction3-bProton reduction is in nmol H2/mg protein/h.1++−++−+106612+3-cSt1 and St2 were boiled for 10 min.+3-cSt1 and St2 were boiled for 10 min.−++−+003+3-dSt1 and St2 (1 mg each) were preincubated for 16 h at 20 °C with protease K (12.5 μg) and then assayed for activity.+3-dSt1 and St2 (1 mg each) were preincubated for 16 h at 20 °C with protease K (12.5 μg) and then assayed for activity.−++−+004+3-eSame as d, except that protease K was replaced by trypsin (50 μg).+3-eSame as d, except that protease K was replaced by trypsin (50 μg).−++−+005++−−−−−006+−−++−+007−+−++−+008++−+−−−009++−−+−−0010++−−−−+0011++−++−−0012++−+−−+0013++−−+−+0014++−+−+3-fSame results were obtained with 3 or 30 mg of ADP per assay.+0015+−+++−+0016−++++−+0017−−+++−+003-a N2 reduction is in nmol NH4+/mg protein/h.3-b Proton reduction is in nmol H2/mg protein/h.3-c St1 and St2 were boiled for 10 min.3-d St1 and St2 (1 mg each) were preincubated for 16 h at 20 °C with protease K (12.5 μg) and then assayed for activity.3-e Same as d, except that protease K was replaced by trypsin (50 μg).3-f Same results were obtained with 3 or 30 mg of ADP per assay. Open table in a new tab Maximum activity for the formation of NH4+ from N2 was obtained at a molar ratio of St1 to St2 of 2.2:1 (Fig.3). An ATP-regenerating system (e.g. creatine phosphate and creatine kinase) was not required. A 10-fold excess of MgADP over MgATP had no effect on nitrogenase activity. MgADP is apparently not inhibitory for S. thermoautotrophicus nitrogenase. Formation of NH4+ from N2 as well as formation of H2 from H+ was linear with time for at least 2.5 h (Fig. 4, 5). In the absence of N2, only H2 but no ammonium was formed (Fig. 4). Reduction of ethine or ethene by mixtures of St1 and St2 was below the detection limit of 0.2 pmol of carbon of the gas chromatographic assay applied. There was a linear correlation between MgATP hydrolysis to MgADP and NH4+formation from N2 (Fig. 5). At the assay temperature of 65 °C, ATP was almost chemically stable, whereas significant hydrolysis of ADP to AMP and inorganic phosphate occurred (Fig. 5). There was a linear correlation between the molar formation of ammonium from N2 and the molar amount of MgATP under different assay conditions (Fig.6). The regression line followed the equation [NH4+] = 0.35833 × [ATP] + 0.0409. Formation of 2 mol of NH4+, which is equivalent to the reduction of 1 mol of N2, had a mean requirement of 5.5 ± 1.0 mol of MgATP (n = 22). The minimum and maximum MgATP/N2 ratios were 3.85 or 11.34, respectively (Fig. 6). This is significantly less than the minimum of 16 ATP reported for nitrogenases from other sources (29Burris R.H. J.

Meyer, unpublished data. andS. thermoautotrophicus can transfer the electrons formed upon CO oxidation (CO + H2O → CO2 + 2e − + 2H+) to O2, thereby producing superoxide anion radicals (O·̄2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In assays containing purified CO dehydrogenase, St1 and St2 protein, and MgATP under an atmosphere of (v/v) 50% CO and 50% air, N2 was reduced to ammonium, indicating that N2 reduction was coupled to the oxidation of CO. Ammonium was not formed in the absence of CO. The requirement of O2 for N2 reduction in cytoplasmic fractions (Table IV) is explained by the formation of O·̄2 by CO dehydrogenase and the subsequent reoxidation of O·̄2 to O2 by the St2 protein. The functioning of O·̄2 as an electron donor for N2 reduction is further substantiated by the sensitivity of the reaction to added SODs, the ability to replace CO dehydrogenase for xanthine oxidase, plus a suitable substrate or to provide O·̄2 chemically from riboflavin plus light (Table IV). MnSODs from Escherichia coli andB. stearothermophilus could not substitute for the St2 protein (Table IV). Oxidation of H2 by CO dehydrogenase in the presence of O2 also leads to O·̄2 formation (Table IV). During chemolithoautotrophic utilization of H2,S. thermoautotrophicus employs a membrane-bound hydrogenase for energy generation; this hydrogenase cannot produce O·̄2. Under these conditions the hydrogenase activity of CO dehydrogenase (32Meyer O. Frunzke K. Gadkari D. Jacobitz S. Hugendieck I. Kraut M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 87: 253-260Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Santiago B. Meyer O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 157-162Crossref Google Scholar) is used for the generation of O·̄2 as an electron donor for N2 fixation. When cytoplasmic fractions of S. thermoautotrophicus were kept for 24 h at room temperature under N2, helium, air, or O2, nitrogenase activities ranged from 20.2 to 29.6 nmol of NH4+/mg of protein/h. Shaking of the purified proteins St1 and St2 for 24 h in air also did not affect nitrogenase activity. Under oxic conditions St1 was purified 11-fold with a yield of 1% and a specific activity of 139 nmol of NH4+/mg of protein/h, and St2 was purified 21-fold, with a yield of 31% and a specific activity of 233 nmol of NH4+/mg of protein/h. The results characterize the N2-fixing system of S. thermoautotrophicus as absolutely O2-insensitive. The insensitivity of St2 to H2O2 has already been mentioned. Since H2O2 is another product in the formation of O·̄2 by CO dehydrogenase or xanthine oxidase, the results of Table IV also indicate that the entire nitrogenase reaction in subcellular fractions of S. thermoautotrophicus is insensitive to H2O2. N2 fixation by S. thermoautotrophicusinvolves CO dehydrogenase, free O2, and O·̄2 as electron carriers and the proteins St2 and St1 (Fig.7). CO dehydrogenase generates superoxide anion radicals (O·̄2) from O2, which makes N2 fixation in S. thermoautotrophicus obligately O2-dependent and establishes a molecular coupling via O·̄2, which is in contrast to the electronic coupling in the known nitrogenase systems. The O·̄2 anions are free intermediates and can be trapped by SOD (Table IV). Consequently, interaction of CO dehydrogenase and the St2 protein for O·̄2transfer is not required. Generally, O·̄2 is considered a highly reactive and destructive metabolic by-product that requires detoxification, e.g. by superoxide dismutases. N2 fixation in S. thermoautotrophicus shows that the redox couple O2/O·̄2 (E 0′ = −160 mV) operates as an electron carrier with similar efficiency as ferredoxins, flavodoxins, or hydroquinones in the known nitrogenase systems (34Yates M.G. FEBS Lett. 1972; 27: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Evans H.J. Burris R.H. Stacey G. Burris R.H. Evans H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 1-42Google Scholar). In addition, the use of O·̄2 in N2fixation by S. thermoautotrophicus seems to be a powerful mechanism to scavange O·̄2 radicals. The dinitrogenase reductases known so far are γ2 dimeric iron proteins with molecular mass ∼63 kDa and contain 4Fe and 4S2− atoms per dimer (36Eady R.R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In contrast, the St2 protein ofS. thermoautotrophicus has been identified as a manganese-superoxide oxidoreductase with molecular mass ∼48 kDa and does not contain Fe or S2− (Table II). In contrast to SOD, St2 is unable to disproportionate O·̄2 into O2 and H2O2. The function of St2 is rather to generate electrons through the reoxidation of O·̄2 ions to O2and to deliver them to the St1 protein (Fig. 7). Like the known nitrogenases, the S. thermoautotrophicus system also has a requirement for MgATP. With S. thermoautotrophicusnitrogenase the most efficient MgATP/N2 ratio is 4, instead of 16 reported for nitrogenases from other sources, indicating its superb efficiency. Future work must unravel how MgATP interacts with the nitrogenase proteins. It is likely that the reduction of N2 takes place at the St1 protein of S. thermoautotrophicus. The known MoFeS-dinitrogenases are complex α2β2tetrameric proteins with M r ∼230 kDa containing 2 molybdenum atoms and 30–34 iron atoms and an approximately equivalent number of acid-labile sulfide atoms (36Eady R.R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The St1 protein was also identified as a MoFeS-protein but with molecular mass ∼144 kDa and a differing LMS heterotrimeric subunit structure (Figs. 1 and 7). It revealed per molybdenum atom, 13.8–21.7 iron atoms and 8.8–15 acid-labile sulfide atoms (Table II). A substoichiometric amount of acid-labile sulfide compared with iron is frequently found with nitrogenases (37Blanchard C.Z. Hales B.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There was a moderate sequence similarity between the N-terminal sequences of the subunits St1-L and Kp1-β or St1-M and Kp1-α, although we are aware of the limitations of a comparison of subunit N termini. The overall reaction catalyzed byS. thermoautotrophicus nitrogenase compares to that of known nitrogenases, including the concomitant formation of H2(Fig. 4). In consequence of the inability of the S. thermoautotrophicus nitrogenase to reduce ethine or ethene, the widely used ethine reduction assay is not applicable for measuring nitrogenase activity in environmental samples inhabited by bacteria performing this new type of N2 fixation. It can be expected that the insensitivity of the S. thermoautotrophicusnitrogenase to O2 will open new avenues for practical applications. Studies on the electron paramagnetic resonance properties of the metal centers in the S. thermoautotrophicusnitrogenase system as well as on the genetics and molecular biology of CO dehydrogenase (St3 protein) and St1 and St2 proteins, which are currently underway, will add further clues to the understanding of the novel nitrogenase system."
https://openalex.org/W2145338033,"Recently, human interleukin 18 (hIL-18) cDNA was cloned, and the recombinant protein with a tentatively assigned NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was generated. However, natural hIL-18 has not yet been isolated, and its cellular processing is therefore still unclear. To clarify this, we purified natural hIL-18 from the cytosolic extract of monocytic THP.1 cells. Natural hIL-18 exhibited a molecular mass of 18.2 kDa, and the NH2-terminal amino acid was Tyr37. Biological activities of the purified protein were identical to those of recombinant hIL-18 with respect to the enhancement of natural killer cell cytotoxicity and interferon-γ production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also found two precursor hIL-18 (prohIL-18)-processing activities in the cytosol of THP.1 cells. These activities were blocked separately by the caspase inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO. Further analyses of the partially purified enzymes revealed that one is caspase-1, which cleaves prohIL-18 at the Asp36-Tyr37 site to generate the mature hIL-18, and the other is caspase-3, which cleaves both precursor and mature hIL-18 at Asp71-Ser72 and Asp76-Asn77 to generate biologically inactive products. These results suggest that the production and processing of natural hIL-18 are regulated by two processing enzymes, caspase-1 and caspase-3, in THP.1 cells.

In 1995 we purified murine IL-18 from the liver extracts of mice sensitized withPropionibacterium acnes followed by elicitation with lipopolysaccaride (1Okamura H. Nagata K. Komatsu T. Tanimoto T.

Using this as a probe, human IL-18 cDNA was also cloned from a human normal liver cDNA library (3Ushio S. Namba M. Okura T. Hattori K. Nukada Y. Akita K. Tanabe F. Konishi K. Micallef M. Fujii M.

The recombinant human IL-18 with a tentatively assigned NH2-terminal amino acid based on its homology with the natural murine IL-18 sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its biological activities were examined (3Ushio S.

However, natural hIL-18 had not yet been isolated, and its maturation site remained unclear. In this report, we screened for hIL-18 mRNA-expressing cell lines and purified natural hIL-18 from the cell-free extract of positively expressing cells. Furthermore, we identified two hIL-18-processing enzymes in the same cellular extract. One enzyme is ICE/caspase-1, which acts on prohIL-18 to generate the mature active form of hIL-18, and the other is CPP32/caspase-3, which acts on both the prohIL-18 and the mature hIL-18 to generate biologically inactive degraded products. This is the first report on the identification of natural hIL-18 and its processing enzymes existing in the same cells. Tetrapeptidyl ICE-like protease inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO and CPP32-like protease inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, and ICE- and CPP32-like protease fluorogenic substrates Ac-YVAD-MCA and Ac-DEVD-MCA, respectively, were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-hIL-18 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 125-2H (IgG) and 25-2G (IgG) were raised against the recombinant protein in our laboratory. Human IL-1β precursor and anti-precursor human IL-1β rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) were obtained from Cistron (Pine Brook, NJ). Anti-human ICE-p20 subunit, anti-human CPP32, anti-human poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase goat pAbs, and anti-human ICE-p10 subunit rabbit pAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant purified human (His)6-tagged CPP32, (His)6-tagged CMH-1, and anti-CMH-1 rabbit antiserum (antibody 25) were prepared at Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cambridge, MA). 42 hematopoietic cell lines were cultured for the screening of hIL-18 mRNA in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Whittaker, Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured under standard conditions in a humidified 5% CO2 and air mixture at 37 °C. To obtain large amounts of THP.1 cells, anin vivo cell propagation method using immunosuppressed hamsters was applied as described previously (9Ando S. Ohta T. Tanimoto T. Sano O. Yamauchi H. Ando O.

Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Lymphokine Res. 1988; 7: 175-185Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 THP.1 cells were transplanted subcutaneously into newborn hamsters and injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of a rabbit anti-hamster thymocyte serum (J R Scientific, Inc., Woodland, CA). Every 3 or 4 days after the transplantation, these hamsters were given 0.1 ml of the serum intraperitoneally. After 3 weeks, the solid tumor masses of THP.1 cells were harvested, rinsed thoroughly with RPMI 1640 medium, and small tumor masses were dispersed by scissors and then passed through stainless steel meshes to obtain a single cell suspension. Total RNAs were isolated from various cell lines by ULTRASPEC-3 (Biotecx, Houston, TX) in accordance with the supplier's instructions. The RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR. The thermocycle conditions were 30 or 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively. The sequences of the primer pair for hIL-18 were 5′-GCTTGAATCTAAATTATTATCAGTC-3′ and 5′-CAAATTGCATCTTATTATCATG-3′, which produced a 335-base pair product. The PCR products were run on 3% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C except for DEAE-5PW chromatography, which was carried out at room temperature. A THP.1 cell-free extract was prepared by hypotonic lysis (11Kostura M.J. Tocci M.J. Limjuco G. Chin J. Cameron P. Hillman A.G. Chartrain N.A. Schmidt J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5227-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellets from 5 × 1011 THP.1 cells were washed once with 10 volumes of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA·2Na) and were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 3 volumes of hypotonic buffer and frozen at −20 °C until use. Cells were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g. The cell-free extract obtained was then dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 6.6. The cell-free extract (7.2 liters) from step 1 was loaded onto a 3.6-liter DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mm PB at pH 6.6. After washing with the same buffer, the extract was eluted with 10 mm PB containing 0.2m NaCl and then 0.5 m NaCl. The fractions containing hIL-18 activity eluted with 0.2 m NaCl (8.0 liters) were pooled and concentrated to 1.0 liter with a hollow fiber membrane module AIP-1010 model (Asahi Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm PB at pH 6.8. The dialyzed product from step 2 was passed through a 0.22-μm Millipak filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), loaded onto a 550-ml DEAE-5PW column (Tosoh, Tokyo) equilibrated with 20 mm PB at pH 6.8, and washed with the same buffer. Elution was carried out with 5 bed volumes of a linear salt gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl), and 25-ml elute fractions were collected. hIL-18 activity was eluted at 90–200 mmNaCl in 20 mm PB, and fractions 44–54 containing the activity were pooled and concentrated to 50 ml with hollow fiber membranes, Mini-module model NM-3 (Asahi Chemical Industry). A hIL-18 affinity column was prepared using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) and anti-hIL-18 murine mAb (125-2H) in our laboratory. The pooled and concentrated preparation from step 3 was applied onto a 1-ml hIL-18 affinity column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.2. After washing with the same buffer extensively, the sample was eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer containing 0.1 mNaCl at pH 2.5. Eluted fractions were neutralized immediately with 1.0m Tris. The hIL-18-containing fractions from step 4 were loaded onto a 4.2-ml reverse phase ASAHIPAK C4P-50 4E column (Showa Denko, Tokyo), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the column was washed with the same buffer. Next, the sample was eluted with 24 bed volumes of an increasing acetonitrile linear gradient (0–90% acetonitrile). The main peak fraction eluted at about 40% acetonitrile and was used for peptide mapping of natural hIL-18. IFN-γ production assay and NK cell cytotoxicity assay were performed as described previously (3Ushio S. Namba M. Okura T. Hattori K. Nukada Y. Akita K. Tanabe F. Konishi K. Micallef M. Fujii M. Torigoe K. Tanimoto T. Fukuda S. Ikeda M. Okamura H. Kurimoto M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4274-4279PubMed Google Scholar). As in the previous procedures, all purification steps were performed at 4 °C except for DEAE-5PW chromatography, which was carried out at room temperature. THP.1 cells (2.0 × 1011 cells) were obtained as described above. Cell-free extract was prepared by the method of Miller et al. (12Miller D.K. Ayala J.M. Egger L.A. Raju S.M. Yamin T.-T. Ding G.J.-F.

The solution was stirred for 20 min, and the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then brought to 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate collected by centrifugation was resuspended in TGCD buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), and dialyzed against the same fresh buffer for 16 h. The dialyzed fraction from step 2 was passed through a 0.22-μm poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane filter (Millipore). Half of the preparation was loaded onto a 550-ml DEAE-5PW column equilibrated with TGCD buffer and washed with the same buffer. The extract was eluted in two batches of 45-ml fractions with 4.5 bed volumes of a linear salt gradient (0–0.25m NaCl). Fractions containing ICA (fractions 17–21 eluting at about 100 mm NaCl) and IDA (fractions 33–48 eluting at 150–210 mm NaCl) were pooled separately and dialyzed against HGCD buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm DTT). These two preparations were subjected to further purification. Half of the dialyzed fraction containing ICA was loaded onto a 20-ml S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with HGCD buffer and washed with the same buffer. Then the sample was eluted in two batches of 5-ml fractions with 6 bed volumes of a linear salt gradient (0–0.12 mKCl). Fractions 23–26 containing ICA eluted at 50–80 mmKCl in HGCD buffer and were pooled and dialyzed against HGCD buffer. This microvolume concentration step was carried out with a SMART system (Pharmacia) in accordance with the supplier's instructions. One-third of the dialyzed fractions containing ICA was loaded onto a 0.1-ml Mono S column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with HGCD buffer and washed with the same buffer. Then the sample was eluted in three batches of 25-μl fractions with an HGCD buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. Fractions 3–5 containing ICA were pooled and used in the next process. One-third of the pooled fractions from step 2 was loaded onto a 2.4-ml Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with HGCD buffer. The sample was eluted in three batches of 80-μl fractions with the same buffer. ICA was eluted in fractions 11–14. Biologically active fractions were pooled and subjected to NH2-terminal analysis of the polypeptides. One-third of the dialyzed fraction containing IDA was loaded onto a 20-ml S-Sepharose column equilibrated with HGCD buffer at pH 7.0 and washed with the same buffer. The sample was then eluted in three batches of 10-ml fractions with HGCD buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. Fractions 3–5 containing IDA were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mmBis-Tris buffer at pH 7.1. Half of the dialyzed pool from step 1 was loaded onto a 20-ml Mono P column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 25 mm Bis-Tris buffer at pH 7.1 and washed with the same buffer. The sample was eluted in two batches of 8-ml fractions with 10% polybuffer (Pharmacia) and iminodiacetic acid at pH 5.0, which generates a decreasing linear pH gradient (pH 7.1–5.0). Fractions containing IDA (pH 5.8–6.0) were pooled and dialyzed against HGCD buffer. The dialyzed pooled fractions from step 2 were concentrated and loaded onto a 120-ml Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with HGD buffer (HGCD buffer without CHAPS) at pH 7.4. IDA was eluted in fractions 29–35. Fractions containing IDA were pooled and used in next process. The pooled fractions from step 3 were loaded in two batches onto a 4.4-ml hydroxyapatite column (Tonen, Tokyo) equilibrated with HGD buffer at pH 7.4. The sample was then eluted in 0.5-ml fractions with 5 bed volumes of a linear phosphate gradient (0–0.5 m). Fractions containing IDA eluted at 500 mm phosphate in HGD buffer in fractions 54 and 55, which were pooled and subjected to NH2-terminal analysis of the polypeptides. Amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal portions of purified natural hIL-18 and processed forms of hIL-18 (p18, p16, and p15) and of partially purified hIL-18-processing enzymes were determined with an automated protein sequencer model 473A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, proteins of interest were subjected to electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto ProBlottTM membranes (Applied Biosystems). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and excised for direct NH2-terminal sequencing. For peptide mapping, purified natural hIL-18 was digested with clostripain (Sigma), and the resulting peptide fragments were separated using a 2.5-ml ODS-120T column (Tosoh) with 20 bed volumes of increasing acetonitrile linear gradient (0–70% acetonitrile) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted fragments detected at a wavelength of 214 nm were separately collected and analyzed. A 0.8-kilobase cDNA encoding precursor hIL-18 (3Ushio S. Namba M. Okura T. Hattori K. Nukada Y. Akita K.

The expressed protein was analyzed by immunoblotting using a hIL-18-specific mAb (25-2G). Human ICE cDNA was cloned from THP.1 cells using the PCR method. PCR primers were designed based on the published hICE nucleotide sequence (14Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R.

COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation with an expression construct containing hICE cDNA into pCDM8 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego) and harvested after 3 days. Proteins from the cells were extracted with hypotonic buffer using a Dounce homogenizer. The supernatant of this homogenate was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h to activate ICE precursor and was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by DEAE-5PW and Superdex 75 column chromatographies. The quantities of hIL-18 were assessed by a two-site sandwich ELISA using mAbs prepared in our laboratory (15Taniguchi M. Nagaoka K. Kunikata T. Kayano T. Yamauchi H. Nakamura S. Ikeda M. Kurimoto M.

Briefly, 3 × 105 KG-1 cells suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded in a 96-well microplate. Samples were added to the wells and incubated for 24 h, and IFN-γ activity induced in the culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA. ICE-like and CPP32-like activities were measured using the fluorogenic substrates Ac-YVAD-MCA and Ac-DEVD-MCA, respectively (12Miller D.K. Ayala J.M. Egger L.A. Raju S.M. Yamin T.-T. Ding G.J.-F.

Briefly, 1 mm substrate and samples (10 μl) were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT in 96-well microplates (100 μl) at pH 7.4 for 3 h (ICE-like activity assay) or at pH 6.5 for 0.5–1 h (CPP32-like activity assay). The levels of generated 4-amino-2-methylcoumarin were assessed with a fluorescence plate reader (FluoroScan II, Labsystems Japan, Tokyo) at a wavelength of 355 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission. The activities of these proteases were calculated and normalized as pmol of 4-amino-2-methylcoumarin formed/μl/min. To identify hIL-18-producing cell lines, we first examined the level of constitutive expression of hIL-18 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR analysis using hIL-18-specific primers. 42 hematopoietic cell lines of various lineages were screened. hIL-18 mRNA was highly expressed in myelomonocytic cell lines such as THP.1, KG-1, HBL-38, and HL-60, and some non-lymphocytic and non-myelomonocytic cell lines such as MEG-01 and TS9;22. In some B cell and non-T, non-B cell lines such as BJAB, MOLP-2, and NALM-20, weak expression of hIL-18 mRNA was observed. Interestingly, no expression was observed in T cell lines (TableI).Table IConstitutive expression of hIL-18 mRNA in hematopoietic cell linesCell linesPCR cycles3035T cell DND-39−− HUT-78−− C5/MJ−− SAALT-3−− DND-41−− JM−− JURKAT−− PEER−− ED-S−−B cell NALM-6−− BALM-9−− BALM-10−− MKB-1−− Hair-M−− HPB-ALL−− DAUDI−− RAJI−− BAL-KHs−− BALL-1−− B372−− B373−− B374−− Ramos−+ MLB-1084−+ MOLP-2−++ BJAB−++Non-T, non-B cell HDLM-2−− NALM-19−− NALM-20−++ NALM-24−++Myelomonocyte cell KCL-22−− U-937+++ ML-1+++ KU-812+++ THP.1++++ HL-60++++ KG-1+++++ HBL-38+++++Non-L, non-M cell L428−− HEL+++ MEG-01++++ TS9; 22++++The levels of constitutive expression of hIL-18 mRNA were examined by reverse transcription-PCR analysis using IL-18-specific primers. 42 hematopoietic cell lines of various lineages were studied.

The strength of expression was judged from the density of the band detected: very strongly expressed, +++; strongly expressed; ++; weakly expressed; +; no expression, −. Initially, we chose four myelomonocytic cell lines (THP.1, HL-60, U-937, and HBL-38) and two non-L, non-M cell lines (HEL and MEG-01) as targets for the detection of natural hIL-18 at the protein level. As a preliminary study, culture supernatants or extracts of these cell lines were analyzed using hIL-18-specific ELISA and immunoblotting. Small amounts of hIL-18 were detected in the cell extracts of THP.1 and U937 cells, but little or no hIL-18 was detected in the culture supernatants (data not shown). Furthermore, hIL-18 was found mostly in the cytosolic fraction of the cells. Next we employed some differentiation-inducing agents (lipopolysaccaride, retinoic acid, A23187, and phorbol myristate acetate) to investigate whether these reagents can augment the production or secretion of hIL-18. However, no significant elevation in the levels of intra- or extracellular hIL-18 was observed (data not shown). Based upon the above mentioned preliminary results, we selected the cytosolic extract of THP.1 cells as a starting material for the isolation of natural hIL-18. For this purpose, large numbers of THP.1 cells were obtained with an in vivo cell propagation method (9Ando S. Ohta T. Tanimoto T. Sano O. Yamauchi H. Ando O. Torigoe K. Kurimoto M. Jpn. J.

The cell extract was subjected to DEAE anion-exchange chromatography twice (Fig. 1, A and B) for the purification of natural hIL-18. Subsequently, affinity purification on anti-hIL-18 mAb-conjugated Sepharose was employed. The purified protein had a molecular mass of 18.2 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and exhibited IFN-γ-inducing activity on KG-1 cells (Fig. 1 C). The overall yield of natural hIL-18 after affinity purification ranged from 3 to 30 μg/1011 cells. Direct amino acid sequencing of the affinity-purified polypeptide showed that the NH2-terminal amino acid is Tyr37. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of the peptides prepared from the purified polypeptide coincided with those deduced from the cDNA (Fig. 2;underlined). These results indicate that the purified polypeptide derived from THP.1 is a mature form of hIL-18 proteolytically processed behind the Asp36 residue in a manner similar to that of the murine homolog (Fig. 2; vertical arrow) (1Okamura H.

Calcium mobilization by ATP or by platelet-derived growth factor was abolished, while the ability of thapsigargin (2 μm) to empty calcium stores and activate calcium influx was unaffected. Similar experiments with nocodazole to depolymerize the tubulin network yielded identical results. Platelet-derived growth factor induced an increase in inositol phosphates, and this increase was undiminished in the presence of cytochalasin D. Therefore, the blockade of agonist responses by this drug does not result from decreased phospholipase C. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) released calcium to the same extent in control and cytochalasin D-treated cells. Confocal microscopic studies revealed a significant rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum after cytochalasin D treatment. Thus, disruption of the cytoskeleton blocks agonist-elicited [Ca2+] i mobilization, but this effect does not result from a lower calcium storage capacity, impaired function of the IP3 receptor, or diminished phospholipase C activity. We suggest that cytoskeletal disruption alters the spatial relationship between phospholipase C and IP3 receptors, impairing phospholipase C-dependent calcium signaling. Capacitative calcium entry was not altered under these conditions, indicating that the coupling between depletion of intracellular calcium stores and calcium entry does not depend on a precise structural relationship between intracellular stores and plasma membrane calcium channels.

A variety of hormone and neurotransmitter agonists activate phospholipase C, promoting the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two intracellular messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIOC6(3), dihexaoxacarbocyanine; DIC, differential interference contrast; (2,4,5)IP3, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIOC6(3), dihexaoxacarbocyanine; DIC, differential interference contrast; (2,4,5)IP3, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. and diacylglycerol (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). IP3 binds to channel receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting channel opening and increasing cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+] i ) as a consequence of depletion of Ca2+ sequestered within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in the modulation of diverse cellular functions.Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates a pathway for Ca2+ influx (presumably mediated by a channel) across the plasma membrane, which has been termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Numerous studies utilizing reagents that inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase responsible for Ca2+storage within the endoplasmic reticulum (e.g. thapsigargin) have demonstrated that Ca2+ store depletion provides a full and sufficient signal for activation of capacitative Ca2+entry (3Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 4Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). However, the nature of the signal linking pool depletion to opening of the capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway remains unknown. Two general mechanisms have been proposed to explain how information is transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Putney and Bird (3Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and Berridge (5Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar)). One model describes a direct protein-protein association between the IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum and the capacitative entry channel: after IP3 binding and release of stored Ca2+, the IP3 receptor would undergo a conformational change, which allows for its interaction with the capacitative Ca2+ channel, resulting in its opening. In the other proposal, a diffusible messenger, released and/or formed as a consequence of Ca2+ pool depletion, would stimulate the Ca2+ influx pathway to open. The first model implies a close physical interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane; on the other hand, such a direct interaction would not be required for a diffusible factor to act.In a previous report, we provided indirect evidence for a physical interaction between IP3 receptors and the plasma membrane that involved the actin cytoskeleton, and we speculated that this interaction might be important in signaling capacitative calcium entry (6Rossier M.F. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present studies were conducted to assess agonist- and thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i mobilization in NIH 3T3 cells under cytoskeletal-disrupting conditions. Whereas cytoskeletal disruption blocked agonist-induced Ca2+signaling, release of sequestered Ca2+ by thapsigargin and the resulting activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry were not affected, despite profound alterations in cellular structure and endoplasmic reticulum morphology. Thus, these data indicate that the coupling between Ca2+ pool depletion and capacitative Ca2+ entry does not depend on the cytoskeleton or on cell shape and suggest that signaling can occur without maintenance of a close proximity between intracellular stores and plasma membrane Ca2+ channels.RESULTSNIH 3T3 cells treated with vehicle, 10 μmcytochalasin D to depolymerize the actin microfilaments, or 10 μm nocodazole to disrupt the tubulin microtubules, were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig.1). Control cells were characterized as being flat, extended, and elongated, expressing a typical fibroblast phenotype (Fig. 1 A); on the other hand, both cytochalasin D and nocodazole induced significant alterations in cellular morphology, causing the cells to assume a spherical shape (Fig. 1, B andC, respectively). To confirm that cytochalasin D and nocodazole induced the predicted cytoskeletal disruptions, a double-labeling fluorescence protocol was used to stain the actin and the tubulin cytoskeletons (Fig. 2). The filamentous actin, as evidenced by the presence of stress fibers (red staining), as well as the microtubules (green staining) were found to be intact and distributed throughout the cytoplasm in control cells (Fig. 2 A); the tubulin stain, however, was more prominent in the cell periphery. Pretreatment with cytochalasin D (Fig.2 B) or nocodazole (Fig. 2 C) specifically depolymerized either the stress fibers or the microtubules, respectively. In the cytochalasin D-treated cells, the actin bundles were replaced by a punctate accumulation of actin in the cytoplasm; on the other hand, in the nocodazole-treated cells the depolymerized tubulin redistributed toward the cell periphery and also accumulated within surface blebs. Although disruption of either the actin or the tubulin cytoskeletons caused the cells to round up, a specific feature of the cytochalasin D treatment was the formation of cellular processes radiating from the cytoplasm, whereas the nocodazole-treated cells expressed cell surface blebs. This laboratory has recently reported that activation of protein kinase C by PMA promotes cell shape alterations as well as changes in Ca2+ storage capacity in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (8Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since protein kinase C activation can lead to actin depolymerization in some cells, including fibroblasts (11Rifkin D.B. Crowe R.M.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1067-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we also examined the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons in PMA-treated NIH 3T3 cells. Fig. 2 D confirms that activation of protein kinase C in these cells leads to disruption of actin fibers. Unlike cytochalasin D, PMA causes accumulation of depolymerized actin in the cell periphery, toward membrane ruffles. The integrity of the microtubules was not affected by PMA treatment as previously reported (12Schliwa M. Nakamura T. Porter K.R. Euteneuer U. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1045-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Figure 2Cytochalasin D or nocodazole treatment specifically disrupts the actin or the tubulin cytoskeleton, respectively, in NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO, control; A), cytochalasin D (B), nocodazole (C), or PMA (D) and double stained for actin (red) or tubulin (green) as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, Control fibroblasts express intact actin stress fibers and tubulin microtubules throughout the cytoplasm. B, cytochalasin D treatment promotes disruption of the stress fibers, with the depolymerized actin shown as a punctate cytoplasmic accumulation, but the microtubules are left intact.C, nocodazole disrupts the microtubules, resulting in accumulation of the depolymerized tubulin on the cell periphery and in surface blebs, without altering the stress fibers. D, in PMA-treated cells, the stress fibers are disrupted but the tubulin cytoskeleton is spared. However, contrary to the effect of cytochalasin D, the PMA-depolymerized actin accumulates in the cell periphery toward membrane ruffles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the effect of treatment with cytoskeletal-disrupting agents on [Ca2+] i mobilization. Only cells that expressed the spherical phenotype described above were selected for comparison with control fibroblasts. Fig.3 A depicts the Ca2+-mobilizing action of 1 mm adenosine triphosphate, ATP, an agonist that acts through purinergic receptors to couple to phospholipase Cβ activation. In control cells (Fig.3 A, solid line), ATP induced a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+] i . This action was completely abolished in cells pretreated with 10 μmcytochalasin D (Fig. 3 A, broken line). Activation of phospholipase Cγ by 50 ng/ml PDGF led, after a lag period of few hundred seconds, to a Ca2+ mobilization of longer duration compared with ATP in control cells (Fig. 3 B, solid line) as previously reported (8Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D also abolished the Ca2+response to PDGF (Fig. 3 B, broken line). Disruption of the tubulin network with nocodazole yielded similar results, with complete blockade of ATP- or PDGF-induced Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 3, C and D, control, solid lines; nocodazole, broken lines). The failure of cytoskeleton-disrupted cells to respond to phospholipase C-activating agonists was not due to a loss of Ca2+ stores, because 2 μm thapsigargin released Ca2+ in cytochalasin D- or nocodazole-treated cells to the same extent as in control (Fig. 4, A andB, respectively); moreover, in cytochalasin D- or nocodazole-treated cells, the kinetics of activation and the magnitude of capacitative Ca2+ entry after thapsigargin-induced pool depletion were indistinguishable from those in control cells (Fig. 4,A and B, control, solid lines; cytochalasin D or nocodazole, broken lines). These findings indicate that inhibition of agonist-promoted Ca2+mobilization by cytoskeletal disruption does not result from a diminished Ca2+ pool storage capacity or capacitative entry or from increased Ca2+ buffering. In addition, they demonstrate that the signaling mechanism for capacitative Ca2+ entry is not rigorously dependent on cell morphology or on the integrity of the cytoskeleton.Figure 3Disruption of the actin or the tubulin cytoskeleton blocks agonist-induced [Ca2+] i mobilization. NIH 3T3 cells grown on coverslips were treated with Me2SO (control), 10 μmcytochalasin D, or 10 μm nocodazole as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were loaded with fura-2/AM, and [Ca2+] i mobilization was assessed after addition of 1 mm ATP (panels A and C) or 50 ng/ml PDGF (panels B and D) in HPSS buffer containing 1.8 mm Ca2+.

Panel B, control, solid line; nocodazole, broken line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The failure of agonists to induce Ca2+ mobilization in cytoskeleton-disrupted cells could be accounted for by the following possibilities: (a) one or more of the steps involved in coupling cell surface receptor activation and phospholipase C stimulation may be affected by cytoskeletal disruption, the result being a failure of agonists to increase IP3 levels; (b) the activation of the IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum may be affected by cytoskeletal disruption, impairing IP3-induced pool depletion; (c) cytoskeletal disruption-induced cell shape changes may alter the spatial-temporal relationship between phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ pool depletion, resulting in diminished Ca2+ mobilization. To address the first possibility, PDGF-induced phospholipase C activation was investigated in control and cytochalasin D-treated cells. As shown in Fig.5, either PDGF or cytochalasin D pretreatment alone increased the levels of IP3 compared with control but, more importantly, when cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, the effect of PDGF on IP3 production was not blocked and was, if anything, augmented. 2The data shown in Fig. 5 represent the IP3 fraction from Dowex separations of inositol polyphosphates, and thus include both the 1,4,5 and 1,3,4 isomers of IP3. It is unlikely that the increases due to PDGF, cytochalasin D, or the combination of the two represent significant net increases in cellular content of IP3; we have previously shown that the increase of this isomer is too small in NIH 3T3 cells to be statistically detectable against the sizable background of basal IP3, whether assayed by high performance liquid chromatography-resolved radiolabeled inositol polyphosphates, or be mass assay of IP3 (25Lobaugh L.A. Eisfelder B. Gibson K. Johnson G.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar). We note that in addition to increases in the IP3 fraction from the Dowex columns, the fractions containing isomers of inositol diphosphate and of inositol tetraphosphate, were also significantly increased by PDGF, and in each case this was not prevented by treatment with cytochalasin D. This suggested that the coupling between agonist receptor activation and phospholipase C stimulation was not affected by cytoskeletal disruption. These results are in agreement with studies in mast cells showing that actin or tubulin depolymerization did not inhibit agonist-increased IP3 levels (14Tasaka K. Mio M. Fujisawa K. Aoki I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Figure 5Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton does not block agonist-induced IP3 formation. NIH 3T3 cells were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol, treated with Me2SO or 10 μm cytochalasin D, followed by addition of 50 ng/ml PDGF or vehicle. Accumulation of inositol phosphates was assessed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Depicted is the effect of cytochalasin D and PDGF on IP3levels, but similar results were obtained for the IP3metabolites, inositol diphosphate and tetraphosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The possibility that the function of the IP3 receptor could have been depressed by cytoskeletal disruption was addressed by experiments such as the one shown in Fig.6. Fig. 6 A (solid line) shows that microinjection of a single control NIH 3T3 cell incubated in nominally Ca2+-free buffer with a maximal Ca2+-mobilizing concentration (1 mm pipette concentration) of the nonhydrolyzable IP3 analogue, (2,4,5)IP3, led to a rapid and transient Ca2+mobilization as previously reported (8Ribeiro C.M.P.

Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); pretreatment with cytochalasin D did not affect this response (Fig. 6 A,broken line). Likewise, the Ca2+-mobilizing action of a submaximal concentration (1 μm pipette concentration) of (2,4,5)IP3 was the same in control and cytochalasin D-treated cells (Fig. 6 B, control, solid line; cytochalasin D, broken line). To confirm that the Ca2+ stores were only partially depleted by the lower concentration of (2,4,5)IP3, 2 μmthapsigargin was subsequently applied; again, there was no difference in the response to thapsigargin in cytochalasin D-treatedversus control cells (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the ability of the IP3 receptor to bind IP3 and release Ca2+ was not altered by cytoskeletal disruption.Figure 6Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton does not block Ca2+ release induced by the nonhydrolyzable analog (2,4,5)IP3. NIH 3T3 cells grown on coverslips were treated with Me2SO (control) or 10 μm cytochalasin D (dashed line) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were previously loaded with fura-2/AM to allow for the measurement of basal [Ca2+] i and subsequently microinjected in nominally Ca2+ free HPSS buffer with 2 mmfura-2 plus 1 mm or 1 μm(2,4,5)IP3 (pipette concentration; A andB, respectively) to assess Ca2+ release. Addition of 2 μm thapsigargin promoted an additional Ca2+ release in cells injected with the lower (panel B) but not with the higher (panel A; not shown) dose of (2,4,5)IP3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since we found no evidence for alterations in the formation or action of IP3 under cytoskeletal-dismantled conditions, we tentatively concluded that the cell shape changes induced by cytochalasin D or nocodazole were altering the spatial relationship between phospholipase C and IP3 receptors, impairing phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Thus, we next investigated the effect of cytoskeletal depolymerization on the cellular distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum. To localize the endoplasmic reticulum in control and cytoskeleton-disrupted cells, this organelle was labeled in fixed cells with the fluorescent dihexaoxacarbocyanine dye, DIOC6(3), as previously reported (10Terasaki M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 29: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By abolishing the mitochondrial membrane potential, cell fixation resulted in better labeling of the endoplasmic reticulum. Fig.7 illustrates the fluorescent staining of the endoplasmic reticulum (orange) superimposed with the differential interference contrast image (green) in control (left) or cytochalasin D-treated (right) cells (DIOC6(3) images were ∼ 1 μm thick). In control cells, the endoplasmic reticulum appeared to be spread throughout the cytoplasm, although in the interior regions of the cells some labeling of mitochondria undoubtedly occurs, confusing the interpretation of the images. However, in the flattened regions in the cell periphery, single tubule-like structures were observed and confirmed to correspond to ribosome-studded endoplasmic reticulum in electron micrographs (not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton caused the cells to round up, and thus the flattened cellular regions containing diffuse endoplasmic reticulum strands were retracted into the more compacted cells. Although it is not possible from such images to determine the precise relationship between endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane effectors, it is nonetheless clear that the shape of the endoplasmic reticulum is dramatically changed in cytochalasin D-treated cells, at the very least to accommodate the drastic changes in cell shape. Thus, it is possible that this severe rearrangement of endoplasmic reticulum membranes alters the spatial relationship between the site for phospholipase C generation of IP3 and IP3-sensitive sites on the endoplasmic reticulum.Figure 7The endoplasmic reticulum is significantly rearranged after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with vehicle or 10 μm cytochalasin D for 60 min, fixed with glutaraldehyde and stained with DIOC6(3) as described under “Materials and Methods.”Left panel, the DIOC6(3) stain in control cells;right panel, the fluorescent staining pattern is significantly altered after cytochalasin D treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious work from this laboratory provided evidence that the IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum are linked to the plasma membrane through the actin cytoskeleton (6Rossier M.F. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As a result, investigators from this laboratory (6Rossier M.F. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and elsewhere (5Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 16Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) have suggested that the communication between endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane involved in signaling capacitative Ca2+entry might depend on a structural connection between these two cellular sites. Thus, in the present work we investigated the effects of disruption of the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons on [Ca2+] i signaling in NIH 3T3 cells. Disruption of actin microfilaments with cytochalasin D or tubulin microtubules with nocodazole resulted in profound alterations of both cell morphology and physiology. Depolymerization of either the actin or tubulin networks caused the cells to assume a spherical shape in contrast to the planar, extended, and elongated control fibroblasts (Fig. 1). The specificity of the cytoskeleton-disrupting agents was confirmed by the use of a double-label fluorescence staining protocol; in the cytochalasin D-treated cells only the actin stress fibers were dismantled, with the microtubules left intact, whereas in the nocodazole-treated fibroblasts the microtubules were disrupted but the stress fibers were undisturbed (Fig. 2). When hormones coupled to either phospholipase Cβ or phospholipase Cγ activation were tested for their ability to mobilize [Ca2+] i under the same cytoskeletal-disrupting conditions, it was found that agonist action was completely blocked (Fig. 3). This inhibition of agonist-induced [Ca2+] i signaling appeared to be a general effect of cytoskeletal disruption and/or cell shape change, because it could be induced by depolymerization of either the actin or the tubulin network.In contrast to the effects on agonist-induced [Ca2+] i signaling, neither the release nor the entry of Ca2+ in response to thapsigargin was significantly affected by cytoskeletal disruption. These findings rule out a number of causes for the block of the agonist response, including a loss of Ca2+ stores, or augmented Ca2+ buffering by Ca2+ pumps. Additionally, the failure of cytoskeletal disruption to affect thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry indicates that neither an intact cytoskeleton nor cytoskeletal-dependent processes are required for activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry.We also include data demonstrating disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by PMA. In an earlier work, we demonstrated that pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with PMA led to a significant loss of stored calcium without activation of capacitative calcium entry (8Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the PMA pretreatment also caused the cells to round up and protein kinase C activation in fibroblasts can disrupt actin microfilaments (11Rifkin D.B. Crowe R.M. Cell. 1979; 18: 361-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Schliwa M. Nakamura T. Porter K.R. Euteneuer U. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1045-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Hedberg K.K. Birrell G.B. Griffith O.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1067-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we speculated that PMA-induced calcium store loss may be a result of cytoskeletal rearrangement. The present studies confirmed that protein kinase C activation by PMA disrupts the actin stress fibers in NIH 3T3 cells; however, since dismantling of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D did not affect calcium pool storage capacity (even though the alteration of cellular shape due to cytochalasin D was more dramatic compared with PMA), we suggest that our earlier reported finding on the effect of PMA on calcium stores is independent of cytoskeletal rearrangement or cell shape. Furthermore, as reported in our earlier investigation (8Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with PMA seemed to fragment the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas in the present work cytochalasin D appeared to induce a rearrangement rather than a fragmentation of this organelle.The blockade of agonist-induced mobilization of Ca2+ by cytoskeletal disruption was not a result of decreased phospholipase C activity as shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly, cytochalasin D treatment increased cellular levels of IP3 (Fig. 5), but the mechanism for this effect is not known. It is known, however, that monomeric actin-binding proteins"
https://openalex.org/W1975426967,"We used purified mammalian topoisomerases I (top1) and oligonucleotides containing a unique top1 cleavage site to study top1-mediated cleavage and recombination in the presence of nicks and short gaps mimicking DNA damage. In general, top1 cleavage was not induced opposite to the nicks, and nicks upstream from the top1 cleavage site suppressed top1 activity. Irreversible top1 cleavage complexes (“suicide products” or “aborted complexes”) were produced in DNA containing nicks or short gaps just opposite to the normal top1 cleavage site. Camptothecin enhanced the formation of the aborted top1 complexes only for nicks downstream from the cleavage site. These aborted (suicide) complexes can mediate DNA recombination and promote illegitimate recombination by catalyzing the ligation of nonhomologous DNA fragments (acceptors). We report for the first time that top1-mediated recombination is greatly enhanced by the presence of a phosphate at the 5′ terminus of the top1 aborted complex (donor DNA). By contrast, phosphorylation of the 3′ terminus of the gap did not affect recombination. At concentrations that strongly enhanced inhibition of intramolecular religation, resulting in an increase of top1 cleavable complexes, camptothecin did not reduce recombination (intermolecular religation). Nicks or gaps with 5′-phosphate termini would be expected to be produced directly by ionizing radiations or by processing of abasic sites and DNA lesions induced by carcinogens or drugs used in cancer chemotherapy. Thus, these results further demonstrate that DNA damage can efficiently trap top1-cleavable complexes and enhance top1-mediated DNA recombination.

DNA rearrangements such as deletions, translocations, inversions, or gene amplifications are involved in genetic diseases and carcinogenesis (1Stark G.R. Debatisse M. Giulotto E. Wahl G.M.

These modifications are based on the cell's ability to promote recombinations. This process can be initiated after exposure to exogenous DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiations, environmental carcinogens, and drugs used in cancer chemotherapy (5Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Even though their molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, two types of recombinations have been described depending on the homology of the DNA molecules joined. In eukaryotes, the nonhomologous (or illegitimate) recombination occurs more frequently than the homologous (or legitimate) recombination (6Roth D. Wilson J. Kucherlapatti R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 621-653Google Scholar). Topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in multiple processes including replication, transcription, chromosome segregation, and recombinations (7Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

DNA topoisomerase I (top1) 1The abbreviations used are: top1, topoisomerase I; CPT, camptothecin; DTT, dithiothreitol. acts as a monomer and creates transient DNA single-strand breaks via the formation of a covalent bond between the 3′-phosphate of the cleaved strand and a tyrosine residue of the enzyme. Under physiological conditions, these intermediates are referred to as cleavable complexes. The cleavable complexes are readily reversible by top1-mediated religation of the 5′-hydroxyl termini (7Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

We recently reported that top1 can be trapped irreversibly by common DNA endogenous lesions such as DNA mismatches and abasic sites (21Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M.

Previous studies also reported that nicks in the vicinity of the top1 cleavage site were able to generate double-strand breaks, leading to suicide or aborted products, where covalently bound top1 is able to religate various nonhomologous acceptors bearing a 5′-hydroxyl terminus and thus participates into illegitimate recombination (10Champoux J.J.

In this study, we used purified mammalian top1 and DNA oligonucleotides containing a unique top1 cleavage site derived from the rDNA sequence of Tetrahymena (25Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F.

Such nicks and gaps mimic endogenous DNA lesions or modifications resulting from DNA damage (such as ionizing radiations) or DNA repair (base elimination or excision). Such lesions were introduced at various positions relative to the top1-mediated cleavage site in the oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 1. The results demonstrate for the first time the importance of a phosphate at the 5′ terminus of the DNA break opposite to the top1 linkage for top1-mediated recombinations. We also report the influence of DNA nicks on CPT activity and discuss these results in the context of the known potentiating effect of ionizing radiations on camptothecin activity. High performance liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). [α-32P]Cordycepin 5′-triphosphate was purchased from NEN Life Science Products; polyacrylamide was from Bio-Rad. Camptothecin (CPT) was provided by Drs. Wani and Wall (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). 10 mm aliquots of CPT were stored at −20 °C, thawed, and diluted to 1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide just before use. 3′ labeling was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with [α-32P]cordycepin as described previously (27Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides with a phosphate group on the 3′ end were directly obtained from The Midland Certified Reagent Company. 5′ phosphorylation was performed using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase from Life Technologies, Inc. in the presence of 1 mmATP for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped by a 10-min incubation at 70 °C. All reaction mixtures were subsequently centrifuged through a G-25 Sephadex column to remove excess unincorporated nucleotide. Radiolabeled single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to the same concentration of unlabeled complementary strands in 1 × annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) to create nicks or gaps as indicated by the sequences shown in the figures. Reaction mixtures were heated to 95 °C and slowly chilled overnight to room temperature. The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged through a G-25 Sephadex column and used in the top1 reactions. Overexpression of the human recombinant top1 was performed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus virus construct containing the top1 full-length cDNA (28Zhelkovsky A.M. Moore C.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. 0.8 × 106 Sf9 cells were infected with 2 ml of virus suspension (final volume 20 ml). Four days later, cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were lysed in buffer RSB1 (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), vortexed vigorously for 1 min, and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min. Pellets were washed four additional times: once with RSB1, twice with RSB2 (1 volume of RSB1 + 1 volume of 1% Tween 20 + 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate), followed by another wash with RSB1. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of HSB buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and submitted to a centrifugation at 113,308 × g for 90 min. Supernatants were submitted to a 3-h dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT. Then dialysate was centrifuged for 4 min at 16,000 ×g, and the nuclear extracts (supernatants) were stored at −80 °C. Human top1 amino terminus is known to be histidine-rich. For this reason, top1 was purified from nuclear extract using Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). 50 μl of beads were placed into microfuge tubes and washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 50 mm KCl). 500 μl of nuclear extract were incubated with beads for 30 min at 4 °C and washed two times with 300 μl of the wash buffer. Insect cells top1 was eluted with wash buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. Human recombinant top1 was eluted with wash buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and dialysed for 3 h with 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT. Bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml) and glycerol (30% v/v) were added to the purified top1, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. DNA substrates (approximately 50 fmol/reaction) were incubated with 5 units of calf thymus or with human recombinant top1 for 15 min at 25 °C with or without CPT in standard reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were stopped by adding either SDS (final concentration 0.5%) or NaCl (unless otherwise indicated, 0.5 m for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 0.5% SDS). Time course reactions were conducted in the same conditions and stopped with 0.5% SDS. Intramolecular religation experiments were performed using the full-duplex oligonucleotide (see Figs. 1 and 6 A), which was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of CPT and stopped with 0.5% SDS. The intermolecular religation experiments were performed in the presence of 0.2 pmol of cold oligonucleotide bearing a one-base gap at the +1 position (see Fig. 4 C and sequence in Fig. 6 B) in the presence of the same amount of a 3′-labeled 23-mer blunt-ended oligonucleotide as an acceptor and increasing concentrations of CPT for 2 h.Figure 4Effect of phosphorylation at the ends of the DNA gap opposite to the top1 cleavage site.

Imaging and quantitations were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nicks were introduced at various positions in the non-scissile strand of the oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 1. Nicks at positions −5/−4 and −4/3 suppressed top1-induced cleavage even in the presence of CPT (Fig. 2 A). Top1 cleavage was also decreased by the nick at position −3/−2. These results are consistent with the effects of uracil and abasic site incorporations at these positions (21Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and confirm the importance of DNA-top1 interactions in this upstream (5′) region of the DNA substrate for top1 activity. Nicks at position −1/+1 and +1/+2 enhanced top1-mediated DNA cleavage independently of CPT (26- and 13-fold, respectively). When a nick was present at the −2/−1 position, cleavage at the normal cleavage site was suppressed, but cleavage two bases upstream (Fig. 2, open arrowhead) was observed. Cleavage was not reversed by salt for nicks at positions −1/+1 and +1/+2 and was partially reversed for nick at position −2/−1 (Fig. 2, see lanes 3 and 5for the corresponding panels). These results are consistent with the formation of double-strand breaks associated with suicide (or aborted) top1 intermediate when top1 cleavage occurs opposite to a nick. When nicks were introduced more downstream (3′) from the expected top1 cleavage site, from positions +2 to +6, salt-resistant top1-mediated DNA cleavage was induced by CPT (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5). Therefore, nicks at these positions enhanced CPT activity and were converted to double-strand breaks (and suicide products) in the presence of CPT. Processing of physiological, environmental, or pharmacological DNA damage frequently leads to loss of bases. In the case of ionizing radiation or abasic site processing, DNA termini are usually 5′-phosphates and 3′-phosphates or phosphoglycolates (5Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of such termini on top1 activity, we used three different oligonucleotide substrates containing either a nick in −1/+1 position, a one-base gap (base +1), or a two-base gap (bases +1 and +2). And we compared top1 activity in such oligonucleotides bearing either a phosphate or an hydroxyl group at the 5′ terminus (Fig.3). When a hydroxyl was present at the 5′ terminus, top1-mediated cleavage at the predicted site was greatly enhanced and was salt-resistant for the oligonucleotides containing a nick and a one-base gap (Fig. 3,arrowhead). However, cleavage was suppressed for the two-base gap oligonucleotide bearing a 5′-hydroxyl. The presence of a phosphate at the 5′ terminus increased top1 cleavage in the oligonucleotides with a nick or a one-base gap. 5′ end phosphorylation restored top1 cleavage activity for the two-base gap oligonucleotide, probably by repositioning the enzyme on the DNA recognition site (Fig.3, far right panel; see “Discussion”). In all cases, cleavage was irreversible and led to suicide products and DNA double-strand breaks (Fig. 3, compare lane 2 with lane 3). Interestingly, presence of a phosphate at the 5′ terminus markedly stimulated the formation of top1-mediated recombination products with all three substrates (Fig. 3, R band). To determine the effect of 3′ end phosphorylation on top1-mediated cleavage and recombination, the one-base gap oligonucleotide was used as a substrate with the four different combinations for phosphorylation of the DNA termini (Fig. 4). Recombination was readily detected when a phosphate was present at the 5′ terminus of the gap (same result as Fig. 3), and several products of different sizes were detected. By contrast, presence of hydroxyl or phosphate at the 3′ end of the gap had no effect on top1 activities. Taken together, these results indicate that a phosphate at the 5′ end of a gap mimicking DNA damage or DNA repair intermediates increases both the cleavage and the recombinogenic activity of top1. To further characterize the nature of the different recombination products, a time course was performed with the one-base gap oligonucleotide containing a phosphate at the 5′ end (see Fig. 4). As shown in Fig.5 A, appearance of the recombination products was time-dependent and increased more slowly than the cleavage product. The first recombination product (51-mer) was detectable after a 1-min reaction, whereas the 65-mer recombination product was clearly observed after a 30-min reaction and the 79-mer product, after 1 h. To determine the mechanism of the recombination, the bands were excised from the sequencing gel after 4 h reaction and submitted to purine sequencing (29Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are shown in Fig. 5 B, and a scheme of the putative mechanism leading to the recombination products is presented in Fig.5 C. Arrow 1 (panels B andC) indicates the intermolecular junctions between the 14-mer (donor) top1-linked DNA fragment generated after cleavage of the 37-mer substrate and the 5′ terminus of another uncleaved oligonucleotide (acceptor). The 51-mer resulting product can then serve as a new acceptor and be religated to a second donor, giving rise to the 65-mer product (Fig. 5, B and C, arrow 2). In agreement with this recombination scheme, we did not observe any recombinant when the 5′ terminus of the scissile strand was phosphorylated (data not shown). We further tested whether CPT affected top1-mediated DNA recombination, as it is able to inhibit intramolecular religation (9Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 30Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 94: 194-218Google Scholar). For this purpose, we compared the inhibition of intra- and intermolecular religation using increasing concentrations of CPT (Fig. 6). As expected, inhibition of intramolecular religation occurred with low CPT concentrations, resulting in an increase of top1 cleavage (Fig.6 A). To test the effect of CPT on intermolecular religation, we used an unlabeled donor containing the one-base gap (see Fig. 4) with a 5′-phosphate and incubated this substrate with top1 in the presence of a 3′-labeled 23-mer blunt-end acceptor and increasing concentrations of CPT (Fig. 6 B). High concentrations of CPT were required to inhibit intermolecular recombination. Both intra- and intermolecular religation products were quantified, expressed as the percentage of the highest rate of religation obtained, and plotted as a function of CPT concentration (Fig. 6 C). Complete inhibition of intramolecular religation was observed between 0.3 and 1 μm CPT. By contrast, in this concentration range, intermolecular religation was not significantly inhibited. Inhibition of intermolecular religation required much higher concentrations of CPT, such as 10–100 μm. Previous experiments using a partial double-stranded top1·DNA post-cleavage complex also demonstrated that CPT concentrations in excess of 1 μmwere required for inhibition of religation of an exogenous scissile strand (27Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, these data are consistent with the selective binding of CPT at the enzyme-DNA interface and with its interaction with the +1 base pair 3′ to the top1 cleavage site (25Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1339-1346PubMed Google Scholar). Nicks and single-base gaps are frequent DNA lesions that can arise from both spontaneous and environmental DNA modifications. Nicks can be produced directly by ionizing radiations, and single-base loss can result from base mismatch, uracil misincorporation, or modified base processing via the base excision repair pathway. After recognition by a specific DNA glycosylase, misincorporated or modified bases are processed into abasic sites, which upon conversion by AP endonucleases, lead to base elimination (5Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of nicks and gaps on top1 activity by studying the effects of such DNA lesions as a function of their position relative to a preexisting top1 site. A first conclusion is that the presence of nicks does not appear to induce novel top1 sites opposite to the nicks. This result is consistent with an earlier study (23McCoubrey W.K. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5130-5137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using plasmid DNA and probability calculations showing that the conversion of nicks to double-strand breaks by eukaryotic top1 was due to the random distribution of the top1-cleavable complexes rather than to the induction of top1 breaks by the preexisting nicks. A second conclusion of the present study is that nicks immediately upstream (5′) (between positions −5 and −3) from a preexisting top1 site abolish top1 activity. This observation is consistent with our previous findings that top1-cleavable complexes are suppressed by DNA mismatches and abasic sites within the first 4 bases immediately upstream to the top1 cleavage site (21Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and by cytosine methylation at the −3 position (32Leteurtre F. Kohlhagen G. Fesen M.R. Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7893-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the base sequence preference for top1 cleavage also indicates a strong preference for 4 base pairs immediately upstream (5′) of the top1 cleavage site (29Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Together, these observations indicate that DNA structure including DNA backbone integrity immediately upstream from the top1 cleavage site is critical for enzyme activity (34Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Google Scholar, 36Stevnsner T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Conversion of the nicks or short gaps into a DNA double-strand break by top1 was consistently observed for nicks at positions −1/+1 and +1/+2 (opposite from the preexisting top1 site) and when the +1 base was removed opposite to the cleavage site (one-base gap oligonucleotide). Such double-strand breaks represent a unique type of DNA damage, as top1 remains covalently attached to the 3′ DNA terminus as an aborted (suicide) intermediate. Thus, our data further demonstrate that top1 can be trapped by DNA damage. Recently, trapping of top1 by DNA mismatches, abasic sites (21Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and UV damage (38Lanza A. Tornatelli S. Rodolfo C. Scanavini M.C. Pedrini A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6978-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) has also been reported. At the present time, it is not known whether such a trapping is part of DNA repair (39Yeh Y.-C. Liu H.-F. Ellis C.A. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15498-15504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cell death pathways. Top1 suicide (or aborted product) is a very efficient donor for the religation of an exogenous DNA duplex bearing a 5′-hydroxyl end (Figs. 3, 4, 5) (12Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16755-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Christiansen K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Bullock P.

Religation of blunt-ended DNA duplex molecules is not influenced by the terminal sequence of the acceptor (13Christiansen K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these data further demonstrate that top1-mediated intermolecular religation can produce illegitimate recombination. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the efficiency of the intermolecular religation (recombination) is markedly enhanced by the presence of a phosphate group at the 5′ terminus of the break or gap opposite from the top1 linkage. This is physiologically relevant, as damaged DNA with nicks or gaps generally exhibits 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini. For example, nicks and gaps induced by ionizing radiations are usually 5′-phosphate and 3′-phosphate or phosphoglycolate (5Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Thus, taking into account the high frequency of top1 sites in most genes (for instance see Ref. 33Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), our study suggests that by random occurrence a fraction of the top1-cleavable complexes might be converted into DNA double-strand breaks and aborted (suicide) top1 intermediates with high recombinogenic potential in the presence of DNA-damaging agents that lead to backbone interruptions. Secondly, from an enzyme-DNA interaction standpoint, the fact that the −1/+1 phosphate opposite from the top1–DNA covalent bond facilitates top1 cleavage, and intermolecular religations suggests that this phosphate is involved in the interaction between the enzyme and the DNA. Further evidence for a structural role of this −1/+1 phosphate can be inferred from the observation that its removal inhibits top1 cleavage in the oligonucleotide with a two-base gap 3′ to the cleavage site (Fig. 3). Transcription bypass by T7 RNA polymerase has also been shown to be sensitive to the phosphorylation of the termini of the gapped DNA template (41Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, the present study provides further insights for the molecular interactions of camptothecin with top1. This is the first report showing that nicks downstream (between bases +2 and +5) from a top1 site can convert camptothecin-induced reversible cleavable complexes into DNA double-strand breaks and abortive (suicide) intermediates. Since this effect was not detectable in the absence of camptothecin, it seems plausible that camptothecin destabilizes the DNA immediately downstream (3′) from the top1 cleavage site. This would be consistent with the selective binding of camptothecin at the enzyme-DNA interface (25Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Fujimori A. Harker W.G. Kohlhagen G. Hoki Y. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1339-1346PubMed Google Scholar) and with its interaction with the +1 base pair immediately flanking the cleavage site (29Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the +1 base pair for camptothecin binding inside the top1-cleavable complexes is further supported by the present data showing that camptothecin is markedly more potent for inhibition of intramolecular versusintermolecular religation. The low efficiency of camptothecin for inhibition of the intermolecular religation could be due to the inefficient interaction of camptothecin with DNA·enzyme complexes lacking the +1 base pair. The present results may help to explain the synergism between ionizing radiations and camptothecin derivatives (42Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar,43Chen A.Y. Okunieff P. Pommier Y. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1529-1536PubMed Google Scholar) and contribute to a better understanding of the mutagenic effects of top1 in the absence and presence of camptothecin and its derivatives (44Anderson R.D.

https://openalex.org/W1968191899,"The targeting of karyophilic proteins to nuclear pores is mediated via the formation of a nuclear pore-targeting complex, through the interaction of nuclear localization signal (NLS) with its NLS receptor. Recently, a novel human protein, Qip1, was identified from a yeast two-hybrid system with DNA helicase Q1. This study demonstrates that Qip1 is a novel third class of NLS receptor that efficiently recognizes the NLS of the helicase Q1. Moreover, the data obtained in this study show that the specific interaction between Qip1 and the NLS of the helicase Q1 requires its upstream sequence of the minimal essential NLS. By using purified recombinant proteins alone in the digitonin-permeabilized cell-free transport system, it was demonstrated that the two known human NLS receptors, Rch1 and NPI-1, are able to transport all the tested NLS substrates into the nucleus, while Qip1 most efficiently transports the helicase Q1-NLS substrates, which contain its upstream sequence in so far as we have examined the system. Furthermore, in HeLa cell crude cytosol, it was found that endogenous Rch1 binds to all the tested NLS substrates, while the binding of endogenous NPI-1 is restricted to only some NLSs, despite the fact that NPI-1 itself shows binding activity to a variety of NLSs. These results indicate that at least three structurally and functionally distinct NLS receptors exist in the human single cell population, and suggest that the nuclear import of karyophilic proteins may be controlled in a complex manner at the NLS recognition step by the existence of a variety of NLS receptors with various specificities to each NLS.

In eukaryotic cells, the selective transport of karyophilic proteins to the nuclei is mediated by short amino acid sequences, which are commonly referred to as nuclear localization signals (NLSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PTAC, pore-targeting complex; MDBK, Madin-Darby bovine kidney; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bBSA, biotinylated BSA; APC, allophycocyanin; DTT, dithiothreitol; TB, transport buffer. and which are characteristically rich in basic amino acids (1Dingwall C.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). NLSs can be classified into two major groups. The first is a single type containing 3–5 basic amino acids with the weak consensus Lys-Arg/Lys-X-Arg/Lys, which is similar to the simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 T) NLS. The other is a bipartite type NLS containing two clusters of basic regions of 3–4 residues, each separated by approximately 10 amino acids, similar to nucleoplasmin NLS. The NLS functions at various positions within the protein and is capable of directing a non-karyophilic protein into nuclei when conjugated genetically or chemically (4Yoneda Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1996; 59: 97-107Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the NLS-mediated nuclear transport of karyophilic proteins occurs in at least two steps (5Newmeyer D.D. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 6Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C.

The first step is the NLS-dependent, but energy- and temperature-independent, binding to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. The second step is an energy and temperature-dependent translocation through the nuclear pore complex. In earlier studies, we found that a karyophilic protein forms a stable complex, the nuclear pore-targeting complex (PTAC) in the cytoplasm to target nuclear pores (4Yoneda Y. Arch. Histol.

The complex consists of a karyophilic protein and two essential factors, PTAC58 and PTAC97, which were originally isolated from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. PTAC58, also named mouse pendulin, directly recognizes the NLS (9Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y.

In the Ran-mediated translocation step, although importin-α enters the nucleus together with the cargo, importin-β remains on the nuclear envelope, suggesting that the two subunits of importin dissociate during the import reaction (32Moroianu J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It has been clearly demonstrated that guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by Ran is required for the translocation step, but the exact mechanism of translocation remains unclear (34Melchior F.

Although, for example, two major groups, Rch1 and NPI-1, are found in the human single cell population, the number of groups that exist in the same species and the variety of NLS receptors that are actually required for the nuclear transport remains unknown. Further, if the variety is essential for cellular functions, then it is essential to know whether each isoform recognizes different classes of NLSs and how each one distinguishes the NLSs in the cytoplasm. Recently, it was shown by Northern blot analysis that mouse pendulin/PTAC58 is very highly expressed in thymus, spleen, and heart (37Prieve M.G. Guttridge K.L. Munguia J.E. Waterman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7654-7658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the expression of the isoform is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, although the physiological significance for the tissue-specific expression is presently unknown. More recently, consistent with these results, it was found that Rch1/hSRP1α and NPI-1/hSRP1 are differentially expressed in various human leukocyte cell lines and can be induced in normal human peripheral lymphocytes (38Nadler S.G.

Very recently, a novel human protein, named DNA helicase Q1-interacting protein 1 (Qip1; GenBank accession number AB002533) was identified by using a yeast two-hybrid system with DNA helicase Q1 (39Seki T.

Since Qip1 has Armadillo repeating motifs in its primary structure and shows about 50% amino acid identity to both Rch1 and NPI-1, it was suspected to be a third class of human NLS receptor. In this study, we demonstrate that Qip1 is, in fact, a novel third class of human NLS receptor, which efficiently recognizes the NLS of DNA helicase Q1. Further, we found that the recognition of helicase Q1-NLS by Qip1 requires the upstream amino acid sequences of helicase Q1-NLS as well as a single basic amino acid cluster of the NLS itself. Moreover, we found that PTAC58 (∼Rch1) interacts with all the NLSs tested, but NPI-1 can interact with only limited types of NLSs, as evidenced by solution binding assays of the crude cytosol. In contrast, NPI-1 showed binding ability for all the tested NLSs when the solution binding assays were performed using recombinant proteins alone. These findings provide evidence that at least three distinct classes of NLS receptors exist in human cells, each of which shows NLS recognition in a different manner. The results suggest that a regulatory mechanism may exist for nuclear transport of karyophilic proteins at the NLS recognition step, and that the binding of some NLS receptors to particular NLSs may be controlled by other cytosolic proteins. Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). Synthetic peptides used in this study are listed in Table I. ShortT has only the minimal essential sequence of SV40 T-antigen NLS, while LongT contains the NLS minimal sequence of SV40 T-antigen and its upstream 17 amino acids. ReverseT contains the amino acid sequence of ShortT, but arranged in the reverse order, and was used as a transport-negative control. ShortQ1 has the C-terminal 15 amino acids of DNA helicase Q1, which contain its C-terminal basic amino acid cluster, while LongQ1 contains the C-terminal 27 amino acids, including the ShortQ1 sequence and its upstream 12 amino acids. LongQ1(KK-AA) has amino acid substitutions (K625,626A) of LongQ1 as shown in Table I. UpstreamQ1 has the same sequence as LongQ1, but lacks the C-terminal 10 amino acids. CBP80 has the bipartite type NLSs of a nuclear CAP-binding protein 80 (14Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 45Izaurralde E.

Q1/T has UpstreamQ1 sequence, combined with the minimal essential sequence of SV40 T-antigen NLS, and its most C-terminal 3 amino acids are the same as helicase Q1. N-terminal cysteine and tyrosine residues were added for the chemical coupling reaction with Sulfo-SMPB (Pierce). To protect cysteine from histidine attack to the N terminus, the cysteine residue of LongT or CBP80 had glycine added or was N-acetylated, respectively.

All the conjugates contained 5–9 peptides/carrier molecule, as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Qip1 constructed into pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), was expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Qip1 in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The E. coli cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to a density ofA 550 = 1.0. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, followed by incubation for 12 h at 20 °C. Lysis of bacteria and purification of the fusion protein with glutathione-Sepharose were performed as described previously (8Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol.

The GST portion of chimeras was cleaved by incubation for 2 h at 25 °C with 1 NIH unit of thrombin/100 μg of chimeras. GST and thrombin were separated from recombinant proteins by ion-exchange chromatography (MonoQ) column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1.0m NaCl in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and checked on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 100 mm CH3COOK, 2 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A.

HeLa S3 cells were grown in culture medium (RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3) using a spinner flask (Bellco). When the cell concentration of HeLa cells reached 5 × 105 cells/ml, they were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2), and washed once in washing buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm CH3COOK, 2 mm DTT). They were then homogenized with lysis buffer (5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3, 10 mm CH3COOK, 2 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml cytochalasin B, 1 mm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A).

Anti-Qip1 antibodies were purified independently from antiserum of each rabbit, by passage over GST-Qip1 immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose with glutaraldehyde. Antibodies bound to Qip1-Sepharose were eluted with 100 mmglycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and neutralized. After dialysis against phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 300 mm NaCl, the purified antibodies were concentrated in a Micro Centricon 30. Anti-PTAC58 and anti-NPI-1 antibodies were purified as described previously (9Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y.

MDBK cells were plated on marked coverslips, and microinjection experiments of DNA helicase Q1-related peptide-bBSA (1 mg/ml) were performed as described previously (46Yoneda Y. Arioka T.

After injection into the cytoplasm and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 3.7% HCHO in phosphate-buffered saline. The injected biotinylated peptide conjugates were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (Pierce). Ten μl of each peptide-conjugated bBSA (1 mg/ml) was immobilized on 15 μl of avidin-agarose gel, and mixed with affinity-purified recombinant GST-PTAC97 (100 pmol) in addition to GST-Qip1, GST-PTAC58, or GST-NPI-1 (100 pmol), respectively, and the total reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl with TB. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, materials bound to the immobilized peptide conjugates were washed with TB, and eluted with elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Each NLS receptor immobilized peptide conjugate analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PTAC58, anti-NPI-1, or anti-Qip1 antibodies. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (9Imamoto N.

One ml of HeLa cell cytosol (8 mg/ml) containing a final concentration of 2 μg/ml cytochalasin B was added to 10 μl of peptide-bBSA conjugates (1 mg/ml), and the mixture was incubated with 15 μl of avidin-agarose gel for 1 h at 4 °C. After the agarose was washed with TB, the bound proteins were eluted with incubation with elution buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. NLS receptors bound to immobilized NLS substrates were detected by anti-NLS receptor antibodies. Digitonin-permeabilized MDBK cells were prepared as described previously (8Imamoto N. Tachibana T.

The 10-μl sample solution contained 1 μl of peptide-APC conjugate (1 mg/ml) and appropriate transport factors were diluted with TB. For the nuclear-binding (first step) assay, the incubation was performed on ice for 20 min in the presence of each NLS receptor (7 pmol) and PTAC97 (6 pmol), the concentration of which was adjusted with TB containing 2% BSA. For the nuclear import (second step) assay, the incubation was performed at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of each NLS receptor (7 pmol), PTAC97 (6 pmol), GDP-Ran (42 pmol), p10/NTF2 (14 pmol), 1 mm ATP, ATP regeneration system (20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate), and 1 mm GTP, the concentration of which was adjusted with TB containing 2% BSA. After incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% HCHO in TB. Peptide-APC conjugates were detected by Axiophoto microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To determine whether Qip1 actually functions as an NLS receptor, we first attempted to determine the NLS of DNA helicase Q1. Based on the observation that Qip1 failed to bind DNA helicase Q1, which lacks the C-terminal basic amino acid cluster in a yeast two hybrid system (39Seki T. Tada S. Katada T. Enomoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we postulated that DNA helicase Q1-NLS involves the 4 C-terminal basic amino acids (KKRK645). Furthermore, since another basic amino acid cluster (KK626) was located 16 amino acids upstream from this C-terminal basic cluster, we also considered the possibility that the helicase Q1-NLS is a bipartite type. Therefore, considering these two possibilities, we prepared four types of synthetic peptides containing only the C-terminal basic amino acid cluster (ShortQ1, termed in Table I), the C-terminal basic cluster and its 19-amino acid upstream sequence (LongQ1), a peptide identical to LongQ1 except for the amino acid substitution K625,626A (LongQ1(KK-AA)), and the 17 amino acids upstream from the C-terminal basic amino acid cluster containing KK626 (UpstreamQ1), and conjugated these to bBSA. We then examined whether these conjugates migrate into the nucleus, when injected into the cytoplasm of cultured mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 1, we found that ShortQ1, LongQ1, and LongQ1(KK-AA) efficiently directed bBSA into the nucleus to the same extent, but UpstreamQ1 did not. From these findings, we conclude that the C-terminal basic amino acid cluster of DNA helicase Q1 is necessary and sufficient for NLS activity. As a result, the NLS of helicase Q1 can be classified into a conventional single basic type. We next examined whether Qip1 directly binds to the NLS of DNA helicase Q1 in a solution binding assay. Purified recombinant Qip1 was added to the peptide-bBSA conjugates immobilized to avidin-agarose, and the interaction was examined by Western blotting of bound materials with affinity-purified anti-Qip1 antibodies. Unexpectedly, as shown in Fig.2 A, Qip1 bound to LongQ1- and LongQ1(KK-AA)-bBSA efficiently, but only weakly to ShortQ1- and not at all to UpstreamQ1-bBSA. Differential binding activity of Qip1 with ShortQ1- and LongQ1-bBSA indicates that the upstream sequences contained in LongQ1 peptide play an important role in the recognition of helicase Q1-NLS by Qip1. To confirm whether these upstream sequences actually contribute to the NLS recognition by Qip1, we prepared three additional peptides containing minimal essential sequences of SV40 T-antigen NLS (ShortT), ShortT sequences plus its own upstream sequences of the same length as those of LongQ1 (LongT), and SV40 T-antigen NLS combined to the 17-amino acid upstream sequence of DNA helicase Q1-NLS (Q1/T). Furthermore, we prepared a synthetic peptide, CBP80, which contains a typical bipartite type NLS for a nuclear CAP-binding protein 80. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Qip1 was found to bind efficiently to Q1/T-bBSA, but only slightly to ShortT-, LongT-, and CBP80-bBSA, indicating that the NLS binding of Qip1 requires not only the C-terminal basic amino acid cluster of DNA helicase Q1, but also its upstream sequences, and that the basic amino acid sequence in the NLS is essential but not sufficient for the binding of Qip1. On the other hand, recombinant PTAC58 and NPI-1 efficiently bound to all the tested functional NLS substrates (ShortQ1-, LongQ1-, LongQ1(KK-AA)-, ShortT-, LongT-, CBP80-, and Q1/T-bBSA), suggesting that the upstream sequences are not required for the NLS recognition by PTAC58 and NPI-1. To further investigate whether Qip1 actually functions as an NLS receptor, we examined the transport activity of recombinant Qip1 using an in vitro digitonin-permeabilized cell-free transport assay. As expected, as shown in Fig. 3, Qip1 transported LongQ1- and Q1/T-APC conjugates into the nucleus efficiently, but ShortQ1-APC was transported only weakly, and UpstreamQ1-APC conjugate not at all (data not shown), which is consistent with the solution binding assay described above. These results indicate that Qip1 acts as a novel class of NLS receptor, requiring the upstream sequences of the helicase Q1-NLS for its NLS recognition. From this and previous studies, it is evident that at least three different classes of NLS receptors, Rch1, NPI-1, and Qip1, are present in HeLa cells. However, the issue of whether distinct classes of NLS receptors show different NLS recognition specificity to a variety of NLSs remains poorly understood. To address this question, we compared the ability of three classes of recombinant NLS receptors to transport various NLS substrates into the n"

IF-B12 affinity chromatography of renal cortex membrane from rabbit and man yielded the same approximately 460-kDa protein. Binding studies including surface plasmon resonance analyses of the protein demonstrated a calcium-dependent and high affinity binding of IF-B12 to a site distinct from the RAP binding site. The high affinity binding of IF-B12 was dependent on complex formation with vitamin B12. Light and electron microscope autoradiography of rat renal cortex cryosections incubated directly with IF-57Co-B12 and rat proximal tubules microinjected in vivo with the radioligand demonstrated binding of the ligand to endocytic invaginations of proximal tubule membranes followed by endocytosis and targeting of vitamin B12 to lysosomes. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing the approximately 460-kDa receptor inhibited the uptake. Immunohistochemistry of kidney and intestine showed colocalization of the IF-B12 receptor and megalin in both tissues. In conclusion, we have identified the epithelial IF-B12-binding receptor as a approximately 460-kDa RAP-binding protein facilitating endocytosis."

We have shown that FAS transcription rate is induced dramatically when fasted animals are refed with a high carbohydrate diet or when streptozotocin-diabetic mice are given insulin. We also reported that FAS gene transcription was up-regulated by insulin through the proximal promoter region from −71 to −50 and that upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), including USF1 and USF2, interact with this region in vitro. In the present study, by using site-directed mutagenesis of the −71/−50 region and correlating functional assays of the mutated promoter with USF binding activities, we demonstrate that the −65/−60 E-box motif (5′-CATGTG-3′) is functionally required for insulin regulation and that USFs are in vivo components of the insulin response complex. Mutation of the −65/−60 E-box sequence abolished insulin response in both transiently and stably transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the −2.1 kb promoter context, which contains all the necessary regulatory elements of the promoter based on our previous transgenic mice studies, and in the minimal −67 promoter context. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that USFs can no longer bind to the −71/−50 promoter region when the E-box is mutated. Cotransfection of USF1 and USF2 expression vectors with the FAS promoter-luciferase reporter constructs increased insulin-stimulated FAS promoter activity. Moreover, cotransfection of dominant negative USF1 and USF2 mutants lacking the DNA binding domain inhibited the insulin stimulation of the FAS promoter activity. On the other hand, site-directed mutagenesis of the −65/−60 E-box surrounding sequences within the overlapped tandem copies of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) binding sites prevented SREBP from binding to −71/−50 promoter regionin vitro but had no effect on insulin regulation of the FAS promoter in vivo. When rat liver nuclear extracts were used in gel mobility shift assays, only USF-containing protein-DNA complexes that can be supershifted by specific USF antibodies were observed.

By action of its seven active sites, FAS catalyzes all the reaction steps in the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate. FAS activity is not known to be regulated by allosteric effectors or covalent modification. However, FAS concentration is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional, hormonal, and developmental status (1Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Volpe J.J. Vagelos P.R. Physiol. Rev. 1976; 56: 339-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The concentration or activity of FAS in liver and adipose tissue changes dramatically when animals are subject to certain nutritional and hormonal manipulations. We reported previously that due to changes in the rate of FAS transcription, FAS synthesis declines and increases in an insulin-dependent manner during fasting and refeeding, respectively (3Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of insulin to streptozotocin-diabetic mice stimulated the level of FAS mRNA and FAS transcription rates (4Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that insulin increased levels of FAS mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (3Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequences mediating insulin induction of the FAS gene were first located within the first 332 bases of the FAS promoter and further mapped to the proximal promoter region from −71 to −50 by chimeric constructions of serial 5′-deletions of the rat FAS promoter-reporter constructs and transfection into H4IIE hepatoma cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, three tandem copies of the −68/−52 FAS promoter region linked to heterologous SV40 promoter were responsive to insulin (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using competition gel mobility shift assays and specific upstream stimulatory factor (USF) antibodies, we identified USF1 and USF2 as major components of complexes that bind to this region of the FAS promoter in vitro (6Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Within the −71/−50 region of the FAS promoter that we defined as the insulin response sequence, two tandem binding sites for sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) were recently reported to be present at position −68/−63 and −62/−57 (7Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two SREBP binding sites overlap with a core E-box (5′-CATGTG-3′) present in the insulin response sequence at position −65/−60. It was postulated that SREBP proteins bind their binding sites, rather than the E-box, to participate in sterol regulation of FAS promoter (7Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). USF proteins are members of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors.

The two USF proteins bind to the 5′-CANNTG-3′ E-box motif with identical DNA binding specificity (11Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the bHLH structure, a leucine zipper is immediately adjacent and is also important for USF dimerization and DNA binding (12Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The basic region is critical for DNA binding, and deletion of this region results in a dominant negative USF, which still dimerizes but lacks DNA binding capacity (18Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl.

Although USF proteins were found to be ubiquitously expressed among various tissue and cell types, they can be involved in transcriptional regulation of specific genes. USF binding sites have been found, and the involvement of USF in transcriptional regulation have been studied in a number of cellular and viral genes (19Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A.

For example, USFs were shown to bind the glucose response element of the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) and S14 gene promoters in vitro (21Diaz Guerra M.J. Bergot M.O. Martinez A. Cuif M.H. Kahn A.

Evidence supporting (19Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) the direct involvement of USF proteins in glucose response of the L-PK and S14 genes was reported. Based on our previous reports that sequences responsible for insulin regulation of the FAS gene is present in the promoter region at −71/−50 and USFs bind to this region in vitro, this report provides evidence to further define the −65/−60 E-box as a critical requirement for insulin regulation and demonstrate that USF proteins are in vivo components mediating insulin regulation of the FAS promoter activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that mutations of the −65/−60 E-box, but not the surrounding sequences within the SREBP binding sites, could effectively abolish the USF binding to FAS −71/−50 region in vitro and disrupt the insulin regulation of the FAS promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in transfection assays. When cotransfected with the FAS promoter constructs, USF1 and USF2 could further activate and dominant negative USF1 and USF2 could inhibit the insulin-stimulated FAS promoter activity. Using gel mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that USF and SREBP proteins independently bind to their exclusive binding sites and that USF interaction with the −65/−60 E-box, but not SREBP, is required for insulin regulation of the FAS transcription. The reporter gene constructs of p2.1kb-LUC and p67-LUC, which contain, respectively, the −2.1 kb and −67 bp of wild-type rat FAS promoter fused with luciferase sequence have been described previously (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p2.1kbM-LUC and p67M-LUC constructs were made to mutate the FAS −65/−60 E-box sequence 5′-CATGTG-3′ to 5′-GAATTC-3′ by site-directed mutagenesis methods (25Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 26Wang D. Sul H.S. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 70-72Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). p2.1kbS1-LUC, p2.1kbS2-LUC, and p2.1kbS3-LUC plasmids, which contain the −2.1 kb FAS promoter with mutations disrupting the SREBP binding sites or SREBP and SP1 interaction (7Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), were also made by site-directed mutagenesis methods (25Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A.

In p2.1kbS1-LUC, wild-type FAS promoter sequence 5′-TCA-3′ from position −71 to −69 and 5′-TGG-3′ from position −56 to −54 were changed to 5′-TCA-3′ and 5′-CAA-3′, respectively. In p2.1kbS2-LUC and p2.1kbS3-LUC, a 4-bp (5′-CTAG-3′) and a 10-bp (5′-CTAGTCTAGA-3′) sequence were inserted between position −73 and −72. Expression vectors pFLAG-USF1 and pFLAG-USF2, which contain full-length human USF1 and mouse USF2 cDNA sequences, were made by PCR amplifying the USF plasmid DNA (kindly provided by Dr. M. Sawadogo, M. D. Anderson Medical Center, University of Texas) with the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and inserting the products into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). PCR primers were designed to introduce a N-terminal FLAG peptide tag (N-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C) to the expressed USF1 and USF2 proteins and incorporate a consensus Kozak sequence upstream of the ATG start codon for efficient translation. Dominant negative forms of USF1 and USF2, i.e. pFLAG-USFΔb and pFLAG-USF2Δb, were made by site-directed mutagenesis (25Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 26Wang D. Sul H.S. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 70-72Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) of pFLAG-USF1 and pFLAG-USF2 to delete the basic regions of USF1 (amino acids 193–211) and USF2 (amino acids 228–247). SREBP expression vectors, pcDNA-SREBP1 and pcDNA-SREBP2, for active forms of SREBP1a (amino acids 1–490) and SREBP2 (amino acids 1–484) were constructed by inserting the corresponding Pfu DNA polymerase-amplified cDNA sequences into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). A consensus Kozak sequence was also introduced immediately upstream of the ATG start codon of SREBP1a and SREBP2 by PCR primers. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and induced to differentiate to adipocytes by 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and 0.25 μmdexamethasone as described previously (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For stable transfection of 3T3-L1 cells, 10 μg of the experimental reporter plasmid DNA and 1 μg of pcDNA3.0 plasmid DNA, which provides the neomycin resistance, were cotransfected into preadipocytes using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (27Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 9.1.1-9.1.3Google Scholar) and selected with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. G418-resistant colonies were pooled for later differentiation and luciferase activity assay. For transient transfection of 3T3-L1 cells, 10 μg of the experimental reporter plasmid with the indicated amount of expression vectors (when used) were cotransfected into differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method. Insulin treatment of the cells and luciferase activity assay were carried out as described previously (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triplicate plates were used for each sample group and average luciferase activities were used to calculate -fold changes induced by insulin and -fold stimulation caused by USF cotransfection. Plasmid DNA containing USF1, USF2, SREBP1, and SREBP2 cDNA sequences cloned in pcDNA3.0 and pcDNA3.1 (as described above) was first linearized and then in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using a mRNA capping kit (Stratagene). The mRNAs were then in vitro translated to USF and SREBP proteins by programming rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Manufacturer's instructions were followed. The in vitro translation reaction with no mRNA added to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate was used as a negative control. Parallel experiments were set up to allow one set of reactions to produce [35S]Met-labeled proteins to monitor the translation products and the other set of reactions to produce unlabeled proteins for gel mobility shift assays. The following single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon, Inc. (Alameda, CA). IRS­WT:5′­AGCTGTCAGCCCATGTGGCGTGGCCGC­3′ 3′­AGTCGGGTACACCGCACCGGCGTCGAC­5′ IRS­M:5′­AGCTGTCAGCCGAATTC¯GCGTGGCCGC­3′ 3′­AGTCGGCTTAAG¯CGCACCGGCGTCGAC­5′ IRS­S1:5′­AGCTGCAG¯GCCCATGTGGCGCAA¯CCGC­3′ 3′­GTC¯CGGGTACACCGCGTT¯GGCGTCGAC­5′ Underlined sequences are the mutations from the wild-type insulin response sequence (IRS-WT). IRS-M contains the mutation of the −65/−60 E-box sequence, and IRS-S1 contains the mutation same as described in p2.1kbS1-LUC. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were formed as described previously (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All probes for gel mobility shift assays were made by labeling with [α-32P]dCTP, in the presence of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, and Klenow fragment of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. Cold dCTP was added at the end of the labeling reaction to make full-length probes. Reactions (20 μl) containing the indicated amount of in vitro translated USF and SREBP proteins and 5 × 105 cpm oligonucleotide probes were carried out and applied onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiography was performed as described previously (6Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specific USF1 and SREBP1 antibodies (2 μl each; Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc.) were added to the binding reactions for supershift experiments. Previously, we mapped the insulin response sequence (IRS) at the proximal FAS promoter region from −71 to −50. Based on the results of gel mobility shift assays, we identified both USF1 and USF2 as major components of complexes in rat liver nuclear extracts that bind the FAS IRS in vitro (6Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Within this region, there is an E-box sequence (5′-CATGTG-3′) located at −65 to −60. We hypothesized that USF interacts with the E-box in vivo and this interaction is involved in the insulin regulation of the FAS gene transcription. As the first step, we tested the functional importance of the E-box sequence using transfection assays. Based on the studies in transgenic mice, the −2.1 kb promoter region contains all the necessary regulatory DNA elements and is sufficient to confer insulin responsiveness in vivo (28Soncini M. Yet S.-F. Moon Y. Chun J.-Y. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30339-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated the E-box 5′-CATGTG-3′ sequence to 5′-GAATTC-3′ within the −2.1 kb FAS promoter context and tested the effect of this mutation on the insulin responsiveness of FAS promoter first in transiently transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin response was calculated as the ratio of luciferase activities in the presence of 10 nm insulinversus in the absence of insulin. As shown in Fig.1 A, mutation of the E-box sequence decreased the insulin response from 2.7-fold in p2.1kb-LUC to 1.4-fold in p2.1kbM-LUC in transient transfection assays. Then we tested the insulin response of these two reporter gene constructs using stable transfection assays. Pooled stable 3T3-L1 adipocyte transfectants were assayed by measuring the luciferase activities of the cells maintained in the presence 10 nm and absence of insulin. Similar to the results of transient transfection experiments, insulin response was decreased from 2.7-fold in p2.1kb-LUC to 1.2-fold in p2.1kbM-LUC (Fig. 1 A). These results suggested that the 5′-CATGTG-3′ E-box sequence within the previously identified −71/−50 region is required for insulin regulation of the FAS promoter, not only when transiently expressed as naked DNA templates but also when stably incorporated into the chromosomes. Next, we examined changes in the insulin response caused by the same mutation in the FAS −67 promoter context, which is the minimal region that we have shown to confer insulin responsiveness in transient transfection assays (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the 5′-CATGTG-3′ E-box sequence within this minimal promoter context will further demonstrate the functional importance of the −65/−60 E-box. As shown in Fig. 1 A, insulin treatment caused a 2-fold response in luciferase activities of p67-LUC, consistent with our previous reports using the same construct (5Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the E-box is mutated, adding insulin to the culturing medium did not induce a insulin response of the FAS promoter. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the 5′-CATGTG-3′ E-box sequence is critical for mediating the insulin response of the FAS promoter. We also found that E-box mutation within the −2.1 kb promoter context decreased the basal promoter activity by 75%, suggesting that, in addition to its involvement in the insulin regulation of the FAS promoter, the E-box sequence is also important for the basal promoter activity. Similar decrease of basal promoter activity was observed by Osborne and co-workers (32Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), using deletion of −43 to −73 containing the E-box at −65 in the context of −150. Interestingly, we did not observe a decrease of the basal promoter activity by the E-box mutation in the −67 bp promoter context. Since basal promoter activity of p67-LUC is only 5% of the p2.1kb-LUC, it would have been difficult to see the further decrease caused by the mutation. It is also possible that interaction of USF with other transcription factors binding to sequences upstream to −67 may be necessary for the basal promoter activity. To see if the USF binding to the −65/−60 E-box correlates with the functional data presented above, we carried out gel mobility shift assays using the FAS −71/−50 region as the wild-type probe (IRS-WT) and the same region carrying the 5′-CATGTG-3′ to 5′-GAATTC-3′ E-box mutation as the mutated probe (IRS-M). In this experiment, in vitro translated USF1 and USF2 proteins were used to bind the32P-labeled probes. As shown in Fig. 1 B, when USF1 and USF2 were added together to form USF heterodimers, they interacted with the IRS-WT probe to form protein-DNA complexes (lane 6) in a migration pattern similar to our previously reported patterns when nuclear extracts were used (6Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, when the IRS-M probes were used, USF proteins could no longer bind (lane 3), and the IRS-M sequence could not compete for the binding of USF to the IRS-WT probe (data not shown). Two additional bands (indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 1 B) were also observed and appeared to be nonspecific protein-DNA complexes because they formed with the unprogrammed rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and their patterns did not change when the −65/−60 E-box sequence was mutated (lanes 5 and 2), nor did addition of specific USF antibodies affect these two bands (see Fig. 4 A). Combined with the transfection data, in vitro binding analysis demonstrated that when USF can not bind to the FAS −65/−60 E-box, insulin response is abolished. These studies, therefore, demonstrate that mediation of insulin response is through the −65/−60 E-box and probably through its interaction with USF. In the case of several genes whose transcription regulation involves USF, cotransfection of USF expression vectors with the reporter genes stimulate the reporter gene activity (19Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M.

To further investigate the effect of USF on insulin regulation of the FAS promoter activity, we cotransfected USF1 and USF2 expression vectors, i.e. pFLAG-USF1 and pFLAG-USF2 (Fig. 2 A), with the FAS-luciferase reporter construct. To directly demonstrate the interaction between USF and the −65/−60 E-box, we used the p67-LUC because this construct represents the minimal insulin-responsive promoter and has the −65/−60 E-box as the only E-box in the promoter region that USF could bind to. Fig. 2 B shows the insulin-stimulated luciferase activities from cotransfection of expression vectors relative to the luciferase activity of p67-LUC under minus insulin conditions. Cotransfection of the control expression vector pcDNA3.0 at all concentrations resulted in the insulin-stimulated luciferase activities at about 2-fold level and thus had little effect on the insulin-stimulated p67-LUC activity. However, cotransfection of USF1 and USF2 significantly increased the insulin-stimulated luciferase activities up to 8- (USF1) and 11-fold (USF2) levels. Maximal activation was seen at concentrations of 200 ng of USF expression vector/culture plate, similar to the concentrations previously reported for maximal stimulation of the L-PK gene promoter by USF in transfection assays (19Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When the amounts of USF1 and USF2 were further increased to 1 and 2.5 μg/culture plate, the stimulation was reduced, probably due to the interference of the cellular transcription processes by overproduction of the ectopic USF proteins. When equal amounts of USF1 and USF2 were cotransfected together, further increase of insulin-stimulated FAS promoter activity was observed as USF1 and"
https://openalex.org/W1993260214,"Groucho is a transcriptional repressor implicated in Notch signaling and involved in neural development and segmentation in <i>Drosophila</i>. We are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of Groucho and its mammalian homologs, the transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) proteins. We report that Groucho/TLEs are associated with chromatin in live cells and that they co-purify with isolated histones. Affinity chromatography and far Western blotting studies show further that native Groucho/TLE proteins interact specifically with histone H3 and not with other core histones. This interaction is mediated by the H3 amino-terminal domain previously shown by genetic analysis in yeast to be essential for the role of H3 in transcriptional silencing. We also demonstrate that Groucho/TLEs form oligomeric structures <i>in vivo</i>. These combined findings suggest that transcription complexes containing Groucho/TLEs may associate with chromatin through interactions with the amino terminus of histone H3 and that these interactions may be propagated along the chromosome due to the ability of Groucho/TLEs to participate in higher order structures."

To demonstrate the presence of hGRβ as protein we produced specific rabbit antisera to hGRβ, as well as a hGRβ-specific mouse monoclonal IgM antibody, by peptide immunizations. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting we showed that hGRβ is endogenously expressed at the protein level in HeLa cells and human lymphatic leukemia cells. Using an antibody directed against an epitope shared by both isoforms we showed a relatively lower expression of the hGRβ form. We also showed that hGRβ bound to hsp90 by immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated hGRβ in reticulocyte lysate with hsp90-specific antibodies, a coprecipitation occurring also in the presence of dexamethasone. We could not demonstrate that hGRβ inhibited the effects of dexamethasone-activated hGRα on a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene. In conclusion, low hGRβ expression levels and hGRβ-hsp90 interaction maintained in the presence of ligand and lack of inhibition of hormone-activated hGRα effects challenge the concept of the hGRβ isoform as a proposed dominant negative inhibitor of hGRα activity.

Characterization of the genomic structure of the hGR gene suggested two alternative exons for the COOH-terminal part of GR and that alternative splicing of exons 9α and 9β was the mechanism responsible for generating the two receptor isoforms (2Encio I.J. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7182-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Oakley et al. (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Both hGR isoforms share the same amino acid sequence through amino acid 727 but diverge beyond this position with hGRα having an additional 50 amino acids and hGRβ with an additional nonhomologous 15 amino acids. Human GR in similarity to the other members of the steroid receptor superfamily consists of a poorly conserved amino-terminal region containing a major transactivation domain responsible for gene activation, a highly conserved cysteine-rich central DNA-binding domain, and a relatively well conserved carboxyl-terminal domain important for hormone binding (4Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). In addition to steroid binding, the ligand-binding domain also has a number of other functions including dimerization, heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) binding and transactivation (5Gustafsson J.-Å.

Without making any distinction between hGR isoforms, earlier studies could be summarized to have shown that hGR resides both in the cytoplasm and in the cell nucleus and forms a heteroligomeric complex containing one steroid binding hGR and several nonsteroid binding components (6Pratt W.B. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including a dimer of hsp90 and monomers of hsp70 and hsp56. Hsp90 has been suggested to maintain hGR in a conformation that is unsuitable for DNA (GRE) binding but favorable for ligand binding. Once hormone binds to the receptor, a conformational change of the receptor results in the dissociation of hsp90 and some of the other associated proteins. Upon ligand binding GR is preferentially located in the nucleus, where it binds as a homodimer to GREs usually localized in the promoter regions of glucocorticoid-responsive genes (7Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that hGR, in addition to either enhancing or repressing transcription of a specific gene by binding to its promoter or to further upstream regions, may modulate gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors such as AP-1 (8Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (9Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Only a few recent studies have addressed the function of the β-isoform of hGR (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 10Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin.

Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus many aspects of the possible physiological role of hGRβ remain to be further elucidated. Oakleyet al. (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) have shown that hGRβ does not bind dexamethasone or RU486 (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). hGRβ has been assigned a role as a dominant negative inhibitor of hGRα activity (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 10Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In the absence of hGRα, however, hGRβ seems to be transcriptionally inactive (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), although it can bind to a GRE as demonstrated in a gel mobility shift assay. The presence of hGRα and β at the mRNA level has also been demonstrated (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 10Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and a relatively lower amount of hGRβ message (0.2–0.3% of total GR mRNA) has been suggested (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). A recent study by de Castro et al. (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has implicated that hGRβ binds hsp90, but has not demonstrated this in a direct fashion. In the same study this group also demonstrated hGRβ protein in various tissues. However, the relative levels of hGRβ as compared with hGRα remain to be unequivocally established. Reports of the intracellular localization of hGRβ are somewhat conflicting and it also remains to be established under which conditions, normal and/or pathological, glucocorticoid-dependent repression or activation of gene transcription may be modulated by the interaction of the two hGR isoforms. The exact mechanism of such an effect also warrants further study. To demonstrate the presence of hGRβ as an expressed protein and to enable further studies of its function, we have performed peptide immunizations of rabbits and mice and produced specific rabbit antisera to hGRα and hGRβ as well as an hGRβ-specific monoclonal IgM antibody. We confirm the expression of specific hGRβ transcripts in several human tissues and extend these findings to the demonstration of the expression of the hGRβ protein in two cell lines. We also show a faster relative mobility of hGRβ in SDS-PAGE/Western blotting as compared with hGRα. Furthermore, our data indicate a lower relative amount of hGRβ protein expression as compared with hGRα. Finally, we demonstrate that hGRβ can bind directly to hsp90, that this binding is not affected by ligand in the same way as hGRα-hsp90 binding and, based upon cotransfection studies in COS-7 cells, we challenge the current belief that hGRβ is a general, negative modulator of hGRα function. A cDNA library panel (CLONTECH) of 8 different human 5′-Stretch PlusTM cDNA libraries was screened by PCR for hGRβ specific expression. The sense primer corresponded to the α and β common exon 8 hGR sequence bp 2219–2238, i.e.5′-AGCTAGGAAAAGCCATTGTC-3′. The specific hGRβ primer corresponded to the exon 9β sequence bp 2317–2335 generating the antisense primer 5′-CTGGTTTTAACCACATAAC-3′. PCR reactions were performed in the presence of 3 μm of the primer set, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.8 μg of DNA, 12.5 mm nucleotide mixture, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). After a 2-min denaturing step at 95 °C, 28 PCR cycles were run using an annealing temperature of 45 °C for 1 min and an extension temperature of 72 °C for 2 min. A PCR product of approximately 117 bp was generated in all tissues tested, i.e. heart, pancreas, lung, liver, brain, placenta, kidney, and skeletal muscle (data not shown). Plasmid pGem7SP6hGRα (RiboProbe System, Promega) contained the full-length human GR α-isoform under control of the SP6 promoter (generously provided by Dr. Sam Okret, Karolinska Institute). For construction of plasmid pGEM7SP6hGRβ, aClaI-XbaI fragment was amplified from pRShGRβ (kindly provided by Dr. R. Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) by PCR. The NH2-terminal primer, GR1, 5′-CCATCGATAAAATTCGAAGA-3′, contained an internalClaI site corresponding to bp 1525 within the GR gene (1Hollenberg S.M. Weinberger C. Ong E.S. Cerelli G. Oro A. Lebo R. Thompson E.B. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar) and the COOH-terminal antisense primer, GR8, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTGGCCAGATAACACATACA-3′, corresponding to bp 2609–2627 contained an added 5′ XbaI site (1Hollenberg S.M. Weinberger C. Ong E.S. Cerelli G. Oro A. Lebo R. Thompson E.B. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). The GR1-GR8 fragment was amplified by PCR using Vent-Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following program: 25 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 44 °C, 90 s at 72 °C, and a final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified segment was subcloned as aClaI-XbaI fragment into pBluescript (Stratagene), resulting in plasmid p8-1 and subsequently sequenced. pGem7SP6hGRβ was finally constructed by replacing the COOH-terminalClaI-XbaI fragment in pGem7SP6hGRα (RiboProbe System, Promega) with fragment p8-1. GRβ was produced under the control of the SP6 promoter. GRα was expressed from pMT-GRα (12Alksnis M. Barkhem T. Strömstedt P.-E. Ahola H. Kutoh E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Nilsson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10078-10085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GRβ from pRShGRβ (13Giguère V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Control plasmid pRShGRβΔSalI was constructed by cutting pRShGRβ with SalI, at a unique restriction site within the τ1 sequence in the GR-coding region. The protruding ends were blunt ended by mung bean nuclease treatment and the plasmid was religated. This generates a 4-bp deletion (confirmed by sequencing) and a change in reading frame after R 131. The truncated protein produced from this construct corresponded to the NH2 terminus of the hGR and was 168 amino acids long, with the last 37 amino acids differing from the wild type protein. This protein did not activate the GRE-dependent reporter gene used in our transfection experiments. The reporter plasmid pSALP contained the gene for secreted placental alkaline phosphatase under the control of the GR inducible MMTV promoter. Plasmid pAP contained the same reporter gene under control of a non-inducible promoter. Both plasmids were kindly provided by KaroBio, Huddinge, Sweden. Plasmids used in transfection experiments were prepared from Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue on Sepharose columns (Qiagen, KEBO, Sweden). Monolayer cultures of COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, penicillin (5 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Transient transfection was performed using DOTAP as a transfection agent according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes. 1 μg of reporter plasmid (pSALP) was cotransfected with various amounts of expression plasmid pMT-GRα, pRShGRβ, and pRShGRβΔSalI, respectively, for 6 h. Cells were induced by adding fresh medium containing dexamethasone (Sigma), 24 h after transfection. 48 h after dexamethasone induction, alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in cellular supernatants. Concentrations of plasmids and dexamethasone are as indicated in the figures. Transient transfections were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity. For this purpose, 1 ml of medium of induced cells was cleared by centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min and thereafter recentrifuged. 250 μl of the supernatant was added to 80 μl of alkaline phosphatase assay solution (5 μl/ml Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate in 1.12 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.8 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) in microtiter plates and incubated at room temperature. Enzymatic activity was monitored by following the rate of change of absorption ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate at 405 nm. Peptides were selected based on the predicted antigenicity or based on unique sequences of the two hGR receptor isoforms. Peptide E17P corresponds to amino acids 510–526 in both hGRα and hGRβ. Peptide K15K corresponds to the 15 COOH-terminal amino acids of hGRα and N15I to the 15 COOH-terminal amino acids of hGRβ. The peptides were ordered from Neosystem Laboratoire (Strasbourg, France). Peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by the one-step glutaraldehyde method. Rabbits were immunized with 50 μg of peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin initially in Freund's complete adjuvant and thereafter in incomplete adjuvant or phosphate-buffered saline. Immunization was repeated monthly and after several boosters, the animals were bled and the antisera tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the relevant peptide. Positive sera were further tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against hGR purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (cf. below) from HeLa cells or a baculovirus-expressed hGR (kindly provided from KaroBio, Huddinge, Sweden). Monoclonal antibodies were prepared according to standard procedures. A monoclonal antibody previously generated against the rat GR with a known cross-reactivity to hGR (mAb5, also called 293 (14Okret S. Wikström A.-C. Wrange Ö. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc.

Cytosol from approximately 5 ml of HeLa cell pellets, stored frozen at −70 °C, was prepared by homogenization in low salt buffer as described previously (16Brönnegård M. Poellinger L. Okret S. Wikström A.-C. Bakke O. Gustafsson J.-Å. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cytosol was slowly passed over the column, washed with 10 column volumes of EPG (1 mm EDTA, 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mmdithiothreitol) containing 50 mm NaCl and further with 10 column volumes of EPG with 1 m NaCl. Human GR was then eluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0. A similar procedure was used for hGR purification from plasmapheresis-enriched lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia (a kind gift from Dr. Adam Smolovitz, Dept. of Hematology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden) or from Sf1 cells expressing hGR obtained from KaroBio (Huddinge, Sweden). The radiolabeled glucocorticoid receptors GRα and GRβ, respectively, were generated by in vitro transcription/translation of plasmids phGRα and pGEM7SP6hGRβ, in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled glucocorticoid receptor-bound to hsp90 by monoclonal IgM antibodies against hsp90 (antibody 3G3, purchased from Affinity Bioreagents) and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (17McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with an additional step to block nonspecific binding using 3% fat-free milk. The SDS gels were dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography. The same protocol was used with polyclonal anti-hGR antibodies, with the modification that samples were blotted to nitrocellulose before autoradiography. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to nitrocellulose of immunoaffinity-purified hGR were performed according to standard procedures. To allow discrimination between hGRα and hGRβ, strips were cut from single lanes of purified hGR subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, marked to ensure proper alignment, and probed with peptide-specific antibody and the relevant secondary antisera coupled to alkaline phosphatase (DAKO-Patts, Denmark). Apart from primary antibodies described in this paper we also used previously derived antibodies to rat GR, mAb5, and mAb7 (14Okret S. Wikström A.-C. Wrange Ö. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We confirmed that hGRβ is expressed at the mRNA level in human tissues by PCR screening of a commercial human cDNA library panel using an exon 9β-specific primer together with a common internal GR primer corresponding to an exon 8-specific sequence. With all tissues investigated a PCR product corresponding to the expected size, 117 bp, was generated indicating the widespread presence of hGRβ-mRNA transcripts (data not shown), similar to what has been demonstrated previously (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 10Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Primer specificity was tested by incubating the β-primers with plasmids containing the gene for hGRα and hGRβ, respectively. No PCR product was obtained with the combination of β-primers/α-plasmid (data not shown). To study the expression of the hGRβ protein we produced and tested a number of anti-hGRβ antibodies. Upon extensive immunization the three selected peptides, K15K, N15I, and E17P, corresponding to hGRα, hGRβ, and a peptide common to both isoforms, elicited immune responses in rabbits. We also produced a monoclonal antibody to hGRβ. To ensure that the antisera were specific for each isoform we tested for cross-reactivity. Proteins corresponding to each of the isoforms, hGRα and hGRβ, were specifically expressed in reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 1, shows that antibodies raised against peptides only recognized the cognate receptor isoform,i.e. antibodies raised against the hGRα specific peptide K15K precipitated hGRα but not hGRβ and antibodies raised against N15I precipitated hGRβ but not hGRα. The expression of hGRβ was studied in HeLa and CLL cells. Cytosol from HeLa cells grown in culture or from lymphocytes obtained from plasmapheresis of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) was enriched for hGR using a monoclonal antibody directed against the NH2-terminal part of rat GR, mAb5, that cross-reacts with hGR and presumably should recognize both GR isoforms equally. Fig.2 shows strips cut from a nitrocellulose filter after SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Strips from one large lane of cytosol were cut into several narrower strips and probed with antibodies and the relevant secondary antisera coupled to alkaline phosphatase. In Fig. 2 A, hGR-enriched HeLa cell cytosol, when probed with a hGRβ specific antibody raised against peptide N15I, was shown to contain a major immunoreactive band of slightly lower relative molecular weight than that of the predominant band, which was seen when the blot was probed with the antiserum raised against peptide E17P, which was common to both hGR isoforms. A similar result for CLL cells is shown in Fig. 2 B. These results clearly showed that hGRβ was expressed at the protein level in two different cell types of human origin. The expression levels of hGRβ, however, seemed to be significantly lower as compared with hGRα expression levels indicated by the fact that the intensity of the β-band was much lower when an antibody recognizing an epitope situated approximately 200 amino acids more NH2 terminally in the ligand-binding domain and common for both receptor isoforms was used. This was also suggested by experiments where mAb7, recognizing an epitope within the NH2-terminal domain of hGR, separate from the mAb5 epitope (15McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wikström A.-C. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25629-25636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at increasing concentrations and recognized an additional band of lower molecular weight, corresponding in size to the hGRβ isoform, as tested on CLL cytosol enriched for both GR isoforms by mAb5 immunoaffinity chromatography as described above (Fig.3). Thus, the results in Figs. 2 and 3, although not directly quantitative, indicate a lower relative amount of hGRβ protein in both HeLa and CLL cells.Figure 3Relatively lower expression of hGRβ in HeLa cells. Cytosol derived from HeLa cells was enriched for hGR by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-ratGR antibody mAb5 directed against an epitope within the NH2-terminal domain of rGR, previously shown to be cross-reactive with the hGR NH2-terminal (15McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wikström A.-C. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25629-25636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enriched cytosol was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Strips cut from one lane were probed with increasing dilutions of mAb7. Lane 1, 10 μg/ml;lane 2, 2 μg/ml; lane 3, 0.4 μg/ml;lane 4, 80 ng/ml; lane 5, 16 ng/ml; andlane 6, 3 ng/ml. Note the rapid disappearance of the lower band, which in size corresponds to hGRβ, with decreasing antibody concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether hGRβ is present as a heterocomplex with hsp90 and, if so, whether hsp90 could be released by addition of dexamethasone,in vitro translation of hGRα or hGRβ in reticulocyte lysate in either the absence or presence of 100 μmdexamethasone was carried out. Aliquots of the lysate were divided and immunoprecipitated using either Sepharose-coupled monoclonal hsp90 antibodies (cf. below) or, as a control, unspecific IgM antibodies (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 5, 9, and 12). As indicated in Fig. 4,35S-labeled protein was detected in lysate containing phGRα (lanes 6 and 13) and pGem7SP6hGRβ (lanes 3 and 10), respectively. hGRβ, which is 35 amino acids shorter than hGRα, runs slightly ahead, demonstrating the difference in size between the two hGR isoforms (85 and 81 kDa). Furthermore, both hGR isoforms were detected in immunoprecipitates using hsp90 antibodies, indicating that hGRα (Fig. 4, lane 4) as well as hGRβ (Fig. 4, lane 1) is bound to hsp90. To test whether hsp90 was released in the presence of hormone, hGRα or hGRβ were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 100 μm dexamethasone and immunoprecipitated with hsp90 antibodies in the presence of dexamethasone. As shown in Fig. 4 (lane 11), hGRα was not immunoprecipitated with hsp90 antibodies in the presence of dexamethasone. In contrast, hGRβ (Fig. 4, lane 8) was immunoprecipitated with hsp90 antibodies in the presence of dexamethasone. hGRβ coprecipitated with hsp90 to the same extent in both the absence (Fig. 4, lane 1) and presence (Fig. 4, lane 8) of dexamethasone. To test whether hGRβ had any effect on the hormone-induced hGRα-mediated stimulation of gene expression, COS-7 cells were transfected with pSALP as a reporter gene and constant amounts of hGRα or hGRβ plasmid. In hGRα transfected cells, dexamethasone induced alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas no induction was observed in hGRβ transfected cells (Fig. 5). In a second set of experiments, cells containing pSALP were transfected with increasing amounts of hGRβ and a constant amount of hGRα. As indicated in Fig.6, panel A, alkaline phosphatase activity decreased accordingly. However, we obtained the same effect when cells were transfected with a a constant amount of a GR independent reporter gene (pAP) and increasing amounts of hGRβ (Fig. 6, panel B), indicating that the hGRβ effect on the GR-inducible pSALP activity might be due to unspecific squelching and not to a specific inhibitory effect of hGRβ. A caveat in this set of experiments is that the total plasmid concentration was changing. Therefore to keep the total concentration of transfected plasmid DNA constant, cells were transfected with increasing amounts of hGRβ in the presence of hGRβΔ. As shown in Fig.7 (panel B), the problem with unspecific squelching in the GR independent reporter gene system was eliminated. However, we did not obtain a significant inhibitory effect of hGRβ on dexamethasone-induced hGRα-mediated stimulation of the pSALP reporter gene activity (Fig. 7, panel A).Figure 6Nonspecific repression of reporter gene activity in cotransfection experiments with hGRα and hGRβ.COS7 cells were transfected with constant concentrations of hGRα coding plasmid pMThGRα (0.4 μg), constant concentrations of reporter plasmid pSALP (1.5 μg), and increasing concentrations of hGRβ coding plasmid pRShGRβ, in amounts as indicated below the figure and further described under “Experimental Procedures.” Secreted akaline phosphatase activity was measured in supernatants from ligand-untreated cells (filled bars) or in supernatants from cells treated with 1 μm dexamethasone (open bars).

In addition, the pRShGRβΔSalI plasmid was cotransfected to obtain a constant total DNA concentration (pRSV-GRβ + pRShGRβΔSalI = 1.6 μg). The pRShGRβΔSalI plasmid by itself, with or without dexamethasone treatment could not induce reporter gene activity (data not shown). Secreted alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in supernatants from ligand-untreated cells (filled bars) or in supernatants from cells treated with 1 μm dexamethasone (open bars).

Weinberger C. Ong E.S. Cerelli G. Oro A. Lebo R. Thompson E.B. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Results have recently been published demonstrating expression of hGRβ transcripts in a variety of human tissues and a potential role for hGRβ as a dominant negative inhibitor of hGRα activity (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 10Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well characterized hGRα isoform, very little is known about the hGRβ splice variant. In this report, we examined the expression of the hGRβ transcript and protein, association of hGRβ with hsp90 and physiological function of hGRβ. By PCR we confirmed that hGRα and hGRβ mRNA transcripts were co-expressed in several human tissues. We have previously produced anti-rat GR antibodies that cross-react with hGR and recognize epitopes in the amino-terminal domain, thus recognizing both the hGRα and hGRβ (14Okret S. Wikström A.-C. Wrange Ö. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this report, we have produced isoform-specific anti-hGRα and hGRβ polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, which are noncross-reactive in immunoprecipitation experiments and which specifically recognize the hGRα and hGRβ proteins in Western blotting. In this study we also produced a monoclonal antibody against hGRβ, raised against the 15 unique COOH-terminal amino acids of hGRβ here called peptide N15I. This antibody also recognizes a specific immunoreactive band in CLL cell cytosol (Fig. 2 B) as well as in HeLa cell cytosol (not shown), demonstrating that hGRβ was expressed at the protein level in human cells. As compared with hGRα, hGRβ expression levels seemed to be significantly lower, as indicated by results using two different antibodies recognizing epitopes common for both isoforms, one in the NH2-terminal part of hGR and the other in the ligand-binding domain, approximately 200 amino acids NH2terminally of the diverging point of hGRα and -β. A low hGRβ expression is in better agreement with a recent report by Oakleyet al. (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), where hGRβ mRNA levels are estimated to be only 0.2–0.3% of total mRNA. These data and ours indicate that hGRβ may not necessarily be of significant importance under normal physiological conditions. However, a recent study by de Castro et al. (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests a high level of hGRβ protein expression, in most cases exceeding hGRα expression, based on quantitation in Western blotting experiments, using peptides coupled to albumin to create standard curves. It is unclear to what extent coupling efficiency for the different peptides is controlled in this experiment and whether a quantitative comparison between the two isoforms in this fashion really is valid. Furthermore, we noted that the antisera raised by de Castro et al. (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not differentiate between the sizes of the two hGR isoforms. We believe that the use of an antibody that recognizes a common epitope in the two hGR isoforms, as described in this paper, is better suited for quantitative comparison of the isoforms as no difference in affinity to this epitope between isoforms is to be expected in Western blotting. This enables a direct comparison of relative levels of the proteins. Whether there exists a varying expression of the different hGR isoforms in normal tissues as well as in pathological tissues remains to be further studied. In addition to steroid binding, the ligand-binding domain also harbors other functions including dimerization, hsp90 binding, and transactivation (6Pratt W.B. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that the hGRα receptor isoform translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a hormone-dependent manner and that, in the absence of hormone, the association of hsp90 with hGRα appears to inactivate the nuclear localization signal (18Urda L.A. Yen P.M. Simons S.S. Harmon J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The hormone-dependent dissociation of hsp90 from hGRα is probably important in the nuclear translocation of hGRα. In this report we showed that hGRβ is also associated with hsp90, but in contrast to hGRα still maintains the hsp90 association in the presence of ligand. Receptor derivatives of rat GR terminating at amino acids 766 (hGR 748) and 671 (hGR 653) were found to coprecipitate together with hsp90, whereas further truncation at the COOH-terminal end interfered with this interaction (20Dalman F.C. Scherrer L.C. Taylor L.P. Akil H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 3482-3490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the site of hsp90 interaction appears to lie within a common region of the two hGR isoforms located at least 75 residues N-terminal of the diverging point of hGRα and hGRβ. Relating to the involvement of hsp90 in determining the intracellular localization of GR, a recent report by Oakley et al. (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) demonstrates that hGRβ resides primarily in the nucleus of transfected cells independent of hormone treatment. However, this is in contrast to another study showing essentially the same distribution pattern for hGRα as for hGRβ (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. the intracellular localization of hGRβ and its relation to hsp90 interaction call for further studies. In our experimental system, and in contrast to previous reports (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar,10Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), we were not able to demonstrate that hGRβ inhibits the effect of hormone-activated hGRα on a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene in COS-7 cells. In cotransfection experiments, using the reporter gene pSALP containing an MMTV promoter positively regulated by glucocorticoids and hGRα, alkaline phosphatase activity was clearly induced by dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no induction was obtained in cells transfected with pSALP and hGRβ. When COS-7 cells were transfected with a constant amount of hGRα-plasmid and increasing concentrations of hGRβ-plasmid, hGRα-mediated activation of the MMTV promoter was inhibited. However, the increasing expression of hGRβ inhibited a glucocorticoid-independent constitutive reporter gene to the same extent, indicating that this effect was due to nonspecific squelching. When hGRα and hGRβ were expressed in the same cell and transfected DNA was kept constant by adding the truncated pRSV-GRβΔSalI plasmid, we did not obtain a significant hGRβ inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced hGRα-mediated activation of the MMTV promoter. Thus, we conclude that the suggested hGRβ-mediated repression of hGRα is not a universal phenomen and also that the interaction between hGRα and hGRβ may be more complex than previously suggested and warrants further studies. In the case of repression occurring in systems other than ours, it also remains to be determined to what extent hGRα/hGRβ-heterodimers or hGRβ/hGRβ-homodimers participate in the occupation of GRE sequences. In addition, interactions with other steroid hormone receptors and other proteins and transcription factors, such as AP-1 (8Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and NFκB (9Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), may further contribute to the complexity of hGRα and hGRβ regulation of gene expression. Studies of progesterone receptor isoforms in different animal models have identified variations in the levels of progesterone receptor-A and -B as a consequence of endocrine manipulations as well as during development (21Vegato E. Shahbaz M.M. Wen D.X. Goldman M.E. O'Malley B.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1244-1255Google Scholar). Despite the issues raised above regarding hGRα-hGRβ interaction, the possible resulting effects on specific gene expression and the conflicting data with regard to the absolute and relative levels of hGRα and hGRβ expressed in various human tissues, it may still be possible that during specific circumstances an altered ratio of these GR receptor isoforms may result in an alteration of hormonal responses. In conclusion, there are a number of important issues yet to be addressed with regard to the physiological significance of hGRβ as a modulatory receptor isoform. Studies by Oakley et al. (3Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and de Castro et al. (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that the hGRβ protein indeed is expressed in several tissues at the mRNA level. Based on experiments using antibodies detecting both the hGRα and hGRβ isoform, however, GRα was suggested as the major form expressed in our system. We also found that hGRβ was associated with hsp90, and our study indicated that ligand does not result in a significant release of hGRβ from hsp90. These results and the fact that hGRβ did not have a dominant negative action in a glucocorticoid-driven reporter gene system, but rather a nonspecific squelching effect, warrant further studies of the role of GR isoforms in human, and indicate that hGRβ, under normal physiological conditions probably does not have a significant function at observed expression levels.

https://openalex.org/W2081457291,"Catabolite repression of a number of catabolic operons in bacilli is mediated by the catabolite control protein CcpA, the phosphocarrier protein HPr from the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport system (PTS), and a cis-acting DNA sequence termed the catabolite-responsive element (cre). We present evidence that CcpA interacts with HPr that is phosphorylated at Ser46 (Ser(P) HPr) and that these proteins form a specific ternary complex with cre DNA. Titration experiments following the circular dichroism signal of the cre DNA indicate that this complex consists of two molecules of Ser(P) HPr, a CcpA dimer, and the cre sequence. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that the domain structure of CcpA is similar to other members of the LacI/GalR family of helix-turn-helix proteins, comprised of a helix-turn-helix DNA domain and a C-terminal effector domain. NMR titration of Ser(P) HPr demonstrates that the isolated C-terminal domain of CcpA forms a specific complex with Ser(P) HPr but not with unphosphorylated HPr. Based upon perturbations to the NMR spectrum, we propose that the binding site of the C-terminal domain of CcpA on Ser(P) HPr forms a contiguous surface that encompasses both Ser(P)46 and His15, the site of phosphorylation by enzyme I of the PTS. This allows CcpA to recognize the phosphorylation state of HPr, effectively linking the process of sugar import via the PTS to catabolite repression in bacilli. Catabolite repression of a number of catabolic operons in bacilli is mediated by the catabolite control protein CcpA, the phosphocarrier protein HPr from the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport system (PTS), and a cis-acting DNA sequence termed the catabolite-responsive element (cre).

This allows CcpA to recognize the phosphorylation state of HPr, effectively linking the process of sugar import via the PTS to catabolite repression in bacilli. Catabolite repression (CR) 1The abbreviations used are: CR, catabolite repression; CcpA-C, C-terminal proteolytic domain of CcpA; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Ser(P) HPr, HPr phosphorylated at Ser46; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system. in Escherichia coli has provided a general paradigm for understanding the regulation of the synthesis of various catabolic enzymes in response to the availability of rapidly metabolizable carbon sources. The mechanism for CR in bacteria such as E. coli involves the cyclic AMP-dependent action of the catabolite gene activator protein, CAP (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobsen G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, however, the mechanism is completely different, because no cyclic AMP or CAP homologue is present (2Chambliss G.H. Sonensheim A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology and Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 213-219Google Scholar). CR in some bacilli and a few other Gram-positive organisms has been shown to be dependent on the catabolite control protein A (CcpA), which is a member of the LacI/GalR family of regulators (3Miwa Y. Saikawa M. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a cis-active operator DNA sequence, termed the catabolite-responsive element (cre), which has been identified in the promoter or in the 5′ region of 29B. subtilis genes (5Hueck C.J. Hillen W. Saier Jr, M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that CR is mechanistically linked to the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport system (PTS), which is responsible for the import of various sugars (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobsen G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser46 to Ala in the PTS phosphocarrier protein HPr results in resistance to CR for several catabolic genes in B. subtilis (6Deutscher J. Reizer J. Fischer C. Galinier A. Saier Jr., M.H. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ser46 in HPr is known to be phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent kinase that is activated by glycolytic intermediates such as fructose-1,6-diphosphate (7Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confirming the link between CR and the PTS, recent DNase I protection experiments have shown that cre sequences are specifically protected by CcpA only in the presence of HPr phosphorylated at Ser46 (Ser(P) HPr) (8Fujita Y. Miwa Y. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms for CR have been established; CcpA is known to bind to the cre sequence of the amyE operon in the absence of any corepressor (9Kim J.H. Guvener Z.T. Cho J.Y. Chung K.-C. Chambliss G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Voskuil M.I. Chambliss G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7014-7015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CR of the B. subtilis lev and bgl operons appear to be regulated by a mechanism involving Ser(P) HPr and the transcriptional activator LevR or the antiterminator LicT but not CcpA (11Krüger S. Gertz S. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Martin-Verstraete I. Stülke J. Klier A. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6919-6927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CcpA-mediated CR is therefore not the only mechanism for CR, although it is probably the dominant mechanism (13Gösseringer R. Küster E. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based upon these data, a general model for CR in Gram-positive bacteria has been proposed. The availability of a rapidly metabolizable carbon source results in elevated levels of glycolytic intermediates, which leads to the phosphorylation of Ser46 of HPr. Ser(P) HPr is proposed to interact with CcpA, resulting in negative regulation at the level of transcription of a number of catabolic genes. A direct interaction between CcpA and Ser(P) HPr is suggested based upon the observation that elution of Ser(P) HPr from a Ni2+-NTA column loaded with His-tagged CcpA is retarded, whereas elution of unphosphorylated HPr is not (14Deutscher J. Küster E. Bergstedt U. Charrier V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A specific ternary complex involving CcpA, Ser(P) HPr, and cre DNA is suggested by results from DNase I footprinting protection studies; specific protection ofcre sequences by CcpA only occurs in the presence of Ser(P) HPr (8Fujita Y. Miwa Y. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Gösseringer R. Küster E. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To date, many of the details of how this complex is formed are unclear. We have therefore used a variety of biophysical methods to characterize CcpA and its interactions with DNA and Ser(P) HPr. The results demonstrate the formation of a ternary complex between CcpA, Ser(P) HPr, and cre DNA. Binding of the binary CcpA·Ser(P) HPr complex to cre DNA is clearly distinguishable from the nonspecific complex formed between CcpA and cre DNA in the absence of Ser(P) HPr. Additionally, the binding site for CcpA on Ser(P) HPr allows CcpA to recognize the phosphorylation state of HPr, effectively linking the process of sugar import via the PTS to catabolite repression. His6-CcpA fromBacillus megaterium was purified using a Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) as described previously (13Gösseringer R. Küster E. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Hueck C.J. Kraus A. Schmiedel D. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following elution with imidazole, CcpA was dialyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Protein was quantified using the method of Gill and von Hippel (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). B. subtilis HPr was purified as described previously (17Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Wu L.-F. Deutscher J. Reddy P. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9158-9169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser(P) HPr was generated by phosphorylation and purified as described previously (18Wittekind M. Reizer J. Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9908-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).15N isotopic labeling of HPr was accomplished by growing bacteria in minimal medium with [15N]NH4Cl (Isotec) as the sole nitrogen source. Synthetic oligonucleotides (Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University) were purified as described previously (19Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA was annealed in 10 mm MgCl2by heating to 70 °C and slowly cooling to room temperature. Exact ratios of each strand for annealing reactions were determined by polyacrylamide gel analysis of multiple annealing reactions and silver staining. The double-stranded DNA was quantified assumingA 260 - 1.0 corresponds to 33 μg/ml. CD experiments were performed on an Aviv 62DS Circular Dichroism Spectrapolarimeter. Typically, experiments were performed with a 1.5 nm band width, and data points were taken every nm with a 15-s averaging time. DNA concentrations ranged from 5 to 40 μm, and either 1- or 10-mm path length cuvettes were used. The buffer used in the CD experiments was 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. Limited proteolysis experiments were carried out with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or clostripain (Worthington Enzymes) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. For clostripain digests, the buffer also contained 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Typically, the CcpA concentration was 1 mg/ml, and the ratio of substrate to protease was 100:1 (w/w). Time course reactions were quenched with 1 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (for trypsin), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (for chymotrypsin), or 10 mm EDTA (for clostripain) before analysis by either SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For samples analyzed by mass spectrometry, trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager Elite (University of Washington Mass Spectrometry Facility) using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as the matrix (21Kowalak J.A. Walsh K.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purification of CcpA-C was accomplished by limited proteolysis with clostripain (1 mg/ml CcpA concentration and 100:1 (w/w) ratio of CcpA to clostripain) for 90 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. Samples were lyophilized, resuspended in one-tenth the original volume with H2O, and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a 50 × 2-cm Sephacryl S-100 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Titrations of uniformly15N-labeled HPr (0.5 mm) or Ser(P) HPr (0.4 mm) with CcpA-C were carried out at 30 °C. The appropriate amounts of protein were dialyzed extensively in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and lyophilized. The HPr or Ser(P) HPr was dissolved in 500 μl of 10%2H2O/90% H2O; the CcpA-C was dissolved in 100 μl. Titrations were accomplished by the addition of CcpA, followed by a 15-min equilibration period before recording the [1H-15N]HSQC spectra. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX-500 MHz spectrometer. [1H-15N]HSQC spectra were recorded with spectral widths of 7002 Hz (1H) × 2000 Hz (15N). Data were processed using NMRPipes (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). Near-UV CD has been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in either the environment or structure of DNA (for review see Ref. 23Gray D.M. Ratliff R.L. Vaughan M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 389-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used CD studies to monitor a DNA oligonucleotide containing a consensus cre sequence in the presence of CcpA with and without Ser(P) HPr. Fig.1 shows various CD spectra of a 26-base pair duplex oligonucleotide in the presence and the absence of CcpA and Ser(P) HPr. The DNA sequence is 5′-GGGCTGATTTGAAAGCGCTAACAGGG-3′ and its complement, where the underlining denotes the 14-base pair consensus cresequence (5Hueck C.J. Hillen W. Saier Jr, M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Weickert M.J. Chambliss G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6238-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The presence of an equimolar amount of CcpA dimer (30 μm DNA duplex and 30 μm CcpA dimer) results in a moderate change in the DNA CD spectrum compared with free DNA; there is a slight decrease in ellipticity near 265 nm and a slight increase in ellipticity at ∼285 nm. However, the presence of Ser(P) HPr (60 μm) results in much more pronounced changes, with a maximal decrease in ellipticity occurring at ∼267 nm. The observation that the CD spectrum of DNA in the presence of CcpA is different from the free DNA spectrum suggests that there is some nonspecific interaction between the protein and DNA, even at 150 mm NaCl. However, it is clearly different from what is observed in the presence of Ser(P) HPr. Identical results are obtained under low ionic strength conditions; although the spectrum of the free DNA is slightly different, the spectra of DNA + CcpA and DNA + CcpA + Ser(P) HPr are superimposable with the spectra shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). We took advantage of the large change in CD signal observed upon the formation of the protein-DNA complex to determine an apparent binding constant. The results of titration of cre DNA (5 μm) with CcpA in the presence of excess Ser(P) HPr (40 μm) are shown in Fig. 2. The CD titration showed a clear isodichroic point (at 278 nm), indicating that a simple two-state equilibrium can be used to obtain an approximate affinity. The observation of an isodichroic point, which occurs at the same wavelength observed in the comparison of the spectra of DNA alone compared with the ternary complex (Fig. 1) and which is different from the isodichroic point (∼273 nm) for the comparison of the spectra of DNA in the presence of CcpA and the ternary complex, strongly suggests that the CD titration data are monitoring the formation of the ternary complex from the DNA and a CcpA·Ser(P) HPr complex. The change in CD signal at 267 nm is well fit to a single binding event with an apparent K d of 4.5 ± 0.5 μm. The determined K d represents theapparent dissociation constant for the formation of the ternary complex; because the CD signal is only sensitive to the formation of the ternary complex, it is not possible to measure the true dissociation constants directly for each of the possible binary complexes. The measured affinity of CcpA binding to DNA is in a range that allowed us to determine the stoichiometry for the interaction between Ser(P) HPr and the CcpA dimer from the change in the CD signal. The oligonucleotide used contains only one cre sequence and is therefore sufficient for only one CcpA dimer. The change in CD signal during a titration of 40 μm cre DNA and 40 μm CcpA dimer was essentially linear up to 80 μm Ser(P) HPr (data not shown); further additions had no further effect on the CD spectrum, indicating that saturation has been reached. These results indicate that the ternary complex contains two molecules of Ser(P) HPr. The CD results demonstrate the existence of a ternary complex formed between CcpA, Ser(P) HPr, and cre DNA. This supports the hypothesis that Ser(P) HPr is necessary for CcpA to bind specifically and with high affinity to cre sequences. Although these results do not directly rule out the possibility that the function of Ser(P) HPr is to increase the affinity of CcpA for DNA, specific or otherwise, the differences in the CD spectra for CcpA + DNA and CcpA + DNA + Ser(P) HPr suggest that Ser(P) HPr does alter the mode of DNA binding by CcpA. Other evidence also indicates that the interaction is specific to cre sequences; DNase I protection studies of CcpA in the presence of Ser(P) HPr show protection only withincre sequences (8Fujita Y. Miwa Y. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Kim J.H. Guvener Z.T. Cho J.Y. Chung K.-C. Chambliss G.H. J.

Biol. 1997; 266: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting that a ternary complex is specifically formed with the cre sequence only. In an effort to characterize CcpA and its interaction with either DNA or Ser(P) HPr further, we performed limited proteolysis experiments. Full-length CcpA (monomeric mass of ∼39 kDa) was subjected to proteolysis using trypsin, chymotrypsin, or clostripain, and the time points were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In each case, a fragment of ∼31 kDa was generated within the first minute and remained relatively resistant to further proteolysis (Fig.3). Samples from each digest were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy to determine the prominent cleavage sites. Some fragments whose identity could be unambiguously assigned based upon their molecular mass and cleavage sites for each enzyme are indicated in representative mass spectra for proteolysis samples (Fig. 4). The ∼31-kDa fragments observed as protease-resistant bands on the SDS gels all correspond to a large C-terminal fragment that begins between residues 54 and 59 and extends to the C terminus of the protein, Lys332.Figure 4MALDI-TOF mass spectra of proteolytic digests of CcpA.

Saikawa M. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Chauvaux S. Res. Microbiol. 1996; 147: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and is shown schematically in Fig. 4. The initial proteolytic fragments are consistent with this proposal; for each protease, cleavage occurs in the region between the DNA binding helix-turn-helix domain and the C-terminal domain, producing a stable C-terminal fragment. The observation that all three proteases cleave between residues 54 and 59 suggests that this region is most likely the separation point between the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal domain. Limited proteolysis experiments were also performed in the presence of Ser(P) HPr, cre DNA, or both to determine whether the formation of a binary or ternary complex would lead to protection of CcpA from cleavage. Under the conditions used for these experiments (typically 20–30 μm CcpA monomer, 100 μmSer(P) HPr, and 60 μm DNA), no change in resistance to proteolysis was observed; this is in contrast to results of similar experiments with PurR, its corepressor, and its cognate DNA sequence (26Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the susceptibility of the linker between the DNA binding helix-turn-helix domain and the C-terminal domain is not greatly altered by the formation of any of the possible complexes or that the dissociation of any complex with CcpA occurs sufficiently fast to allow proteolysis to occur. The CD results demonstrate the formation of a ternary complex between the cre-DNA, CcpA, and Ser(P) HPr. Previous elution-retardation experiments indicated that Ser(P) HPr interacts directly with CcpA (14Deutscher J. Küster E. Bergstedt U. Charrier V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar); however, the question remains as to which regions on CcpA and Ser(P) HPr are important for this interaction. Interactions between HPr and its PTS protein partners have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy (28Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Van Nuland N.A. Kroon G.J. Dijkstra K. Wolters G.K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T.

Academic Press, Lake Placid, NY1994: 439-445Google Scholar). We employed a similar approach, in which [1H-15N]HSQC spectra of15N-labeled HPr (or Ser(P) HPr) are monitored as a function of added CcpA. Because CcpA was not isotopically15N-labeled, its effect on HPr can be observed directly in these spectra. Based upon sequence similarities to proteins with known three-dimensional structures such as LacI (32Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1995; 271: 1247-1254Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and PurR (33Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the C-terminal effector domain is likely responsible for binding Ser(P) HPr; the N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain presumably binds DNA, as has been observed for a proteolytic fragment of LacI corresponding to the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (34Platt T. Files J.G. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 110-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the C-terminal domain was generated by limited proteolysis and purified. Quantities of the C-terminal domain (CcpA-C) sufficient for NMR studies were isolated by treatment of CcpA with clostripain, followed by purification by gel filtration. Similar to intact CcpA, which is a dimer (3Miwa Y. Saikawa M. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Hueck C.J. Kraus A. Schmiedel D. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), CcpA-C elutes on a gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, indicating that this domain, isolated from the DNA binding domain, also exists as a dimer in solution (data not shown). Aliquots of purified CcpA-C were titrated into a sample of 0.4 mm15N-labeled Ser(P) HPr, and NMR spectra were collected following each addition. Fig. 5shows [15N-1H]HSQC spectra at various points in the titration. Upon the addition of 0.25 mol equivalents CcpA-C, a subset of resonances (indicated in Fig. 5 A) either broaden dramatically or disappear completely. As additional CcpA-C is added, most peaks in the spectrum completely disappear. This behavior is indicative of line broadening of resonances whose environment is altered by the interaction between Ser(P) HPr and CcpA-C. Unfortunately, due to the large size of the complex (∼80 kDa; the CcpA-C dimer at ∼62 kDa and two Ser(P) HPr molecules at 9 kDa each), the resonances for Ser(P) HPr in the complex are not observed. The gradual disappearance of nonperturbed resonances, in contrast to the very rapid disappearance of a subset of resonances, suggests that exchange between free and bound is occurring in the fast to intermediate time regime (relative to the chemical shift differences of resonances in the free and bound states). 2In the fast to intermediate exchange regime, the observed line width for a peak will be the sum of the population-weighted average of the line widths of the free and bound species and an additional chemical exchange contribution that scales asf f f bΔωfb2, where f f and f b are the mole fractions of the free and bound species and Δωfbis the difference in chemical shift (in Hz) between the free and bound species. This predicts that all resonances that do not undergo a change in chemical shift upon complex formation will disappear (broaden) from the spectrum as a function of mole fraction of bound species, whereas resonances that undergo a change in chemical shift will broaden and disappear early in the titration due to the squared dependence on the chemical shift perturbation. This is precisely the behavior observed in the titration of CcpA-C into Ser(P) HPr. Therefore, resonances that are perturbed most and consequently have the largest chemical shift changes due to the formation of the complex should disappear early in the titration, allowing for the determination of which portions of Ser(P) HPr are most affected in its interaction with CcpA-C. Unfortunately, similar experiments with intact CcpA were impossible due to insufficient solubility of the intact protein. A similar titration of unphosphorylated HPr showed neither changes in intensity nor line width changes, indicating that CcpA-C does not bind unphosphorylated HPr, even at millimolar concentrations (Fig. 5 D). Thus, the NMR results confirm that the C-terminal domain is responsible for the formation of a binary complex with Ser(P) HPr and that this interaction absolutely requires that Ser46 be in its phosphorylated state. The residues that are selectively broadened at low concentrations of CcpA form a contiguous surface on Ser(P) HPr (Fig.6). The binding surface comprises two α-helices in HPr; Helix A, which includes residues within the active site of HPr (residues near His15), and Helix B, which includes Ser46. Interestingly, this surface is very similar to the surface recognized by both enzyme I (30Van Nuland N.A. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and enzyme IIA (29Van Nuland N.A. Kroon G.J. Dijkstra K. Wolters G.K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Rajagopal P. Klevit R.E. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry V. Academic Press, Lake Placid, NY1994: 439-445Google Scholar) of the PTS. The observation that the binding site for CcpA encompasses His15 suggests that CcpA can also discriminate whether HPr is phosphorylated at His15, consistent with previous results suggesting that CcpA does not interact with HPr phosphorylated at His15 (14Deutscher J. Küster E. Bergstedt U. Charrier V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) or mutated at His15 (35Reizer J. Bergstedt U. Galinier A. Küster E. Saier Jr., M.H. Hillen W. Steinmetz M. Deutscher J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5480-5486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction of HPr with enzyme IIA and probably enzyme I is diminished upon phosphorylation at Ser46, allowing the PTS to sense the phosphorylation state of Ser46 in HPr. Thus, the regulatory phosphorylation of Ser46 in HPr effectively coordinates the functions of the import of sugars and the synthesis of catabolic enzymes. The results presented here shed light on the general mechanism for CcpA-mediated CR and suggest a particular order of events from the initial phosphorylation of HPr at Ser46 to the repression of transcription by CcpA. The observation that a specific complex is formed between Ser(P) HPr and CcpA in the absence of DNA suggests that this interaction must precede the recognition of cresequences. The apparent increase in affinity for cre DNA by CcpA in the presence of Ser(P) HPr and the observation of the ternary complex also support this sequence of events. It is remarkable to consider the effect of Ser46phosphorylation on the binding of CcpA. Considering the apparentK d for the formation of the ternary complex (4.5 μm), phosphorylation of Ser46 on HPr leads to an increase in affinity for CcpA by at least 3 orders of magnitude over unphosphorylated HPr (no binding is observed at 0.5 mm HPr and CcpA, Fig. 5 D). NMR studies have revealed that phosphorylation of Ser46 does not induce a conformational change in HPr (36Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, CcpA must specifically recognize the phosphoserine moiety, suggesting that the interaction has a large electrostatic component. It is important to note that the two proteins are from different species; the CcpA used is from B. megaterium, and the HPr is from B. subtilis. However, the HPrs from these two species exhibit 81% sequence identity, and the CcpAs exhibit 76% sequence identity. More importantly, however, there are only three amino acid differences between the two species of HPr in the binding site for CcpA as identified by the present results (Fig. 6); residues Thr21, Ala25, and Gln56 in B. megaterium are replaced with Val21, Thr25, and Ala56 in B. subtilis. Therefore, the apparent K d measured in this heterologous system is probably similar to either homologous system. The crystal structure of another family member, the PurR-DNA-hypoxanthine ternary complex (33Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) provides insight into the mode of DNA binding by CcpA. Upon binding to DNA, a leucine (Leu56) from each monomer of PurR is inserted between bases through the minor groove of the DNA, resulting in a bend in the DNA of ∼45 °. A sequence comparison between CcpA and PurR indicates that this leucine is conserved, as are a number of residues preceding this side chain that make contacts to the DNA phosphate backbone in the PurR-DNA complex structure. The large changes in the DNA CD spectrum we observe are consistent with a significant structural change in the DNA, suggesting that CcpA, in the presence of Ser(P) HPr, may interact with DNA in a manner similar to PurR. This conclusion is supported by nearly identical CD spectral changes observed with PurR and its cognate DNA sequence. 3B. Jones, R. Klevit, and R. Brennan, unpublished results. The apparent structural similarity of CcpA to other helix-turn-helix proteins is interesting in light of its mode of action. Other helix-turn-helix proteins require small molecules for regulation, which upon binding cause the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences and affect transcription in some manner. Although the end result is the same, CcpA must bind another protein, namely Ser(P) HPr, to manifest a change in its DNA binding ability. A structural insight as to how this might occur can be gained from the three-dimensional structures of LacI and its complex with the coeffector isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (32Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1995; 271: 1247-1254Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In this case, binding of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to LacI results in a conformational change within the C-terminal effector domain that is proposed to reposition the DNA binding domains of each monomer relative to one another. Whether Ser(P) HPr performs its regulatory role in an analogous manner must await future characterization of this system. We thank David Baker for use of the CD spectrometer, Peter Brzovic for assistance with MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, and Richard Brennan for initial proteolysis suggestions, for providing us with purified PurR and DNA, and for helpful discussions."

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Several topological models have been proposed based on computer-assisted analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of MRP and of other members of this subgroup of ABC transporters (39Stride B.D.

Indeed, such data is limited to observations made by epitope mapping (43Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J.R.

We have used a biochemical approach to initiate topology mapping of the membrane-associated regions of MRP. This method is based on the insertion of a 10-amino acid antigenic peptide (HA epitope from influenza virus) in predicted hydrophilic peaks from the TM regions of MRP (37Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins are then expressed in HeLa cells to test their capacity to confer drug resistance, and the polarity of the epitope tag with respect to the plasma membrane (intra-versus extracellular) is then determined by immunofluorescence in intact or permeabilized cells using a monoclonal antibody directed against the epitope tag. Here, we report on the topology mapping of the two membrane-associated regions from the amino-terminal half of MRP, including the unique domain characteristic of the MRP class of ABC transporters. Genetycin (G418) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Ontario), vincristine (VCR) from Sigma, and etoposide (VP-16), Adriamycin (ADM), and actinomycin-D (ACTD) were obtained from the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario) or Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Baie d'Urfe, Quebec). The protein assay reagent was from Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd. (Mississauga, Ontario), the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (version 2.1, RPN 1523) was from Amersham Canada (Oakville, Ontario). The monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin A (HA) antibody 16B12 (Babco Labs, Richmond, CA), the monoclonal anti-MRP antibody QCRL-1 (ID Laboratories, London, Ontario), and the goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine (TRITC) or cyanine (Cy3TM) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario) were obtained commercially. The HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The full-length human MRP cDNA was a generous gift of Drs. R. Deeley and S. Cole (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario). HA epitopes were inserted at discrete locations in MRP as 10-amino acid peptides (YPYDVPDYAS) by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA, as described previously (36Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4402-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to contain a unique NheI site to facilitate the insertion of additional tags. The positions of epitope insertions in the amino acid sequence of the protein are listed in Fig. 1, and the oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are shown in TableI. Briefly, a full-length cDNA for human MRP cloned into the plasmid vector pBluescript (pBl/MRP) was digested with SacI andSphI, and a 2.7-kilobase restriction fragment (polylinker to position 2695) that corresponds to the 5′-half of the MRPcDNA was cloned into the corresponding sites of M13mp18 (M13/MRP). To facilitate subsequent cloning procedures, two silent mutations generating novel SacII (position 12; mutagenic oligonucleotide 3′-CGTACCGCGAGGCGCCGAAGACGTC-5′) and AflII (position 1546; mutagenic oligonucleotide 3′-CTAGTTTCACGAATTCGAAATACGGAC-5′) restriction sites were introduced in the MRP cDNA. For this, mutagenic oligonucleotides were annealed to single-stranded M13/MRPDNA template and mutagenesis carried out using a commercially availablein vitro kit. The 2.7-kilobase SacI toSphI fragment containing novel SacII andAflII sites was reinserted into pBl/MRP prior to cloning of the full-length modified MRP cDNA (as aSacI to KpnI fragment) in the mammalian expression vector pCB6 (46Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13782-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Insertional mutagenesis in the amino-terminal half of MRP (constructs 2–5, 6a, 7, and 8a) was carried out by in vitro mutagenesis using single strand M13/MRP DNA template and the oligos listed in Table I. The integrity of the mutagenized MRP cDNA inserts was verified by nucleotide sequencing (47Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar), and the modified MRPcDNA inserts were subcloned either asSacII/BamHI (constructs 2, 3, and 4),BamHI/AflII (constructs 5 and 6a), orAflII/Eco NI (constructs 7 and 8a) fragments into pCB6/MRP. In the case of mutants 1 and 9, the HA epitope was introduced by cloning a short double-stranded segment composed of two complementary oligonucleotides into pre-existing restriction sites, as described previously (37Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HA epitopes were inserted in this way at nucleotide positions 12 (SacII site) and 1959 (Eco NI site) using oligos with cohesive ends compatible with the respective cloning site. A similar cloning strategy was used to insert a second consecutive HA epitope in constructs 6b and 8b, using the unique NheI site present in the first inserted HA epitope.Table IOligonucleotides used for epitope insertion by site-directed mutagenesis1Arg-41-bAmino acid residue immediately preceeding the site of insertion of the influenza virus HA epitope.(HA epitope)1-cInfluenza virus HA epitope sequence.Gly-5Glu-127(HA epitope)Arg-1282 (363)1-aNucleotide position in sequence of MRP published by Cole et al.

Open table in a new tab Drug-sensitive human HeLa cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). pCB6/MRP constructs were transfected into HeLa cells by calcium phosphate co-precipitation, as we have previously described (36Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4402-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After 2 days, cells were subcultured at a 1:5 dilution and stable transfectants were selected in medium containing G418 (600 μg/ml). Mass populations of G418R transfectants were harvested after 9 days and subcultured in medium containing the VP-16 (final concentration 250 ng/ml) to select mass populations of drug-resistant cell clones overexpressing the tagged MRP proteins. VP-16Rpopulations were harvested 1–2 weeks later, expanded in culture, and frozen at −80 °C in 90% serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Crude membrane fractions from transfected HeLa cells were isolated as described previously (48Devault A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1652-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 70% confluency and harvested in cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) containing sodium citrate. The cell pellet was homogenized (Dounce homogenizer, 25 strokes) in buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors leupeptin, 2 μg/ml, aprotinin, 2 μg/ml, and pepstatin, 1 μg/ml. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (400 g/10 min) and a crude membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation of the supernatant fraction at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The protein concentration in the crude membrane fraction was determined by the method of Bradford using a commercially available reagent (Bio-Rad). For immunodetection of recombinant MRP, 25 μg of protein was resolved on a SDS-containing 6.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoblots were incubated with the MRP-specific monoclonal antibody QCRL-1 at a dilution of 1:150, or the monoclonal anti-HA antibody 16B12 at a 1:3000 dilution, and specific immune complexes were revealed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:10000) (Amersham). Drug cytotoxicity assays were performed using sulforhodamine B to stain cellular proteins, as described previously (49Tang-Wai D.F. Brossi A. Arnold L.D. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6470-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For this, 6 × 103 cells from VP-16R mass populations expressing independently tagged MRP proteins and drug-sensitive HeLa control cells were seeded in 96-well titer plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing increasing concentrations of ADM, ACTD, VCR, or VP-16. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 96 h, fixed in 17% trichloroacetic acid in PBS, and cellular protein was stained for 10 min at room temperature with 0.4% sulforhodamine B in a 1% acetic acid solution. The plates were washed with water, dried, and the stain dissolved in 0.2 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 9). Quantification of sulforhodamine B was done using an automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Rad Model 450) at a wavelength of 490 nm. The relative plating efficiency of each clone was determined by dividing the absorbance observed at a given drug concentration by the absorbance detected in the same clone in the absence of drug. Localization of the epitope was performed by immunofluorescence on 3 × 104 cells from VP-16R mass populations of individually taggedMRP transfectants that had been grown on glass coverslips for 2 days. Drug-sensitive HeLa cells were used as a negative control. Nonpermeabilized HeLa cells were first incubated with the monoclonal antibody 16B12 (1:250) in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized and blocked with PBS, containing 0.05% Nonidet-P40, 5% goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 15 min. A secondary antibody (Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or cyanine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) was applied in the same buffer (1:200 or 1:800 dilutions, respectively). In experiments with permeabilized cells, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above, and blocked with PBS, containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5% goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature prior to exposure to the secondary antibody (1:200 or 1:800 dilutions). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using standard epifluorescence optics (Nikon). Combined hydropathy analysis of MRP and other ABC transporters suggests a protein with two hydrophilic ATP-binding domains (amino acids ∼615–840 and ∼1260–1532), two membrane-associated regions in the amino-terminal half of the protein (amino acids ∼1–190 and ∼310–615), and one membrane-associated region in the COOH-terminal half of the protein delineated by residues ∼970 and 1260 (Fig. 1 A). In addition, subjecting the MRP sequence to different hydropathy algorithms, hydrophobic moment analyses, or TMAP and TOPRED analyses suggested different numbers and positions of TM domains in the three highly hydrophobic regions of MRP (data not shown). To resolve these discrepancies, we have analyzed the membrane topology of the two predicted membrane-associated regions in the amino-terminal half of MRP (residues 4–653) by the epitope insertion method that we previously used to determine the membrane topology of P-glycoprotein (37Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This involved insertion of the antigenic epitope tag YPYDVPDYAS (HA) in some of the most hydrophilic peaks of these membrane-associated regions (Fig. 1 A). Single epitopes were inserted at amino acid positions 4 (construct 1), 127 (construct 2), 163 (construct 3), 271 (construct 4), 417 (construct 5), 461 (construct 6a), 529 (construct 7), 574 (construct 8a), and 653 (construct 9) (Fig. 1, B andC). Since the single epitopes inserted at positions 461 and 574 were found to be poorly accessible to the anti-epitope antibody (see below; Fig. 5), two copies of the HA epitope were inserted at these positions (construct 6b and 8b, respectively). The wild-typeMRP and mutant HA-tagged MRP cDNAs (numbered 1–9) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCB6 and transfected into HeLa cells. Stable transfectants were selected in G4"

Measuring both Ca2+ and Mn2+ entry into store-depleted cells we show in the present study that inhibition of the capacitative pathway is absent in various forms of chronic granulomatous disease. To establish the possible relationship between inhibition of the capacitative pathway and ability of O·̄2 production and consequent membrane depolarization, gradual changes of the membrane potential were evoked in neutrophils of healthy individuals. This was accomplished by pharmacological manipulation of the membrane potential and by variations of the concentration and type of the stimulant. Close relationship was observed between membrane depolarization and inhibition of Mn2+ entry through the capacitative transport route. Our results provide an explanation for the inhibitory action of fMLP and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on capacitative cation influx and reveal that upon physiological stimulation, Ca2+ entry into neutrophils is restricted by the depolarization accompanying O·̄2 production.

Stimulation of neutrophil granulocytes by various receptor agonists is accompanied by an increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This Ca2+ transient is a crucial element in the transduction of extracellular signals, leading to the activation of different effector responses (e.g.degranulation, superoxide production) of the cells (1Scharff O. Foder B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 547-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Pozzan T. Lew D.P. Wollheim C.B. Tsien R.Y.

The Ca2+ signal of neutrophils consists of two components: (i) a rapid, transient increase of [Ca2+] i 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] i, intracellular Ca2+; CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; di-O-C5(3), 3–3′-dipentyloxacarbocyanine; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; fMLP,N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; phox, phagocyte oxidase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TG, thapsigargin. due to Ca2+ release from the internal stores induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and (ii) a sustained elevation of [Ca2+] i due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space (1Scharff O. Foder B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 547-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Neutrophil granulocytes do not possess voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, but there is growing evidence that emptying of the internal Ca2+ stores initiates Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu,i.e. the Ca2+ content of the stores regulates Ca2+-conducting channels in the plasma membrane (4Montero M. Alvarez J. Garcia Sancho J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Biochem.

This Ca2+ entry is often referred to as capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ influx (8Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). In human neutrophil granulocytes the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ influx is more complex: agonists of several chemotactic receptors,N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and platelet-activating factor, initiate Ca2+ influx by emptying the internal stores in an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent manner while fMLP, but not platelet activating factor, was also shown to inhibit capacitative Ca2+ influx (9Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13055-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar action of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been reported, too (9Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13055-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10McCarthy S.A. Hallam T.J. Merritt J.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Foder B.

The inhibitory effect of both fMLP and PMA is absent in undifferentiated HL-60 cells and develops gradually during the differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (13Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26911-26919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the similarity in the basic feature, i.e. blocking the capacitative Ca2+ influx, several differences were also described in the characteristics of the inhibition brought about by the two compounds. (i) The fMLP-induced inhibition is transient while the effect of PMA is sustained (9Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13055-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C prevents the inhibitory effect of fMLP only partially but blocks the effect of PMA completely (9Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13055-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The inhibitory action of fMLP is sensitive to pertussis toxin whereas the effect of PMA is not influenced by the toxin (14Alonso M.T. Mollinedo F. Barasoain I. Alvarez J. Garcia Sancho J. J. Leuk. Biol. 1996; 60: 323-327Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). (iv) Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases prolongs the inhibition elicited by fMLP but it does not affect the PMA-induced response (12Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3963-3967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations a role of protein phosphorylation was suggested but the intervening kinase(s) remained unidentified (9Montero M. Garcia Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol.

The characteristics of Ca2+ influx inhibition by fMLP and PMA are remarkably similar to the features of superoxide production, evoked by the same agents (15Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol.

Generation of superoxide by the NADPH oxidase induces rapid depolarization of the cells mainly due to electron transfer from the intracellular milieu to the extracellular environment (17Seligmann B.E.

However, the possibility of a causal relationship between inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx by fMLP and PMA and depolarization coupled to superoxide generation elicited by the same agents has never been raised. In the present study two approaches were used to test this hypothesis. First the effect of fMLP and PMA on capacitative Ca2+influx was investigated in neutrophil granulocytes of patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), i.e. in cells which are unable to produce superoxide, but possess the capacitative Ca2+ entry mechanism. The second approach consisted of testing the inhibitory action of fMLP and PMA on Ca2+ influx in healthy neutrophils, where O·̄2production or membrane potential have been modulated by pharmacological means. The obtained results reveal a close relationship between plasma membrane depolarization and inhibition of Ca2+ influx into neutrophil granulocytes. The suggested mechanism may play a significant autoregulatory role in healthy granulocytes, whereas in CGD cells the lack of inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry may represent an alteration of cellular Ca2+ metabolism. To our knowledge this is the first report showing disturbed regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry in a human disease. Fura-2/AM was obtained from Calbiochem; Percoll from Pharmacia; dimethyl sulfoxide, PMA, fMLP, cytochrome c, and thapsigargin were from Sigma and di-O-C5(3) from Molecular Probes. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI) was the kind gift of Dr. Arvind Nanda (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). All the other reagents were of research grade. The routinely used medium (referred to as H medium) contained in mm: NaCl 145, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl20.8, HEPES 10, glucose 5, pH 7.4. The Ca2+-free medium consisted of the same constituents except for CaCl2 and was supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA. In the KCl based H medium NaCl was replaced by KCl. Human neutrophils were prepared from blood of healthy volunteers by dextran sedimentation followed by Percoll gradient centrifugation according to the procedure described in Ref.25Hjorth R.

Cells were finally suspended in H medium and kept at room temperature. Preparations contained more than 95% neutrophils, viability as determined by erythrosin B dye exclusion exceeded 97%. The diagnosis of CGD was established on the basis of serious reduction of O·̄2 production and by detection of the molecular defect using Western blot analysis. Qualitative investigation of O·̄2 generation was carried out by the nitro blue tetrazolium slide test as described in Ref. 26Johansen K.S. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. C. 1983; 91: 349-354Google Scholar. Quantitative measurements consisted of determination of chemiluminescence (27Allen R.C.

The amount of cytochrome b 558 in the separated membrane fraction was determined on the basis of the heme spectrum as detailed in Ref. 29Roos D. de Boer M. Borregaard N. Bjerrum O.W. Valerius N.H.

Expression of the different subunits of NADPH oxidase was assessed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies against gp91 phox and p22 phox and polyclonal antibodies against p47 phox . All the applied antibodies were developed and kindly provided by Professor Dirk Roos (Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Genetic analysis of the mutation underlying CGD was carried out by Professor Dirk Roos (CLB, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and the results were reported in Ref. 30Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F.

F., A. R., and G. B.) investigated in the present study had a mutation on the cytochromebβ (CYBB) gene and expressed neither gp91 phox nor p22 phox in their neutrophils. One patient (I.

For loading with the fluorescent dye, cells (5 × 107/ml) were incubated in the presence of 4 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter cells were washed to remove the extracellular dye and resuspended in H medium at a density of 5 × 107/ml. Fura-2-loaded cells were stored at room temperature. For measurement of [Ca2+] i, Fura-2-loaded cells (106) were suspended in 3 ml of H medium and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to addition of any agent. Changes of the fluorescence were recorded in a Deltascan dual-wavelength spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick NJ) using wavelengths 340 and 380 nm for excitation and 505 nm for emission. Measurements were performed at 37 °C with continuous stirring. [Ca2+] i was calculated from the ratio of fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm, following the method detailed in Ref. 31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Data were analyzed with the Felix software (PTI). Mn2+influx measurements were performed under the same conditions as described for [Ca2+] i except that the excitation wavelength was 360 nm. At this wavelength, fluorescence of Fura-2 is quenched by Mn2+ but it is not influenced by changes of [Ca2+] i (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, Mn2+ influx was initiated by adding 300 μm MnCl2. Changes of the membrane potential were monitored by the potential sensitive fluorescent dye 3–3′-dipentyloxacarbocyanine (di-O-C5(3)) as desribed in Refs. 17Seligmann B.E. Gallin J.I. J. Clin.

Cells (106) were suspended in 3 ml of H medium in the presence of 100 nmdi-O-C5(3) and stimuli were added after binding of the probe reached equilibrium and the fluorescence had stabilized. Changes of the fluorescence were recorded in the spectrofluorimeter used for [Ca2+] i measurements or in a Perkin-Elmer 3000 spectrofluorimeter with wavelengths 484 and 510 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Calibration of the fluorescent signal was carried out in the presence of 2 μg/ml valinomycin and varying K+ concentration in the external medium, as described previously (32Seligmann B.E. Gallin E.K.

The amount of O·̄2 generated either by neutrophils or the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction was determined photometrically as the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome cdetected at 550 nm (28Markert M. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (106 cells) were suspended and preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 1.2 ml of H medium supplemented with 100 μm cytochrome c. The absorbance of the sample was followed continuously at 550 nm by a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer. For generation of O·̄2by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, 3 ml of H medium supplemented with 100 μm cytochrome c and 500 μm xanthine was incubated with 20 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase for 5 min at 37 °C. The absorbance of the sample was read after 5 min. O·̄2 production was calculated using an absorption coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1 for cytochrome c. Data are presented either as representative traces of the indicated number of experiments performed on cells of different donors or as the mean ± S.E. of the number of determinations indicated (n). For the selective study of the capacitative Ca2+ influx, neutrophil granulocytes were treated with the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG). In this way the agonist-responsive internal Ca2+ stores could be depleted even in the absence of increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and full activation of the capacitative pathway could be achieved both in the absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+ (34Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar). Comparative experiments were carried out on neutrophil granulocytes of healthy individuals which produced high amounts of O·̄2 upon stimulation by fMLP and PMA, and on cells of CGD patients lacking a functional oxidase. The active O·̄2producing enzyme is a multicomponent structure and genetic defects have been described in both subunits of the membrane-bound cytochromeb 558 (gp91 phox and p21 phox ) and in the two phagocyte-specific cytosolic proteins (p47 phox and p67 phox ) (30Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Német K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Segal A.W.

We carried out measurements on granulocytes of patients with verified defects in the gene of gp91 phox or p47 phox . Fig. 1 shows the effect of fMLP and PMA on the TG-induced capacitative influx of normal (A) and two different types of CGD cells (B and C). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ TG elicited a transient increase of [Ca2+] i which declined slowly, due to the extrusion of Ca2+ by the plasma membrane pump. The resting level of [Ca2+] i as well as the amplitude and kinetics of TG-induced increase of [Ca2+] i were basically similar in healthy and CGD cells. Addition of 1 mm CaCl2 (raising the free [Ca2+] to approximately 0.5 mm) after 10 min incubation in the presence of TG, induced a rapid increase of [Ca2+] i both in normal (Fig. 1 A, trace 1) and in CGD (Fig. 1, B and C trace 1) cells, indicating capacitative entry of Ca2+ into the neutrophils. In cells not treated with TG, the addition of CaCl2 caused no detectable change of [Ca2+] i confirming the necessity of store depletion for the activation of the influx (not shown). Pretreatment of the normal cells with 10 nm PMA (Fig. 1 A, trace 2) or 1 μm fMLP (Fig. 1 A, trace 3) 1 min prior to addition of CaCl2 reduced the amplitude of the increase in [Ca2+] i by 93.7 ± 5 and 82.5 ± 8.4% (n = 4), respectively. Application of the same protocol in CGD cells resulted in a strikingly different pattern of [Ca2+] i response (Fig. 1, Band C): neither PMA (traces 2) nor fMLP (traces 3) had any inhibitory effect on the increase of [Ca2+] i . Identical results were obtained in all experiments carried out on the neutrophil granulocytes of two patients lacking gp91 phox (G. B. and A. R.) and one patient (I. B.) with p47 phox deficiency. Apparently, the observed alteration in the operation of the capacitative Ca2+pathway of CGD cells did not depend on which subunit of the NADPH oxidase was genetically defective. The rapid rise in [Ca2+] i after addition of CaCl2 to store-depleted cells reflects the sum of two opposing processes: Ca2+ influx through the capacitative pathway and Ca2+ extrusion via the plasma membrane Ca2+pump. The capacitative pathway of many different cell types including human neutrophils is also permeable for Mn2+, whereas Mn2+ is not a substrate for the Ca2+ pump. Thus, for isolated study of the capacitative influx Mn2+ is a better indicator than Ca2+ itself. As the reaction of Fura-2 with Mn2+ results in quenching of the fluorescence of the dye, Mn2+ entry into the cells is represented by and proportional to the detected decrease of Fura-2 fluorescence (5Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the following experiments we examined the effect of fMLP and PMA on the TG-evoked Mn2+ entry. Cells were exposed to 100 nm TG in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. After a 10-min incubation, 300 μm MnCl2 was added. As shown in Fig. 2 (traces 1) the addition of MnCl2 induced a rapid quenching of fluorescence representing Mn2+ entry via the capacitative pathway opened by the store depletion. A rapid fall in fluorescence occurred in the first 30 s (about 80% of total decrease of fluorescence), followed by a slower phase of quenching. In control experiments, where the cells were not treated with TG, MnCl2 caused only negligible decrease in fluorescence (data not shown), proving that the plasma membrane of resting neutrophils is relatively impermeable for Mn2+ and the dye is localized almost exclusively in the cytosol. When normal cells were stimulated by 10 nm PMA (Fig. 2 A, trace 2) or 1 μm fMLP (Fig. 2 A, trace 3) 1 min before the addition of MnCl2, the quenching by Mn2+ was strongly reduced (69.2 ± 8.9% inhibition by PMA,n = 4 and 66 ± 3.2% by fMLP n = 4) indicating that both fMLP and PMA inhibited Mn2+ influx into the cells. Fig. 2, B and C (traces 2 and 3), summarizes the effect of the same agonists on the TG-induced Mn2+ entry in gp91 phox (B) and p47 phox -deficient (C) CGD cells. As the nearly parallel experimental recordings show, PMA and fMLP were both ineffective in reducing the TG-induced Mn2+ entry into the cells. In four experiments carried out on gp91 phox -deficient CGD patients the rate of Mn2+entry in the presence of fMLP or PMA was even slightly higher (by 6.7 ± 7 and 6.2 ± 4.5% respectively) than in the absence of any stimulator. In the experiment carried out on p47 phox -deficient neutrophils, fMLP induced 8% and PMA effected 14% inhibition of Mn2+ entry. Both methods, widely used for investigation of Ca2+ entry through the capacitative pathway provided similar results: neither fMLP nor PMA inhibits this transport route in CGD cells. We wished to establish whether the altered regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry into CGD cells might be related to the characteristic functional defects observed in this disease. To this end O·̄2 production and the consequent membrane potential changes had to be checked in the cells of the CGD patients investigated in this study. When stimulated with PMA, superoxide production was not detectable in the granulocytes of three gp91 phox -deficient patients (N. M., A. R., and G. B.). The neutrophils of one gp91 phox patient (L. F.) produced less than 10%, whereas the cells of the p47 phox -deficient patient (I. B.) produced less than 5% of the control value. Stimulation of intact neutrophils by fMLP or PMA was shown to induce rapid depolarization of the cells, the main component of which seems to be the electrogenic operation of the oxidase. In accordance with this suggestion, CGD cells were reported to undergo only marginal depolarization upon fMLP or PMA treatment (17Seligmann B.E. Gallin J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Whitin J.C. Chapman C.E. Simons E.R. Chovaniec M.E. Cohen H.J. J. Biol.

In our experiments addition of PMA or fMLP to neutrophils obtained from healthy individuals resulted in a sudden depolarization of similar amplitude but with different kinetics (Fig.3). Whereas PMA induced a stable depolarization lasting over 5 min (Fig. 3 A), the fMLP-evoked depression of the membrane potential showed a partial recovery after 2 min (Fig. 3 B). Both PMA and fMLP had only a marginal effect on the membrane potential of neutrophil granulocytes obtained either from gp91 phox -deficient (Fig. 3) or p47 phox -deficient (not shown) patients. Our measurements carried out on healthy and CGD cells are thus in full agreement with previous reports (17Seligmann B.E. Gallin J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,18Whitin J.C. Chapman C.E. Simons E.R. Chovaniec M.E. Cohen H.J. J. Biol.

The experiments carried out on neutrophil granulocytes of CGD patients revealed that both fMLP and PMA failed to inhibit capacitative Ca2+ influx in these defective cells and they both failed to induce any significant depolarization. In our next experiments we wanted to test the correlation of these two parameters in healthy neutrophils under conditions where gradual changes of the membrane potential could be evoked. As a first approach we tried to reduce the agonist induced depolarization by pharmacological means and study the effect of fMLP and PMA on the Ca2+ influx under these conditions. For this purpose we applied a combined pretreatment using two drugs which affect charge movements in two different ways. The NADPH-oxidase inhibitor DPI reduces the rate of electron efflux through the oxidase (38Ellis J.A. Mayer S.J. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) whereas the K+-selective ionophore, valinomycin, allows charge compensation through outward movement of K+. These two agents with different sites of action were previously described to clamp efficiently the PMA-induced depolarization (33Nanda A. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10816-10820Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The addition of 10 nm PMA after 10 min incubation with TG induced a rapid depolarization response (Fig. 4 A, trace b) whereas pretreatment of the cells with valinomycin and DPI largely diminished the depolarizing effect of PMA (Fig. 4 A, trace a). Clamping of the membrane potential by these agents was similarly effective when fMLP was used as a stimulus (Fig.4 B). Both DPI and valinomycin, when applied separately, were able to reduce only partially the membrane potential change induced by either stimulating agent (data not shown). The effect of pretreatment with valinomycin and DPI on the PMA-induced inhibition of the capacitative influx is demonstrated in Fig.4 C. Addition of CaCl2 to store-depleted control cells resulted in an incr"

Here we have analyzed interactions of recombinant CBF with DNA using hydroxyl radical footprinting and methylation interference assays. In the CBF-DNA complex, three separate DNA regions are protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage, one located over and immediately adjacent to the CCAAT motif itself and the other two located on both sides of the CCAAT motif. The methylation interference assay showed, however, that only in the CCAAT motif region methylation of bases was able to interfere with the formation of a CBF-DNA complex, suggesting that CBF makes sequence-specific contacts only in the CCAAT motif region. To further determine the specific DNA sequences necessary for CBF binding, we employed a polymerase chain reaction-mediated random binding site selection method. This analysis showed that CBF binding to DNA requires the CCAAT sequence and other specific sequences immediately flanking both ends of the CCAAT motif. We also showed that the nature of the flanking nucleotide sequences affects the affinity of CBF for DNA. Interestingly, most of the CCAAT motifs present in various higher eukaryotic promoters correspond to the CBF binding sites that were selected, consistent with the hypothesis that these motifs are binding sites for CBF and, hence, that CBF could regulate transcription of numerous eukaryotic genes.

In many higher eukaryotic class II promoters, CCAAT motifs (or ATTGG motifs in the opposite strand), are often found between −50 and −110 relative to the start of transcription (1Dorn A. Bollekens J.

The precise location of these CCAAT motifs and the promoter sequences around the motif of a specific gene are highly conserved during evolution. Experiments in several laboratories have shown that in many eukaryotic promoters, including tissue-specific and inducible promoters, the mammalian heterotrimeric CCAAT-binding protein CBF (also called NF-Y and CP1) binds to these CCAAT motifs. Mutations of the CCAAT motif that cause loss of CBF binding also decrease the transcriptional activity of these promoters, suggesting that CBF is essential for optimal transcriptional activation of these promoters (5Maity S.N.

The conserved segments of CBF-A and CBF-C show amino acid sequence similarities with the histone-fold motifs of histone H2B and H2A, respectively (21Li X.Y. Mantovani R. Huisjduijnen R.H.V. Andre I.

Mutational analyses of the three CBF subunits demonstrated that the histone-fold motifs of CBF-A and CBF-C are needed to form a CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer; this heterodimer generates a hybrid surface, which then interacts with CBF-B to form the heterotrimeric CBF molecule (23Sinha S.

Our previous mutational study also showed that each CBF subunit contains a domain that interacts with DNA, indicating that in each of these CBF subunits specific amino acids are involved in formation of the CBF-DNA complex. Previous studies showed that mutations of any nucleotide in the CCAAT sequence either decrease or abolish CBF binding, suggesting that CBF is a bona fide CCAAT-binding factor (1Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 5Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B.

However, it was also shown that some of the DNA sequences containing CCAAT do not bind CBF, indicating that specific nucleotide sequences other than CCAAT are necessary for CBF binding. Moreover, several other proteins that bind to CCAAT motifs of specific promoters have been isolated (2Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 27Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian T.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6709-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Together, these studies raised the question whether the CCAAT motif in a promoter binds only to a specific protein such as CBF or to a heterogeneous set of DNA-binding proteins whose requirement of an intact CCAAT motif for binding seems less rigorous than for CBF. This in turn underscored the need to better define the sequences in the CBF binding sites that are required for CBF binding. In the present study, we analyzed in more detail the interactions between the heterotrimeric CBF and DNA using hydroxyl radical footprinting and methylation interference assays. By utilizing a polymerase chain reaction-mediated random binding site selection method, we defined the specific DNA sequences necessary for CBF binding. Specific sequences flanking the CCAAT motif were identified that are involved in the formation of a CBF-DNA complex. Interestingly, the flanking sequences that we found to favor CBF binding also flank CCAAT motifs in many eukaryotic promoters, consistent with the notion that CBF is the major CCAAT-motif binding protein which participates in the regulation of transcription of many eukaryotic genes. Each of the three full-length CBF subunits was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified as described by Coustry et al. (13Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DNA binding of recombinant CBF was performed as described by Sinha et al.(20Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides −130 to −30 of the pro-α2(1) collagen promoter and nucleotides −140 to −45 of the pro-α1(1) collagen promoter were used for hydroxyl radical footprinting. The DNA fragments were labeled at their 3′ ends with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase. Hydroxyl radical footprinting reactions were performed according to the method of Dixon et al. (29Dixon W.J. Hayes J.J. Levin J.R. Weinder M.F. Dombroski B.A. Tullius T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 380-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, the labeled DNA fragments (1–2 × 105 cpm) were incubated with pure recombinant CBF subunits (about 120 ng of total protein) in a 50-μl volume of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% glycerol for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA fragments without CBF were similarly incubated. To initiate hydroxyl radical-mediated DNA cleavage, 6 μl of a mixture containing 2 μl of Fe(II)EDTA (125 mm Fe(II) and 250 mm EDTA), 2 μl of 28 mm sodium ascorbate, and 2 μl of 0.8% hydrogen peroxide was added to the DNA solutions. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at room temperature and was stopped by adding 150 μl of stop solution containing 112 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), 10 μl of 0.1 m thiourea, 25 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, 2 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, and 1 μl (5 mg/ml) of tRNA. The mixtures were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and DNAs were precipitated by ethanol. The DNA samples were separated on a 8% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel. Partial methylation of end-labeled DNA was performed as described by Baldwin et al.(30Baldwin A.S. Oettinger M. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 12.3.1-12.3.7Google Scholar). One picomole of labeled DNA fragments was incubated in a 200-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate at room temperature for 5 min and was stopped by adding 40 μl of dimethyl sulfate stop buffer containing 1.5 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μl (5 mg/ml) of tRNA. DNA was precipitated by ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 10 μl of TE. The methylated DNA (6 × 104 cpm) was incubated with recombinant CBF subunits (100 ng) in a 20-μl DNA binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 20 min. After the reactions were fractionated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, the CBF-bound DNA and unbound DNA were each eluted from the gel in a buffer containing TE and 0.3 m sodium acetate, purified by ElutipKit (Schleicher & Schuell), cleaved after incubation with piperidine, precipitated, resuspended, and separated on an 8% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel. Two different 67-base oligonucleotides, termed R1 and R2, were synthesized and used as primers in two independent binding site selection experiments. Both were flanked by sequences complementary to two 18-base oligonucleotides primers A and B containing XhoI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively, for cloning. The sequences of these four oligonucleotides are as follows: oligo R1, 5′-CTGAGTCCCCTCGAGCTAGCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTTGGTCTAGACCTCCGGCT-3′; oligo R2, 5′-CTGAGTCCCCTCGAGCTAGCNNNNNNNNNNNNATTGGNNNNNNNNNNTTTGGTCTAGACCTCCGGCT-3′; primer A, 5′-CTGAGTCCCCTCGAGCTA-3′; primer B, 5′-ACCAGATCTGGAGGCCGA-3′. Double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing oligo R1 or R2 to 5-fold molar excess of primer B and extending with Taq DNA polymerase at 72 °C for 30 min in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled DNA (50 fmol) was incubated in a 10-μl volume of DNA binding buffer together with the three recombinant CBF subunits (100 ng) or separately with either CBF-A/CBF-C (50 ng) or CBF-B (50 ng) alone. After reaction mixtures were fractionated by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel, the DNA-protein complex specifically formed in the presence of three CBF subunits was eluted from the gel and then amplified in a PCR using primers A and B in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled DNA was used in a second round of CBF binding, followed by isolation of the DNA-protein complex and reamplification of the CBF-bound DNA. After four rounds of selection, the amplified DNA was digested with XhoI and XbaI restriction enzymes and subcloned into a pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene). The DNA sequence of inserts in individual clones was then determined. The plasmids containing the selected binding sites were digested with XhoI and NotI, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase, and assayed for binding with CBF. Labeled DNA fragments were incubated first with recombinant CBF in a 100-μl DNA binding buffer at room temperature for 20 min and then incubated with a 100-fold excess of a 42-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the CBF binding site of the pro-α2(1) collagen promoter over different time intervals. At each time point, 10 μl of the incubation mixture was loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and run at 50 V. After the last aliquot of the incubation mixture was loaded, the gel was run at 150 V for 2 h. The amount of CBF-DNA complex remaining at each time point was measured by densitometry in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The equation ln(fraction CBF bound) = −k d t(t = time) was used to determine the dissociation rate constant k d . In vitrotranscription assay was performed using EL4 cell nuclear extracts depleted of CBF (12Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DNA templates containing the wild-type pro-α2(1) collagen promoter and the pro-α1(III) collagen control promoter were used in the assay as described previously (5Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutations in the flanking sequences of CCAAT of the pro-α2(1) collagen promoter were generated by two-step PCR (24Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The following oligonucleotides used to generate the mutants are as follows: oligo 1 (5′-CTCAACCAATCAGAGGGCTAGGGCTA-3′); oligo 2 (5′-CCTCTGATTGGTTGAGACGTTTTTGG-3′) for MUT1; and oligo 3 (5′-CTGCCCCAATTTGAGGGCTAGGGCTA-3′) and oligo 4 (5′-CCTCAAATTGGGGCAGACGTTTTTGG-3′) for MUT2. To identify the contacts in DNA that are produced by CBF binding, we used the hydroxyl radical footprinting method of Tullius and Dombroski (31Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical is a small molecule cleavage agent that removes individual bases from a DNA fragment; the base cleavage is diminished, however, by the contacts produced by protein-DNA interaction. Thus, this footprinting method provides high resolution structural information on the DNA-protein contacts. Briefly, DNA fragment of the mouse pro-α2(1) collagen promoter containing a CCAAT motif was labeled at the 3′ end of either the upper or the lower strand. The labeled DNA fragments were then incubated with purified recombinant CBF subunits and subjected to hydroxyl radical cleavage. The concentration of reagents used in the reaction to generate hydroxyl radical footprints did not affect formation of the CBF-DNA complex, as examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. When the DNA binding reactions contained all three CBF subunits, three separate regions of the upper DNA strand and three separate regions of the lower strand were protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 6). Each of the three protected regions on the lower strand was offset by about 4 to 5 residues in comparison with the protected regions on the upper strand. When the DNA binding reaction contained either CBF-B alone or the CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer, no protection was seen (data not shown). Thus, the protection of three DNA regions from hydroxyl radical cleavage in each DNA strand was specifically due to interactions with the heterotrimeric CBF. Among the three hydroxyl radical footprinting regions, one contained the CCAAT sequence, and the other two were located on either side of the CCAAT motif (Fig. 2). A previous comparison of the CBF binding sites in different promoters showed nucleotide sequence similarity only in the CCAAT motif and the bases immediately surrounding this motif and none in the more distal flanking regions that were protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage (1Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 2Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). To determine the footprinting pattern of another CBF binding site, we performed the hydroxyl cleavage reaction using the sequence containing the CCAAT motif DNA of the pro-α1(1) collagen promoter. When this promoter DNA bound to CBF, three separate regions on both the upper and lower strand were also protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 6). The CBF footprints of the two promoters are summarized in Fig. 2. The results show that the footprinting patterns of the pro-α1(1) and pro-α2(1) collagen promoters were qualitatively very similar despite the absence of obvious sequence similarities other than in the CCAAT motif. This suggests that the CBF contacts over the CCAAT motif are sequence-specific and those in the more distal flanking footprinting regions are not. In the three footprinting regions, each of the regions protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage on the complementary strand was shifted toward the 3′ boundary; this pattern was also found in the hydroxyl radical footprinting of the bacteriophage λ repressor and Cro proteins, characteristic of proteins that interact with DNA on one side of the helix only (31Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Previous mutational analyses of all three CBF subunits indicated that a DNA binding domain is present in each CBF subunit, suggesting that all three CBF subunits make contact with DNA in the CBF-DNA complex (23Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kim I.-S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that in the CBF-DNA complex each of the three CBF subunits interacts with one of the three separate regions of DNA protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage. Since none of the DNA regions are protected in the presence of either CBF-B alone or the CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer, all three CBF subunits must be present together to make contact in the three DNA regions. To determine the specificity of the contacts between CBF and DNA, we performed the hydroxyl radical cleavage reaction using DNA binding domain mutants of the CBF-A (A60) and CBF-C (C46/47) subunits. Each of these CBF mutants formed a heterotrimeric CBF that was, however, unable to bind DNA in a electrophoretic mobility shift assay (23Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Kim I.-S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When the DNA binding reaction contained either a mixture of mutant A60, wild-type CBF-B, and wild-type CBF-C or a mixture of wild-type CBF-A, wild-type CBF-B, and mutant C46/47, none of the three DNA regions were protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage (data not shown). This indicated that none of the three DNA binding domains of the CBF subunits made contact separately in the CBF-DNA complex but rather that these domains must have interacted simultaneously with DNA to form a CBF-DNA complex. To identify specific base contacts that contributed to CBF binding, we performed a methylation interference assay. In this assay, we treated the labeled DNA of the pro-α2(1) collagen promoter with dimethyl sulfate and then determined whether methylation of A and G bases interfered with CBF binding. Using this assay, we found that methylation of two Gs in the upper strand and two Gs in the lower strand, all located in the CCAAT motif region, strongly interfered with CBF binding (Fig. 2 and Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, methylation of bases in the flanking regions of CCAAT that were protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage did not interfere with CBF binding. This indicated that the bases that formed specific contacts with CBF were only those of the CCAAT motif region. We also performed a methylation interference assay with the pro-α1(1) collagen promoter DNA. In this promoter, methylation of one G base in the upper strand and two A bases in the lower strand, all located within the CCAAT motif, interfered with CBF binding (Fig. 2 and Fig.3 B, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, methylation of bases of the hydroxyl radical-footprinted regions flanking the CCAAT sequence did not interfere with CBF binding. Again this indicated that CBF made sequence-specific contacts with bases in the CCAAT motif region but not with bases flanking the CCAAT motif. In the pro-α1(1) collagen promoter, methylation of both A and G interfered with CBF binding, suggesting that CBF contacted bases in both the major and minor grooves of DNA. Recently, Ronchi et al. (32Ronchi A. Bellorini M. Mongelli N. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4565-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that several minor groove-binding drugs inhibited CBF binding to DNA, suggesting that CBF makes contact with minor groove DNA. However, this study did not rule out that CBF also makes contact with major groove DNA. To define the nucleotides that determine the specificity of CBF binding to DNA in an unbiased manner, we used PCR-mediated random binding site selection (33Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). For this the 67-base pair oligonucleotide R1 containing 27 random nucleotides flanked by 20 nucleotides of defined sequences at each end was used for the selection (Fig. 4 A). The DNA binding assays were performed using radiolabeled double-stranded random oligonucleotides incubated with the three purified recombinant CBF subunits. For control experiments, the radiolabeled oligonucleotides were incubated in two separate reactions, one with CBF-B and the other with the CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer. Formation of a protein-DNA complex was observed only in the reaction containing all three CBF subunits and not in control reactions containing either CBF-B alone or the CBF-A/CBF-C heterodimer alone; this indicated that the protein-DNA complex consisted of the heterotrimeric CBF-DNA complex. After four rounds of selection, the amplified DNAs were cloned, and 33 different clones were sequenced. The sequences are compiled and are divided into three groups in Fig. 4 B. In the first group, each of 10 different clones contained the 5′-ATTG-3′ sequence at the 3′ end of the selected sequences. The next nucleotide 3′ of the ATTG sequence was a G in the flanking sequence of the starting oligonucleotide. In the second group of 20 different clones, all sequences contained the ATTGG sequence but at different positions on either strand. In the third group none of three different clones contained the ATTGG sequence. In subsequent experiments the DNAs in the third group bound very weakly to CBF. Thus most of the selected sequences contained ATTGG (or CCAAT in the complementary strand), indicating that CBF bound preferentially to DNAs containing the CCAAT motif. To determine whether the flanking sequences of the ATTGG motif had any specific role in CBF binding, we aligned the 30 selected clones with respect to ATTGG (Fig. 4 C). Although no single nucleotide was selected in every clone at any position either 5′ or 3′ of ATTGG, specific nucleotides were selected in several positions with high frequency. Most notably, at the 5′ end of ATTGG, G residues in position 1 and T and C residues in position 2 were preferentially selected. At the 3′ end of ATTGG, T and C residues in positions 1 and 2 and A and G residues in position 3 were preferentially selected. These results indicated that sequences immediately flanking ATTGG played a role in CBF binding and that (T/C)G ATTGG (T/C)(T/C)(A/G) was the sequence that favored CBF binding. To confirm the role of the flanking sequences, we repeated the PCR-mediated binding site selection using oligonucleotide R2 (Fig.5 A). The difference between R1 and R2 is that instead of 27 random nucleotides, R2 contains an ATTGG core sequence flanked by 12 5′ random nucleotides and 10 3′ random nucleotides. After four rounds of DNA binding and PCR amplification of the bound DNA, the amplified DNAs were cloned, and 30 different clones were sequenced. The sequences are compiled in Fig. 5 B, and the frequency of the selected nucleotides in each position is shown in Fig. 5 C. The results indicated the following: at the 5′ end of ATTGG, G and T residues were preferentially selected in positions 1 and 2, respectively; at the 3′ end, pyrimidine nucleotides were preferentially selected in positions 1 and 2 and purine nucleotides in position 3. The results also indicated that the favorable sequence for CBF binding was TG ATTGG (T/C)(T/C)(A/G). Therefore, very similar sequences flanking the ATTGG motif were preferentially selected in the two different experiments. To analyze in more detail CBF binding with respect to different flanking sequences of ATTGG, we divided the selected sequences into four groups (TableI). Most sequences in the first group contained consensus flanking sequences on both sides of the ATTGG motif, whereas sequences in groups 2 and 3 contained consensus flanking sequences only on the 5′ side and 3′ side, respectively. Group 4 contained no consensus flanking sequences at either end.Table IDNA binding affinity of recombinant CBF for selected binding sitesSiteSequence1-aThe sequences of selected clones are divided into four groups according to the derived consensus sequences for CBF binding present in group 1.

The non-ligand binding isoform GRβ was proposed to act as a transdominant negative inhibitor of GRα, thus modulating glucocorticoid responsiveness of target tissues. To study GRβ in mice we characterized the genomic region around exon 9 of the murine GR gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the presumed exon 9β contained an open reading frame of 59 amino acids. In contrast, human exon 9β encoded only 15 amino acids. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction the absence of GRβ mRNA was demonstrated in all adult mouse tissues examined. To exclude the possibility that the polymerase chain reaction conditions employed were not suitable for the amplification of GRβ mRNA, we synthesized an artificial template corresponding to the presumed GRβ mRNA spanning exons 7, 8, and 9β. Various amounts of this template were added to brain cDNA preparations and as little as 25 molecules were detectable under the polymerase chain reaction conditions chosen. Since GRβ is not conserved across species its physiological significance in humans appears questionable.

Under basal conditions the GR resides in the cytoplasm where it is associated with heat shock proteins and other proteins forming a multiprotein complex (6Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon hormonal stimulation the GR dissociates from the multiprotein complex and translocates into the nucleus where it can stimulate or suppress transcription of multiple genes (1Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 2Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2845) Google Scholar, 3Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Two human glucocorticoid receptor isoforms termed hGRα and hGRβ have been described (7Hollenberg S.M. Weinberger C. Ong E.S. Cerelli G. Oro A. Lebo R. Thompson E.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Both isoforms are derived from the same gene by differential splicing. Whereas hGRα and hGRβ share the first eight exons of the human GR gene, either of the last two exons,i.e. exon 9α or 9β, is spliced into the respective mRNA (8Encio I.J. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7182-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the formation of two protein isoforms having the first 727 amino acids in common. Exon 9α encodes 50 amino acids and exon 9β 15 amino acids. Whereas hGRα can bind hormone and is transcriptionally competent, hGRβ is not (8Encio I.J. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7182-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that hGRβ transiently expressed in COS-7 cells bound specifically to glucocorticoid-responsive elements and acted as a dominant negative inhibitor of hGRα activity (9Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Since hGRβ mRNA was expressed in all human tissues examined it was assumed that this isoform might play an important role in modulating tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids (9Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, the low abundance of hGRβ mRNA is incompatible with such a function. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments revealed that in all human tissues and cell lines analyzed the hGRβ message was expressed 200–500-fold less than the hGRα message (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was shown by Western blots that the ratio of hGRβ to hGRα varied from 1.0 to 5.0 (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, some conflicting results concerning the subcellular localization of the hGRβ protein were obtained. Using hGRβ specific antibodies it was demonstrated that after dexamethasone treatment hGRβ translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it had been reported that hGRβ resided primarily in the cell nucleus independently of hormonal stimulation (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To date all these discrepancies have not been conclusively explained. Since GRβ has been studied so far exclusively in human tissues we were interested to investigate whether this GR isoform would be of physiological importance in other species. Therefore we characterized the genomic region around the presumed exon 9β of the murine GR locus and studied the tissue distribution of GRβ in mice. DNA modifying enzymes, Taq DNA polymerase, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, MgCl2, and PCR buffer were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Reverse transcriptase and first strand buffer were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., Pfu polymerase from Stratagene, and RNasin from Promega. A murine genomic stem cell library (12Kaestner K.H. Lee K.H. Schlöndorff J. Hiemisch H. Monaghan A.P. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7628-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was screened with a mouse cDNA probe spanning exons 6–9 of the GR gene using high stringency hybridization and washing conditions (13Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). Three hybridizing genomic phages were purified and characterized by restriction mapping. One of the phages containing exon 9 was subcloned into Bluescript KSII (Stratagene). A 2.8-kilobaseHindIII fragment containing the 3′-untranslated region of exon 9α and the putative exon 9β was sequenced on both strands (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Total RNA from a variety of adult mouse tissues was isolated after homogenization in guanidinium thiocyanate (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). The quality of the RNA preparations was controlled by ethidium bromide staining of the 18 S and 28 S rRNA after electrophoretic separation in denaturing agarose gels. 2 μg of total RNA were subjected to cDNA synthesis. After DNase I digestion, cDNA synthesis was performed in first strand buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 units of RNasin, 200 units of reverse transcriptase, 1 μg of random hexamers in a final volume of 20 μl. To control for DNA contamination, addition of reverse transcriptase was omitted in control samples of each RNA preparation. The cDNA was precipitated and dissolved in 20 μl. For the amplification of GRα and GRβ mRNA by PCR, 2 μl of cDNA solution were used. PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit ofTaq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.2 μm upstream and downstream primers. After an initial incubation for 3 min at 95 °C, samples were subjected to 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. This was followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. 35 cycles of PCR were sufficient for the amplification of GRα mRNA, whereas in the case of control cDNA experiments and amplification of GRβ mRNA a second round of 35 cycles was done under identical conditions using 2 μl of the first amplification round as template. Primers used for the amplification of the GRα message were as follows: 5′-AGCAGAGAATGACTCTAC-3′ (upstream, corresponding to nucleotides 1928–1945 of the murine GR cDNA (16Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)) and 5′-GAATTCAATACTCATGGAC-3′ (downstream, corresponding to nucleotides 2265–2283 of the murine GR cDNA (16Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)). The primers used for the amplification of the GRβ message were as follows: 5′-AGCAGAGAATGACTCTAC-3′ (upstream, corresponding to nucleotides 1928–1945 of the murine GR cDNA (16Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)) and 5′-AGCTCTTTATACATCTAATG-3′ (downstream, corresponding to the putative murine exon 9β). Amplified cDNA fragments were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, subcloned, and sequenced. An artificial GRβ template was generated by overlap extension using PCR (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). Briefly, two different sets of PCR experiments using Pfu polymerase were performed. In the first round two different DNA fragments were amplified: a 290-bp fragment (amplified from brain cDNA) containing exons 7 and 8 of the murine GR gene and having a 3′-overhang homologous to the beginning of the presumed exon 9β and a 194-bp fragment (amplified from the genomic 2.8-kilobase HindIII fragment) containing the putative exon 9β having a 5′-overhang homologous to the end of exon 8. Primers used for the amplification of the 290-bp fragment were as follows: 5′-AGCAGAGAATGACTCTAC-3′ (upstream, outer primer 1) and 5′-GGGTTTAACCATATAACATTATCATGCATGGAGTCCAA-3′ (downstream, inner primer 1). Primers used for the amplification of the 194-bp fragment were as follows: 5′-TTGGACTCCATGCATGATAATGTTATATGGTTAAACCC-3′ (upstream, inner primer 2) and 5′-AGCTCTTTATACATCTAATG-3′ (downstream, outer primer 2). Both PCR fragments were gel purified and fused in a second PCR experiment using the two outer primers. PCR conditions were the same as described above. The 484-bp fusion product spanning exons 7, 8, and 9β was purified by gel electrophoresis, subcloned into Bluescript KSII, and sequenced on both strands (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). To investigate GRβ in mice we isolated and characterized a genomic phage containing exons 8 and 9 of the murine GR locus. A 2.8-kb genomic HindIII fragment including exon 9 was sequenced on both strands to locate exons 9α and 9β. The nucleotide sequence of the presumed exon 9β and its preceeding intron is shown in Fig.1 A. This sequence shows strong similarity to the sequence of human exon 9β. However, as depicted in Fig. 1 B the murine and rat sequences (19Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikström A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) homologous to human exon 9β are not preceeded by a splice site conforming to the G(T/A)G rule (18Sharp P.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 643-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The putative murine exon 9β would contain an open reading frame of 59 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) since the stop codon of human exon 9β is not conserved in mice and rats (Fig.1 B). The first 15 amino acids of the presumed murine exon 9β are highly conserved, the remaining contain a remarkable stretch of basic amino acids (Fig. 1 A). These sequence data make the existence of GRβ in mice unlikely. To obtain evidence for or against the existence of GRβ in mice we performed RT-PCR analysis of GRα and GRβ mRNA in various adult mouse tissues using an upstream primer specific for murine exon 7 and either one of the downstream primers specific for exon 9α and the presumptive exon 9β, respectively. The primers were chosen in close analogy to those employed in RT-PCR experiments examining the tissue distribution of GRβ in humans (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). GRα cDNA producing a 356-bp band was easily detectable after 35 cycles of PCR in liver, brain, kidney, heart, and pituitary (Fig.2 A). In contrast, amplification of the presumptive GRβ cDNA which would produce a 484-bp band was not successful even after two rounds of 35 PCR cycles. The absence of GRβ in the examined tissues was confirmed by radioactive hybridization of the blotted PCR gels (data not shown). To ensure that the PCR conditions employed were suitable for the amplification of GRβ cDNA, we generated, by use of the overlap extension technique (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar), an artificial murine GRβ template. This template spanned exons 7, 8, and 9β thus resembling the proposed structure of the carboxyl-terminal part of human GRβ (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The concentration of the stock solution of the artificial GRβ template was determined spectrophotometrically and serial dilutions were prepared. Various amounts of this template were added to brain cDNA preparations and subjected to two rounds of 35 PCR cycles (Fig.2 B). Whereas native GRβ was not detected under the PCR conditions chosen as little as about 25 molecules of the added artificial GRβ template were easily detectable. From these results we conclude that GRβ mRNA comparable to that described in humans (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) is not synthesized in adult mice. Recently, first attempts were made to unravel if GRβ plays a physiological role in humans. Using transient transfection experiments it was shown that GRβ could act as a transdominant negative inhibitor of GRα (9Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). From these results it was hypothesized that a possiblein vivo function of GRβ could be the modulation of glucocorticoid sensitivity of target tissues (9Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). It was speculated that abnormally high expression levels of GRβ might contribute to the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid resistance, whereas low expression could cause syndromes of glucocorticoid hypersensitivity (9Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, thein vitro experiments revealed that GRβ was only a weak transdominant negative inhibitor of GRα since 5-fold overexpression was required to get a 50% reduction of GRα activity (9Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. de Castro M. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Moreover, there was a large discrepancy observed concerning the mRNA and protein levels of GRβ in humans. While the GRβ mRNA was 200–500-fold less expressed than the GRα mRNA (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) the ratio of GRβ to GRα protein varied between 1 and 5 (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These discrepancies which have never been explained conclusively, as well as conflicting results about the subcellular localization of GRβ protein (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raised some doubts concerning the existence and hence the physiological importance of this GR isoform in humans. We therefore decided to study as an additional approach GRβ in mice and to examine whether it was conserved across species. Using quantitative RT-PCR experiments we could not find any evidence for the existence of GRβ mRNA in all adult mouse tissues examined, among them liver, brain, pituitary, and kidney which have been reported to contain considerable amounts of GRβ protein in humans (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude from these experiments that GRβ mRNA structurally comparable to that in humans (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) is not synthesized in mice. Whereas GRβ mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in humans and was amplified under comparable PCR conditions after 45 cycles (10Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) we failed to demonstrate GRβ in mice even after 2 × 35 cycles of PCR. To control the suitability of our PCR conditions we synthesized an artificial GRβ template structurally corresponding to the human GRβ mRNA. The amplification product of this template was easily detectable even if very low amounts of template were added to the cDNA preparation. In addition, the obvious absence of GRβ in mice is supported by two other findings. First, splicing of the putative murine exon 9β would give rise to a protein distinctly different from human GRβ. Apart from the first 15 amino acid residues of the presumptive exon 9β which indeed show high homology to the 15 amino acids encoded by human exon 9β, the additional 44 amino acids of the open reading frame have no counterpart in human GRβ. They contain a remarkable stretch of basic residues. Therefore one can conclude that, if GRβ would exist in mice it might have properties distinctly different from its human variant. In rat, a putative exon 9β would encode 48 amino acids and only the first 7 amino acids would show high homology to human exon 9β. Second and even more important, the splice site in front of the putative exon 9β is not in accordance with the consensus splice sequences at all (18Sharp P.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 643-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, however, all other splice junctions in the murine GR gene (20Strähle U. Schmidt A. Kelsey G. Stewart A.F. Cole T.J. Schmidt W. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the intron preceeding human exon 9β (8Encio I.J. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7182-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) conformed to the GT/AG rule (18Sharp P.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 643-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that exon 9β is not spliced and belongs to the 3′-untranslated region of the murine GR gene. From these results we conclude that GRβ is not conserved across species. It is tempting to speculate that during evolution a point mutation in the splice acceptor site is responsible for the absence of GRβ mRNA in rodents. The obvious lack of GRβ protein in mice argues against an important role of this isoform in humans. This assumption is supported by recent findings (21Hecht K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Stierna P. Gustafsson J.A. Brönnegärd M. Wikström A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26659-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the expression level of GRβ protein in humans is much lower than previously reported (11de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and providing strong evidence against a transdominant negative activity of GRβ. We thank W. Fleischer for oligonucleotide synthesis and photographic work and S. Bendeck for critical reading the manuscript."

We demonstrate that TGFβ enhances luciferase activity 2.5–6-fold in transient transfection assays of epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast cell lines.

Recent studies have shown that Smad proteins, which are postulated to function as TGFβ receptor-regulated transcription factors, may act as cellular mediators in TGFβ signaling of mammalian cells and play a critical role in transmitting the TGFβ signal to the nucleus (15Massague J.

Protein kinase C and other protein kinases have also been implicated in TGFβ-mediated regulation of gene expression.

Nuclear factor 1 also appears to be involved in expression of several genes regulated by TGFβ (29Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). TGFβ modulates interaction of theses transcription factors and their cognate elements in a coordinated manner to specifically regulate TGFβ-responsive gene expression. However, the signaling pathway(s) through which TGFβ modulates gene responses in mammalian cells remains largely unknown.The clusterin protein was first discovered in ram rete testis fluid as an ∼80-kDa heterodimeric glycoprotein that facilitated the aggregation of a variety of cells in culture (30Blaschuk O. Burdzy K. Fritz I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7714-7720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of homologues of clusterin have been identified in several species (31Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Clusterin is present in almost all mammalian body fluids and can also be induced or constitutively expressed in almost all cell types (30Blaschuk O. Burdzy K. Fritz I.B. J. Biol.

Analysis of the 5′-regulatory region of the clusterin gene has revealed TGFβ inhibitory elements as well as AP-1, Sp1, and AP-2 regulatory elements in the quail, rat, and human clusterin genes (38Wong P.

These elements are postulated to be responsible for the modulation of clusterin gene expression observed during cell differentiation, development, and embryogenesis (31Jenne D.E. Tschopp J.

It has also been demonstrated that clusterin gene expression can be regulated by TGFβ in a cell type-dependent manner (35Thomas-Salgar S. Millis A.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17879-17885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Morgan T.E. Laping N.J. Rorovsky I. Oda T. Hogan T.H. Finch C.E. Pasinetti G.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 58: 101-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, TGFβ down-regulates clusterin mRNA levels in porcine smooth muscle cells (35Thomas-Salgar S. Millis A.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17879-17885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), induces its gene expression in rat astrocytes in the presence of oligodendrocytes and microglia, while repressing its message in monotypic cultures of astrocytes (42Morgan T.E.

However, the mechanism(s) of regulation of clusterin gene expression by TGFβ is unknown.We have previously reported that TGFβ induces expression of clusterin protein and rapidly stimulates clusterin mRNA levels in a mink lung epithelial cell line CCL64 cells (Mv1Lu). We have also demonstrated that TGFβ selectively induces accumulation of clusterin protein in the nucleus (11Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 43Reddy K.B Karode M.C. Harmony J.A. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To further dissect the mechanism of TGFβ-mediated regulation of clusterin gene expression, we have analyzed the intracellular signaling pathway through which TGFβ modulates gene expression. Our results demonstrate that TGFβ regulates clusterin gene expression in epithelial, fibroblasts, and in a primary culture of bovine aortic endothelial cells, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. An AP-1 site in the rat clusterin 5′-promoter region is responsible for the regulation of clusterin gene expression by TGFβ, and the effect of TGFβ on clusterin gene expression requires the involvement of protein kinase C.DISCUSSIONClusterin is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in homeostatic control of lipoprotein metabolism, tissue repair and remodeling, sperm maturation, inhibition of complement mediated cell lysis, and epithelial cell differentiation (30Blaschuk O. Burdzy K. Fritz I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7714-7720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of clusterin is well regulated during development, cell differentiation, and tissue remodeling, and can be modulated by cytokines, such as TGFβ (31Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 50Hardardottir I. Kunitake S.T. Moser A.H. Doerrler W.T. Rapp J.H. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 51Zwain I.H. Grima J. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that TGFβ enhances clusterin protein synthesis and RNA levels, and induces the translocation of a cytosolic form of clusterin to the nucleus in CCL64 cells (11Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These effects of TGFβ on clusterin led us to investigate the mechanisms of regulation of clusterin gene expression by TGFβ. Our data demonstrate that TGFβ rapidly induces clusterin mRNA levels in a variety of cell lines, including epithelial (CCL64 and HeLa), fibroblast (10T1/2 and 3TP), and BAEC. The induction of clusterin by TGFβ in mink lung epithelial cells (CCL64) occurs in both rapidly growing, asynchronous cells and in serum-starved G0-arrested cells. This suggests that this induction is not cell cycle dependent since it occurs not only during quiescence but also throughout the cycle. These results also suggest that the induction of clusterin is not secondary to TGFβ-induced growth arrest because TGFβ is capable of inducing clusterin in an already G0-arrested cell population, as well in 3TP cells which are not growth arrested by TGFβ (44Hocevar B. Howe P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7655-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Clusterin mRNA can be induced as early as 30 min after TGFβ stimulation and remains elevated for at least 24 h in the presence of TGFβ. This induced expression pattern of clusterin mRNA is similar to that observed with other stimuli where mRNA levels peak within several hours and remain elevated for over 24 h following stimulation (31Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 50Hardardottir I. Kunitake S.T. Moser A.H. Doerrler W.T. Rapp J.H. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).There is over 80% similarity within the first 150 base pairs of the 5′-upstream regulatory region between the human and rat clusterin genes (40Michel D. Chatelain G. Herault Y. Brun G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two conventional cis-elements, Sp1 and AP-1, have been found in the regulatory region of clusterin genes from human, rat, quail, and mouse (39Herault Y. Chatelain G. Brun G. Michel D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6377-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Michel D. Chatelain G. Herault Y. Brun G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several TGFβ-inhibitory elements have also been identified in the first intron of the rat clusterin gene and in the upstream regulatory region of the avian clusterin gene (38Wong P. Pineault J. Lakins J. Taillefer D. Leger J. Wang C. Tenniswood M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5021-5031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Michel D. Chatelain G. Herault Y. Brun G. Eur. J.

These cis-elements have been implicated in the regulation of clusterin gene expression by various stimuli (37Brown T.L. Moulton B.C. Baker V.V. Mira J. Harmony J.A. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 1038-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Wong P. Pineault J. Lakins J. Taillefer D. Leger J. Wang C. Tenniswood M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6377-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Michel D. Chatelain G. Herault Y. Brun G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Rosemblit N. Chen C.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, the T64 gene of quail embryo fibroblasts, corresponding to clusterin in mammals, contains an AP-1-binding site located at position −25 to −19 of the single transcriptional start site. Promoter transactivation of the T64 gene has been shown to be significantly induced by an active v-src oncoprotein, and the v-src response requires the AP-1 site and a purine-rich element (39Herault Y. Chatelain G. Brun G. Michel D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6377-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There is, however, no evidence to indicate that thesecis-elements in the promoter region of clusterin genes regulate TGFβ induction.In the present study, a 1.3-kilobase rat clusterin promoter region has been used for identifying cis-elements mediating TGFβ signaling. This promoter contains AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 consensus binding sites. Our deletional analyses demonstrate that the AP-2 and Sp1 consensus sites, located at position −124 and −372 from the transcriptional start site, respectively, are not involved in promoter transactivation by TGFβ. However, removal of the AP-1 consensus site, located at position −73 to −79 relative to the transcription start site, abates TGFβ induction of promoter transactivation. The data indicate that TGFβ modulates clusterin gene expression via an AP-1-binding site, and that this AP-1 site is required and sufficient for promoter transactivation by TGFβ. The importance of the AP-1 site in the induction of the clusterin gene by TGFβ is confirmed by our mutagenesis experiments of the AP-1 site in the clusterin promoter region. A single base pair mutation, T to G in the AP-1-binding site, abolished TGFβ-promoter transactivation, indicating that the AP-1 site is necessary for TGFβ-induced clusterin expression. Decoy experiments with 23-mer AP-1 oligonucleotides also demonstrate that the AP-1 site is required for TGFβ induction of the endogenous clusterin gene. Transfection of the wild-type AP-1 oligonucleotide into CCL64 cells markedly decreases TGFβ induction of clusterin mRNA levels and promoter transactivation. Transfection of the T to G mutated AP-1 failed to serve as a decoy of the endogenous AP-1 site in the clusterin gene and had no effect on the ability of TGFβ to induce endogenous clusterin gene expression. The data indicate that TGFβ regulation of endogenous clusterin expression in CCL64 cells is also mediated via the AP-1-binding site and its cognate transcription factors.In addition to clusterin, a large number of TGFβ responsive genes, such as JE/MCP-1(25), c-jun (7de Groot R.P. Kruijer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 51Zwain I.H. Grima J. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (8Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.-J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and α2(I)-collagen (62Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), contain AP-1-binding sites in their 5′-regulatory region. Expression of these genes can be modulated by TGFβ and requires involvement of the AP-1-binding site and its cognate transcription factor. The collagenase gene has also been shown to be regulated by TGFβ in a cell type specific manner through an AP-1 site. In fibroblast cells, for example, TGFβ inhibits collagenase gene expression through an AP-1 site presumably via an up-regulation of junB (63Mauviel A. Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Tamai T. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofjunB mimics the inhibitory effects of TGFβ on collagenase expression. In contrast, TGFβ-induced collagenase expression in keratinocytes is preceded by a transient elevation of c-junexpression, which is suggested to be a ubiquitous inducer of collagenase gene expression (63Mauviel A. Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Tamai T. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that cell-specific induction of different AP-1 family members, with opposite trans-activating properties, are responsible for the differences observed in TGFβ regulation of collagenase gene expression. Taken together, these data establish that AP-1 is a mediator of TGFβ-induced gene transcription. However, the mechanism through which TGFβ modulates AP-1 activity and the individual AP-1 family members which are induced or suppressed by TGFβ, in a cell-type and gene-specific fashion, remain to be determined.We postulated that since the promoter region of the rat clusterin gene contains an AP-1-binding site, which is required for TGFβ induction, that PKC activity might mediate TGFβ induction. It is well established that activation of PKC by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate results in increased synthesis of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins which are required for the formation of the AP-1 transcriptional complex (AP-1) (53Hattori K. Angel P. LeBeau M.M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9148-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 54Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Upon activation and translocation to the nucleus, the AP-1 protein binds to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive elements mediating activation of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inducible genes (7de Groot R.P. Kruijer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 53Hattori K. Angel P. LeBeau M.M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive element has been identified as an AP-1-binding site, and the AP-1 site as well as its cognate transcription factors are directly related to phorbol ester, a PKC regulatory reagent (51Zwain I.H. Grima J. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 55Verma I.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1987; 51: 513-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 56Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 57Lee W. Michell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that activated PKC leads to dephosphorylation of c-Jun protein at sites which negatively regulate DNA binding activity and thereby augments AP-1 activity (64Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize J.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). PKC has also been implicated in TGFβ signaling. In A549 human lung carcinoma cells, TGFβ has been shown to induce promoter transactivation of 3TP-Lux, a TGFβ-inducible artificial promoter construct which contains 3 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive elements (17Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TGFβ induction of this promoter construct can be inhibited by prior treatment of the cells with PKC inhibitors and down-regulation of PKC with PMA (17Halstead J. Kemp K. Ignotz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that inhibition of PKC activity by two distinct types of PKC inhibitors blocked TGFβ-induced clusterin mRNA levels and promoter transactivation, thus providing further support for the role of AP-1 in TGFβ regulation of clusterin gene expression. Stimulation of PKC activity by treatment of the cells with PMA, however, had no effect on clusterin mRNA levels or TGFβ-induced clusterin mRNA levels. These results suggest that activation of PKC alone is not sufficient for regulating clusterin gene expression but that PKC activity is necessary for TGFβ-induced clusterin gene expression. These data are in agreement with the observation that PMA treatment does not coordinate phosphorylation of nuclear proteins in CCL64 cells, whereas TGFβ stimulates nuclear protein phosphorylation (20Ohtsuki M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 261-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are also similar to those observed in activated T cells where full activation of AP-1 requires both the calcium- and PKC-"
https://openalex.org/W2140311021,"MUC3 is a large mucin glycoprotein expressed by the human intestine and gall bladder. In this manuscript, we present details of the deduced protein structure of MUC3. The MUC3 carboxyl-terminal domain is 617 residues in length, including 511 residues of a non-repetitive mucin-like domain (27% Thr, 22% Ser, and 11% Pro) and a 106-residue Cys-rich domain with homology to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like structural motifs found in many proteins. The region of MUC3 located upstream of the previously described 51-base pair (bp) tandem repeats, which encode a major Ser and Thr-rich domain, consists of a second type of repetitive structure with an imperfect periodicity of approximately 1125 bp. This domain is also mucin-like and appears to be considerably larger than 2000 residues (6000 bp). The <i>MUC3</i> gene itself is large and complex. Using pulse field gel electrophoresis and blot analysis, the smallest fragment found that contained all human genomic DNA hybridizing to the 51-bp tandem repeat probe was 200 kilobases with restriction enzyme <i>Swa</i>I. Both <i>Pvu</i>II and<i>Pst</i>I produced two sets of hybridizing fragments that were hypervariable within the human population with a pattern suggestive of both a variation in the number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and sequence polymorphism. These fragments varied independently of each other, but no genetic recombination was detected in a study of 40 human families. Thus, the <i>MUC3</i> gene encodes a very large glycoprotein with a structure very different from that of any mucin currently described."
https://openalex.org/W2014608875,"β2-chimaerin, a member of the GTPase-activating proteins for the small GTP-binding protein p21Rac, possesses a single cysteine-rich domain with high homology to those implicated in phorbol ester and diacylglycerol binding in protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. We have expressed β2-chimaerin in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and determined that, like PKCs, β2-chimaerin binds phorbol esters with high affinity in the presence of phosphatidylserine as a cofactor. Scatchard plot analysis using the radioligand [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate revealed a dissociation constant of 1.9 ± 0.2 nm for β2-chimaerin. Likewise, β2-chimaerin is a high affinity receptor for the bryostatins, a class of atypical PKC activators. A detailed comparison of structure-activity relations using several phorbol ester analogs revealed striking differences in binding recognition between β2-chimaerin and PKCα. Although the diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol binds with similar potency to both β2-chimaerin and PKCα, the mezerein analog thymeleatoxin has 56-fold less affinity for binding to β2-chimaerin. To establish whether β2-chimaerin responds to phorbol esters in cellular systems, we overexpressed β2-chimaerin in COS-7 cells and monitored its subcellular distribution after phorbol ester treatment. Interestingly, as described previously for PKC isozymes, β2-chimaerin translocates from cytosolic to particulate fractions as a consequence of phorbol ester treatment. Our results demonstrate that β2-chimaerin is a novel target for the phorbol ester tumor promoters. The expansion of the family of phorbol ester receptors strongly suggests a potential for the “non-kinase” receptors as cellular mediators of the phorbol ester responses. β2-chimaerin, a member of the GTPase-activating proteins for the small GTP-binding protein p21Rac, possesses a single cysteine-rich domain with high homology to those implicated in phorbol ester and diacylglycerol binding in protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes.

The expansion of the family of phorbol ester receptors strongly suggests a potential for the “non-kinase” receptors as cellular mediators of the phorbol ester responses. The phorbol esters and related diterpenes are natural compounds that are used widely as tumor promoters in animal models. The search for receptors for the phorbol esters led to the identification of protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol; GST, glutathione S-transferase. as their target (1Castagna M.

The complexity and heterogeneity in the biology of phorbol esters suggested the existence of multiple receptors, and 11 PKC isoforms have been identified so far: classic or calcium-dependent isozymes (PKC α, β1, β2, and γ), novel or calcium-independent isozymes (PKC δ, ε, η, θ, and μ), and atypical isozymes (PKC ζ and λ) (6Newton A.C.

The last group is unresponsive to the phorbol esters. DAG, the postulated endogenous activator of PKC, competes with phorbol esters for binding to PKC inin vitro assays, although its binding potency is lower than that of the most commonly used phorbol esters (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domains present at the NH2-terminal region of the PKCs are the binding sites for DAG/phorbol esters (9Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashim K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc.

Each of these 50- or 51-amino acid domains possesses the motif HX 12CX 2CX 13/14CX 2CX 4HX 2CX 7C, where H is histidine, C is cysteine, and X is any other amino acid. This motif is duplicated in tandem in both the classic and novel PKCs and is present only once in the atypical PKCs. The cysteine-rich domains have been implicated in the association of PKC with membranes upon phorbol ester binding, a process referred to astranslocation in intact cells. The molecular basis of this subcellular compartmentalization is currently the subject of intense research; recent studies on the structural aspects of translocation revealed that in PKCδ the second cysteine-rich domain plays the predominant role in the translocation to membranes (14Szallasi Z. Bogi K. Gohari S. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18299-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although it is widely assumed that phorbol esters mediate their responses through activation of PKC isozymes, two additional phorbol ester receptors have been identified so far: mammaliann-chimaerin and Caenorhabditis elegans Unc-13 (15Ahmed S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim H.H. Smith P. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These novel receptors both possess a single copy of the cysteine-rich domain, suggesting that, as observed previously with PKC deletion mutants, only one copy of the motif is sufficient for high affinity binding of phorbol esters. The chimaerin family has expanded recently with the cloning of a spliced variant of n- (or α1)-chimaerin, namely, α2-chimaerin (17Hall C. Sin W.C. Teo M. Michael G.J. Smith P. Dong J.M. Lim H.H. Manser E. Spurr N.K. Jones T.A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4986-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cloning of β1- and β2-chimaerins, two novel spliced variants from a second (β) gene (18Leung T. How B.-E. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3813-3816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Leung T. How B.-E. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12888-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both members of the α- and β-chimaerins possess, in addition to the NH2-terminal cysteine-rich motif, a COOH-terminal region with high homology to BCR, the Breakpoint Cluster Region involved in the translocation of Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This domain in α- and β-chimaerins is completely unrelated to any kinase domain and has GTPase-activating protein activity for p21Rac, a small GTP-binding protein involved in the control of cell morphology and cell growth (18Leung T. How B.-E. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3813-3816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dieckman D. Brill S. Garret M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A.

Cell Sci. 1994; 18: 127-131Crossref Google Scholar). Both β1- and β2-chimaerin have identical cysteine-rich and GTPase-activating protein domains. β2-Chimaerin possesses an additional NH2-terminal SH2 domain of unknown function (19Leung T. How B.-E. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12888-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cysteine-rich domains of β-chimaerins have a high degree of homology to those in PKC isozymes and n-chimaerin, it is not known whether the β-chimaerins are receptors for the phorbol esters and DAG. It is noteworthy that single changes at several positions of the cysteine-rich domains in PKCs are sufficient to abolish completely or reduce substantially the binding of phorbol esters (13Kazanietz M.G.

Moreover, not all of the proteins possessing similar cysteine-rich motifs in their structure are phorbol ester receptors (23Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G.

In this study we expressed β2-chimaerin as a prototype of the β-chimaerin family using the baculovirus expression system and showed that it binds phorbol esters and DAG with high affinity in the presence of phosphatidylserine as a cofactor. In addition, we found that phorbol esters translocate β2-chimaerin from cytosolic to particulate compartments in COS-7-transfected cells. The discovery of novel cellular phorbol ester receptors allows us to speculate that some of the biological responses of the phorbol esters could be mediated by the activation of PKC-independent pathways. [3H]PDBu (20.0 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Bryostatin 1 (4.8 Ci/mmol) was prepared as described previously for [3H]bryostatin 4 (25Lewin N.E. Dell'Aquila M.L. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Warren B.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PDBu, PMA, 4α-PMA, mezerein, thymeleatoxin, (−)-indolactam V, prostratin, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, and GF 109203X were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). 1-Oleoyl 2-acetylglycerol (OAG) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). Phospholipids were obtained from Sigma. Cell culture reagents and media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for expression and purification of recombinant GST-fusion proteins were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells were cultured in spinner flasks at 27 °C (without CO2) in Grace's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. The full-length cDNA for β2-chimaerin was cloned using a polymerase chain reaction from human cerebellar cDNA (CLONTECH). The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GTCAGGCTCGAGGGATCCATGCGTCTCCTCTCCAGCCTGTCC (XhoI and BamHI sites underlined) and 5′-GTCAGGACGCGTGAATTCGGATTAGAATAAAACGTCTTCG (MluI and EcoRI sites underlined), where the bases following the restriction sites correspond to the nucleotides 445–468 and 1827–1848 in the original sequence reported by Leunget al. (19Leung T. How B.-E. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12888-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The restriction sites were included to facilitate the subcloning into baculovirus, bacterial, and mammalian expression vectors. A fragment of 1.4 kilobases was cloned and ligated into pCRII using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) to generate pCRII-β2. The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced, and the sequence fully agreed with the original sequence (19Leung T. How B.-E. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12888-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.4-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragment was isolated from pCRII-β2 and subcloned in-frame into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcG2T (Pharmingen, San Diego), a vector designed for the expression of GST-fusion proteins in Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated with the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen), as we have described previously forn-chimaerin (26Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High titer stocks (>108plaque-forming units/ml) of the recombinant baculovirus were prepared in suspension cultures of Sf9 cells using standard techniques (27Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). To express high levels of recombinant β2-chimaerin protein, Sf9 cells (1 liter) in spinner flasks were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with the recombinant baculovirus. Cells were lysed by homogenization and sonication (lysis buffer: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4; 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant collected, and the GST-β2-chimaerin bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads using the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). To cleave the GST partner, the GST-β2-chimaerin bound to the beads was treated with thrombin for 4 h (4 °C). Thrombin was removed with benzamidine-Sepharose 6B beads (Pharmacia). In some experiments, we used the GST-β2-chimaerin fusion protein, generated by elution with 10 mm reduced glutathione from the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Recombinant proteins were kept at −80 °C. The 1.4-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding the full-length β2-chimaerin cDNA was isolated from pCRII-β2 and ligated in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia). Expression of the GST-fusion protein in XL-1 blue E. coli cells (Stratagene) was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside after the bacteria reached an A 600 of about 0.5. After 5 h at 37 °C, the cells were pelleted at 4,000 ×g, and the recombinant β2-chimaerin or GST-β2-chimaerin was purified as described for insect cells. Recombinant PKCα and PKCδ were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]PDBu binding was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed by Sharkey and Blumberg (28Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar), using 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 mm EGTA at 18 °C (unless otherwise indicated). A detailed description of the binding assay methodology can be found elsewhere (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of the dissociation constants (K d ), saturation curves with increasing concentrations of the radioligand were performed in triplicate. To measure competition of [3H]PDBu binding by different phorbol ester analogs, we used a fixed concentration of [3H]PDBu (3–5 nm) and increasing concentrations of the competing nonradioactive ligand. Five to seven different concentrations of the competing ligand were typically used. ID50 values were determined from the competition curve, and the K i for the competing ligand was calculated from the ID50 by using the relationship K i = ID50/(1 + L/K d ), whereL is the concentration of free [3H]PDBu at the ED50. In general, triplicate determinations differed by <10%. [3H]Bryostatin 1 binding was measured using a variant of the filtration assay described for [3H]epibryostatin 4 (25Lewin N.E. Dell'Aquila M.L. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Warren B.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 250 μl, as described in an earlier paper (29Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Gao F. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). Binding using total cellular lysates was carried out using a fixed concentration of [3H]PDBu (15 nm). Sf9 cells or COS-7 cells in a six-well plate were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. 50 μl/tube of the total lysate (in triplicate) was used in the binding assay (30Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have modified the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen) by inserting an 81-base pair cassette with XhoI andMluI restriction sites, an epitope or ε-tag, and a stop codon. We named this vector pCR3ε. The ε-tag proved to work well for immunodetection with a commercial anti-PKCε antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) and, importantly, it does not affect subcellular localization in tagged phorbol ester receptors (14Szallasi Z.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A 1.4-kilobaseXhoI-MluI fragment comprising the full-length β2-chimaerin was ligated in the pCR3ε vector to generate pCR3ε-β2. The plasmid pCR3ε-β2 was transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The highest expression of β2-chimaerin was observed at 48–72 h. Treatment of cells with PMA (0.001–10 μm) for different times was performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were harvested into lysis buffer, lysed by sonication, and fractionated by centrifugation, as described by Szallasi et al. (32Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic fraction was obtained by collection of the supernatant after centrifugation of the total lysate (1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C). The pellet was extracted for 1 h with 1% Triton X-100 in lysis buffer and subsequently centrifuged (1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C). The supernatant of this spin represents the Triton X-100-soluble particulate fraction (membrane-enriched), and the remaining pellet is the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (cytoskeleton-enriched). Protein concentration was determined in each sample using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and equal amounts of protein for each fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently immunostained with the anti-ε-tag antibody. After stripping off the antibodies by incubation in 3.5 mMgCl2 and phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 60 °C, the membranes were blotted with a specific anti-PKCα antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for detection of the endogenous PKCα. Densitometric analysis was performed under conditions that yield a linear response and analyzed using the NIH Image 1.52 program (33Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we took advantage of the baculovirus expression system to generate β2-chimaerin as a GST-fusion protein. Using a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell, the highest levels of expression were obtained at about 60 h after infection (data not shown). Total lysates of Sf9 cells infected with either a recombinant β2-chimaerin baculovirus or a PKCα baculovirus (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar) showed elevated [3H]PDBu binding compared with noninfected Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 B). High levels of expression of GST-β2-chimaerin were observed in Western blots using an anti-GST antibody (Pharmacia) (data not shown). GST-β2-chimaerin was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and then β2-chimaerin was subsequently released from the GST fusion partner by cleavage with thrombin. A Coomassie Blue-stained gel of the recombinant purified β2-chimaerin is shown in Fig. 1 A. About 1–2 mg of β2-chimaerin/liter of Sf9 cells was typically obtained, and the purity of the preparation was usually greater than 80%. Chimaerins have a high degree of sequence identity with PKC isozymes at the level of the cysteine-rich domain (approximately 40% with PKCα). We have determined previously that, similar to PKCα, recombinant n-chimaerin expressed in baculovirus binds phorbol esters with high affinity (26Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using [3H]PDBu as a probe for phorbol ester binding, we have observed that β2-chimaerin also binds efficiently to the radioligand in the presence of a phospholipid cofactor (phosphatidylserine, 100 μg/ml). As described earlier for PKC (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dunphy W.G. Kochenburger R.J. Castagna M. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2640-2647PubMed Google Scholar), binding of [3H]PDBu to recombinant β2-chimaerin is fast and stable. At 18 °C, 76% of the maximum binding was observed after a 5-min incubation. Maximum binding was reached after 30 min and maintained for at least 2 h. Binding at 37 °C proved to be less stable, reaching a maximum of only 75% at 5 min and decreasing to about 50% after 10 min. For routine analysis we used a 30-min incubation time at 18 °C. Scatchard analysis revealed that β2-chimaerin binds [3H]PDBu with high affinity (K d = 1.9 ± 0.2 nm,n = 3) (Fig.2 A). The presence of 0.1 mm calcium, a cofactor for the classic PKC isozymes, did not affect substantially the binding affinity (K d = 1.1 ± 0.1 nm, n = 3). Under similar experimental conditions, PKCα expressed and purified from Sf9 cells bound [3H]PDBu with a K d of 0.15 ± 0.02 nm (n = 3). In previous papers we have reported low nanomolar affinities for classic and novel PKCs (K d values between 0.1 and 1 nm) and for Unc-13 (K d = 1.3 nm) (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). β2-Chimaerin expressed in E. coli has a comparable binding affinity for [3H] PDBu (K d = 1.3 ± 0.1 nm, n = 3). The presence of the GST fusion partner did not change the affinity for [3H]PDBu (K d = 1.3 ± 0.2 nm, n = 3). To analyze receptor-ligand interactions, we quantitated competition of [3H]PDBu binding with a range of analogs known to bind and activate PKC (Table I). The series of compounds used in this structure-activity analysis, in addition to possessing different biological properties in cellular and animal models, spanned a range of 3 orders of magnitude in binding affinity for PKC isozymes. Our previous studies revealed a specific pattern of recognition for these compounds by individual PKC isoforms (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Competition experiments with 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate (prostratin), potent antipromoters in animal models, revealed somewhat lower affinities for β2-chimaerin than for PKCα, as was the case for PDBu. Similarly, the incomplete tumor promoter mezerein bound with lower potency to β2-chimaerin. The tumor promoter thymeleatoxin, a mezerein analog, has a significantly lower affinity (approximately 56-fold) for β2-chimaerin. This difference is greater than that previously observed among classic and novel PKC isozymes (i.e. 20-fold lower affinity for PKCε and η compared with PKCβ1) (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that differences in the binding affinity for thymeleatoxin between PKCα andn-chimaerin (26Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or between PKCδ and Unc-13 (13Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

The indole alkaloid (−)-indolactam V showed similar binding affinity for β2-chimaerin and PKCα. Likewise, the diacylglycerol OAG bound with similar affinity to both receptors. A representative competition experiment using OAG is shown in Fig.2 B. Structure-activity analysis was nearly identical in either Sf9- or E. coli-expressed β2-chimaerin (data not shown). These results clearly show that β2-chimaerin has a unique pattern of ligand recognition.Table IStructure-activity analysis of binding to β2-chimaerinCompoundKiRatioβ2-ChimaerinPKCα1-aFrom Kazanietz et al.

The bryostatins, macrocyclic lactones with an atypical spectrum of biological responses compared with those of the typical phorbol esters, also bound to β2-chimaerin with high affinity.

Early studies have established that acidic phospholipids are essential cofactors for the activation of PKC (35Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Iwasa Y. Kawahara Y. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

For this purpose, a plasmid expressing mGrb10α was stably transfected into p6 cells and other mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines.

At least seven laboratories have reported Grb10 proteins interacting with either the Insulin or the IGF-I receptors. The first report was by Liu and Roth (17Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), who identified a Grb10, which they called Grb-IR (now hGrb10β), lacking, in respect to mGrb10α, a 46-amino acid sequence in the PH domain. hGrb10β inhibited insulin signaling, in particular tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (17Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hansen et al.(18Hansen H. Svensson U. Zhu J. Laviola L. Giorgino F. Wolf G. Smith R.J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8882-8886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) identified Grb10 (the same as the original one) as interacting with the C terminus of the IR, apparently at residue tyrosine 1322, and as noninteracting with IRS-1. Five other papers appeared almost simultaneously, describing an interaction of Grb10 (or similar molecules) with the IGF-IR (19Morrione A. Valentinis B. Li S. Ooi J.Y.T. Margolis B. Baserga R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The first of these papers reported the identification of the original mGrb10α (16Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar), while in the case of Dey et al. (20Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), only fragments of a human sequence were identified. O'Neill et al. (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W.

A peptide (presumably acting as a dominant negative) of this splice variant inhibited insulin- and IGF-I-mediated DNA synthesis. The Grb10 identified by Frantz et al. (21Frantz J.D. Giorgietti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is very similar to hGrb10γ1, and has been called hGrb10γ2, while the peculiarity of mGrb10ε (22Laviola L. Giorgino F. Chow J.C. Baquero J.A. Hansen H. Ooi J. Zhu J. Riedel H. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is that it interacts with the IR, but not at all with the IGF-IR. Very little has been published on the function of the Grb10 proteins, and that little is discordant, inasmuch as Liu and Roth (17Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) found an inhibitory action while O'Neill et al. (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) gave opposite results in terms of IR or IGF-IR signaling, albeit with a different isoform. We therefore decided to investigate in some detail the effect of the original mGrb10α (16Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar) on IGF-I-mediated cell proliferation. For this purpose, we stably transfected a plasmid expressing the full-length Grb10 (mGrb10α) into mouse embryo fibroblasts. The results indicate that mGrb10α has an inhibitory effect on IGF-I signaling for cell proliferation. The most intriguing finding, however, is that it does not inhibit entry into S phase, but that, instead, it seems to inhibit progression through the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. p6, TC4 and R−/IR cells are all mouse embryo fibroblasts, generated by a 3T3-like protocol, and have all been described in detail previously (24Pietrzkowski Z.

All Grb10-expressing cell lines were generated by cotransfecting the plasmid pMJ30/Grb10, expressing the full-length mouse Grb10α fused to a Myc tag, (a kind gift from Dr. Ben Margolis and James Ooi, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The University of Michigen Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI) with a plasmid carrying the hygromycin resistance gene (27Gritz L. Davies J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Clones were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml (p6 and TC4) or 300 μg/ml (R−/IR) amounts of hygromycin, using the Transfectam® reagent (Promega Corp.). For all experiments assessing proliferative effects, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 103/cm2 in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cultures were then placed in SFM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml transferrin, with or without purified growth factors (Sigma, Life Technologies, Inc.), and cell numbers were determined after 3 days in culture. Anchorage-independent growth and focus formation were carried out as described previously (7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). For the soft agar assay, 103 cells/plate were seeded and the colonies (diameter >125 μm) counted after 2 weeks in culture. For focus formation, cells were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105; after 14 days, the cultures were fixed in methanol containing 0.5% crystal violet. Cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibody in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylymethysulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 4–15% gradient gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% dry nonfat milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C and probed with the indicated first antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Oncogene Science). Blots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect Grb10 expression in the transfected clones, cell lysates from exponentially growing cells were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the Myc tag (Oncogene Science) and membranes were probed with an anti-Grb10 polyclonal antibody (309; a kind gift of Dr. Ben Margolis). For IGF-IR, IRS-1, and Shc analysis, cells were incubated in SFM for 48 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml IGF-I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated, respectively, with an anti-IGF-IR antibody (Ab1, Oncogene Science), an anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), or a polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (Transduction Laboratories). To detect phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated proteins, we used an anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories). After stripping on the same membranes, the amount of the immunoprecipitated protein was detected with an anti-IGF-IR β-subunit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), an anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), or a monoclonal anti-Shc antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Grb2 was immunoblotted with a monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). p6 and p6/Grb10 cells were grown in serum-free medium with or without IGF-I. Incubation was stopped by washing with PBS and trypsinizing the cells after 72 h. The analysis by flow cytometry was performed as described by Sell et al. (29Sell C. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 303-306PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsinized cells were washed in cold PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20 °C. After a wash in cold PBS, cells were incubated in PBS with RNase A (75 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed in PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 15 μg/ml propidium iodide. A minimum of 20,000 cells/sample were analyzed with a Coulter Epics Profile II (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, FL). Cell cycle distribution was calculated by the Multi-Cycle Program (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104/35-mm dish on coverslips in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cultures were then placed in SFM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml transferrin for 96 h, to become quiescent before the addition of growth factors. Tritiated thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) was added at the same time as the growth factors, and the incubations were continued for the times indicated. The cells were then fixed in cold methanol and autoradiographed. The percentage of labeled cells was determined by scoring a total of 1,000 cells. This has been described in detail previously by Resnicoff et al. (30Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar). At the times indicated, the cells recovered from the chambers were counted and examined for the presence of apoptotic cells. As a starting cell line, we selected p6 cells (24Pietrzkowski Z. Lammers R. Carpenter G. Soderquist A.M. Limardo M. Phillips P.D. Ullrich A. Baserga R. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar), which are Balb/c 3T3 cells stably transfected with a plasmid expressing the full-length human IGF-IR cDNA (31Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 503-512Crossref Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). p6 cells express about 5 × 105 IGF-IRs/cell, grow very well in SFM supplemented solely with IGF-I, and are transformed because they form colonies in soft agar (7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell.

Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar). p6 cells were transfected with the Grb10 plasmid, and clones were selected as described under “Materials and Methods.” Three clones (clones J, 5, and 6) were found to express substantial amounts of Grb10 (Fig.1, lower panel), while three other clones (4, E, and H) expressed lower amounts, although still more than the parental cell line (see lanes 3–5 and 1in Fig. 1). We define as overexpressing those clones that have substantial amounts of Grb10 (clones J, 5, and 6). The various cell lines were tested for their ability to grow in SFM supplemented solely with IGF-I. As Fig. 1 (upper panel) shows, the growth of the three clones J, 5, and 6 was inhibited markedly, in respect to the parental cell line, the V cell line transfected with an empty vector, and the three cell lines expressing only moderate amounts of Grb10. Significantly, clone H, the highest of the low expressors, was inhibited moderately. TC4 cells are R− cells (28Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar), we transfected TC4 cells with the Grb10 plasmid and selected three clones. These three clones express substantial amounts of Grb10 (Fig. 2,lower panel, lanes 3–5); lane 6 gives the level of expression of p6/Grb10 clone 5, showing that the TC4 cells express at least as much Grb10 as the p6/Grb10 clones, whose growth in IGF-I is inhibited. However, the Grb10-expressing TC4 cells are not inhibited in the test for IGF-I-mediated growth (Fig. 2, upper panel), indirectly confirming that mGrb10α interacts with the C terminus of the IGF-IR. To clarify the discordant results of the literature (see Introduction), we tested the ability of mGrb10α to inhibit the growth of R−/IR cells (26Miura M. Surmacz E. Burgaud J.-L. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Morrione A. Valentinis B. Xu S. Yumet G. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Four clones expressing substantial amounts of Grb10 (Fig. 3, lower panel, lanes 3–6) were analyzed. As in Fig. 2, the last lane (lane 7 in this case) shows lysate of p6/Grb10 clone 5 cells, to offer a comparison of expression levels. The various cell lines were then tested for growth in SFM supplemented with 100 ng/ml insulin. Fig. 3 (upper panel) shows that the Grb10-expressing clones grow just as well as the parental cell line, R−/IR, and parental cells stably transfected with an empty vector (V cells). Fig. 4 shows a FACS analysis of p6 cells (A and B) and p6/Grb10 clone 5 cells (C and D) in either SFM or in SFM supplemented with IGF-I (20 ng/ml). The p6 cells stably transfected with an empty vector gave the same result as the parental p6 cells, while p6/Grb10 clone 6 cells were undistinguishable from clone 5 (data not shown). The Grb10-expressing cells clearly accumulated in the S and G2phases of the cell cycle, in SFM 70% against 28.2% in the parental p6 cells. After the cells were stimulated to grow by IGF-I (right panels), 86.8% of p6/Grb10.5 cells were in S/G2 versus 60% in the parental p6 cells. Because of the results obtained by O'Neill et al. (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we then determined whether an overexpressed mGrb10α inhibited the entry of quiescent cells into S phase. For this purpose, cells were made quiescent in SFM and were subsequently stimulated with IGF-I. Fig.5 shows the number of cells labeled by [3H]thymidine, as determined by autoradiography. There is no significant difference between the parental p6 cells and the two clones overexpressing Grb10 in their ability to enter S phase after stimulation with IGF-I. Foci formation and colony formation in soft agar are a characteristic of transformed cells, like p6 cells (7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). p6 and clones 5 and 6 of p6/Grb10 cells were tested for foci formation in monolayers (Fig.6). While p6 cells (panel A) formed distinct foci, p6/Grb10 clones 5 and 6 (panels B andC), although growing to high saturation density, did not form foci. Several cell lines were then tested for colony formation in soft agar (Table I). p6 cells, V cells (empty vector), and p6/Grb10 clone 4 cells (low level of Grb10 expression) formed essentially the same number of colonies in soft agar. The p6/Grb10 clones 5 and 6, by contrast, especially clone 5, had a reduced number of colonies, and the size of the colonies was also smaller. These experiments were repeated at least three times.Table IColony formation in soft agar of p6 and p6-derived cellsCell lineNo. of colonies1-aThe number of colonies (equal to or greater than 125 μm) was determined after 2 weeks.Maximum sizeμmp6252 /243250p6/V (empty vector)253 /260200p6/Grb10 clone 4255 /261250p6/Grb10 clone 513 /10125p6/Grb10 clone 6153 /1892001-a The number of colonies (equal to or greater than 125 μm) was determined after 2 weeks. Open table in a new tab However, mGrb10α does not cause apoptosis of p6 cells. This is shown in Table II, where the ability to induce apoptosis was determined by a very sensitive assay, the diffusion chamber described by Resnicoff et al. (30Resnicoff M. Abraham D.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3739-3741PubMed Google Scholar). p6 cells overexpressing mGrb10α do not undergo apoptosis in this system; in fact, they double in number in 24 h. Clone 5 showed a lower recovery of cells, but still well above the initial number of cells loaded into the chamber. This lower recovery is probably simply due to a slowed growth rate. It should be pointed out that, when the IGF-IR is targeted (30Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R.

The number of recovered cells is expressed as percent of cells loaded into the chambers. Open table in a new tab Cells (5 × 105) were loaded into a diffusion chamber as described by Resnicoff et al.

At that time, the chambers were removed from the animals and the cells were quantitatively recovered and counted. The number of recovered cells is expressed as percent of cells loaded into the chambers. Because the G1 phase of the cell cycle does not seem to be affected (Figs. 4 and 5), we did not expect gross alteration in IGF-IR autophosphorylation and in tyrosyl phosphorylation of either IRS-1 or Shc (see “Discussion”). However, we wanted to confirm our prediction by comparing p6 and V cells to clones 5 and 6 of p6/Grb10. Fig. 7 shows the results for the IGF-IR (panels A and B) and for IRS-1 (panels C and D). An overexpressed mGrb10α does not seem to affect IGF-IR autophosphorylation (panel A). Similarly, tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 is the same in all the 4 cell lines tested (panel C). Fig.8 shows the same experiment for the expression and tyrosyl phosphorylation of the Shc proteins. In each cell line, an additional band is tyrosyl-phosphorylated after stimulation with IGF-I, but the three cell lines are indistinguishable from each other (panels A and B). In Fig. 8(panel C), we tested for the possibility that Grb10 may compete with Grb2 for interaction with Shc (35Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, the blot of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody, was stripped and reblotted with an antibody to Grb2. The amount of Grb2 bound to Shc is the same in the three cell lines. We also tested for a direct interaction of mGrb10α with Shc proteins on the same blot; no Grb10 band was detectable (data not shown).Figure 8Tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shc proteins in p6 cells overexpressing mGrb10α.

These findings are discussed separately. Inasmuch as several reports have now appeared on the interaction of Grb10 proteins with either the IR or the IGF-IR, it may help the reader to summarize the Grb10 proteins so far published in TableIII. The original Grb10 (16Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar) is now called mGrb10α; it is known to interact both with the IR (18Hansen H. Svensson U. Zhu J. Laviola L. Giorgino F. Wolf G. Smith R.J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8882-8886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and with the IGF-IR (19Morrione A. Valentinis B. Li S. Ooi J.Y.T. Margolis B. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar), and it is the one used in the present experiments. Of the others, hGrb10γ1 (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) also interacted with both receptors, whereas mGrb10ε (22Laviola L. Giorgino F.

Grb10 function has been investigated very little, in fact only with hGrb10β (17Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), hGrb10γ1 (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but cell proliferation function was studied only by O'Neill et al. (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and their findings are relevant to our paper. These authors found that a microinjected peptide acted as a dominant negative of hGRb10γ1, by inhibiting both insulin and IGF-I-mediated DNA synthesis, but not DNA synthesis stimulated by either epidermal growth factor or serum. The corollary was that wild type hGrb10γ1 must have a stimulatory effect on IGF-induced DNA synthesis. Our data with mGrb10α indicate an opposite conclusion. We have used several stably transfected clones, not only, but when Grb10 was poorly expressed, growth was not inhibited. Indeed, there is fair correlation between expression levels and inhibition of IGF-I-mediated cell proliferation. We have also repeated, substantially, the experiment of O'Neill et al.(23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and, under our conditions, an overexpressed mGrb10α does not inhibit entry into S phase after IGF-I stimulation. On the other hand, the experiments of O'Neill et al. (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Although mGrb10α is known to interact both with the IR (18Hansen H. Svensson U. Zhu J. Laviola L. Giorgino F. Wolf G. Smith R.J. Riedel H. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar), it inhibits only IGF-I-mediated mitogenesis, and has no effect on insulin-mediated mitogenesis (Fig. 3). It should be remarked that p6 and R−/IR cells have approximately the same number of IGF-IRs and IRs, respectively, and expressed similar levels of Grb10 protein. It seems that mGrb10α signals differently from the two receptors. This may be due to the fact that, although mGrb10α seems to interact with the C terminus of either receptor (18Hansen H. Svensson U. Zhu J. Laviola L. Giorgino F. Wolf G. Smith R.J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8882-8886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Morrione A. Valentinis B. Li S. Ooi J.Y.T. Margolis B. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar), these C termini have substantially different sequences (31Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kahuria S. Chen E. Jakobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 503-512Crossref Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), and also differ functionally (36Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 37Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the C terminus is confirmed in the present experiments by the finding that mGrb10α does not inhibit the growth of 3T3-like cells expressing a truncated form of the IGF-IR (25Surmacz E. Sell C. Swantek J. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), lacking the last 108 amino acids. Overexpression of mGrb10α partially reverses the transformed phenotype of p6 cells. We use the expression “partial reversion,” because, although foci formation is abrogated, colony formation in soft agar is only partially inhibited, especially when compared with the effect of inhibition of the IGF-IR function, either by antisense strategies (38Resnicoff M. Sell C. Rubin R. Rubini M. Coppola D. Ambrose D. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2218-2222PubMed Google Scholar) or dominant negatives (34D'Ambrosio C. Ferber A. Resnicoff M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4013-4020PubMed Google Scholar, 39Burgaud J.-L. Resnicoff M. Baserga R. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which result in a much higher inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. Compatible with this partial inhibition is our finding that overexpression of mGrb10α does not induce apoptosis, even in a very sensitive assay. Our previous findings with the IGF-IR have indicated that several mutants of the receptor (acting as dominant negatives) that reduce colony formation in soft agar are not sufficiently impaired to cause apoptosis (30Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 33Resnicoff M. Burgaud J.-L. Rotman H.L. Abraham D.

Our results show that the inhibitory effect of mGrb10α is not the effect of a block in G1, but, instead, of a delay in the progression of cells through S phase and G2. This should not be surprising, because Sell et al. (7Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) have shown that the activated IGF-IR is required for cell cycle progression in each phase of the cell cycle, and not just in G1. Accordingly, we found no inhibition of IRS-1 or Shc tyrosyl phosphorylation, which are usually associated with the transition from G0 to S phase (40Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22231-22234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rose D.W. Satiel A.R. Majumdar M. Decker S.J. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because IGF-IR signaling in p6/Grb10 cells does not seem to be impaired in G1, we have not insisted in extending our studies to transducing molecules downstream of these two IGF-IR substrates, IRS-1 and Shc. The delay in S phase/G2progression suggests to us that we must look at a different pathway, connecting the IGF-IR to the later phases of the cell cycle. This is not an easy task, inasmuch as very few clues are available on the identity of such a pathway; the only clue, in fact, comes from the observation that one of the cyclin-associated proteins, cdc2, is induced by IGF-I (42Surmacz E. Nugent P. Pietrzkosky Z. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Studies are in progress on the functional status of cyclins A and B and their associated proteins in p6/Grb10 cellsversus the parental cell line. In conclusion, we report here that overexpression of mGrb10α has an inhibitory effect on IGF-mediated mitogenesis and transformation. The discrepancy with the opposite results obtained by O'Neill et al. (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Glucose uptake requires sequential phosphoryl transfer from four PTS proteins, as follows: P-enolpyruvate → EI → HPr → IIAGlc → enzyme IIB, CGlc→ glucose. In this pathway, HPr acts as part of a phosphoryl shuttle between EI and sugar-specific proteins. Since the PTS was discovered in E. coli nearly 30 years ago (3Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), additional studies have documented other metabolic roles of this system. The PTS regulates chemotaxis to PTS sugars, adenylate cyclase, and certain non-PTS permeases (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies implicate the crr gene product (IIAGlc) as the mediator of some of these regulatory phenomena. The current model suggests that IIAGlc and/or P-IIAGlc interact with target proteins and that the ratio of P-IIAGlc to IIAGlc may be the determining factor in PTS-mediated regulation. Until now, there has been no direct evidence for the participation of the two general PTS proteins (EI and HPr) in the regulation of other metabolic pathways in enteric bacteria except that GTP binding to HPr may mediate the GTP-dependent stimulation of the activity of the adenylyl cyclase complex in E. coli (4Peterkofsky A. Seok Y.-J. Amin N. Thapar R. Lee S.Y. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. Anderson J.W. Gruschus J. Huq H. Gollop N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8950-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). E. coli HPr is a small, monomeric protein with aM r, predicted from its amino acid sequence, of 9119 (5De Reuse H. Roy A. Danchin A. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Its three-dimensional structure has been determined by x-ray crystallographic and two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis (6Hammen P.K. Waygood E.B. Klevit R.E.

Phosphoryl transfer from P-EI (His-189) to HPr is at His-15 (9Weigel N. Powers D.A. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14499-14509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Gram-positive bacteria, HPr is phosphorylated at a second site, Ser-46, by a metabolite-activated, ATP-dependent protein kinase and dephosphorylated by a Pi-dependent phosphatase (10Reizer J. Romano A.H. Deutscher J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Ser-46 phosphorylation site appears to play a role in the regulation of catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis (11Deutscher J. Kuster E. Bergstedt U. Charrier V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). HPr has also been shown to regulate glycerol kinase by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism in Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis (12Vadeboncoeur C. Res. Microbiol. 1995; 146: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, ligand fishing, using surface plasmon resonance 2Further extensive information concerning surface plasmon resonance can be obtained on the World Wide Web athttp://www.biacore.com. spectroscopy, was employed to discover the high affinity binding of HPr to a protein in E. coli extracts. The protein was purified and established to be glycogen phosphorylase (GP). E. coliGP has a M r, predicted from its amino acid sequence, of 93,144, and it has been suggested, from gel filtration chromatography experiments, to exist as a dimer (13Yu F. Jen Y. Takeuchi E. Inouye M. Nakayama H. Tagaya M. Fukui T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13706-13711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GP is constitutively expressed (14Chen G.S. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 127: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is encoded (glgP) on theglgCAP operon, which also includes genes for ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and glycogen synthase, respectively (15Romeo T. Kumar A. Preiss J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GP was overexpressed and purified. A variety of physical studies established that HPr is an allosteric effector of GP and that it specifically stimulates GP activity by a mixed type of mechanism. Several amino acids in HPr important for GP activation were identified. Before the present studies were carried out, there was no conclusive evidence that associated HPr with regulatory functions in Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli; further, it was previously thought that E. coli and other prokaryotic GPs are not subject to regulation (16Newgard C.B.

Yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, yeast hexokinase, rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase, and restriction enzymes SalI and NdeI were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Pfu DNA polymerase was a Stratagene product. Mark 12TM Wide-Range protein standards were purchased from NOVEX. EI and IIAGlc from E. coli were purified after hyperexpression by a previously described method (18Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HPr was expressed and purified using GI698 transformed with expression vector pSP100 as described recently (19Garrett D. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). HPrs fromB. subtilis and Mycoplasma capricolum were gifts from Dr. Peng-Peng Zhu. A collection of HPrs carrying single replacements was a gift from Dr. E. Bruce Waygood. Dr. Jonathan Reizer generously provided essentially pure E. coli NPr as well asE. coli DTP (approximately 50% pure). Two samples of the HPr-binding protein (10 μg) were dried in a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). The resulting residues were dissolved in 50 μl of 8m urea, 0.4 m NH4HCO3and subjected to reduction, alkylation, and proteolytic digestion with (a) 1.0 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) or (b) 1.0 μg of modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the method of Stone and Williams (20Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 43-69Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting digests were separated by RP-HPLC on a narrowbore (2.1 × 250 mm) Vydac 218TP52 column/guard column combination (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) with elution at 0.25 ml/min at 35 °C, utilizing the gradient described by Fernandez et al. (21Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) on a System Gold HPLC equipped with a model 507 autosampler, model 126 programmable solvent module, and model 168 diode array detector (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Column effluent was monitored at 215 and 280 nm. Fractions were collected at 30-s intervals and stored at −70 °C. Selected fractions from the trypsin digest containing mixtures of peptides were pooled, concentrated in a Speed Vac concentrator, and further purified by a second RP-HPLC step on a narrowbore (2.0 × 250 mm) YMC ODS AQ column (YMC, Morris Plains, NJ). Elution was at 0.25 ml/min at 35 °C on the same HPLC system utilizing the previously described gradient and buffers. Fractions (125 μl) containing peptides were applied in 30-μl aliquots to a Biobrene-treated glass fiber filter (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and dried prior to amino acid sequencing on a model 477A pulsed liquid protein sequencer equipped with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems), using methods and cycles supplied by the manufacturer. Data were collected and analyzed on a model 610A data analysis system (Applied Biosystems). Amino acid sequences were searched in the GCG-Swiss Protein Data base (University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The interactions of glycogen phosphorylase and PTS proteins were monitored by SPR detection using a BIAcore optical biosensor (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).2 PTS proteins were immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip. Enzyme I (70 μl, 20 μg/ml), HPr (70 μl, 100 μg/ml), or IIAGlc(70 μl, 100 μg/ml) in coupling buffer (10 mmsodium-formate, pH 4.0) was allowed to flow over a sensor chip at 10 μl/min to couple the protein to the matrix by a NHS/EDC reaction (70 μl of mix). Unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide was inactivated by injecting 70 μl of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0. A blank surface was prepared by activation and inactivation of the sensor chip without any protein immobilization. Assuming that 1000 resonance units (RU) corresponds to a surface concentration of 1 ng/mm2, EI, HPr, and IIAGlc were immobilized to a surface concentration of 2.9, 1.4, and 2.0 ng/mm2, respectively. The standard running buffer was 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20, and all reagents were introduced at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The sensor surface was regenerated between assays by injecting 10 μl of water to remove bound analyte. Kinetic parameters for the interaction of E. coli glycogen phosphorylase with immobilized HPr were determined using the BIA-evaluation 2.1 software (Pharmacia). Primers possessing the synthetic restriction enzyme sites NdeI, located 3 base pairs upstream from the ATG start codon (in boldface type) (5′-TTTCAGGAAACGCCCATATG AATGCTCCGT-3′) of theglgP gene (encoding glycogen phosphorylase), andSalI, located 1 base pair downstream from the TAA stop codon (in boldface type) (5′-CGTTCTATTTATTGGTCGAC TTACAATCTC-3′), were constructed (restriction sites underlined). Using these primers, theglgP gene from pJF02 (13Yu F. Jen Y. Takeuchi E. Inouye M. Nakayama H. Tagaya M. Fukui T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13706-13711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified for 30 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min (denaturing), 50 °C for 2 min (annealing), and 72 °C for 3 min (extension) in a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler. The pJF02 was a gift from Dr. M. Inouye. After digestion, theNdeI-SalI fragment (2454 base pairs) was inserted into the corresponding sites of pRE1 (22Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the recombinant plasmid (pGP, 7399 base pairs) (Fig. 1) was electroporated with a Bio-Rad E. coli pulser into E. coli strain GI698 (23Seok Y.-J. Lee B.R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which encodes the gene for the λ repressor under control of the trp promoter. Cells grown overnight were used to inoculate 1 liter of synthetic medium (23Seok Y.-J. Lee B.R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A 600 = 0.25–0.30, and the culture was incubated at 30 °C. When the culture reached an A 600 = 0.4, tryptophan (100 μg/ml) was added to induce glgP expression. The cells were harvested at an A 600 of 1.8 (7–8 h after induction) and washed once with 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, and the cell pellet was stored at −20 °C. The steps of purification were followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). GP activity was determined as described below and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) (see Table I). The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and then passed three times through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. The lysate was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 100 min (crude extract). The majority of GP (approximately 80%) was found in the insoluble portion of the lysate due to inclusion body formation associated with the high level of GP expression. Approximately 15% of the protein in the crude extract corresponded to GP. The crude extract was chromatographed through an FPLC Mono-Q 10/10 column (Pharmacia) using a gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl (total volume, 80 ml). Fractions at approximately 450 mm NaCl were enriched in glycogen phosphorylase according to analysis using SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gel, Novex). These fractions were pooled and concentrated in a 10 K Macrosep centrifugal concentrator (Filtron) in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. At this stage, the GP was approximately 75% pure. The concentrated Mono-Q fractions were chromatographed through a Superose 12 column (1.6 × 50 cm) using 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, with 100 mm NaCl. The fractions were analyzed, pooled, and concentrated as described for the Mono-Q column and then stored at −80 °C. TableI shows the details of the purification. The overall purification was 7.7-fold from the crude extract to the final preparation. From 1 liter of culture (wet weight of cells, 3.24 g), a yield of 16.24 mg (24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) of approximately 95% pure GP was obtained.Table IPurification of E. coli glycogen phosphorylasePurification stepTotal activityTotal amount of proteinSpecific activityunitsmgunits/mgCrude extract16.33214.900.076Mono-Q column9.1721.270.431Superose 12 column9.516.240.585The total activity, total amount of protein, and specific activity were determined for the soluble steps of the purification scheme for GP.

Glycogen phosphorylase activity was measured using a phosphoglucomutase- and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled enzyme assay (25Helmreich E. Cori C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% glycogen, 50 nm glucose 1,6-diphosphate, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mm NADP, 10 μg/ml phosphoglucomutase, 2 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 5 μg/ml glycogen phosphorylase, unless noted otherwise. Two minutes after the initiation of the reaction with GP, theA 340, a measure of the increase in NADPH, was recorded every minute for a total of 10 min in a Pharmacia LKB Ultrospec Plus Spectrophotometer. A unit of glycogen phosphorylase activity is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of NADP/min at 25 °C. PAGE was used to demonstrate the shift of GP mobility due to its interaction with HPr in a nondenaturing discontinuous system (3% stacking gel in Tris·HCl, pH 6.7, and 6% resolving gel in Tris·glycine, pH 8.3). Tris·glycine (pH 8.3) was used as the running buffer, and the temperature was maintained at 15 °C using a NOVEX Thermoflow temperature controller. A binding mixture (10 μl) of 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml glycogen phosphorylase, and 40 μg/ml of HPr (approximately a 2:1 molar ratio of HPr to GP) was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. This mixture was combined with 3 μl of 5 × loading buffer (0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.5 m Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol) and electrophoresed on a pre-equilibrated gel for 1 h at 70 V, followed by 2 h at 100 V. For analysis of gel shifts associated with mutant HPrs (see Table III), each gel consisted of 10 lanes and was loaded in the following manner: lanes 1 and 10, GP control; lane 2, GP plus wild-type HPr; lanes 3–9, GP plus the specified mutant HPrs. After electrophoresis, a xerographic copy of the stained gel (magnification: × 4) was used for measurement of gel shifts. A reference line was drawn to connect the bands in lanes 1 and 10 (glycogen phosphorylase controls). The distance (in mm) was measured between the gel-shifted bands and the reference line, and from these values, a ratio was calculated for the distance the mutant HPr shifted GP in comparison with the shift produced by wild-type HPr.Table IIIInteraction of mutated HPrs with glycogen phosphorylaseMutationGel shiftGP activationMutationGel shiftGP activationR(mutant/wild type)R(mutant/wild type)R(mutant/wild type)R(mutant/wild type)F2Y1.10.9S46R1.40.4Q3K1.51.1S46N1.00.3Q4S1.41S46A1.00.8E5Q1.50.9Q51T1.01.0T7N1.30.8Q51E0.20.5 (0.1)N12D1.20.9Q57E0.90.9H15E3-aAll of the mutated HPrs, except for H15E, were a gift from Dr. E.

The gel shift data for those mutations exhibiting a ratio of mutant to wild-type of ≤0.3 are highlighted in boldface type. GP activation data represents the ratio of the stimulation of GP activity by a mutant HPr compared to the activation by wild-type HPr (see “Experimental Procedures”). Numbers in parentheses correspond to the activation ratio at a lower concentration of HPr (1 μg/ml) than that used in the standard assay (10 μg/ml) (see Fig. 7). A statist"

J., Jr., Alamo, I. J., and Hollander, M. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8800–8804) that led to the identification and cloning of five important hamster and humanGADD genes (Fornace, A. J., Jr., Nebert, D. W., Hollander, M. C., Luethy, J. D., Papathanasiou, M., Fargnoli, J., and Holbrook, N. J. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol.9, 4196–4203). In this study we have characterized the remaining DNA damage-inducible (DDI) transcripts. Of the 24 DDI clones, 3 clones (A13, A20, and A113) representing different regions of the same hamster cDNA exhibited near perfect homology to human p21 WAF1/CIP1 cDNA. The DDI clones A26, A88, and A99 displayed very high sequence homologies with the human proliferating nuclear antigen, rat translation initiation factor-5 (eIF-5), and human thrombomodulin, respectively, whereas clones A29 and A121 matched with express sequence tagged sequences of unknown identity. The DDI clones A18, 106, and A107 were different isolates of the same hamster cDNA (hereafter referred to as A18) and displayed high sequence homology with the members in the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. Using the hamster A18 partial-length cDNA as a probe, we screened human fibroblast cDNA library and isolated the corresponding full-length human cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the putative protein contains all the canonical features of a novel glycine-rich hnRNP. The A18 mRNA levels were specifically increased in response to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation or UV mimetic agents. Thus the putative A18 hnRNP is the first hnRNP whose mRNA is specifically regulated in response to UV-induced DNA damage; accordingly, it may play some role in repair of UV-type DNA damage. Low ratio hybridization subtraction technique was previously used in this laboratory to enrich and isolate a number of low abundance UV-inducible hamster transcripts (Fornace, A. J., Jr., Alamo, I. J., and Hollander, M. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8800–8804) that led to the identification and cloning of five important hamster and humanGADD genes (Fornace, A.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are constantly exposed to endogenous as well as exogenous DNA damaging agents. DNA damage (genotoxic stress) is implicated not only in enhancing the rate of mutagenesis but has also been shown to invoke replication and transcription blocks (reviewed in Refs. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar and 2Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1994: 221-237Google Scholar). UV irradiation and UV mimetic agents inflict DNA damage that is predominantly repaired via NER 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; MMS, methylmethane sulfonate; AAAF,N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene; DDI, DNA damage-inducible; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EST, expressed sequence tagged; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; eIF-5, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP, heterogeneous RNP; RBD, RNA binding domain; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase pair(s). pathway (reviewed in Ref. 2Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1994: 221-237Google Scholar). DNA damage induced by base damaging agents such as MMS and H202, on the other hand, is repaired primarily by base excision repair pathway (reviewed in Ref. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar and 2Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1994: 221-237Google Scholar). The cellular response to genotoxic stress is mediated via important genes that control a multitude of complex regulatory pathways. Although a number of mammalian genotoxic stress-inducible genes have been identified in recent years, the actual number of these genes is probably far greater (reviewed in Ref. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These genes have been implicated to play roles in a number of important cellular processes such as control of cell cycle progression, replication, transcription, signal transduction, DNA repair, and mutagenesis (reviewed in Ref.1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Low ratio hybridization subtraction technique is a highly sensitive method that allows for the enrichment of cDNAs of low abundance transcripts that are increased only a few-fold over the uninduced levels (3Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This technique was used previously in this laboratory to enrich and isolate low abundance transcripts that were rapidly induced (within 4 h) by UV irradiation in CHO cells (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The cDNAs representing those UV-regulated, enriched transcripts were used to construct a DDI library (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Based on their response to genotoxic stress, these cDNA clones were later divided into two classes. Class I contained clones that were induced solely by UV irradiation and UV mimetic agents, whereas class II contained clones that were regulated by UV radiation and a host of other genotoxic agents producing base damage in DNA, such as MMS (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Upon further characterization of the isolated clones, five important GADD(growth arrest and DNAdamage-inducible) genes including GADD45, GADD153, GADD34, GADD33, and GADD7 were identified (5Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar,6Papathanasiou M.A. Kerr N.C.

GADD45 is directly regulated by p53 at transcriptional level (7Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar) and appears to play a role in controlling cell proliferation (8Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Recently, the human GADD45 protein was also found to physically interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and p21 WAF1/CIP1 (9Smith M.L. Chen I. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C. Gilmer T.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1675-1683PubMed Google Scholar). The GADD153 gene codes for a protein that belongs to the C/EBP family of transcription factors (11Luethy J.D. Fargnoli J. Park J.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), whereas the GADD34 gene product appears to play a role in cell differentiation and perhaps in regulation of apoptosis (8Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The GADD33 is a hamster equivalent of a human cornifin gene and appears to regulate keratinocyte differentiation (1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Although the protein product of the GADD7 gene has not been detected and its transcript is probably not translated (12Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 387-395Google Scholar), enforced overexpression of exogenous GADD7 gene was sufficient to reduce the colony-forming efficiency of Chinese hamster ovary and RKO human colon carcinoma cells (12Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). The GADD genes are induced in response to various types of genotoxic and nongenotoxic stresses that elicit growth arrest (reviewed in Refs. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar and 2Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1994: 221-237Google Scholar). Unlike theGADD genes, a number of other transcripts were variably induced only by genotoxic agents and were not modulated in response to nongenotoxic growth-arresting conditions (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The identity of these transcripts remains unknown. We undertook this study to further characterize the remaining DNA damage-inducible clones and to identify their human homologs. UV irradiation and/or MMS regulation of human homologs of hamster DDI transcripts were investigated in the following human cell lines: MCF-7, breast carcinoma cells; RKO, colon carcinoma cells; A549, lung carcinoma cells; H1299, lung carcinoma cells; HeLa, cervical carcinoma cells; Sk-N-SH, neuroblastoma cells; OVCAR, ovarian carcinoma cells; ML-1, myeloid leukemia cells; WMN, Burkitt's lymphoma cells; GM536, lymphoblastoma cells. Cells were irradiated with UV or γ-irradiation or treated with chemical agents as described previously (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 5Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell.

Fornace Jr., A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from cells 4 h after UV irradiation and subjected to cDNA synthesis. The cDNAs from irradiated cells were hybridized at a high Rot with poly(A)+ RNA from unirradiated cells. The single-stranded cDNA thus obtained was then hybridized to original poly(A)+ RNA obtained from irradiated cells, and the cDNA:RNA duplex was separated by hydroxylapatite column. The RNA was removed from the cDNA by alkali treatment, and the remaining single-stranded cDNAs were utilized as templates to synthesize second strand cDNAs using a mixture of random primers. The resulting double-stranded cDNAs were cloned into a plasmid pXF3 via GC-tailing (3Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). For cloning of the human homolog of hamster A18, the Okayama-Berg GM637 human fibroblast cDNA library (13Chin D.J. Gil G. Russell D.W. Loscum L. Lusky K.L. Basu S.K. Okayama H. Berg P. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1984; 308: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by H. Okayama) was screened using a partial-length hamster A18 cDNA. The DDI clones and the cDNAs representing human homologs of hamster A18 were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination method as described previously (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 5Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA preparation, Northern blotting, and quantitative dot blot hybridization were performed essentially as described previously (14Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 174-179PubMed Google Scholar). For probe labeling, the appropriate cDNA inserts were excised from the plasmids and labeled using random primer methods (14Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 174-179PubMed Google Scholar, 15Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The relative poly(A) content of each RNA sample was determined using a labeled polythymidylate probe, and the values were used to correct for variations in sample loading as described (14Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 174-179PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation, the radioactive signals were either counted directly using a Betascope (Betagen), or the signals on the autoradiograms were measured by a densitometer. DNA extraction and Southern blot hybridization analysis were performed using standard protocols (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following cDNA probes were used in this study: (a) cDNA inserts of DDI clones, (b) human equivalent of hamster A18 cloned in this study, (c) human EST sequences homologous to hamster DDI A29, A88, and A121 (obtained from IMAGE Consortium, LLNL), (d) human β-actin cDNA probe, as previously described (5Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The A18 cDNA containing the ORF and 3′-untranslated region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified. The T7 promoter sequence was incorporated into the 5′ primer so that it was collinear with the A18 cDNA sequence starting with ATG. The polymerase chain reaction primer sequences are as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGGCATCAGATGAAGGCA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CACAGCACAGATGGACGCA-3′. Aliquots ranging from 0.2 μg to 1 μg of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified A18 cDNA were subjected to in vitrotranscription/translation using TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the reactions were performed in 50 μl for 90 min at 30 °C. Luciferase cDNA was used as a positive control, and reactions without DNA template were performed to determine the background incorporation of [35S]methionine. Five μl of each sample were analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gel was fixed, soaked for 30 min in an enhancer solution (Enlightening; Dupont), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. As described previously (3Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), cDNA clones isolated after our hybridization subtraction procedure were only partial length, with an average insert size of 0.2–0.3 kb. In addition, many of these hamster cDNA sequences were from nontranslated portions of the UV-inducible transcripts and cross-hybridized poorly with human RNA. These partial-length cDNA clones were sequenced in their entirety and compared with all published sequences in the nucleotide and peptide sequence data bases using the BLAST network service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. TableI illustrates the results of the homology searches. As reported previously, these clones can be divided into two classes; class I comprises the clones that are induced by UV irradiation, whereas the class II clones are UV irradiation- and MMS-inducible. Among the DDI clones shown in Table I, the clone A26 exhibited 96, 96, and 94% nucleotide sequence homology, respectively, with mouse, rat, and human cDNAs encoding PCNA (17Toschi L. Bravo R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1623-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of A88 was 97% homologous to the rat cDNA encoding eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5 (eIF-5) and 91% homologous to human EST sequence bearing homology to rat eIF-5 cDNA (18Das K. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3058-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The DDI clone A99 was 86 and 72% homologous to mouse and human thrombomodulin clones, respectively (19Shirai T. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Yamamoto S. Kusumoto H. Deyashiki Y. Maruyama I. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1988; 103: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The DDI clones A113 as well as A13 and A20 each displayed 80, 85, and 80% homologies to mouse, rat, and human p21 WAF1/CIP1 cDNA sequences, respectively (20El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E.

A18, A106, and A107 exhibited homology to nucleotide sequences encoding hnRNPs of diverse origin (22Cobianchi F. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

The DDI clones A29 and A121 also displayed homology to EST sequences of unknown identity. An automated BLASTX search for the possible translation products of A29 and A121 from all reading frames did not reveal significant identities to any of the known amino acid sequences in the data bases. None of the remaining clones exhibited homology to any of the nucleotide or amino acid sequences deposited in these data bases.

PCNA, p21WAF1/CIP1, and thrombomodulin are among the known stress-inducible genes (25Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Bae I.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3058-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and yeast (28Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) eIF-5 cDNAs are cloned and sequenced, whereas the corresponding human cDNA remains to be cloned and sequenced. We next sought to investigate whether human homologs of hamster A88, A29, and A121 genes were also stress-inducible. In CHO cells, A88 is regulated by UV treatment, whereas the A29 and A121 are induced by UV and MMS. We exposed various human cell lines to UV irradiation, MMS, and γ-irradiation; poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and subjected to quantitative RNA blot hybridization using corresponding human cDNA probes. Our results (summarized in Table I) demonstrated that MMS induced the mRNA levels of human A29 and A121 in all the cell lines tested, whereas it had no effect on the expression of A88 (eIF-5 homolog). γ-Irradiation by contrast had no appreciable effect on the levels of these transcripts in any of the human cell lines tested (data not shown). The UV effects were, however, cell-type specific. Of the cell lines tested (mentioned under “Experimental Procedures”), UV treatment modestly enhanced the mRNA levels of human A88 (eIF-5) in H1299 human lung carcinoma and in GM536 human lymphoblastoma cells, whereas the A29 and A121 regulation was noted in ML-1 myeloid leukemia cell line and GM536 human lymphoblastoma cells. Both A29 and A121 were also regulated by UV irradiation and by MMS in CHO cells, whereas A88 was regulated only by UV irradiation and not by MMS in CHO cells. These results, therefore, demonstrate that the regulation of these genes in response to genotoxic stress is conserved in rodent and human (TableI). Northern blot analyses were performed to determine the sizes of these transcripts, and the overall results are summarized in TableI. A18, A106, and A107 were the three other DDI clones that belonged to class I and displayed nucleotide sequence homology to known sequences in the data bases. A comparison (using BLASTX search) of the predicted amino acids of the partial sequences of A18, A106, and A107 in all reading frames with known sequences in the data bases revealed high similarity with the hnRNPs of the RNP family (22Cobianchi F.

The hnRNPs belong to a subgroup in a large family of the RNPs and exist in the nucleus in association with other proteins (22Cobianchi F. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Isolation of three clones representing different regions of the same cDNA that did not cross-hybridize with any of the other isolated DDI clones coupled to the fact that none of the other clones exhibited homology to RNP family members suggested that the A18 mRNA might encode a novel hnRNP that is exclusively regulated by UV irradiation. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of A18 displayed a high degree of homology with the corresponding sequences of human and rat A1 hnRNP (22Cobianchi F. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3536-3543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in hamster cells the rat A1 hnRNP cDNA hybridized to a more abundant transcript of approximately 2 kb, which differs in size from that of A18 mRNA (1.4 kb), suggesting that the hamster DDI A18 clone does not represent hamster A1 hnRNP cDNA (22Cobianchi F. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3536-3543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but rather codes for a different hnRNP. Using hamster A18 and rat A1 hnRNP cDNAs as probes, we next investigated the effect of UV irradiation on the mRNA levels of A18 and A1 hnRNP in CHO cells. The results in Table II show that UV, near UV, and the UV mimetic agent AAAF up-regulated only A18 message and had no effect on A1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, only UV and UV mimetic agents enhanced the A18 transcript levels, whereas a number of other stress-inducing agents did not alter the A18 mRNA levels in these cells (Table II). It is interesting that the UV irradiation and AAAF-induced DNA damage is predominantly repaired via NER pathway (Ref.4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar; see Refs. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar and 2Hollander M.C.

The specific induction of A18 mRNA exclusively by DNA damage that is repaired by NER is quite intriguing. To investigate the significance of the A18 gene in response to DNA damage that is repaired by NER and to investigate whether the A18 gene is also regulated in human cells, we sought to isolate and sequence the full-length human equivalent of hamster A18.Table IISpecific induction of DDI A18 mRNA by UV and UV mimetic AAAF in Chinese hamster ovary cellsAgentDoseDDI A18cDNA probeβ-actinA1 hnRNPUV14 J/m23.11.00.9Near UV300 J/m22.91.10.9AAAF20 μm3.01.01.1MMS100 μg/ml1.11.11.3200 μg/ml1.0ND2-aND, not determined.1.1N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine10 μm1.10.81.030 μm1.00.90.9x-ray5 gray0.9ND0.940 gray1.1ND1.1Nitrogen mustard4 μm1.0ND0.68 μm1.00.91.040 μm1.41.01.0H2O20.4 mm1.30.91.1Bleomycin50 μg/ml1.2ND0.9Adriamycin0.4 μg/ml1.41.10.8Heat shock45.5 °C0.51.20.712-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate20 ng/ml1.21.10.7Cells were ex"

To explore the role of the different domains of the βL subunit in IFNα signaling, we coexpressed wild-type α subunit and truncated forms of the βL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265–346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the βL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNα2 binding to the receptor. This region of the βL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the βL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300–346 on the β subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287–295).

Interestingly, the type I IFN-binding proteins are not limited to the cellular components described above, because we and others have found a vaccinia virus-encoded protein capable of binding type I IFNs as well as blocking type I IFN signaling (11Colamonici O.R.

Coexpression of the α subunit with either βL or βS in mouse L-929 cells reconstitutes the high affinity receptor, whereas either form of the β chain expressed independently binds type I IFNs with low affinity. Additional studies using these transfectants show that the IFNα response can be reconstituted in mouse cells only when the α chain is coexpressed with the βL subunit rather than βS, indicating that both the α and βL subunits are indispensable for IFNα signaling (9Domanski P.

Similarly, only the long form of the β subunit is able to complement the mutant cell line U5A that is defective in the IFNα pathway (10Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J.

IFNs, cytokines, and growth factors activate the Jak-Stat pathway; more specifically, type I IFNs activate Jak1, Tyk2, Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 (for recent reviews, see Refs. 13Ihle J.N.

Ligand binding to the cytokine receptor subunits activates tyrosine kinases of the Jak family that are constitutively associated with different cytokine receptors. It has been demonstrated that Jak2 binds to the Box 1 motif present in the membrane proximal region of the erythropoietin, prolactin, growth hormone, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors (15Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

In the case of the α subunit of the type I IFN-R, there is no conserved Box 1 motif, and Tyk2 interacts with a distinct region different from that of Box 1 (22Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in those cytokine receptors that activate Jak1, the region that interacts with this kinase has not been clearly defined. The presence of a Box 1 motif in the membrane proximal region of the βL subunit of the type I IFN-R suggested a possible role for this motif in the binding and/or activation of Jak1 by this receptor subunit. We therefore sought to determine the role of the Box 1 and other domains of the βL chain in type I IFN signaling using two strategies: (a) we stably cotransfected mouse L-929 cells with the wild-type α subunit and various truncated forms of the βL chain to study in vivo signaling processes; and (b) we produced GST fusion proteins with deletions of the βL chain to demonstrate interactions in vitro. Our data indicate that a minimal region of the βL subunit cytoplasmic domain, specifically AAs 265–346, is required to activate Jak1 and induce an antiviral state. Using GST fusion proteins we show that this region contains a Jak1 binding domain (AAs 300–346) that is different from the Box 1 motif (AAs 287–295). The interaction between the βL chain and Jak1 is direct and does not require binding of IFNα2 to the receptor, although ligand binding slightly increases the amount of Jak1 associated with the βL chain. These results suggest that the homologous Jak kinases may interact with different motifs within the proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of cytokine receptors. Human recombinant IFNα2 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Brunda (Hoffman-La Roche) and Dr. Paul Trotta (Schering-Plough, Union, NJ). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies against Tyk2, Jak1, and Stat1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY).

The anti-Stat3 and anti-Jak1 sera were kindly provided by Drs. D. Levy (New York University, New York, NY) and J. N. Ihle (St. Jude's Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN), respectively. Antiviral assays were performed as described previously (23Cheung S.C. Chattopadhyay S.K. Hartley J.W. Morse H.C. Pitha P.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 121-127PubMed Google Scholar). These constructs were made by PCR using proofreading Vent polymerase and primers with an early termination codon at positions 300, 346, 360, or 417 (Fig. 1), respectively. The same forward primer (GGAAGATCTGTAAAAGTCAAGAGAAGACTC) at the beginning of the coding sequence of βL was used for all these constructs. Forward and reverse primers contained a BglII restriction site that was used for subcloning into the BamHI site of the pZipNeoSV(X) retroviral vector (constructs pZβL300, pZβL346, pZβL360, and pZβL417). The construct in which the βLchain was truncated at position 462 (pZβL462) was made byBamHI restriction endonuclease digestion of the 4A1 clone (9Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Menachen R. Larner A. Pitha-Rowe P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) followed by subcloning into the BamHI site of the pZipNeoSV(X) retroviral vector (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the pZβL462 construct revealed the addition of 13 amino acids (GSYMGHPAPCKLP) before a termination codon in the pZipNeo vector. PCR mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Expression of the α and βL subunit constructs in mouse L-929 cells was achieved by cotransfection of the different βL constructs and the pR4.IFNαRα construct containing the α subunit (cell lines designated as LpZR; i.e. LpZRαβL360.4) or transfection of the βL subunit constructs into the LpRα cell line that corresponds to L-929 cells stably transfected with the pR4.IFNαRα construct (cell lines designated as LpRZ;i.e. LpRZαβL346.4). Transfectants were selected in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (500 μg/ml), and individual clones were isolated and screened for receptor expression using affinity cross-linking and binding methods (see below). The GSTα465–557 encoding amino acids 465–557 of the α subunit of the type I IFN-R has been described previously (3Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs for the cytoplasmic domain of the βS and βL forms of the β subunit were made by PCR amplification using the same forward primer (AAATGGATTGGTTATATATGC) for the common region of the cytoplasmic domain and a specific reverse primer for βS and the SP6 primer for βL. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and subcloned into pGEX-KG vector to generate GSTβS spanning the whole cytoplasmic domain of βS (amino acids 265–331) (8Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and GSTβL265–462 corresponding to residues 265–462 of βL (9Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Menachen R. Larner A. Pitha-Rowe P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The GSTβL265–515 construct corresponding to the whole cytoplasmic domain of βL was generated by SalI/HindIII digestion of the PCR product and subcloned into the XhoI/HindIII restriction sites of pGEX-KG. The GSTβL265–462 construct was digested with SacI, StuI/SmaI, andNcoI to generate GSTβL265–375, GSTβL265–346, and GSTβL265–299, respectively (Fig. 1). GSTβL300–515 was produced by deletion of an NcoI restriction fragment (from theNcoI site in the pGEX-KG cloning site to the NcoI site at position 959 of the βL chain) from the GSTβL265–515 construct. The GST fusion proteins were produced in BL-21 cells (Novagen) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia). 5–10 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins were used for precipitations. Cells were treated with different concentrations of the indicated IFNs for 15 min, rapidly centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 30 s in an Eppendorf microfuge, and subsequently solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μm sodium orthovanadate).

Jak1 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEM vector under the control of the T7 promoter, and [35S]methionine-labeled protein was produced using rabbit reticulocyte (Novagen) or wheat germ (Promega) in vitrotranslation kits. Radioiodination of IFNα2, competitive displacement assays, and affinity cross-linking procedures were performed as described previously (2Colamonici O.R. D'Alessandro F. Diaz M.O. Gregory S.A.

To determine the biological relevance of disrupting the interactions of the βL subunit with the IFNα signaling machinery, we made constructs in which the βL chain was truncated at amino acids 462, 417, 360, 346, or 300, respectively (Fig.1). These βL chain constructs were coexpressed with the wild-type α subunit in mouse L-929 cells, and stable transfectants were selected with G418 and hygromycin B. We characterized the cell surface expression of the different human type I IFN-R chains by cross-linking125I-labeled IFNα2 to the receptor, followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against the α, βL, or βS subunits. Fig.2 shows that the anti-α subunit antibody detects the α subunit and a high molecular weight complex (lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16) that includes the α and βL chains (9Domanski P. Witte M.

The anti-βLsubunit antibody immunoprecipitates the βL chain (Fig. 2, ∗, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) and the high molecular weight complex containing the α and βL chains (arrow) and also coprecipitates the α subunit as described previously (25Platanias L.C.

The signal corresponding to the α subunit is similar in most transfectants, suggesting that relatively equivalent amounts of high affinity receptors are expressed in the different transfectants. The differences in the intensity of the bands observed in immunoprecipitates performed with the anti-βL serum are likely due to the low efficiency of cross-linking of IFNα2 to this subunit (9Domanski P.

As expected, a specific rabbit serum raised against the carboxyl-terminal region of the βS chain failed to react with any of the complexes (lanes 2, 5, 8, 14, and 17). In human U-266 cells (positive control), βS cross-linked to IFNα2 was observed in long exposures of the autoradiograms after immunoprecipitation with the anti-βS sera, confirming that the βS chain is expressed at much lower levels than βL in this cell line (compare lanes 11 and12). The anti-βL serum detects all truncated forms of the βL chain, except the most proximal at amino acid 300. However, the expression of this truncated form of βL can be detected when cell lysates obtained after affinity cross-linking are directly resolved in an 8% SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 B). Binding of radioiodinated IFNα2 to all transfectant cell lines was specifically blocked by the IFNaRβ1 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain shared by both forms of the β subunit (Fig. 2 B, lane 1 and data not shown). These results indicate that these truncated forms of the βL chain are expressed correctly on the cell surface. No significant difference in the K d for high affinity receptors was observed among the various cell lines (TableI). The K d for high and low affinity receptors ranged from 22–91 pm and 0.5–5 nm, respectively. Most cell lines expressed between 2,400 and 4,600 high affinity sites/cell, except for LpRZαβL346.4, which expressed slightly lower numbers (780 sites/cell). However, it has been previously demonstrated that stable transfectants expressing low numbers of high affinity receptors display a complete antiviral effect in response to human IFNα2 and human IFNβ (9Domanski P.

Open table in a new tab We first tested the ability of human IFNα2 to induce an antiviral state in the different transfectants. As can be seen in TableII, all of the transfectants were able to mount an antiviral response to human IFNα2, except for L-929 cells expressing human βL chain truncated at amino acid 300. The antiviral effect induced by human IFNα2 in transfectants expressing βL chain truncated at residues 462, 417, 360, or 346 was comparable to that induced by mouse IFNαβ. Therefore, the lack of response to human IFNα2 was not due to a defect in the signaling pathway, because these cells did respond to murine IFNαβ. Similar results were reproduced with a second independent clone (LpZRαβL300.1) (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the first 82 amino acids (residues 265–346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the βL subunit correspond to the minimum cytoplasmic receptor required to elicit an antiviral response.Table IIAntiviral activity in L-929 cells transfected with α chain and truncated forms of the βL subunitTransfectantMouse IFNαβ2-aCytopathic effect assay was performed using a 1:25,000 dilution of encephalomyocarditis virus stock that produced 100% cytophatic effect in 24 h.

Open table in a new tab We next explored the activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of Jak1 and Tyk2 in cells expressing βLchain truncated at amino acids 417, 346, or 300, respectively. Because the βL subunit associates with Jak1 (see below), we used a GST fusion protein encoding the cytoplasmic domain of this chain to precipitate Jak1. Fig. 3 (center panel) shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 is observed in cells expressing βL subunit truncated at residue 417 or 346 but not when the βL chain was truncated at amino acid 300 (αβL300). Stripping and reblotting of the filter with an anti-Jak1 antibody demonstrated that similar amounts of Jak1 were precipitated by GSTβL in all cell lines (Fig. 3,lower panel). Similar results were obtained when precipitations were performed with anti-Jak1 antibodies (data not shown). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with slower electrophoretic mobility than Jak1 was precipitated in some experiments by GSTβL, but not by anti-Jak1 antibodies, in αβL346 cells (Fig. 3). The nature of this protein remains to be elucidated. We also studied tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in the different transfectants in response to IFNα2. Activation of Tyk2 was consistently detected in cells expressing βLchain truncated at amino acids 417 and 346, and in some experiments very low levels of Tyk2 phosphorylation were also observed in αβL300 cells (data not shown). Murine IFNαβ was able to induce Jak kinase phosphorylation in all these stable transfectants (data not shown). We also performed EMSA using probes for the IFN-stimulated response element and the m67SIE elements. These probes allowed us to study the activation of Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 factors in response to human IFNα2 in L-929 transfectants carrying deletions of the cytoplasmic domain of the βL chain. Fig.4 A (upper panel) shows that ISGF3 activation is induced by human IFNα2 (huα), human IFNβ (huβ), and murine IFNαβ (muαβ) in L-929 transfectants expressing βL subunit truncated at residues 462 and 346 (lanes 2–4 and 6–8, respectively), but not when this chain is truncated at amino acid 300 (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). However, ISGF3 is induced when αβL300 cells are treated with mouse IFNαβ (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–4), indicating that the Stat pathway is functional in these cells. The ISGF3 complex is supershifted by an anti-mouse Stat2 serum (Fig.4 C, lane 3). EMSA experiments performed with the m67SIE element present in the c-fos promoter showed that full activation of Stat1 and Stat3 also requires amino acids 265–346 of the cytoplasmic domain of the βL chain (Fig. 4, A and B,lower panels, compare the induction of the different c-sis-inducible factor complexes in αβL300and αβL346 cells). Low levels of IFNα2-induced activation of Stat1 and Stat3 were observed in αβL300.2cells that are resistant to the antiviral effect of IFNα2 (Fig.4 B, lower panel, lane 2). The c-sis-inducible factor complexes containing Stat1 and Stat3 were induced by murine IFNαβ and supershifted by anti-Stat1 and anti-Stat3 serum (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7 and9). To test for a possible interaction between the β subunit and Jak1, we produced GST fusion proteins encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain of the βL and βS chains. These GST fusion proteins were used to precipitate lysates from U-266 cells treated with IFNα2 or left untreated. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Jak1 antibodies. Fig. 5 Ashows that Jak1 is precipitated with the βL265–515fusion protein and the control anti-Jak1 antibody before and after IFNα2 treatment (lanes 7 and 12). GSTβS (lane 2), along with antibodies against Stat1, Stat2, and Tyk2, failed to detect Jak1. To define the role of the Box 1 motif in the interaction between Jak1 and the βL chain we produced two GST fusion proteins: (a) one containing only the first 34 amino acids (βL265–299) of the cytoplasmic domain, which include the Box 1 motif (AAs 287–295); and (b) a second consisting of all the cytoplasmic residues except the first 34 amino acids (AAs 300–515), thus deleting the Box 1 region. Interestingly, the βL265–299 construct precipitated Jak1 at levels that were barely above background (Fig. 5 A, lane 4), whereas the 300–515 amino-terminal deletion, lacking the entire Box 1 domain, bound Jak1 roughly at the same level (80%) as the full-length protein (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and 8). This result indicates that the binding of Jak1 to the βL chain requires a region carboxyl-terminal to the Box 1 motif rather than Box 1 itself. To further define the Jak1 binding site, we produced GST fusion proteins encoding truncated forms of the cytoplasmic domain. GST fusion proteins encoding the βL chain truncated at residues 462, 375, or 346 all bound Jak1 at comparable levels (Fig.5 A, lanes 3, 5, and 6), suggesting that the primary Jak1 binding site resides between residues 300–346. To determine whether the interaction between Jak1 and the βL chain could be detected in vivo, lysates obtained from U-266 cells treated with IFNα2 or left untreated were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the different receptor subunits and Jak1. Fig. 5 B shows that an association between the βL chain and Jak1 can be detected in lysates of control and IFN-treated U-266 cells. Interestingly, coprecipitation of Jak1 with the α subunit was only detected after binding of IFNα2 (Fig. 5 B) or IFNβ (data not shown) to the receptor, suggesting that ligand binding alters interactions among the components of the receptor complex. The βL chain was not detected in anti-Jak1 immunoprecipitates after reprobing the blot a second time with an anti-βL serum. This is most likely due to the lower sensitivity of this serum, compared with that of the Jak1 mAb, in Western blots (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether the interaction between Jak1 and the βL chain required additional proteins or phosphorylation, we performed experiments using an in vitro translation system. The Jak1 protein was produced using a wheat germ in vitro translation kit, labeled with [35S]methionine, and precipitated with the appropriate GST fusion proteins or control antibodies. Fig. 5 C shows that βL265–515, but not GSTα or GSTβS, precipitates Jak1 produced in the cell-free system. Because the wheat germ system should not contain adaptor proteins and no tyrosine phosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins or Jak1 was detected by either anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting or in vitro kinase assays with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown), these results strongly suggest a direct interaction between Jak1 and the βLsubunit of the type I IFN-R. The IFNα system is similar to many other cytokine systems in that ligand binding activates kinases of the Jak family and transcription factors of the Stat family. To determine the contribution of the β subunit of type I IFN-R in activating the Jak-Stat pathway, we expressed truncated forms of the IFNαRβL chain in mouse L-929 cells. Our results from in vivo experiments demonstrate that a minimum receptor containing only the 82 proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (AAs 265–346) can activate Tyk2 and Jak1 kinases and Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 transcription factors and elicit an antiviral response in L929 cells after stimulation with IFNα2. Because Tyk2 associates with the α subunit (3Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that Jak1 interacts with the other component of the receptor, the β subunit. The proximal region of the βL chain contains a Box 1 motif, which is essential for binding and activation of Jak2 by single-chain cytokine receptors (15Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T.

Therefore, we wished to determine whether binding of homologous Jak1 is localized to the Box 1 site (AAs 287–295) or other discrete sites in the cytoplasmic region of the βL subunit. We show that Jak1 from several different sources binds to different GSTβL chain fusion proteins and that the majority of the binding is localized to a region (AAs 300–346) carboxyl-terminal to the Box1 domain, whereas only a minimal interaction was observed for the Box1 domain. This corresponds directly with our in vivodata showing that cells expressing the βL300 construct, which contains the Box1 region (but excludes the major Jak1 binding site), do not activate Jak1 in the presence of IFNα2. Similarly, previous reports showed that mutation of residues in the Box 1 domain of the interleukin 2 receptor β chain do not significantly effect activation of Jak1 (35Goldsmith M.A. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14698-14704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the primary Jak1-binding region corresponding to residues 300–346 on the βL chain is required for activation of the Jak-Stat pathway and induction of the antiviral response; however, it is possible that the Box 1 site is also necessary for activation of Jak1. For example, the minimal binding interaction between Jak1 and the fusion protein containing only Box 1 may result from noncontiguous binding of Jak1 at both Box 1 and AAs 300–346 sites or an extended Jak1-binding site that encompasses a region extending from Box 1 to AA 346 on the β subunit. The data presented herein for Jak1 and previous studies for Jak2 suggest that the homologous Jak kinases interact differently with their specific receptor subunits. For example, Jak2 requires the Box 1 motif for binding and, in addition, a less-conserved region distal to Box 1, designated as Box 2, that seems to be necessary in most cases for full kinase activation (15Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

In contrast, we have observed that for the IFNαRβL chain, Jak1 binding and activation relies on a site carboxyl-terminal to Box 1. Similarly, an equivalent region designated in some cases as Box 2 (i.e. interleukin 2 receptor β, gp130, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor) has been reported to be necessary for Jak1 activation by other cytokines (34Murakami M.

The results show that the absence of Na+/H+ antiport as a pH regulatory mechanism can result in deficiencies in both cell growth and differentiation in embryonal carcinoma cells. The Na+/H+ exchanger is a plasma membrane protein that exchanges intracellular protons for extracellular sodium. In eukaryotes it is involved in pH regulation (1Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the control of cell volume and is stimulated by growth factors (2Grinstein S. Clarke C.A. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 619-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of the protein have been identified (NHE1 to NHE5) in mammals, and the NHE1 isoform is the most ubiquitous isoform, being present in most, if not all, mammalian cells (3Pouyssegur J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 453-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that NHE1 mRNA levels are increased due to a number of treatments including treatments that cause cellular differentiation and chronic acid loading (4Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Horie S. Moe O. Miller R.T. Alpern R.J. J. Clin.

Invest. 1991; 87: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). During differentiation of human leukemic cells (HL-60), there is an 18-fold increase in NHE1 transcription and a 7-fold increase in protein levels (4Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Ladoux A. Miglierina R. Krawice I. Cragoe E.J. Abita J.P. Frelin C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that there is a transient increase in the level of NHE1 transcription during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of P19 cells and an increase in activity of the protein (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have also shown that NHE1 mRNA levels increase when L6 cells differentiate from myoblast to myotubes and the NHE1 promoter was also activated during L6 muscle cell differentiation (9Yang W. Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This data suggests that Na+/H+ antiporter plays an important role in cellular differentiation. Increased antiporter activity during differentiation has been suggested to be important for differentiation to occur, at least in some cell types (10Alvarez J. Garcia-Sancho J. Mollinedo F. Sanchez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Hazav P. Shany S. Moran A. Levy R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 72-75PubMed Google Scholar). However, this requirement has not been shown to occur universally and the role of the Na+/H+ exchanger may vary between cell types (12Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar). Another important related aspect of pH regulation is its role in cell growth and proliferation. It has long been suggested that the Na+/H+ antiporter may play a role in the onset and/or maintenance of cell proliferation (13Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In HCO3− free media, some types of Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient cells cannot proliferate in media of low external pH (14Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition, extracellular Na+ is a limiting factor in growth factor dependent proliferation (15Burns C.P. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+exchanger inhibitor, amiloride and its analogs, block changes caused by growth factor stimulation especially in HCO3− free or low Na+medium (16L'Allemain G. Paris S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5809-5815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also clear that in some cell types the mechanism by which the Na+/H+ exchanger acts is to attain a permissive pH i 1The abbreviations used are: pH i, intracellular pH; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; EtMes, ethyl methanesulfonate; HMA, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride; α-MEM, α-minimum essential medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: pH i, intracellular pH; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; EtMes, ethyl methanesulfonate; HMA, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride; α-MEM, α-minimum essential medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. that is critical to the development of mitogenic responses elicited by growth factors (17Lagarde A.E. Pouyssegur J.M. Cancer Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 9: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Na+/H+exchange is important in pH regulation in some tumor types and is a target for inhibition in tumor selective therapy (18Yamagata Y. Tannock I.F. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Springer/R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1996: 269-294Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that Na+/H+ antiport activation is not a prerequisite for cell proliferation in all cell types (19Church J.G. Mills B. Buick R.N. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the NHE1 promoter is activated during the early stages of neuronal differentiation of P19 cells (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggested that this protein may play an important role in differentiation in this cell type. To examine this possibility we studied the role of the NHE1 protein in cell growth and differentiation of P19 cells. The results show that the Na+/H+ exchanger plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation of P19 cells, an important and widely used model of cell differentiation. These findings are the first direct demonstration that deletion of the Na+/H+ exchanger can directly affect differentiation of mammalian cells. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EtMes), alltrans-retinoic acid and G418 were obtained from Sigma. 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of analytical or molecular biology grade and were purchased from Fisher Scientific, Sigma, BDH (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), or Life Technologies, Inc. The neuron specific class III β-tubulin monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. A. Frankfurter of the University of Virginia. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Bio/Can Scientific, Inc. (Mississaugua, Ontario, Canada). 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Hoe 694 was a gift from Drs. H. J. Lang and W. Scholz (Hoechst, Frankfurt). P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Wild-type and mutant P19 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 7.5% newborn calf serum as reported earlier (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). G20 cells were derived from mutated P19 cells (described below) and lacked Na+/H+ exchanger activity. Mutant G20 cells were grown in the above medium, which contained 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4 to ensure that the medium pH did not acidify with cell growth. Cell numbers were measured using a hemocytometer. To induce cell differentiation, wild-type and mutant P19 cells were grown in medium with 1 μm retinoic acid in nonadhesive plates for 48 h, and after aggregation they were plated on adhesive substrates without retinoic acid for another 48 h. In some experiments we examined the effect of Hoe 694 on differentiation of P19 cells. In these experiments, experimental cells had the same protocol except in the presence of 10 μm Hoe 694. P19 cells were mutagenized with EtMes essentially as described elsewhere (20Pouyssegur J. Franchi A. Salomon J.-C. Silvestre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2698-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). P19 cells grown to 70% confluency were treated with 0.25 μl/ml EtMes in α-MEM overnight. With this treatment, 80–90% of the cells did not survive. Surviving cells were grown to confluency and then selected for lack of Na+/H+ antiport by the “proton suicide” technique. The technique is based on the reversibility of Na+/H+ antiport and the fact that Li+ is transported by the exchanger. It results in reversal of activity and H+ killing of cells with an active transporter (14Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Trypsinized cells were incubated in LiCl buffer (130 mm LiCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmglucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed once with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with choline Cl buffer (130 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO3, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.5) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted again and resuspended and grown in α-MEM supplemented with 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. After 7–10 days, resistant colonies were formed and grown individually. The individual clones were selected two additional times using the proton suicide technique. The rate of recovery from an ammonium chloride-induced acid load was used to confirm that clones were devoid of Na+/H+ antiporter activity (21Dyck J.R.B. Maddaford T. Pierce G.N. Fliegel L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To reintroduce the Na+/H+ exchanger back into G20 cells, the expression system used was the pOPRSVicat mammalian expression system (Stratagene). The vector was digested withNotI and filled in with the enzyme Klenow, and a full-length insert coding for the human NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger (22Fliegel L. Dyck J.R.B. Wang H. Fong C. Haworth R.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was blunt end ligated and screened for orientation. The resulting plasmid, pYN4+, was used to transform G20 cells, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described earlier (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Yang W. Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). G20 cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418. Resistant colonies (G20;pYN4) were identified, and individual colonies were repropagated until reaching a higher density. Measurement of pH i in P19 cells was essentially as described earlier (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). P19 and G20 cells were grown to 80% confluency on coverslips. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer. Coverslips were incubated in a cuvette with constant stirring. The acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF-AM (0.1 μg/ml) was incubated with cells for 30–60 s in a solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Intracellular pH was measured using the dual excitation single emission ratio technique. Excitation wavelengths were at 452 and 500 nm with emission at 520 nm. This allows measurement of intracellular pH that is independent of cell concentration and dye loading (23Chaillte J.R. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A calibration curve for intracellular dye was generated by the nigericin method (23Chaillte J.R. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To measure initial rates of proton extrusion after an acid challenge the NH4Cl prepulse method was used. The coverslip was transferred to a buffer containing 15 mm NH4Cl for 5 min and then to a Na+ free medium that contained 135 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine instead of NaCl. The buffer was then changed to one containing 135 mmNaCl, and the initial rate of rise of internal pH was measured during the first 40 s of recovery. P19 and G20 cells were grown in α-MEM supplemented with or without 25 mmNaHCO3 for 2 days and collected in Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a rubber policeman. To characterize the extent of differentiation, P19 cells were treated with retinoic acid as described above and harvested 2 days after retinoic acid treatment. Cells were lysed by sonication for 45 s, and the protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. 25 μg of each cell lysate was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunostaining of nitrocellulose was carried out in the presence of 1% skim milk powder using the neuronal specific class III β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The antibody was detected using the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting and detection system as described by the manufacturer. In some experiments we examined the level of the Na+/H+ exchanger in membrane preparations from P19 and G20 cells. P19 and G20 cells were swollen in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. They were lysed by using 50 strokes with a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer on ice. The lysate was diluted to 20 volumes with lysis buffer containing sucrose added to make a final concentration of 250 mm. Unlysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h to obtain a crude microsome fraction. The crude membrane fraction was solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and used for SDS-PAGE (9%) followed by Western transfer and immunoblotting. The antibody for immunoblotting was affinity purified anti-NHE1 antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger (24Fliegel L. Haworth R.S. Dyck J.R.B. Biochem J. 1993; 289: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We initially examined whether the Na+/H+exchanger could play a role in the differentiation of P19 cells. Cells were treated with retinoic acid in the presence of Hoe 694, a potent inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Cell extracts were then examined for the presence of β-tubulin, a marker of neuronal differentiation (25Alexander J.E. Hunt D.F. Lee M.K. Shabanowitz J. Michel H. Berlin S.C. Macdonald T.L. Sundberg R.J. Rebhun L.I. Frankfurter A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4685-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Typical results are shown in Fig.1. Control cells contained residual amounts of β-tubulin, likely due to a small amount of spontaneous differentiation that usually occurs in these cells. P19 cells treated with retinoic acid and Hoe 694 showed only the same small amount of β-tubulin. In contrast P19 cells treated with retinoic acid in the absence of Hoe 694 showed a much larger amount of β-tubulin, which is typical of cells undergoing differentiation. To establish a Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient cell line, P19 cells were treated with 0.25 μg/ml EtMes for 12 h. This treatment resulted in the death of approximately 90% of the cells. Following this treatment, cells were then subjected to the proton suicide selection technique for 3 h (20Pouyssegur J. Franchi A. Salomon J.-C. Silvestre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2698-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The surviving cells formed colonies after 7–10 days of growth. We examined 22 colonies for Na+/H+ exchanger activity. Four out of 22 clones showed no, or greatly diminished, pH i recovery when subjected to ammonium chloride-induced acid load. One of the mutant clones, G20, was reselected two more times by the proton suicide technique. This clone had the same morphology as the wild-type P19 cells. Since it was sensitive to external pH variation, the cells were maintained in medium containing HEPES, pH 7.4. We examined the G20 clone for Na+/H+ exchange activity using the NH4Cl prepulse technique (Fig.2 A). The results showed that the rate of recovery from an acid load was greatly diminished in this cell line. There was no apparent difference in the degree of acidification induced by NH4Cl suggesting that the buffering capacity of G20 was unchanged in comparison with P19 cells. We noticed that there was still a very small and gradual recovery of pH i in the G20 cells. To examine if this was due to Na+/H+ exchanger activity, we added 10 μm HMA to the recovery phase of both G20 and P19 cells. In the presence of HMA, the pH i recovery was the same in both wild-type P19 and mutant G20 cells (Fig. 2 B). This result indicates that NHE1 activity was excluded or very nearly absent in the slow pH i recovery in mutant G20 cells. Some other exchanger-deficient clones had a tendency to “revert” to a cell line with an active Na+/H+ antiporter. We found that to prevent the reverting of the mutant clones, it was necessary to repeat the proton suicide technique routinely, especially after storing cells as a frozen stock (not shown). The steady state resting intracellular pH of P19 and G20 cells was determined in bicarbonate free medium. For P19 cells the resting pH i was 7.2 ± 0.06, whereas for G20 cells it was 6.9 ± 0.07. There was no appreciable change in the resting pH i in either case with the addition of 23 mmHCO3−. To confirm that the effects on intracellular pH regulation were specifically due to deletion of the Na+/H+antiporter, we reintroduced the exchanger back into G20 cells. G20 cells were stably transfected with cDNA coding for the complete coding region of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+exchanger using the calcium phosphate technique (22Fliegel L. Dyck J.R.B. Wang H. Fong C. Haworth R.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C.L. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A stable cell line was selected using G418 resistance and then tested for antiporter activity. G20 cells stably expressing the transfected antiporter (G20;pYN4) recovered from an acid load in the same manner as control P19 cells (Fig. 2 C). In addition, the recovery was inhibited by HMA, the inhibitor of the Na+/H+antiporter. To examine if the G20 cell line contained the Na+/H+ exchanger protein we used Western blotting with an antibody against the protein. The results (Fig.3) showed that G20 cells had only a small amount of detectable immunoreactive protein of 100–105 kDa in size, whereas control cells contained much more immunoreactive protein. Both cells types contained an 80–90-kDa immunoreactive band, and G20 cells had a noticeable amount of smaller immunoreactive bands. We also examined the growth rate of P19 and G20 cells in the presence of HCO3−. In this experiment cells were allowed to proliferate continuously in culture for 3 days. Under these conditions we found that P19 cells grew much better than G20 cells. When the Na+/H+ exchanger was introduced back into G20 cells, this effect was eliminated (Fig.4). When the same experiment was repeated in the absence of HCO3−, growth was even more reduced in G20 cells in comparison with controls. For wild-type P19 cells the change to HCO3−free medium represented approximately a 34% drop in growth, whereas for G20 cells the same treatment caused approximately an 80% drop in the growth of these cells (not shown). To examine if the absence of Na+/H+ exchange activity had an effect on differentiation in P19 cells we tested the ability of the cells to differentiate using neuronal specific class III β-tubulin as a marker. Under normal conditions, both wild-type P19 cells and mutant G20 cells contained low levels of β-tubulin (Fig.5 A) due to a small amount of cells that normally spontaneously differentiate. Control P19 cells were able to differentiate when treated with retinoic acid. G20 cells showed no apparent increase in the level of class III β-tubulin when treated with retinoic acid. In addition we could only detect a very low level of β-tubulin in G20 cells grown in medium without added HCO3−, suggesting that less spontaneous differentiation occurred (Fig. 5 B). When cells were treated with retinoic acid in the absence of HCO3−, control cells maintained the ability to differentiate, whereas the levels of class III β-tubulin in G20 cells again did not increase with retinoic acid treatment. There also appeared to be a decrease in the amount of β-tubulin that is normally present in G20 cells that are not stimulated with retinoic acid. We also examined the ability of G20 cells to differentiate when they had the Na+/H+ exchanger reintroduced (Fig.5 C). Control cells treated with retinoic acid once again showed much higher levels of class III β-tubulin than G20 cells. However G20 cells transformed with the Na+/H+antiporter were equivalent to wild-type P19 cells. G20 cells transfected with the antiporter also showed the characteristic structural features of neuronal-like cells, similar to wild-type P19 cells but unlike G20 cells not containing the antiporter (not shown). These results show that reintroduction of the Na+/H+ antiporter into P19 exchanger-deficient cells facilitates the process of differentiation. P19 cells are a well known model for early embryonic determination and differentiation. Treatment of these cells with retinoic acid induces the development of neurons, astroglia and microglia cells normally derived from the neuroectoderm. Long term treatment of these cells with retinoic acid results in a high percentage of the cells expressing neuronal markers such as class III β-tubulin (27McBurney M.W. Int J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier, we showed that transcription and activity of the NHE1 protein are activated during neuronal differentiation of this cell type (8Dyck J.R.B. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10420-10427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, in some other cell types such as HL60 cells, both the protein and mRNA for the NHE1 isoform of the protein are elevated dramatically when differentiation is induced (4Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Rao G.N. de Roux N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13485-13488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to suspect that the protein plays an important role in the differentiation process. In addition, a number of studies have suggested that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter either facilitates or is permissive in cell growth (13Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Studies have also suggested that in some cell types the expression of the Na+/H+ antiporter is dramatically increased during stimulation of cell proliferation (29Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19393-19396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons we examined the role of this protein in both cell proliferation and differentiation in P19 cells. Initial experiments examined the effect of Hoe 694 on the differentiation of P19 cells. The results showed that this Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor dramatically reduced the rate of differentiation in this cell type in comparison with controls (Fig. 1). Hoe 694 is a newly developed inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger with a relatively high specificity for the NHE1 isoform (30Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.L. Pouysségur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this result using a second independent technique, we chose to delete the Na+/H+ exchanger from P19 cells. Mutagenesis and the subsequent proton suicide technique (14Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) were used to select exchanger-deficient cells. We obtained several cell lines with similar characteristics that showed no significant Na+/H+ exchanger activity when measuring the recovery from an acutely induced acid load. One of these (G20 cells) was more stable for the mutation than the others and was examined for the presence and activity of the protein. It displayed no Na+/H+ exchange activity (Fig. 2), and resting pH i declined in G20 cells. Western blotting suggested that the 100–105-kDa protein was either absent or greatly reduced in quantity (Fig. 3). In addition we noted the presence of a number of smaller immunoreactive proteins in G20 cells, which suggests that the defect may be related to targeting or degradation of the protein. Therefore we examined the effects of deletion of the protein on the growth of G20 cells. When we grew cells continuously in culture for a period of 3 days, the effects on growth were pronounced (Fig. 4). We also found that an acidic external pH reduced cell growth in G20 cells much more than in controls (not shown). This was similar to a recent report that suggested that NHE1 expression is critical for inner medullary collecting duct cells to survive some types of acid stress (31Singh G. McAteer J.A. Soleimani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 74-80Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that Na+ is limiting in growth factor-dependent cell proliferation, and amiloride and amiloride analogs can block growth factor-induced stimulation of cell proliferation, especially in HCO3−free or low Na+ medium (15Burns C.P. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16L'Allemain G. Paris S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5809-5815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the Na+/H+ antiporter stimulates cell proliferation is not yet clear but may involve raising pH i and facilitating entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (32Vairo G. Cocks B.G. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19043-19046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hensley C.B. Bradley M.E. Mircheff A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C637-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The more acidic resting pH i of G20 and the absence of the Na+/H+ antiporter to modulate pH i might cause an inhibition of this normal progression. We noted that when HCO3− was removed from the medium of exchanger-deficient P19 cells, there was a dramatic enhancement of the effects on cell proliferation. The likely explanation is that without added HCO3− some bicarbonate-based pH regulatory proteins are not as effective in assisting with pH regulation in these cells. A candidate for this activity is the recently described Na+-dependent HCO3−/Cl− exchanger (34Gleeson D. Smith N.D. Boyer J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Neylon C.B. Little P.J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Bobik A. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Cassel D. Scharf O. Rotman M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Katz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6122-6127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This, or some other bicarbonate-based transporter, may contribute at least partially to pH i regulation in P19 cells. We examined the ability of G20 cells to differentiate and found that it was greatly impaired in comparison to wild-type P19 cells (Fig. 5). To our knowledge this is the first direct demonstration that the absence of a Na+/H+ antiporter affects the ability of cells to differentiate. This result confirms by an independent method the results we observed by the addition of Hoe 694. In addition, reintroduction of the Na+/H+ exchanger back into G20 cells rescued the ability of these cells to differentiate. These results suggest that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter also facilitates differentiation in P19 cells. The results contrast with that observed in HL60 leukemic cells. Na+/H+ antiport was not required for HL60 differentiation (12Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was surprising because both protein and mRNA have been shown to be elevated during differentiation of this cell line (4Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Rao G.N. de Roux N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13485-13488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that apart from the differences in cell origin, this conclusion was based on studies using dimethylamiloride (an amiloride analog) to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange. Under similar conditions using the same concentration of the more potent analog HMA we found only slightly reduced inhibition of differentiation in P19 cells (not shown). It may be that some residual Na+/H+ antiport remains in the presence of amiloride analogs that can contribute to cellular differentiation. Long term treatments of cells in culture with these analogs could also be affected by degradation or binding to components of serum. Alternatively, the differences observed between our study on P19 cells and HL60 cells may only be related to differences in cell types. Future studies may address this question. We thank Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W2087714531,"Serglycin is a family of small proteoglycans with Ser-Gly dipeptide repeats and is modified with various types of glycosaminoglycan side chains. We previously demonstrated that chondroitin sulfate-modified serglycin is a novel ligand for CD44 involved in the adherence and activation of lymphoid cells. In this study, we investigated the production and distribution of CD44 binding serglycins in various hematopoietic cells and characterized their carbohydrate side chains. Immunoprecipitation analysis using CD44-IgG and polyclonal antibody against the serglycin core peptide demonstrated that various serglycin species capable of binding CD44 are produced by a variety of hematopoietic cells including lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, and a few tumor cell lines. Glycosaminoglycans on these serglycins, which are essential for CD44 binding, are composed of chondroitin 4-sulfate or a mixture of chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate, but no heparin or heparan sulfate side chain was detected. The serglycins are also secreted by normal splenocytes, lymph node lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells, whereas they are secreted in very small amounts by normal thymocytes. Secretion of serglycins is greatly enhanced by mitogenic stimulation with concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide. Our results showed that serglycin, unlike hyaluronate, is produced and secreted in a functional (CD44 binding) form by many members of the hematopoietic system including various lymphocyte subsets. Our data suggest that serglycin may serve as a major ligand for CD44 in various events in the lymphohematopoietic system. Serglycin is a family of small proteoglycans with Ser-Gly dipeptide repeats and is modified with various types of glycosaminoglycan side chains. We previously demonstrated that chondroitin sulfate-modified serglycin is a novel ligand for CD44 involved in the adherence and activation of lymphoid cells. In this study, we investigated the production and distribution of CD44 binding serglycins in various hematopoietic cells and characterized their carbohydrate side chains. Immunoprecipitation analysis using CD44-IgG and polyclonal antibody against the serglycin core peptide demonstrated that various serglycin species capable of binding CD44 are produced by a variety of hematopoietic cells including lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, and a few tumor cell lines. Glycosaminoglycans on these serglycins, which are essential for CD44 binding, are composed of chondroitin 4-sulfate or a mixture of chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate, but no heparin or heparan sulfate side chain was detected. The serglycins are also secreted by normal splenocytes, lymph node lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells, whereas they are secreted in very small amounts by normal thymocytes. Secretion of serglycins is greatly enhanced by mitogenic stimulation with concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide. Our results showed that serglycin, unlike hyaluronate, is produced and secreted in a functional (CD44 binding) form by many members of the hematopoietic system including various lymphocyte subsets. Our data suggest that serglycin may serve as a major ligand for CD44 in various events in the lymphohematopoietic system. CD44, a cytoskeleton-associated cell-surface glycoprotein, acts as an adhesion molecule and signal transducer in the immune system (1Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv.

Cell. 1993; 74: 257-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin is a novel ligand for CD44 (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Serglycin is a secretory granule proteoglycan, and its mRNA is transcribed in hematopoietic lineage cells, yolk sac, and certain tumor cells (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar). The transcription of the serglycin gene is regulated during tissue development and modulated by activation stimuli such as virus infection (15Stellrecht C.M. Mars W.M. Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F. Differentiation. 1991; 48: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of serglycin remains to be fully determined, it has been suggested that it is involved in myeloid cell differentiation, as well as in cell-mediated cytotoxicity such that it helps packaging and stabilizing cytokines and proteases in secretory granules and transporting them to target sites when secreted extracellularly (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar,17Masson D. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Borst J. Tschopp J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that when the chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin, stored in secretory granules of a mouse T cell line, CTLL2, is secreted, it binds specifically to CD44 (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We also showed that the addition of purified serglycin to CTL clones significantly enhances CD3-dependent granzyme release by these clones (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hyaluronate had no effect on the granzyme release, suggesting that the chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin has a unique function in CTL responses (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). There are certain differences in post-translational carbohydrate modification and degradation of serglycin peptide core in different cell types (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar). Serglycin carries mainly two types of carbohydrate chains, heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate. In human NK cells, the peptide core is thought to be cleaved in the secretory granule at its N and C termini, leaving a glycosaminoglycan attachment region consisting primarily of alternating serine and glycine residues (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar). In rat LGL tumor cells, serglycin is metabolized by an endoglycosidase to individual chondroitin sulfate A in the secretory granule (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of note that neither the serglycin core peptide (as shown in this study) nor the modifying chondroitin sulfate alone can bind CD44 (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether all the serglycins synthesized by hematopoietic cells actually are able to bind CD44. The aim of the present study was to examine the extent of the expression of CD44-binding serglycins in hematopoietic cells and to characterize their chondroitin sulfate side chains. Our results showed that the chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin capable of binding CD44 is secreted by a wide range of hematopoietic cells, including malignant cell lines and normal cells, and that mitogenic stimulation greatly enhances its secretion. We found also that the glycosaminoglycan side chains of the CD44 binding serglycins consist of mainly conventional chondroitin sulfate such as chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, or a mixture of both. The results that a variety of blood cells produce the CD44 binding serglycin implies that serglycin may serve as a major ligand for CD44 in the hematopoietic system. Female C57BL/6 (6–8 weeks of age) were purchased from Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Hamamatsu, Japan). Female Japanese White rabbits (1.5–2.0 kg body weight) were purchased from the Shiraishi Laboratory Farm (Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were performed according to the Guidelines for Animal Use and Experimentation as set by our institutions. Mouse cytotoxic T cell clones were kindly provided by Dr. S. Aizawa (Department of Physiology and Pathology, The National Institute of Radiological Science). The culture medium was RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (lot FKB09, Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Tokyo, Japan), 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10−4m 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) 100 × non-essential amino acids (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Preparation of CD44-IgG was performed as described previously (10Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Control human IgG was purchased from Sigma. Chondroitinase ABC (from Proteus vulgaris, protease-free) and hyaluronidase (fromStreptomyces hyalurolyticus) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo). Female Japanese White rabbits were immunized with 125 μg of the synthetic peptide (see Fig. 2 A) suspended in Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted at intervals of 2 weeks with the same amount of the peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The peptide was derived from a region that lies adjacent to the Ser-Gly repeats and has no homology to any known molecules according to the homology search using EMBLE protein data base, release 27.0. The peptide was synthesized using Peptide Synthesizer model 433A and Fmoc 9N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl) mitogen-activated protein resin (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer). All injections were performed subcutaneously. The rabbits were bled 2 or 3 days after immunization. To obtain antibodies, pSG, specific for the serglycin peptide core, the antiserum was purified on Affi-Gel 10 affinity column where the synthetic peptide was coupled. Purified serglycin was obtained as described previously (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and coated on 96-well microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C. Immobilized serglycin was digested with chondroitinase ABC (0.2 units/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C, and then nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. for 2 h at room temperature. Binding of CD44-IgG (10 μg/ml) or polyclonal anti-serglycin core protein antibody, pSG (10 μg/ml), to each well was examined as described previously (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and [35S]sodium sulfate was performed as described previously (20Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using protein G-Sepharose (10-μl beads) conjugated with 10 μg of either CD44-IgG, human IgG, pSG, or 50 μl of preimmune serum. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% gradient gel). Autoradiography was analyzed using a FUJIX BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Kanagawa, Japan). The total cellular RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka). First strand synthesis was carried out using SuperScriptTM RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Tokyo) with oligo(dT) primer. The cDNA products were then used as template for PCR in which the following primers, 5′CTCAAAAGATTTCATCTCCAA3′ and 5′GTTGAAATAGACAATATTGCT3′, were used. The 3′ primer was located 152 base pairs downstream of the 5′ primer. After amplification, the PCR products were run on agarose gel. Cells were incubated overnight in the presence of [35S]sodium sulfate, and 35S-labeled serglycin in culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated with CD44-IgG. After treatment with chondroitinase ABC, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to disaccharide analysis by high performance liquid chromatography using Partisil-10 SAX (Whatman), as reported previously (21Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mouse thymoma cell line BW5147 cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and adjusted to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. In the next step, 500 μl of the nonaggregated single cell suspension was placed into each well of a 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nunc Inc.) into which purified serglycin (100 μg/ml) was added. Then the cell suspension was rotated on a shaker at 80 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. Aggregation was assessed by phase contrast microscopy. In the antibody blocking experiments, 50 μg/ml of a function-blocking anti-CD44 antibody KM201 (7Miyake K. Medina K.L. Hayashi S.-I. Ono S. Hamaoka T. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) was added to the cell suspension prior to the aggregation assay. Flat-bottom wells of 96-well microtiter plate were coated with anti-human IgG (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, purified CD44-IgG or control human IgG was added to the wells, incubated for 60 min, washed, followed by the addition of various concentrations of purified serglycin. After washing, we examined cell adhesion to these wells using cells labeled with a fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein triacetoxymethyl ester, as described previously (22Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyake K. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The secretion of serglycin was examined by immunoprecipitation analysis using recombinant soluble CD44 (CD44-Ig) on culture supernatants from various hematopoietic cell lines. The cell lines included BW5147 (thymoma), MLV-induced YAC-1 (T lymphoma), EL-4 (T lymphoma), X63 (myeloma), BAF/BO3 (pro-B), WEHI3 (myelomonocyte), P815 (mastocytoma), J774 (macrophage), and a number of CTL clones. This technique has enabled us in the past to identify chondroitin sulfate-modified serglycin as a novel ligand for CD44 in a mouse T cell line CTLL-2 (20Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, sulfated macromolecules similar to those detected in CTLL-2 were precipitated with CD44-IgG from culture supernatants of EL-4, X63, BAF/BO3, WEHI3, J774, P815, and some CTL clones but not from YAC-1 or BW5147. These radiolabeled molecules were not precipitated with control human IgG or other Ig fusion proteins such as LEC-IgG (Fig. 1, Ref.20Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The sulfated molecules migrated as a broad band that disappeared by chondroitinase ABC digestion (data not shown), suggesting that the sulfated macromolecules are modified with chondroitin sulfate that can bind CD44. Chondroitinase-resistant sulfated molecules were not detected, suggesting that chondroitin sulfate-type proteoglycans represent the major CD44 binding material in these cell lines. To determine whether these CD44 binding molecules are identical to chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin, we prepared a polyclonal antibody against a stretch of the peptide representing part of the mouse serglycin peptide core (Fig.2 A). The specificity of the polyclonal anti-serglycin antibody (pSG) was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Interestingly, affinity purified pSG did not recognize intact mouse serglycin purified from mouse T cell line CTLL2 (Fig. 2 B, left panel) to which binding of CD44-Ig was readily recognized (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Treatment with chondroitinase ABC, however, resulted in a dose-dependent binding of pSG to serglycin (Fig. 2 B, left panel) but abolished CD44-Ig binding (Fig. 2 B, right panel). These findings suggest that pSG recognizes a protein epitope hidden by glycosaminoglycan chains, whereas CD44-Ig recognizes a glycosaminoglycan epitope on serglycin. In support of this conclusion, pSG immunoprecipitated successfully the glycosaminoglycan-deprived serglycin core protein derived from CTLL-2, whereas preimmune serum did not (Fig. 2 C). Using pSG, we then investigated whether the core protein obtained from various hematopoietic cell lines represented that of serglycin. To this end, 35S-labeled proteoglycans precipitated with CD44-IgG were treated with chondroitinase ABC, and their reactivity with pSG was subsequently examined. Apart from J774, peptide core preparations from all the examined cell lines reacted with pSG and showed molecular sizes varying from 25 to 32 kDa (Fig. 3), corresponding to the size of the serglycin core protein. The differences in apparent molecular weight might be partly due to differences in post-translational modification with chondroitinase-resistant glycosaminoglycan chains and partly due to differences in glycosaminoglycan linkage region attached to the core protein which is spared from chondroitinase digestion. To characterize glycosaminoglycans on serglycin involved in CD44 recognition, disaccharides were obtained from the serglycin preparations by chondroitinase ABC digestion and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography on a Partisil-10 SAX column with stepwise elution using increasing concentrations of KH2PO4 (Fig. 4). The composition of the disaccharide obviously differed from one cell to another, but the majority of disaccharides on serglycin were of chondroitin 4-sulfate-type and/or chondroitin 6-sulfate-type. Serglycin synthesized by BAF/BO3 and P815 was modified exclusively with chondroitin 4-sulfate, whereas serglycin from X63 was modified mainly by chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate. Serglycin from EL-4 was modified with several types of chondroitin sulfates with chondroitin 6-sulfate being the dominant type. Products corresponding to heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronate, or any unique disaccharides were not observed. These results strongly suggest that the CD44-binding serglycins are predominantly modified by conventional chondroitin sulfates and that the binding of CD44 to serglycin is apparently independent of the composition of the modifying chondroitin sulfate disaccharides. In the next step, we examined whether normal hematopoietic cells produce serglycins capable of binding CD44. For this purpose, suspensions of lymph node cells, splenocytes, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells were incubated in the presence of sodium [35S]sulfate, and immunoprecipitation analysis was performed on their culture supernatants using CD44-IgG. As shown in Fig.5 A, low levels of sulfated macromolecules were detected in the culture supernatants of splenocytes and lymph node cells, whereas a higher level was detected in bone marrow cells. Stimulation of lymphoid cells with concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide markedly increased the secretion of sulfated macromolecules (Fig. 5 B). CD44-IgG-immunoprecipitable serglycin showed approximately 2–10-fold increase in 35S incorporation. pSG reacted with core protein preparations, obtained by treating these molecules with chondroitinase ABC (data not shown), indicating that these molecules represent chondroitin sulfate-modified serglycins. No detectable level of serglycin secretion was observed in thymocytes irrespective of the presence or absence of mitogens, although transcription of the serglycin gene was readily detected by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 5 C). To determine the functional role of the exocytosed serglycin, we examined the effect of purified serglycin added to various hematopoietic cell lines. Purity of serglycin used in this series of experiments was shown in the previous report (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Tumor cell lines such as BW5147 thymoma, X63 myeloma, and P815 mastocytoma, all expressing CD44, exhibited a high degree of aggregation within a few minutes upon exposure to serglycin. Fig.6 B shows serglycin-induced clustering of BW5147 cells which otherwise do not aggregate under normal circumstances (Fig. 6 A). The aggregation was completely inhibited by anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody, KM201 (Fig.6 C), suggesting that serglycin-CD44 interaction is directly responsible for the aggregation and that serglycin acts as a bridge between CD44 on the surface of different cells. The homophilic cell clustering was observed even in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations, indicating that neither integrins nor selectins are involved in this process. To explore further the mechanism of serglycin-induced cell aggregation, we performed the following cell adhesion assay using recombinant CD44 and purified serglycin. When serglycin was added to wells where CD44-Ig had been immobilized, BW5147 cells bound avidly (Fig. 6 D). The process was specifically inhibited by anti-CD44 (not shown). In contrast, BW5147 cells failed to bind when CD44-Ig or human IgG alone was added to wells in the absence of anti-human IgG. This indicates that serglycin acted as a linker between cell-surface CD44 and CD44-Ig immobilized to wells, confirming the above speculation that serglycin is involved in cell-cell interaction by bridging CD44 molecules. We reported previously that chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin is a novel ligand for CD44 and that the chondroitin sulfate side chain plays an important role in recognition by CD44 (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The serglycin gene is transcribed in most leukocytes including neutrophils, monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes (15Stellrecht C.M. Mars W.M. Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F. Differentiation. 1991; 48: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, glycosaminoglycans modifying the serglycin peptide core are heterogeneous in their disaccharide composition, length, extent of sulfation, or position of sulfation (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar, 23Stevens R.L. Fox C.C. Lichtenstein L.M. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2284-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, it is not clear whether these cells actually produce serglycins that can bind CD44. In the present study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that a variety of hematopoietic cells produce chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin capable of binding CD44. Disaccharide analysis showed that the glycosaminoglycans modifying the CD44 binding serglycin differ from one cell type to another and consist of mainly conventional chondroitin sulfates, such as chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, or a mixture of both. This indicates that the binding ability of serglycin to CD44 is independent of its chondroitin sulfate composition. Although neither heparin nor heparan sulfate nor any unique disaccharide was detected from the CD44 binding serglycins, it remains to be formally tested if heparin-type serglycins, such as those produced by connective tissue mast cells (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar), can actually bind CD44. A high level of production of CD44 binding serglycin was observed in bone marrow cells. In this context, it is noteworthy that the expression of the serglycin gene occurs very early in hematopoiesis (15Stellrecht C.M. Mars W.M. Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F. Differentiation. 1991; 48: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that CD44 is involved in bone marrow hematopoiesis (7Miyake K. Medina K.L. Hayashi S.-I. Ono S. Hamaoka T. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 8Delfino D.V. Patrene K.D. Deleo A.B. Deleo R. Herberman R.B. Boggs S.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5171-5179PubMed Google Scholar). Because the abrogation of CD44-hyaluronate interaction leads to disruption of early lymphohematopoiesis in vitro (7Miyake K. Medina K.L. Hayashi S.-I. Ono S. Hamaoka T. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), it is thought that the interaction with hyaluronate is important for CD44 in the regulation of hematopoiesis. However, given that serglycin is ubiquitously expressed by hematopoietic cells and that it binds to the hyaluronate binding site or its close vicinity on the CD44 core protein (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to determine in future studies of the CD44-serglycin interaction contributes at all to the generation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. In addition, other than the possible interaction with CD44, exocytosed serglycin may also be important for the binding of hematopoietic growth factors possibly by increasing their local concentrations and make them accessible to immature hematopoietic cells. Several studies have already indicated the importance of adequate concentrations of diffusible cytokines/growth factors by immobilized proteoglycans in the regulation of cell proliferation and adhesion (19Kolset S.O.

Our results also showed that normal lymph node cells and splenocytes also produce the CD44 binding serglycin, which is markedly enhanced by stimulation with concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide. This confirms and further extends previous observations that mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes produce chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that are secreted rapidly into the extracellular space (27Steward W.P. Christmas S.E. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Kolset S.O. Gallagher J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 191-211PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that thymocytes do not produce the CD44 binding serglycin but transcribe the serglycin gene whereas spleen and lymph node cells actually produce the CD44 binding serglycin indicates that the production of serglycin with a CD44 binding ability may correlate with T cell differentiation. Although the exact function of serglycin in the T cell lineage remains to be fully explored, the results of our previous study indicate that serglycin acts on killer T cells and augments the release of their granzyme (13Toyama-Sorimachi N.

With regard to the receptor expression, most T lymphocytes express CD44 but do not bind hyaluronate unless they are activated (29Hyman R. Lesley J. Schulte R. Immunogenetics. 1991; 33: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This is also the case with binding to serglycin (13Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamaura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This indicates that, although hyaluronate or serglycin may be found frequently in the hematopoietic milieu, ligation with CD44 occurs only when appropriate activation stimulus is present, which may provide specificity for what would otherwise be an uncontrolled interaction between a ubiquitously expressed cell-surface receptor and common components of the lymphohematopoietic system. Furthermore, the restricted expression of serglycin in the hematopoietic cell lineage, which is quite different from the ubiquitous expression of hitherto described ligands for CD44 such as hyaluronate, fibronectin, and collagen, may also help ensure the specificity of CD44 function. Cell aggregation and binding experiments indicated that serglycin can mediate strong homophilic as well as heterophilic cell aggregation by linking CD44 molecules on opposing cells. Although it has been shown previously that stimulation of CD44 induces cell adhesion mediated by non-CD44 molecules under certain experimental conditions (22Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyake K. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Koopman G. van Kooyk Y. de Graff M. Meyer C.J. Figdor C.G. Pals S.T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3589-3593PubMed Google Scholar), homophilic cell aggregation induced by the addition of serglycin is apparently not mediated by other adhesion molecules such as integrins or selectins, since aggregation was not affected by chelators of divalent cations such as EDTA. Our recent findings that the binding is seen even in the presence of function-blocking antibodies against β1 or β2 integrin also excludes the involvement of integrins. 2N. Toyama-Sorimachi and M. Miyasaka, unpublished observations. Finally, it is of interest whether high endothelial cells in mucosal lymph nodes produce serglycin, since CD44 was initially identified as lymphocyte homing receptor of mucosal lymphoid tissues (9Jalkanen S.T. Bargatze R.F. de los Toyos J. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Suggestion has also been made that a counter-receptor for CD44 on high endothelial cells is not hyaluronate but an as yet unidentified type (32Culty M. Miyake K. Kincade P.W. Silorski E. Butcher E.C. Underhill C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, preliminary experiments in our laboratory using polyclonal anti-serglycin core peptide antibody indicate that serglycin is not present in high endothelial venules in mouse mesenteric lymph nodes at least at readily detectable levels.2 Therefore, it is still not clear at present that serglycin plays any role in lymphocyte homing. The in vivo significance and function of the serglycin-CD44 interaction in various cell types remains to be determined. However, our results describing the production of serglycin serve as an important basis for future elucidation of the biological function of serglycin and CD44. Collectively, given that the CD44-binding serglycin is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells and that its expression is restricted to the hematopoietic tissue under normal circumstances (14Stevens R.L. Kamada M.M. Serafin W.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 140: 93-108Google Scholar), it is tempting to suggest that serglycin may serve as a major ligand for CD44 in the hematopoietic system.

Sequence analysis indicates that the NSF subunit contains two nucleotide-binding sites, both with the classical Walker A and B motifs. In this report, we examine the nucleotide binding properties of NSF. The homotrimer contains three high affinity ATP-binding sites withK d = 30–40 nm for ATP andK d = 2 μm for ADP. This class of binding sites did not bind AMP, adenine, or GTP. A second class of lower affinity nucleotide binding sites with a K d = 15–20 μm was also detected. Using various mutant forms of NSF, the high affinity nucleotide-binding sites were localized to the D2 domains and the low affinity sites were localized to the D1 domains. Functionally it is these lower affinity sites in D1 that are crucial for NSF activity. Nucleotide concentration greatly affected the ability of NSF to interact with α-SNAP·SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein-SNAP receptor) complex, suggesting that only when the D1 domain ATP-binding sites are occupied does NSF bind to the α-SNAP·SNARE complex.

Cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in Sec18, when incubated at restrictive temperature, were unable to secrete proteins and exhibited an intracellular buildup of small vesicles (5Novick P.

It would appear that the NSF/Sec18p is required for most heterotypic membrane fusion events in the cell, with one possible exception (22Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and also some of the homotypic membrane fusion events (23Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Many reports have established the importance of NSF in vesicular trafficking processes, yet its mechanism of action has remained elusive. Original data suggested that NSF was required for membrane fusion, since the NEM-accumulated vesicles seemed to be docked to larger membranes which could be construed as target membranes (8Malhotra V. Orci L. Glick B.S. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1988; 54: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was strengthen by the demonstration that NSF participates in the formation of a 20 S complex composed of peripheral membrane proteins (soluble NSF attachment proteins, SNAPs) and integral membrane proteins (SNAP receptors, SNAREs), which are localized to separate aspects of a membrane fusion joint, i.e. the vesicle (v-SNAREs) and the target membrane (t-SNAREs) (25Söllner T.

NSF, through its ability to hydrolyze ATP, disassembles this 20 S complex in a process that was proposed to be consistent with membrane fusion (26Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 27Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H.

However, this proposal has recently come into question, based on kinetic experiments using a number of in vitro systems (7Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,17Colombo M.I. Taddese M. Whiteheart S.W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

These data indicate that NSF functions prior to membrane fusion. This early role is most directly shown in the yeast vacuole fusion assay, in which NSF appears to function at a step that can occur even prior to mixing of the two membrane fusion partners. NSF seems to act on the two fusion partners separately by “priming” their SNARE proteins for the subsequent interactions that are involved in membrane docking and fusion (30Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 31Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this manner, NSF could be thought to act as a molecular chaperone (32Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 5: 335-339Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using ATP hydrolysis to modulate the structure of the SNARE proteins, much like HSP-90 appears to act on steroid receptors (33Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recently it has also been shown that 20 S complexes are present on vesicle membranes, suggesting that the v- and t-SNAREs can bind each other in the same membrane (34Steel G.J. Tagaya M. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). From this data, it seems possible that the NSF-mediated disassembly may in fact be needed to disengage these complexes formed in the same membrane so that they may bind to the SNAREs on opposing membranes. NSF in dilute solution appears to exist as a homotrimer, yet it has the ability to form homohexamers, as indicated by electron microscopic studies (36Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 37Whiteheart S.W. Kubalek E.W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Sequence and limited proteolysis analysis indicate that NSF subunits are made up of three domains, an amino-terminal N domain followed by two Walker-type ATP binding domains, D1 and D2 (3Wilson D.W. Wilcox C.A. Flynn G.C. Chen E. Kuang W. Henzel W.J. Block M.R. Ullrich A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,39Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each domain has been shown to play a distinct role in the overall function of the NSF oligomer. The N domain is required for binding to the SNAP·SNARE complex and thus formation of the 20 S complex (40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis shows that it is the ability of the D1 domain to bind and hydrolyze nucleotide that is critical for transport activity (28Sumida M. Hong R.-M. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20636-20641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In fact it appears that it is an ATPase-driven interaction between the N and D1 domains that is critical for 20 S complex disassembly (40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This is consistent with structural studies which indicate that when NSF is in the ATP form, the N domains extend radially from a central core, and these domains are contracted in the ADP form (36Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The D2 domain, while apparently not required for its nucleotide binding or hydrolysis capacity, is essential to oligomerization and appears to contribute to the formation of the central core of NSF (36Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of NSF and its properties we have examined the nucleotide binding characteristics of NSF. In this study, we demonstrate that each NSF oligomer contains two distinct classes of ATP-binding sites, low and high affinity, which can be distinguished based on their contribution to NSF structure and function. ATP and GTP were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, and ADP, AMP, and adenine were from Sigma. [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP, 800 and >3000 Ci/mmol, were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Pure nitrocellulose transfer and immobilization membranes (0.45 μm for measurement of ATP binding and 0.2 μm for immunoblotting) were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to anti-immunoglobulin secondary antibodies was from Sigma, and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Pierce. Glutathione insolubilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose was from Sigma. All chemicals were of reagent grade. Wild type NSF and NSF domain rearrangement mutants, α-SNAP and GST-syntaxin 1 (cytosolic domain), were produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured according to the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using ovalbumin from Sigma as a standard. Binding of [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP to NSF and to the NSF mutants was determined by the filtration method with a slight modification (42Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, the indicated concentration of radioactive adenine nucleotide ([α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP, 800 and >3000 Ci/mmol) and 1.2 nmol of protein was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (BA-85, 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was washed five times with 1.5 ml of washing buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The radioactivity retained in the membrane was counted in 3 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (Econo Safe, Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) using a Tri-Carb 2100TR (Packard Instrument Co.) liquid scintillation counter. For the competition analysis, radioactive ATP was incubated with NSF or NSF mutants prior to the addition of the indicated concentrations of nonradioactive ATP, ADP, AMP, adenine, and GTP. Direct photoaffinity labeling of proteins with [α-32P]ATP was carried out according to Antonoff (43Antonoff R.S. Ferguson J.J.J. Idelkope G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1976; 23: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein samples were irradiated by a UV source with peak emission at 254 nm for 1 h at −80 °C. After labeling, the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was exposed directly on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the film was developed using a medical film processor Konica QX-70 (Picker, Cleveland, OH). Soluble protein extracts from Escherichia coli cells expressing the GST-syntaxin 1a (cytoplasmic domain) recombinant protein were incubated with pre-swollen glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C with rotation in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EDTA. After 1 h of incubation, the beads were washed seven times in the same buffer, and then equal volumes of the beads were aliquoted into the reaction tubes. Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 300 μl containing 10 μg of NSF or mutant in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm imidazole, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 40% (w/v) ovalbumin) with the indicated nucleotide and divalent cation (see Fig. 6). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times in binding buffer without ovalbumin. The bound NSF was eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using the mouse monoclonal 6E6 antibody (39Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions on 12.5% slab gels in a discontinuous buffer system according to Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Western blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed according to standard techniques (40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol.

Super Signal substrate was used to visualize the immunodecorated antigens using X-Omat x-ray film. Nucleotide binding experiments were performed with recombinant NSF protein using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the binding of radiolabeled ATP increases with increasing concentration, and saturable binding is achieved at approximately 100 nm ATP. These data were subjected to Scatchard analysis (Fig. 1, inset), and aK d for ATP binding of 30–40 nm was calculated. [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP showed similar binding characteristics, suggesting that true ATP binding was being measured in these experiments with no significant nucleotide hydrolysis. From these data and other saturation curves, 3.3 high affinity ATP-binding sites were detected per NSF trimer. This ratio of 3 mol of ATP/mol of NSF was reproducible when fresh preparations were analyzed but was less so after the proteins had been stored for extended periods at 4 °C. Competition experiments were used to examine the nucleotide binding specificity of the NSF trimer. As shown in Fig.2 A, only ATP and ADP could effectively compete with [32P]ATP for binding. AMP and adenine were unable to compete for ATP binding even when used at 100-fold excess. GTP showed a slight degree of competition at the highest concentrations, which may reflect the importance of multiple phosphates to the nucleotide binding properties of NSF. In these experiments NSF was prebound with [32P]ATP, and then increasing amounts of the indicated unlabeled nucleotides were added to evaluate their ability to displace the bound [32P]ATP. The amount of [32P]ATP still bound after incubation was measured and the data was used as another indication of the dissociation constant. The resulting K d value calculated for ATP (30–40 nm) was in good agreement to the values calculated from the Scatchard analysis in Fig. 1. Interestingly, the K d for ADP was about 2 μm, suggesting that these sites can bind ATP and ADP but with an 100-fold difference in affinity. To further demonstrate that NSF in our preparations was indeed binding ATP, photoaffinity radiolabeling of NSF was performed (Fig.2 B). In the complete reaction (wt NSF) NSF was covalently modified by bound [32P]ATP after irradiation. This labeling was specific, since it was not present when a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ATP was added to the reaction (+ATP) or when the samples were not irradiated (-UV) prior to electrophoresis. The analysis above indicates that NSF contains three specific high affinity ATP-binding sites, yet its amino acid sequence suggests that six sites are possible per trimer. Domain rearrangement and ATP-binding site mutants were examined in binding assays to determine which of the two ATP binding domains, D1 or D2, contains the high affinity ATP-binding sites (Fig. 3). Mutant proteins that lacked the D2 domain (ND1) or had the critical lysine residue of the Walker A motif of the D2 mutated (D2K-A) and were unable to bind ATP when the concentration in the binding reaction was held at 0.25 μm (Fig.3 A). Wild type NSF or mutants that contain the D2 domain (ND2, D1D2, and D2) were all able to bind [32P]ATP. In each mutant the stoichiometry of binding was approximately three ATPs per NSF or mutant trimer. These data show that the high affinity ATP-binding site of NSF is in the D2 domain. The photoaffinity labeling of domain rearrangement mutants by [32P]ATP at same concentration as the binding experiment confirms the previous results. Only proteins containing functional D2 domains are labeled. The ND1 mutant and D2K-A mutant, which lack functional D2 domains, were not labeled under these conditions (Fig.3 B). Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of the D1 domain to bind and hydrolyze ATP. This activity is critical for NSF function in the vesicular transport process; however, this domain (D1) does not appear to contain high affinity ATP-binding sites. The concentrations of [32P]ATP used in the nucleotide binding experiments of Fig. 1 were extended to determine whether NSF possessed a second, lower affinity class of nucleotide-binding sites. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, two plateaus were present in this titration. The first (saturating at 100 nm) corresponds to the high affinity sites described in Fig. 1. The data points from the second plateau were subjected to Scatchard analysis and a K d of 15–20 μm was calculated. A Hill plot analysis of the two classes of ATP-binding sites indicated that there is no cooperativity and that both classes of sites appear to be independent. Competition experiments done for these high affinity sites show that the binding for ATP and ADP are quite similar in affinity (Fig. 4 B). TheK d values estimated from this experiment were 40 μm for ATP and 140 μm for ADP, which is in good agreement with the Scatchard analysis above (Fig.4 A). To determine which domain accounts for this class of lower affinity nucleotide-binding sites, the different domain rearrangement mutants were analyzed for ATP binding at the two different ATP concentrations, 0.5 μm and 50 μm (Fig.5). At the lower ATP concentration only the high affinity sites would be detected, and at the high concentration both sites would contribute as shown for wild type NSF (NSF). Mutants lacking a functional D2 ATP-binding site (ND1 and D2K-A) only showed binding at the high [32P]ATP concentration. Mutants lacking a functional D1 domain binding site (D1K-A and D2) showed binding at the low concentration, but it did not increase at the higher [32P]ATP concentrations. These data indicate that the low affinity site is in the D1 domain, whereas the high affinity site is in the D2 domain. The alkylating agent NEM is a known inhibitor of NSF activity, but the mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. NSF protein was preincubated with NEM (1, 5, 10, and 20 mm) for 30 min on ice and then assayed for ATPase activity and nucleotide binding. Prior NEM treatment had no effect on ATP binding at either 0.25 or 30 μm [32P]ATP, indicating that both classes of nucleotide-binding sites were still active to bind ATP (data not shown). However, NEM treatment even at the lowest concentrations completely eliminated the ATPase activity of the NSF trimer. Previous studies have suggested that nucleotide binding to NSF induces crucial conformational changes in the trimer that are required for activity. To extend these observations, we examined the effects of nucleotides on the interactions of NSF with the α-SNAP-syntaxin 1a complex. In brief, NSF was incubated with α-SNAP and immobilized GST-syntaxin 1a with various nucleotides at different concentrations. The effect of these conditions on NSF was measured by examining the amount of NSF that associated with the immobilized SNAP· SNARE complex. The importance of ATP binding and hydrolysis are clearly shown in the first three lanes of Fig.6 A. NSF can only associate with the SNAP·SNARE complex when ATP is present and hydrolysis is prevented. ADP is not sufficient to allow NSF to associate with the SNAP·SNARE complex, perhaps because it does not induce the appropriate conformational changes in the NSF trimer. As previously demonstrated, and also shown in the next three lanes, the ATP-binding site of D1 appears to be critical for NSF binding to the SNAP·SNARE complex. Mutations that disrupt nucleotide binding in the D1 domain eliminate the ability of the mutant protein to bind to the SNAP·SNARE complex in the presence of ATPγS, although similar mutations in the high affinity site of the D2 domain have no effect. These experiments suggest that ATP binding to the D1 domain (but not to the D2 domain) plays an important role in activating NSF. To further test this hypothesis, we made use of the 1000-fold difference in the ATP-binding constants between D2 and D1 and performed a titration experiment to determine the ATP concentration needed for NSF to associate with the SNAP·SNARE complex. As shown in Fig. 6 B, significant binding of NSF to the SNAP·SNARE complex does not occur until the concentration of ATPγS exceeds 1 μm. As the concentration of ATPγS increases, the binding of NSF to the SNAP·SNARE complex continues to become more efficient. These data show that under conditions (<1 μm ATPγS) in which the high affinity ATP-binding sites would be almost completely occupied, NSF is still not competent to bind to the SNAP·SNARE complex. Only when the low affinity sites become occupied (>1 μmATPγS) does NSF become competent to interact with the complex. This confirms the importance of nucleotide binding to these low affinity sites and the role that ATP binding plays in the conformational changes needed for NSF activity. In this report, we demonstrate that NSF has two classes of ATP-binding sites that are distinct in their nucleotide binding properties and functional characteristics. One class has a high affinity for ATP (K d of 30–40 nm) with a 100-fold lower affinity for ADP. These sites are in the D2 domain, but they have been shown not to be catalytically required for NSF activity (38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The second class, found in the D1 domain, has a 1000-fold lower affinity for ATP with a K d of 15–20 μm. Mutational studies indicate that it is this D1 ATP-binding site that is catalytically important for NSF activity (38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP by the D1 domains is crucial for NSF to interact with other components of the membrane fusion machinery. Specifically, NSF binds to the SNAP·SNARE complex only at nucleotide concentrations which would lead to occupancy of the lower affinity sites. At lower concentrations of ATP, when only the D2 sites are occupied, NSF is incompetent to bind to the SNAP·SNARE complex. This demonstrates that the two distinct aspects of NSF function, 20 S complex assembly and vesicular transport activity, are controlled by the dynamics of the nucleotide bound to the D1 domain. Previous reports have indicated the catalytic importance of the D1 domain to NSF activity. Studies done with point mutations in the Walker A and B motifs have shown that the D1 domain accounts for the majority of the ATPase activity of the NSF trimer. Additionally these studies demonstrated that the ATP binding and hydrolytic activity of this domain are critical for NSF function in the vesicular transport processes (38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). From the previous studies with mutant NSF proteins (40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the studies with wild type protein presented here, it is clear that nucleotide binding to the D1 domain is required for NSF to interact with the other elements of the membrane fusion apparatus. Binding of ATP to the D1 domain appears to induce a conformational change in NSF so that it is able to make all of the protein-protein interactions required for formation of the 20 S complex. This is supported by recent structural data that show a radial extension of the N domains when NSF is in the ATP-bound form (36Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). This splaying of N domains is essential for NSF binding to the SNAP·SNARE complex (36Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, this indicates that only the activated form of NSF, charged with ATP, can participate in formation of the 20 S fusion complex. The ADP-bound form of NSF is incompetent for SNAP·SNARE binding (Fig.6 A). The D2 ATP-binding sites show a high affinity and selectivity for ATP, but when assayed as an isolated trimeric domain, D2 has very low ATPase activity (40Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The fact that the D2 domains bind ATP approximately 100-fold higher than ADP is consistent with other nucleotide binding proteins that lack ATPase activity (45Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Unlike the D1 domain, the amino acid sequence of the D2 ATP-binding site is only distantly related to the 240 amino acid consensus ATP-binding sites of the ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities (AAA) family; therefore the D2 domain may not have the ATPase activity or the associated force-generating capacity predicted for the other AAA protein (46Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Aside from its role in multimerization of NSF, it has been difficult to ascribe a function to this domain. Mutations in the ATP-binding site of D2 fail to have a significant phenotype, although the resulting proteins do not appear to be equivalent to wild type NSF in the intra-Golgi transport assay (38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). At present, it is hypothesized that the D2 domain plays a structural role in NSF function similar to the proposed role of the α subunit of the F1F0 ATPase (47Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Like the F1F0 α subunit, the D2 domain has a high affinity ATP-binding site that might be required for the folding and stability of the oligomer (36Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Susan A. Buhrow and Dr. Sergey V.

Only a small number of erythroid cell-restricted transcription factors have been identified that are involved in erythroid gene transcriptional activation (19Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and these include GATA-1 (the prototype of a family of GATA proteins), NF-E2, and the CACCC box-binding protein, EKLF. In the present study, we have identified transcription factors that bind to the ALAS2 promoter to drive its expression and have examined, in detail, the role of GATA and CACCC box-binding proteins in this process. Gel shift assays have been employed to investigate the specificity of protein-DNA interactions in the ALAS2 promoter and the functional contribution of such binding sites evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression analysis of ALAS2 promoter/reporter gene constructs. A series of 5′-flanking ALAS2 deletion constructs were generated from subcloned fragments isolated from the human genomic clone, pTC-EA1 (11Cox T.C. Bawden M.J. Martin A. May B.K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and ligated into the promoterless firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega). The polymerase chain reaction was performed using pTC-EA1 as the template and the following primers: primer 1, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCACTGAGGACGAACG-3′ at +12/+36 (an introducedHindIII site is underlined), and 5′-GGGTTCTGTAACTACATTGCC-3′, which bound upstream of anAvrII site at −718/−699 and resulted in the amplification of a 730-bp promoter fragment. The amplified product was digested withBglII and HindIII and a 321-bp fragment ligated into the similarly digested pGL2-Basic vector. The resulting construct is designated pALAS−293-LUC and contains ALAS2 promoter sequence from −293 to +28. The amplified product was also digested withSacI and HindIII and a 420-bp fragment ligated into the similarly digested pBluescript KS+ phagemid (pKS+-ALAS). To synthesize plasmids with promoter lengths of −124 and −27, a PvuII site was introduced at these positions by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting modified plasmids were digested with SmaI (polylinker) andPvuII and religated to form pALAS−124-LUC and pALAS−27-LUC. The synthesis of the longer promoter constructs was performed in several steps. In separate studies, a HindIII site was introduced at −7/−2 in the ALAS2 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis in a subclone containing −6.0 to +5.0 kb of contiguous human ALAS2 sequence. Subsequent digestion of this subclone withXbaI or KpnI together with HindIII gave promoter lengths of 1.9 and 5.7 kb that were cloned into pGL2-Basic linearized with NheI/HindIII andKpnI/HindIII, respectively. These initial constructs terminated at position −4 and therefore did not contain the native transcription initiation site. To permit strict comparison with the shorter promoter constructs, the sequence from around the native transcription initiation site was then reintroduced into these constructs as follows. An AvrII-HindIII fragment (−700 to −4) was excised from the 1.9 kb promoter construct and replaced with an AvrII-HindIII fragment (−700 to +28) that was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, resulting in pALAS-1.9kb-LUC. An NcoI-HindIII fragment (−1.0 kb to −4) was removed from the 5.7 kb promoter construct and replaced with the NcoI-HindIII fragment (−1.0 kb to +28) isolated from pALAS-1.9kb-LUC to generate pALAS-5.7kb-LUC. To synthesize the construct containing 10.3 kb of 5′-flanking region (pALAS-10.3kb-LUC), pTC-EA1 was digested with ClaI andXhoI, and a 5.7-kb fragment was cloned into the similarly digested vector pSP72 (Promega). An EcoRV-XhoI fragment isolated from this plasmid was used to replace a 1.1-kbSmaI-XhoI fragment in the construct pALAS-5.7kb-LUC. Constructs with 124 bp of wild type promoter (pALAS−124A-LUC) or a mutation in the −54 bp CACCC site were also synthesized for use in transactivation experiments. A 152-bp fragment (−124 to +28) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using the plasmids pALAS−293-LUC and pALAS−293mut8-LUC as templates, and two primers: 5′-GGTTTAGATCTTAGCAAGGAAGGGA-3′ at −131/−106 (an introduced BglII site is underlined) and primer 1. Following digestion of the product with BglII and HindIII, the resultant fragment was cloned into the appropriately linearized pGL2-Basic vector. Additional constructs synthesized for use in transactivation experiments included pβ-glob-LUC and p(CAC)4tk-LUC derived from constructs provided by Dr. J. Bieker (20Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pβ-glob-LUC contained 205 bp of murine β-globin promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene, and p(CAC)4tk-LUC contained four copies of the murine β-globin CACCC site ligated upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase reporter gene fusion. All constructs were verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. The human erythroleukemia cell line, K562, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The adherent murine erythroleukemia MEL (F4–12B2) cell line (kindly provided by Dr. G. Bergholz, Hamburg, Germany), COS-1, and CV-1 cells were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For electroporation, exponentially growing K562 cells were washed in PBS and 107 cells in 200 μl of PBS containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, were electroporated with 2 pmol of the reporter construct at 200 V, 960 microfarads using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. MEL cells were grown to 80% confluency, harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in media, and washed twice in PBS. MEL cells (107) in 500 μl of cold PBS containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, were electroporated with 2 pmol of the reporter construct at 300 V, 960 microfarads. COS-1 cells were grown to 80% confluency and harvested by trypsinization. COS-1 cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in 500 μl of cold buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm dextrose and electroporated with 2 pmol of the reporter construct (300 V, 960 microfarads). All transfections contained 250 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) as a carrier. As an internal control, K562 and COS-1 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector, RSV-β-gal, and MEL cells with 10 μg of this vector. Cells were seeded in 60 × 15-mm Petri dishes containing 5 ml of medium and harvested 24 h after transfection. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid DNA was prepared by the CsCl/ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient procedure (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), quantified by spectrophotometry and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm concentration and supercoiling. All transient transfections were performed in quadruplicate with at least three different plasmid DNA preparations. Transfected cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and treated with 100 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) on ice for 10 min. Cells were then snap frozen, thawed on ice, and centrifuged for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Supernatants were assayed to determine total protein concentration (Bio-Rad protein microassay). Subsequent assays (luciferase and β-galactosidase) were performed with 100 μg of cell lysate. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega), and measurements were determined in a Berthold model LB9502 luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the procedure of Herbomel et al. (22Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and expressed as (A 420/μg of protein/h) × 100. Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activity as an internal control, and the data were expressed as “relative luciferase activity.” All nuclear extracts were prepared by the procedure of Partington et al. (23Partington G.A. Bertwistle D. Nicolas R.H. Kee W.-J. Pizzey J.A. Patient R.K. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) except those used for the detection of CACCC-binding proteins, where the rapid procedure described by Andrews et al. (24Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) was employed. The sequences of sense strand oligonucleotides used in the gel shift experiments are as follows. Binding motifs are underlined: GATA−124, 5′-CTTTGGGTTTTATCTCTAGCAAGG-3′; GATA−100, 5′-AAGGGACTGAGATACCTTTGGGGC-3′; β-globin GATA-cons (25Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F.

Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell.

Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar)), 5′-GCTAGCCCGCATGCGCGCGCACCTTG-3′. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were gel-purified, and 100 ng of each labeled with [γ32P]ATP using T4polynucleotide kinase. A 3-fold molar excess of the unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide was annealed to the32P-labeled oligonucleotide in 100 mm NaCl by incubation at 100 °C for 2 min and 70 °C for 10 min and then allowing the samples to slowly cool to room temperature. The labeled annealed oligonucleotides were precipitated and washed to remove unincorporated radioactivity and resuspended in 100 μl of water. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were also annealed for use in competition assays. Binding reactions used in the detection of GATA-binding proteins contained 5 μg of nuclear protein, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 15 μl of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 60 mm KCl, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm spermidine and incubated on ice for 10 min. Radiolabeled probe (1 ng) was added to the reaction and incubated on ice for a further 30 min. In supershift assays, 2 μl of the GATA-1-specific monoclonal antibody, N-6 (28Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. G. Partington), was incubated in the binding reaction prior to the addition of probe. Retarded nuclear protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 180 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. For the detection of protein binding to the −27 GATA site, the binding reaction protocol described by Fong and Emerson (29Fong T.C. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used. Purified recombinant human TBP was obtained from Promega, and poly(dI-dC) was omitted from the binding reaction. In experiments designed to determine the binding affinity constants (K d ) of GATA-1 and TBP, binding reactions and electrophoresis conditions were as described above with a constant amount of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes and serial dilutions of TBP or a purified GST-GATA-1 zinc finger fusion protein (GST-GATA-1(f)) (30Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) prepared as described previously (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Binding reactions used in the detection of CACCC-binding proteins and the supershift assays using polyclonal antibodies to BKLF, EKLF, and Sp1 were performed as described by Crossley et al. (32Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies to BKLF and EKLF were generously provided by Dr. M. Crossley. The Sp1 polyclonal antibody, Sp1 (PEP 2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), was a gift from Dr. M. F. Shannon. Gel shift competition assays were performed with unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides included in the binding reactions. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene M13 in vitromutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid pKS+-ALAS, containing ALAS2 promoter sequence (−392 to +28), was transformed into the Escherichia coliCJ236 strain, and following superinfection with the helper phage M13KO7, single-stranded DNA was purified and used as a template in the mutagenesis reaction. In the final step, aBglII-HindIII fragment harboring the mutation was excised from pBluescript KS+ and subcloned into theBglII/HindIII-digested pGL2-Basic vector. To synthesize promoter lengths of −124 and −27 and to inactivate the GATA sites, PvuII sites were introduced at −124, −100, and −27. The −27 GATA site was also converted to a canonical TATA box and to a consensus GATA-1 site. The CACCC and NF-E2 sites were also inactivated by conversion to a PvuII site. Mutant clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The primers used in these reactions are as follows with the mutations underlined: −124 GATA, 5′-ACTTTGGGTTTCAGCTGTTAGCAAGGAA-3′; −100 GATA, 5′-GGAAGGGACTGGCAGCTGTTTGGGGCCA-3′; −27 GATA, 5′-AGAGGAGAAGGCAGCTGTGCCAGGTCCT-3′; GATA−27G, 5′-TCAGAGGAGACATGATAAGTGCCAGGTCCT-3′; TATA, 5′-AGAGGAGAAGGTATAAATGCCAGG-3′; −54 CACCC, 5′-CAGAAGGCAGGCAGCTGGGGGCTGAGTC-3′; −44 NF-E2, 5′-GTGGGTGGGGCAGCTGCAGAGGAGAAG-3′. Transactivation experiments in COS-1 cells were performed with 2 pmol of the reporter construct and 5 μg of the murine GATA-1 cDNA expression clone, pXM/GF-1 (provided by Dr. S. H. Orkin) or 10 μg of each of the cDNA expression clones, pMT2/RINFE and pMT2/p18w-1, for NF-E2 (provided by Dr. N. Andrews). For transactivation experiments in K562 cells, 2 pmol of the reporter construct and 7.5 μg of the EKLF cDNA expression clone, pSG5/EKLF (26Miller L.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. J. Bieker), were employed. The vectors pGL2-Basic and ptk-LUC containing the thymidine kinase promoter were included as controls. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and 100 μg of total protein assayed for luciferase activity. The -fold transactivations were determined following subtraction of the background activity obtained with the appropriate progenitor vectors. We previously reported the isolation of genomic clones for human ALAS2 (11Cox T.C. Bawden M.J. Martin A. May B.K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and a partial restriction map of the first 10.3 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the gene is shown in Fig. 1 A. To determine regions that contribute to expression, constructs generated with different 5′ lengths (−10.3 kb to −27 bp) and with a common 3′ end (+28) were fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig.1 B). These constructs were transiently transfected into K562, MEL (F4–12B2), or COS-1 cells, the latter as a nonerythroid control, and luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates. The activity of the longest construct (pALAS-10.3kb-LUC) in each cell line was assigned a value of 100 (Fig. 1 B). The promoter expressed strongly in both erythroid cell lines, and maximal activity was seen with 293 bp of promoter (pALAS−293-LUC). A low level of activity was obtained with the −27 bp promoter construct (pALAS−27-LUC). Expression of the constructs was also observed in COS-1 cells and followed a similar pattern to that in erythroid cells except that 1.9 kb of promoter (pALAS-1.9kb-LUC) gave maximal expression (Fig. 1 B). In this study, we have investigated the basis for the strong transcriptional activity of the first 300 bp of promoter. Sequence analysis of this region revealed a clustering of potential binding sites in the first 140 bp, including those for the erythroid-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 as well as CACCC (19Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and CCAAT (33Chodosh L. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A.

Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C). Three putative GATA-1 binding sites were identified at −126/−121 (on the noncoding strand), −102/−97, and −30/−23 (Fig.1 C). The sites centered at −124 and −100 were first investigated. The −124 GATA site (5′-AGATAA-3′) conforms to the consensus for GATA-1 (35Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 36Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) while the −100 site (5′-AGATAC-3′) deviates by one nucleotide. Binding of nuclear proteins to these sites was determined using GATA−124 and GATA−100 probes in gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from K562, MEL, or COS-1 cells and also from COS-1 cells transfected with the murine GATA-1 cDNA expression vector, pXM/GF-1. A β-globin GATA-1 consensus sequence (GATA-cons) was employed as a control probe (25Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A major protein complex was obtained with the GATA−124 probe (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and3) and GATA-cons probe (lanes 12 and13) using nuclear extracts from K562 and MEL cells. A complex with the same mobility was detected with the GATA−100 probe, although the intensity was reduced (lanes 7 and8). Similar results were also observed with all three probes using nuclear extracts from COS-1 cells expressing recombinant GATA-1 (lanes 5, 10, and 15) but were not detected with nuclear extracts from mock-transfected COS-1 cells (lanes 4 and 9), although a minor band was observed with the GATA-cons probe (lane 14). To confirm whether the protein complex that bound to the −124 and −100 sites in the erythroid cell extracts was indeed GATA-1, gel supershift assays were undertaken with the GATA-1 monoclonal antibody, N-6 (28Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and nuclear extracts from either MEL cells or COS-1 cells expressing recombinant GATA-1. The antibody substantially supershifted the major band obtained with the GATA−124 probe, the GATA-cons probe (Fig. 2 B), and the GATA−100 probe (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2029028209,"C 2-α-Mannosyltryptophan was discovered in RNase 2 from human urine, representing a novel way of attaching carbohydrate to a protein. Here, we have addressed two questions related to the biosynthesis of this modification: (i) isC-mannosylation part of the normal intracellular biosynthetic route, and (ii) how general is it, i.e. which organisms perform this kind of glycosylation? To answer the first question, RNase 2, which is identical to the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, was isolated from intracellular stores of cultured human HL-60 cells. The enzyme was C-mannosylated at Trp-7, showing that the modification occurs intracellularly, before secretion of the protein. The second question was investigated by immunological and chemical analysis of RNase 2 purified from the supernatant of transiently transformed cells from different organisms. This revealed that C-mannosylation occurs in cells from man, green monkey, pig, mouse, and hamster. The observation that pig kidney cells contain the machinery for C-mannosylation of Trp-7 of human RNase 2 but that the homologous RNase from porcine kidney is not a substrate, since it does not contain a tryptophan at position 7, strongly suggests that C-mannosylated proteins other than RNase 2 exist. Recombinant RNase 2 isolated from insect cells, plant protoplasts, and Escherichia coli was notC-mannosylated. These results not only form the basis for further studies on the biochemical aspects ofC-mannosylation but also have implications for the choice of cells for production of recombinant glycoproteins.

These results not only form the basis for further studies on the biochemical aspects ofC-mannosylation but also have implications for the choice of cells for production of recombinant glycoproteins. Post-translational modification of proteins by covalent attachment of carbohydrate is a common and widespread phenomenon. Two kinds of glycosylation have been known for a long time:N-glycosylation, where the sugar residues are linked to Nδ of Asn, and O-glycosylation, where the linkage is to Oγ of Thr or Ser. Both have been extensively characterized with respect to their biosynthetic pathways as well as their distribution in nature. They are found in many organisms, ranging from bacteria to man, and occur in a variety of proteins (1Lis H. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Recently, a new kind of linkage between a carbohydrate and a protein was discovered in human ribonuclease 2 (RNase 2), namely a C-glycosidically linked mannosyl residue (2Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 3de Beer T. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Löffler A. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11785-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this case the C-1′ atom of the mannosyl residue is directly linked to the C-2 atom of the indole moiety of Trp-7 (Scheme 1). RNase 2 from urine is completely identical in primary structure to eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), 1The abbreviations used are: EDN, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin; (C 2-Man-)Trp,C 2-α-mannopyranosyltryptophan; ESIMS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; FCS, fetal calf serum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC-ESIMS, liquid chromatography interfaced with ESIMS; PAA, polyacrylamide; r-RNase 2, recombinant RNase 2; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. 1The abbreviations used are: EDN, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin; (C 2-Man-)Trp,C 2-α-mannopyranosyltryptophan; ESIMS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; FCS, fetal calf serum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC-ESIMS, liquid chromatography interfaced with ESIMS; PAA, polyacrylamide; r-RNase 2, recombinant RNase 2; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. which is located in the cytotoxic granules of the eosinophil and may play a role in the anti-parasitic action of these cells (4Snyder M.R. Gleich G.J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases, Structures and Functions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 425-444Google Scholar). EDN is a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle stiffness and ataxia when injected intracerebrally into experimental animals (Gordon phenomenon, see Refs. 5Gordon M.H. Br. Med. J. 1933; 1: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 6Durack D.T. Sumi S.M. Klebanoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This is associated with the loss of Purkinje cells and vacuolation of white matter in the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord (6Durack D.T. Sumi S.M. Klebanoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The putative glycosyltransferase that carries out the modification of RNase 2 must have a considerable degree of specificity as it transfers a mannosyl residue to Trp-7 while fully ignoring the tryptophan at position 10 (2Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Originally, (C 2Man-)Trp was found in peptides obtained from RNase 2 from human urine. Subsequently, using NMR it was shown in the entire, intact protein (7Löffler A. Doucey M.-A. Jansson A.M. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Hess D. Meldal M. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12005-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since the modification was also found in RNase 2 isolated from human erythrocytes, it was concluded that C-mannosylated RNase 2 from urine does not represent a metabolized form of the excreted protein but that it constitutes a genuine post-translational modification (7Löffler A. Doucey M.-A. Jansson A.M. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Hess D. Meldal M. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12005-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It could be argued, however, that human erythrocytes are not representative for other types of cells, because they lack a nucleus and other major cell organelles. As a result of the absence of protein synthesis, erythrocyte proteins are not replaced and age. This raises the possibility that C-mannosylation of RNase 2 in erythrocytes results from an aging process, in contrast to proteinN- and O-glycosylation, which is part of the biosynthetic route of newly made proteins. We have addressed this question by isolating RNase 2 from cultured human promyelocytic cells (HL-60) and examining its C-mannosylation status. In contrast to N- and O-glycosylation, knowledge about the organisms in which C-mannosylation occurs is lacking, because so far only RNase 2 from human sources has been analyzed. This issue is of importance for further studies on the biosynthesis of (C 2-Man-)Trp and in the search for other proteins containing this modification. In addition, it may also have practical implications for the choice of appropriate cells for the production of recombinant proteins with or without this modification. Therefore, we have expressed human RNase 2 in cells from a variety of organisms. The secreted proteins were purified to near homogeneity and analyzed with an antibody specific for (C 2-Man-)Trp of RNase 2, as well as by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation of purified peptides. Human RNase 1 and 2 were purified as described (2Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G.

Cell culture media and FCS were from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibodies against human RNase 2 have been described previously (7Löffler A. Doucey M.-A. Jansson A.M. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Hess D.

An initial injection of 430 μg of conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant was given, followed by 2 booster injections with 430 μg of conjugate in Freund's incomplete adjuvant after 1 and 2.5 months. Specific antibodies were purified as described (7Löffler A. Doucey M.-A. Jansson A.M. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Hess D. Meldal M. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12005-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described (7Löffler A. Doucey M.-A. Jansson A.M. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Hess D. Meldal M. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12005-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells (ATCC 240-CCl) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, containing 15% FCS. All isolation procedures were performed at 4 °C, and buffers for extraction and chromatography contained a mixture of protease inhibitors, leupeptin (0.2 μg/ml), benzamidine HCl (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.2 μg/ml), p-methanesulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm), unless indicated otherwise. Harvested cells (7.5 × 109) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and RNase 2 was extracted with 380 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h with stirring. After centrifugation at 2000 × rpm in a table-top centrifuge for 4 min at room temperature, the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, and loaded onto a column of SP-Sepharose (1.5 × 11 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed, and proteins were eluted with 0.5m NaCl in the same buffer. The fractions containing RNase 2 were diluted 10-fold with 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, and loaded onto a column of heparin-Sepharose (1 × 7.5 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed, and RNase 2 was eluted with 0.6 m NaCl in the same buffer. After 5-fold dilution with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the RNase 2 containing fractions were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. An immunoaffinity column was prepared by covalently cross-linking RNase 2-specific antibodies to protein A-Sepharose using dimethylpimelimidate (8Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase 2 was bound by recycling over the column for 18 h. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, followed by 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. RNase 2 was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, and neutralized immediately with 1 m Tris base. The fractions containing RNase 2 from the previous step were made 0.1% in trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reversed phase HPLC on a C4 column (1 or 2.1 mm diameter Vydac, Hispania, CA) (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A linear gradient of 15–60% solvent B (70% CH3CN, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid) over 90 min was used at a flow rate of 0.05 or 0.2 ml/min. No protease inhibitors were added in this step. A synthetic gene coding for human RNase 2 in pET11dedn (a gift from Dr. R. J. Youle, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) was used in all experiments (9Newton D.L. Nicholls P.J. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26739-26745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was modified using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis to introduce the RNase 2 signal sequence for secretion (MVPKLFTSQICLLLLLGLLAVEGSLHV-) and XbaI, SalI,BglII, and BamHI restriction sites on the 3′-side of the stop codon. The mutated edn gene was subcloned into pBluescript (pBluescriptedn). From there theEcoRI/BglII fragment, containing the entire pre-RNase 2 coding sequence, was cloned into a pSMC-type of expression vector, which yielded pSMCi99edn. This vector contains an SV40 origin of replication and the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer (10Asselbergs F.A. Grand P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 327-331Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The EcoRI/BamHI fragment obtained from pSMCi99edn was cloned into the expression plasmids pVL1392 and pAcMP2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The constructs, pVL1392edn and pAcMP2edn, encode pre-RNase 2 with its own signal sequence and contain the very late polyhedrin and late basic protein baculovirus promoter, respectively. The same fragment was cloned into pBluescript and from there into the expression vector pBD1119 (a gift from Dr. B. Dickson, University of Zürich), using KpnI and XbaI restriction sites. The plasmid, pBDssedn, contained the pre-RNase 2 coding region and the constitutive D. melanogasterα-tubulin promoter. An MscI and BamHI restriction site was introduced on the 5′- and 3′-side of the edn gene in pET11dedn, respectively. TheMscI/BamHI fragment was cloned into pASK60-strep (11Schmidt T.G. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which had been cut with StuI and BamHI. The plasmid, pASKedn, contained the RNase 2 coding region, in frame with the ompA signal sequence. An NcoI site was introduced at the start codon of the RNase 2 gene in pBluescriptedn, and theNcoI/BamHI fragment was obtained. The plant expression plasmid p35S′-GUS (12Hohn T. Corsten S. Rieke S. Müller M. Rothnie H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8334-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was cut with eitherNcoI/Acc65I orAcc65I/BamHI. The three fragments were joined in a three-way ligation, yielding the plasmid p35S′edn, which contained the pre-RNase 2 coding region and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter/leader. The sequence of all constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573), COS7, LLC-PK1 (ATCC CRL 1392), and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. HEK 293, COS7, and CHO cells were transfected with pSMCi99edn (10 μg/10 cm plate) using the Transfection MBS kit (Stratagene). After transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FCS (HEK 293 cells) or 5% FCS (COS7 and CHO cells). LLC-PK1 and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pSMCi99edn, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, the medium was supplemented with either 10% FCS or 10% newborn calf serum. Conditioned media were collected 2 and 6 days post-transfection and stored at −80 °C. The medium was passed over a Sepharose Q column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. r-RNase 2 appeared in the flow-through and was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and C4 reversed phase HPLC (gradient 0–80% solvent B in 75 min) as described for RNase 2/HL-60, except that no protease inhibitors were added to the buffers. Log phase Sf9 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of plasmid pVL1392edn or pAcMP2edn and 0.5 μg of linearized BaculoGoldTM DNA (Pharmingen). Cells were incubated at 27 °C for 5 days, and the recombinant virus was amplified 3 times. For large scale protein production, virus-infected Sf9 cells were grown in serum-free medium (SF 900 II, Life Technologies, Inc.). Conditioned medium was harvested after 8 days and stored at −80 °C. The medium was centrifuged and dialyzed against 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, and the RNase was purified essentially as described for RNase 2/HL-60. However, the heparin-Sepharose column was omitted; a 0.25–1 m NaCl gradient was used to elute the enzyme from the SP-Sepharose column, and no protease inhibitors were added to the buffers. Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells (14Schneider I. J. Exp. Zool. 1964; 156: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in Schneider II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, were grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates at 25 °C and transfected with 20 μg of pBDssedn using calcium phosphate precipitation. Twelve hours post-transfection serum-free medium was added (SF 900 II medium, Life Technologies, Inc.). The supernatant was harvested 3 days thereafter, and stored at −80 °C. r-RNase 2/Schneider 2 was purified as described for r-RNase 2/Sf9. Protoplasts were prepared from suspension cultures ofOrychophragmus violaceous, transformed with p35S′edn (5 μg/2.1 × 106cells, in 0.7 ml) by electroporation, and transferred to a Petri dish with 10 ml of medium A (15Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After 48 h the medium was collected. r-RNase 2 was isolated as described for the enzymes from mammalian cells. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring plasmid pET11dedn was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Expression of RNase 2 was induced with 500 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and bacteria were harvested after 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, and lysed in a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation and cleaned up by two sequential wash/centrifugation steps with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1m urea. Ten mg of RNase 2 in inclusion bodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 10 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 200 mm dithiothreitol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted 100-fold into a stirred solution of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 ml-arginine, 5.6 mm oxidized glutathione. Refolding proceeded for at least 48 h at 25 °C. The refolding solution was dialyzed against 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, and chromatographed on heparin-Sepharose as described for RNase 2/HL-60, except that no protease inhibitors were added to the buffers. The column was washed with 250 mm NaCl and eluted with 1m NaCl in the same buffer. RNase 2 containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, and applied to a 1-ml Mono S column (Pharmacia) with a flow of 0.5 ml/min. RNase 2 was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (150–600 mm). RNase 2 containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm NH4HCO3, and stored at −80 °C. E. coli strain KS474 (16Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) harboring plasmid pASKedn was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, and expression of RNase 2 was induced with 160 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After 3 h cells were harvested and lysed as described above. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and r-RNase 2/E. coli2 was purified as described for r-RNase 2/Sf9. All RNases were active in an assay using yeast RNA as the substrate (17Fominaya J.M. Garcı́a-Segura J.M. Gavilanes J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Lyophilized RNase 2 (0.5–1.0 μg) in 35 μl of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm CaCl2 was digested with thermolysin (10% w/w) at 75 °C for 60 min. Peptides were fractionated by reversed phase HPLC on a 2.1-mm diameter C18 column (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A linear gradient of 20–41% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, 70% CH3CN) over 50 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min was used. Peptides were detected at 214 nm. The percentage modification of a particular RNase 2 was calculated from the ratio of the peaks of the modified and unmodified peptides, using a calibration curve obtained by digesting and fractionating mixtures containing different ratios of RNase 2/urine and r-RNase 2/E. coli1. LC-ESIMS was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 140 chromatograph equipped with a 0.3-mm diameter C8 column and interfaced with a Sciex API III mass spectrometer (18Hofsteenge J. Löffler A.

Methods for protein reduction, carboxymethylation, proteolytic cleavage, solid phase Edman degradation, and ESIMS have been described (2Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Hofsteenge J. Löffler A. Müller D.R. Richter W.J. de Beer T. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Marshak D.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VII. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 163-171Google Scholar). To be able to analyze the state ofC-mannosylation of small amounts of RNase 2 (1–2 μg) from cultured cells, two analytical tools were established. First, modification-specific antibodies were raised against the peptide comprising residues 5–10 of RNase 2 (FT(C 2Man-)WAQW). The affinity purified α-(5–10) antibodies recognized RNase 2 from human urine (RNase 2/urine; Fig. 1 A, lane 1) but not recombinant RNase 2 (r-RNase 2; Fig. 1 A, lane 2) isolated from the inclusion bodies of E. coli with unmodified Trp at position 7 (r-RNase 2/E. coli1, see below). To exclude that the α-(5–10) antibodies cross-reacted with mannosyl residues in one of the N-glycans of RNase 2/urine, the fragment containing these glycans (residues 13–134) was produced by proteolytic cleavage at Glu-12 and examined by Western analysis. As cleavage of RNase 2/urine proceeded, the signal produced by the α-(5–10) antibodies was lost (Fig. 1 B, lower panel) but that by the αRNase 2 antibodies remained (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). These experiments showed that the α-(5–10) antibodies recognized an epitope located in peptide-(1–12). Because RNase 2/urine and r-RNase 2/E. coli1 differ in this region only with respect to C 2-mannosylation of Trp-7, it was concluded that RNase 2 is only recognized by the α-(5–10) antibodies when it is C-mannosylated at this residue. RNase 2/urine contains abnormally small N-glycans (19Beintema J.J. Hofsteenge J. Iwama M. Morita T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Sugiyama R.H. Schieven G.L. Dekker C.A. Glitz D.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4530-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); therefore, it was of interest to examine other, more heavily N-glycosylated RNases. Fig. 1 A (lanes 3 and 4) shows that neither mannosyl residues in the N-glycans of human RNase 1 (20Ribo M. Beintema J.J. Osset M. Fernandez E. Bravo J. de Llorens R. Cuchillo C.M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar) nor of bovine pancreatic RNase B were recognized. The antibodies seemed to recognize (C 2-Man-)Trp in the context of RNase 2 only, since they did not bind to other proteins in total cell extracts (data not shown). This was most likely due to amino acid residues adjacent to Trp-7 being part of the epitope. We found that Ala-8 and Gln-9 were required for antibody binding. These two residues were not required for C-mannosylation of Trp-7 and therefore do not necessarily occur adjacent toC-mannosylated Trp in other proteins. 2J. Krieg, unpublished results. Second, a micro-method was developed for quantitating the degree ofC-mannosylation, using RNase 2/urine (fullyC-mannosylated at Trp-7) and fully unmodified r-RNase 2/E. coli1. Thermolytic digestion of RNase 2/urine and fractionation of the peptides by C18 reversed phase HPLC yielded C-mannosylated peptide-(5–10) (Fig.2 A, peak b). Cleavage of r-RNase 2/E. coli1 resulted in the formation of two peptides (Fig. 2 B, peaks a and c), which were examined by LC-ESIMS. Peak a ((M + H)+ = 691.5) was assigned to residues 6–10 (TWAQW), whereas peak c ((M + H)+ = 838.5) contained residues 5–10 (FTWAQW). Digestion of mixtures containing RNase 2/urine and r-RNase 2/E. coli1 resulted in all three peptides (not shown). By varying the molar ratios of the two RNases, a calibration curve was obtained that related the mole fraction of (C 2-Man-)Trp in the protein mixture to the relative area of peak b (Fig. 2 C). The hyperbolic shape of this curve resulted mainly from the difference in extinction coefficient between (C 2-Man-)Trp and Trp (18Hofsteenge J. Löffler A. Müller D.R. Richter W.J. de Beer T. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Marshak D.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VII. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 163-171Google Scholar). To examine whether cells that actively divide and synthesize proteins carry outC-mannosylation, RNase 2 was purified from the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60, which yielded 10 μg of RNase 2 from 7.5 × 109 cells (21% recovery). The protein migrated on SDS-PAA gels as a broad smear (Fig.3 A, lane 1), which in a subclone of HL-60 cells has been attributed to heterogeneity ofN-linked glycans (21Tiffany H.L. Li F. Rosenberg H.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 3In this publication RNase 2 has been indicated with eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. This was confirmed for the cells used here by treatment with N-glycosidase F, which resulted in RNase 2/HL-60 that co-migrated with unglycosylated r-RNase 2/E. coli1 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3). Western analysis of N-glycosidase F-treated RNase 2/HL-60 using the α-(5–10) antibodies gave a positive result (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), with RNase 2/urine and r-RNase 2/E. coli1 serving as the positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 6). This demonstrated the presence of (C 2-Man-)Trp in RNase 2/HL-60. The position of the mannosylated Trp in the protein was established by chemical analyses. Comparison of the thermolytic peptide maps of RNase 2/HL60 and RNase 2/urine by LC-ESIMS in the single ion-monitoring mode at m/z = 1000.5 demonstrated the presence of modified peptide-(5–10) (Fig. 3, B and C, upper traces). The sequence of this peptide was determined by Edman degradation to be FT(C 2-Man-)WAQW. In addition, a small amount of unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) was detected by LC-ESIMS atm/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (Fig. 3, B andC, lower and middle traces). Quantitation by the method described above showed that 90% of the RNase 2/HL-60 molecules contained (C 2-Man-)Trp at position 7 (TableI).Table IC-Mannosylation of human RNase 2 from cultured cellsSourceOrganismPeptide (5–10)ProteinPhenylthiohydantoin-(C 2-Man-)TrpLC-ESIMSm/z = 1000.5Binds to α-(5–10) antibodies(C 2-Man-)Trp%UrineMan+++100Cells HL-60Man+++90 HEK293Man+++73 COS7Monkey+++68 LLC-PK1Pig+++55 CHOHamster+++49 3T3Mouse+++81 Sf9Insect−−1-bAt m/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (see Fig. 2), the unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) were detected.−0 Schneider 2Insect−−1-bAt m/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (see Fig. 2), the unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) were detected.−0 ProtoplastsPlant−−1-bAt m/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (see Fig. 2), the unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) were detected.−0E. coli11-aE. coli1 and -2 refer to the enzyme isolated from inclusion bodies and the periplasmic space, respectively.−−1-bAt m/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (see Fig. 2), the unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) were detected.−0E. coli2−−1-bAt m/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (see Fig. 2), the unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) were detected.−01-a E. coli1 and -2 refer to the enzyme isolated from inclusion bodies and the periplasmic space, respectively.1-b At m/z = 838.5 and 691.5 (see Fig. 2), the unmodified peptides-(5–10) and -(6–10) were detected.

https://openalex.org/W2059832428,"The expressional regulation of chicken α1 integrin in smooth muscle cells was studied. The α1 integrin mRNA was expressed developmentally and was distributed dominantly in vascular and visceral smooth muscles in chick embryos. In a primary culture of smooth muscle cells, α1 integrin expression was dramatically down-regulated during serum-induced dedifferentiation. Promoter analyses revealed that the 5′-upstream region (−516 to +281) was sufficient for transcriptional activation in differentiated smooth muscle cells but not in dedifferentiated smooth muscle cells or chick embryo fibroblasts. Like other α integrin promoters, the promoter region of the α1 integrin gene lacks TATA and CCAAT boxes and contains binding sites for AP1 and AP2. The essential difference from other α integrin promoters is the presence of a CArG box-like motif. Deletion and site-directed mutation analyses revealed that the CArG box-like motif was an essential cis-element for transcriptional activation in differentiated smooth muscle cells, whereas the binding sites for AP1 and AP2 were not. Using specific antibodies, a nuclear protein factor specifically bound to the CArG box-like motif was identified as serum response factor. These results indicate that α1 integrin expression in smooth muscle cells is regulated transcriptionally in a phenotype-dependent manner and that serum response factor binding plays a crucial role in this regulation.

Integrins, heterodimeric transmembrane proteins, consist of an α and a β subunit and play a role in cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion as well as intracellular signal transduction (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion mediated by integrins is important for cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. There are at least 15 α and 8 β subunits, and their combinations generate various integrins that are distributed widely in a variety of cells. It has been generally accepted that the α subunit dictates ligand binding specificity and that the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit, which interacts directly with the cytoskeleton, is involved in signal transduction from the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasm. Among variations of the integrin family, α1β1 integrin is a receptor for both laminin (2Ignatius M.J. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1988; 1: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and collagens (3Kramer R.H. Marks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4684-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During quail embryogenesis, the expression of α1 integrin is curious; α1 integrin is expressed transiently in nervous tissues and skeletal and cardiac muscle cells of early embryos, whereas its expression is increased dramatically in smooth muscle tissues as development proceeds (4Duband J.L. Belkin A.M. Syfrig J. Thiery J.P. Koteliansky V.E. Development. 1992; 116: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar).

The down-regulation of α1 integrin expression has been reported in cultured SMCs under serum-stimulated conditions (5Belkin V.M. Belkin A.M. Koteliansky V.E. J.

In general, the integrin promoters contain multiple Sp1, AP1, and/or AP2 binding sites, but not TATA and CAAT boxes, ascis-elements. In the case of α1 integrin, its expression depends upon a phenotype of SMC as described above. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate an SMC-specific transcriptional regulation of the α1 integrin promoter. In this study, we attempted to understand how α1 integrin expression is regulated in SMCs. As a first step, we cloned full-length cDNA encoding chicken α1 integrin and found that α1 integrin expression during phenotypic modulation of SMC is regulated at the mRNA level. We further characterized the 5′-upstream region of the α1 integrin gene and identified a CArG box-like motif as a cis-element involved in the SMC phenotype-dependent transcriptional regulation.DISCUSSIONPhenotypic modulation of SMC is associated with atherosclerosis and SMC-derived tumor progression. The SMCs in primary culture under serum-stimulated conditions display phenotypic modulation from the differentiated to dedifferentiated state. During this process the expression of some cytoskeletal proteins is altered dramatically, and these alterations are regulated at mRNA levels. Such expressional changes of cytoskeletal proteins are used for favorable molecular markers indicating the SMC phenotype. Expression of α1 integrin in SMCs has been reported to be up-regulated during embryonic development (4Duband J.L. Belkin A.M. Syfrig J. Thiery J.P. Koteliansky V.E. Development. 1992; 116: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the expression of α1 integrin in association with an SMC phenotype and analyzed the transcriptional machinery of this gene using both differentiated and dedifferentiated phenotypes of SMCs.We first cloned the full-length cDNA encoding chicken α1 integrin and the genomic DNA carrying the 5′-upstream region of the α1 integrin gene. The NH2-terminal half (extracellular domain) corresponding to the I-domain and seven repeated domains, the transmembrane domain, and the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of chicken α1 integrin are highly homologous with those of rat (38Ignatius M.J. Large T.H. Houde M. Tawil J.W. Barton A. Esch F. Carbonetto S. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and human (39Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) α1 integrins, although homology is not evident among the sequences corresponding to signal peptides (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the domains involved in the function of α1 integrin are highly conserved among different species. The reliability of our cDNA clone was confirmed by immunoreactivity of the protein produced by forced expression of the cloned cDNA against the anti-chicken α1 integrin antibodies (Fig. 1 C).In situ hybridization revealed that the α1 integrin mRNA was expressed predominantly in vascular and visceral smooth muscles in late stages of chick embryo. It was clearly detected in 8-day-old embryo and thereafter increased gradually in proportion to the expression of h-CaD mRNA (Fig. 2). Such an expressional profile of the α1 integrin mRNA almost completely coincided with its protein level in developing embryos (4Duband J.L. Belkin A.M. Syfrig J. Thiery J.P. Koteliansky V.E. Development. 1992; 116: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the α1 integrin was down-regulated dramatically in cultured SMCs during serum-stimulated dedifferentiation (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the SMC phenotype-dependent expression of the α1 integrin gene is regulated transcriptionally and that α1 integrin is available as a molecular marker of SMC differentiation. In addition to SMCs, a low but a significant amount of α1 integrin mRNA was detected in the kidney (Fig. 2). Korhonenet al. (43Korhonen M. Ylanne J. Laitinen L. Virtanen I. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) also demonstrated the expression of α1 integrin protein in mesangial and endothelial cells in fetal and adult human kidney.The 5′-upstream sequences of the α1 integrin gene share structural similarities with other α integrin genes (Fig. 5 A); both TATA and CAAT boxes are absent, and consensus binding sites for AP1 and AP2 are present (23Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Painter A.S. Tsung Y.L. Gafford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 463-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rosen G.D. Birkenmeier T.M. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1187-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is still difficult to perform promoter analysis using differentiated vascular SMCs because no one has succeeded in preparing cultured vascular SMCs in a differentiated phenotype. We have established a primary culture system maintaining a differentiated phenotype of gizzard SMCs. Using our culture system, we analyzed the phenotype-dependent transcriptional regulation of the α1 integrin gene. The comparative analysis of a series of deleted α1 integrin promoter-CAT constructs revealed that the basal promoter activity of the gene was attributed to the region from +77 to +173 and that the 5′-upstream sequence (−516 to +281) produced sufficient transcriptional activity (more than 10-fold activity compared with the basal activity) in differentiated gizzard SMCs (Fig.6 B). However, the transcriptional activities of the same sequence in dedifferentiated gizzard and vascular SMCs were much lower than that in differentiated gizzard SMCs (Fig. 6 B). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the CArG box-like motif was important for the transcriptional activation in differentiated SMCs, whereas binding sites for AP1 or AP2 were not (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, mutagenesis on the CArG box-like motif did not affect the transcriptional activities in both dedifferentiated SMCs and CEFs. These findings indicate that the CArG box-like motif serves as a positive element only in a differentiated phenotype of SMCs (Fig.6 B). The CArG box is known to be involved in quite different facets of the transcriptional regulation. One is the serum response of immediate early genes, mediated by SRE that has been initially identified in the c-fos proto-oncogene promoter (42Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Another is the transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes such as the skeletal and cardiac α-actin genes (44Walsh K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Boxer L.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Kedes L. Mol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10823-10830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the CArG box in gene expression has been emerging not only in striated muscle cells but also in SMCs. Promoter analyses of the smooth muscle α-actin (17Blank R.S. McQuinn T.C. Yin K.C. Thompson M.M. Takeyasu K. Schwartz R.J. Owens G.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) genes have proven that the CArG box plays an essential role in SMC-specific transcription. The promoter region of the SM22α gene which directs tissue-specific expression in arterial SMCs in transgenic mice contains two CArG boxes (47Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 48Moessler H. Mericskay M. Li Z. Nagl S. Paulin D. Small J.V. Development. 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that SRF binds to the CArG boxes in the skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle α-actin promoters (18Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, Soulezet al. (49Soulez M. Tuil D. Kahn A. Gilgenkrantz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) directly showed that SRF is necessary for the CArG box-dependent transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes. We demonstrated by supershift assays using anti-SRF antibodies that SRF is involved in the specific complex formation between the α1 integrin CArG box-like motif and SMC nuclear factors (Fig. 8). This complex formation was intensive when nuclear extracts from differentiated gizzard or vascular SMCs were used, whereas only faint complex formation was observed using nuclear extracts from both dedifferentiated SMCs (Fig. 7). Taken together, we first clarified that the CArG box-like motif in the α1 integrin promoter is a core element for SRF binding and that its binding is essential for the phenotype-dependent transcriptional regulation in SMCs. There was little difference in SRF expression between differentiated and dedifferentiated gizzard SMCs, whereas the binding activity of SRF to the CArG box-like motif in differentiated SMCs was much higher than that in dedifferentiated SMCs. This suggests the possible involvement of additional factor(s) that modulates the SRF binding to the CArG box-like motif. The CArG boxes have been shown to be responsible for SMC-specific gene expression as described above. Indeed, the CArG box-like motif in the α1 integrin gene may be replaceable with the CArG box sequence from another gene because gel shift assays revealed that the SRF binding to it competed efficiently not only with c-fos SRE but also with the CArG box in the CaD gene (data not shown). Despite the consensus core sequences of the CArG boxes and the CArG box-like motifs, there was no sequential homology surrounding these core sequences among SMC-specific genes, suggesting that the surrounding sequences are not essential for SMC-specific expression. SRF is distributed widely in all types of muscle tissues and other non-muscle cells (50Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, SMC-specific transcriptional activation of the α1 integrin and other genes cannot be explained simply by SRF transactivation through its binding to the CArG box-like motif or the CArG box. Homeodomain proteins such as Phox/Mhox (51Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or Nkx-2.5 (52Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been known to enhance the binding activity of SRF to CArG box and the transcriptional activity mediated by its binding. Considering these evidences, SMC-specific homeodomain proteins might be a potent candidate responsible for SMC phenotype-dependent and/or SMC-specific transcriptional regulations.In summary, the present report is a first analysis of the α1 integrin promoter and has demonstrated that the interaction between the CArG box-like motif and SRF is essential for SMC phenotype-dependent transcriptional regulation. Further studies regarding a possible involvement of SMC-specific homeodomain proteins in the SMC-specific gene expression are necessary for elucidating the molecular mechanism of phenotypic modulation of SMCs. Integrins, heterodimeric transmembrane proteins, consist of an α and a β subunit and play a role in cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion as well as intracellular signal transduction (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion mediated by integrins is important for cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. There are at least 15 α and 8 β subunits, and their combinations generate various integrins that are distributed widely in a variety of cells. It has been generally accepted that the α subunit dictates ligand binding specificity and that the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit, which interacts directly with the cytoskeleton, is involved in signal transduction from the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasm. Among variations of the integrin family, α1β1 integrin is a receptor for both laminin (2Ignatius M.J. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1988; 1: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and collagens (3Kramer R.H. Marks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4684-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During quail embryogenesis, the expression of α1 integrin is curious; α1 integrin is expressed transiently in nervous tissues and skeletal and cardiac muscle cells of early embryos, whereas its expression is increased dramatically in smooth muscle tissues as development proceeds (4Duband J.L. Belkin A.M. Syfrig J. Thiery J.P. Koteliansky V.E. Development. 1992; 116: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar). At a late stage of embryogenesis and afterward, α1 integrin expression comes to be restricted in visceral and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC(s), smooth muscle cell(s); CaD, caldesmon; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA end; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kbp, kilobase pair(s); CEFs, chick embryo fibroblasts; SRF, serum response factor; bp, base pair(s); PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SRE, serum response element. 1The abbreviations used are: SMC(s), smooth muscle cell(s); CaD, caldesmon; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA end; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kbp, kilobase pair(s); CEFs, chick embryo fibroblasts; SRF, serum response factor; bp, base pair(s); PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SRE, serum response element. and microvascular endothelium, whereas it is absent from most epithelial tissues. The down-regulation of α1 integrin expression has been reported in cultured SMCs under serum-stimulated conditions (5Belkin V.M. Belkin A.M. Koteliansky V.E. J.

https://openalex.org/W2092921878,"Arrest of DNA replication in Escherichia coli is mediated by specific interactions between the Tus protein and terminator (Ter) sequences. Binding of Tus to aTer site forms a asymmetric protein-DNA complex that arrests DNA replication in an orientation-dependent fashion. In this study, mutant Ter sites carrying single base pair substitutions at 16 different positions were examined for their ability to bind purified Tus protein and arrest DNA replication.In vitro competition assays demonstrated that base pair substitutions at positions 8–19 had significant effects on the free energy of Tus binding (ΔΔG 0 of 1.5 to >4.0 kcal/mol). Concomitant with loss of binding affinity, mutations at these positions also showed significantly lower or undetectable replication arrest activities in vivo. Substitutions at positions 6, 20, and 21 had moderate effects on Tus-Terinteractions, suggesting that these base pairs contribute to, but are not absolutely critical for, Tus binding. Even though the effects on binding were minimal, these Ter mutants were not as efficient as wild type Tus-TerB complexes at arresting replication forks. Three new potential Ter sites, referred to as TerH, TerI, and TerJ, were identified by searching the E. coli genome for sequence similarity to a consensus Ter site sequence. Arrest of DNA replication in Escherichia coli is mediated by specific interactions between the Tus protein and terminator (Ter) sequences. Binding of Tus to aTer site forms a asymmetric protein-DNA complex that arrests DNA replication in an orientation-dependent fashion. In this study, mutant Ter sites carrying single base pair substitutions at 16 different positions were examined for their ability to bind purified Tus protein and arrest DNA replication.In vitro competition assays demonstrated that base pair substitutions at positions 8–19 had significant effects on the free energy of Tus binding (ΔΔG 0 of 1.5 to >4.0 kcal/mol). Concomitant with loss of binding affinity, mutations at these positions also showed significantly lower or undetectable replication arrest activities in vivo. Substitutions at positions 6, 20, and 21 had moderate effects on Tus-Terinteractions, suggesting that these base pairs contribute to, but are not absolutely critical for, Tus binding. Even though the effects on binding were minimal, these Ter mutants were not as efficient as wild type Tus-TerB complexes at arresting replication forks. Three new potential Ter sites, referred to as TerH, TerI, and TerJ, were identified by searching the E. coli genome for sequence similarity to a consensus Ter site sequence. The Tus protein of Escherichia coli binds to specific chromosomal sequences, called Ter sites, and arrests DNA replication in an orientation-dependent fashion (for review, see Ref. 1Hill T.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1602-1614Google Scholar). Replication forks approaching from the non-permissive side of the Tus-Ter complex are arrested, but replisomes approaching from the permissive side can pass through the complex. The Ter sites are oriented in the chromosome to permit DNA replication in the origin-to-terminus direction, but restrict replication forks traveling in the terminus-to-origin direction. Thus, the Tus-Ter complexes form a replication fork trap and prevent DNA replication forks from meeting in regions other than in the chromosomal terminus.The functional polarity demonstrated by Tus is reflected in the asymmetry of the protein-DNA complex, whose crystal structure has been recently solved (2Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto Morikawa K. Nature. 1996; 383: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Tus binds as a monomer (3Sista P.R. Hutchison C.A. Bastia D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contacts both strands of the Ter site on the nonpermissive of the complex, but only a single strand on the permissive side (2Kamada K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7434-7443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheTer site DNA is nestled into a cleft formed by the two primary domains of Tus (amino and carboxyl domains) and the interstrand β-sheets that connect the two domains (2Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto Morikawa K. Nature. 1996; 383: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The primary determinants of base pair recognition and binding are mediated by the main two interstrand β-sheets, which penetrate deeply into the major groove of the Ter site, making both polar and hydrophobic contacts with the bases. Binding is also enhanced by extensive contacts between Tus and the phosphates in the DNA backbone. A total of 42 amino acid residues stretched along the length of the protein make contacts with the DNA.Tus binds to the chromosomal Ter sites with a very high affinity. The K obs for Tus binding to theTerB site ranges between 3.4 × 10−13m and 7.5 × 10−13m, depending on the buffer conditions used (5Gottlieb P.A Wu S. Zhang X. Tecklenburg M. Kuempel P. Hill T.M. J.

Half-lives (t½) of the protein-DNA complex were determined to be 550 to 149 min, respectively, in these studies. The high affinity of the Tus-Ter interaction in conjunction with the distribution of protein-DNA contacts has been used to suggest that Tus can arrest DNA replication by functioning as a clamp on the DNA and preventing the unwinding activity of the DnaB helicase (2Kamada K.

Alternately, protein-protein interactions between Tus and the DnaB helicase have been postulated to mediate replication arrest. This latter model is based upon the specificity of Tus function (9Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20446-20455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ter sequences were originally identified as 22–23 base pairs in length, based on sequence identity betweenTerA, TerB, and TerC (13Hill T.M. Pelletier A.J. Tecklenburg M. Kuempel P.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Hidaka M. Akiyama M. Horiuchi T. Cell. 1988; 55: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As additional sites were identified both in the chromosome and in plasmid replicons, it became apparent that the essential conserved elements of the Ter site were an 11-base pair “core” sequence (positions 9–19) and an upstream G-C base pair at position 6 (Fig. 1). Nucleoside analogs have been used to partially map the determinants of Tus binding (15Duggan L.J. Hill T.M. Wu S. Garrison K. Zhang X. Gottlieb P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28049-28054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Duggan L.J. Asmann P. Hill T.M. Gottlieb P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15391-15396Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and it was shown that (i) the G residues at positions 10, 13, and 17 within the core sequence contributed both major and minor groove interactions, (ii) the conserved G residue at position 6 contributed little to the overall stability of the Tus-Ter complex, and (iii) hydrophobic interactions with thymine methyl groups occurred at positions 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, and 19.The solution of the co-crystal structure has identified specific interactions between Tus and the Ter site, but provides no information about the relative contribution of each contact to the free energy of binding. Likewise, the nucleotide analog studies can measure the energetic contributions of individual bases, but cannot determine the effect of natural base pair substitutions on binding. In addition, neither technique can address the role that specific protein-DNA interactions play in the ability of the Tus-Ter complex to arrest DNA replication. With this in mind, we undertook a systematic mutational analysis of the TerB site to determine which natural base pair substitutions affect Tus binding in vitroand what effect base pair substitutions have on replication arrest function in vivo.RESULTSSixteen different base pairs of the TerB site, between positions 6 and 21, were subjected to substitution analysis (Fig.1). It was possible to collect all three single base-substitutions at each position, except for positions 7 and 19, where only two substitutions were isolated. Therefore, a total of 46 single base pair-substituted Ter mutants were isolated and examined further using two different assays. An equilibrium competition assay was used to determine the binding affinity changes of Tus to the mutant Ter sites and a replication intermediate assay was performed to examine the ability of the mutant Tersequences to arrest DNA replication in vivo.Observed Equilibrium Dissociation Constants, (Kobs)The observed equilibrium dissociation constant (K obs) for each single base pair substitution was determined by measuring the ability of the mutant Tersites to compete with a 32P-labeled oligomeric wild-typeTerB site for Tus binding under equilibrium conditions. Because the competition assays utilized mutant Ter sites embedded in a plasmid, the possibility of nonspecific binding of Tus to the vector sequences of the plasmid was first estimated using the following equation (25Jen-Jacobson L. Lesser D.R. Kupiewski M.R. Nucleic Acids and Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 142-170Google Scholar), Kapp=KS+NNSKNSEquation 4 where K app is the observed equilibrium association constant, K S is the true equilibrium association constant, K KS is the equilibrium association constant for nonspecific DNA (previously determined to be in the range of 2.4 × 10−7m for Tus binding to a 33-base pair non-Teroligomer), 1F. F. Coskun-Ari and T. M. Hill, unpublished results. andN NS is the number of nonspecific binding sites in the plasmid (approximately 300 in pSPORT1). Based on this equation, we would expect nonspecific binding to become problematic when the binding equilibrium constant exceeds 1 × 10−9m.Nonspecific binding of Tus to DNA was then empirically measured in a competition assay by mixing increasing concentrations of pSPORT1 DNA (without a Ter site) with a fixed amount of labeledTerB DNA and determining the decrease in binding to the labeled DNA. Only at DNA concentrations higher than 1 × 10−9m was significant nonspecific binding of Tus to pSPORT1 observed (Fig. 2). Consequently, for all subsequent competition experiments, competitor DNA concentrations were kept in the range of 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−13m. Additionally, to determine if the plasmid contained any other sequences that might affect Tus-Ter binding (such as the presence of pseudosites), unlabeled TerB oligomer and plasmid DNA containing the TerB site were individually assayed in competition reactions. The K obs for oligomericTerB was found to be almost identical to theK obs of a TerB site embedded in plasmid DNA (8 × 10−13m and 8.6 × 10−13m, respectively), indicating a lack of pseudosites or other nonspecific interactions with the plasmid DNA.Figure 2Determination of nonspecific binding of Tus to plasmid pSPORT1. Labeled wild-type TerB oligomer at a concentration of 1 × 10−12m was added to the indicated concentrations of unlabeled pSPORT1 or TerBoligomer and allowed to equilibrate with Tus protein (2.1 × 10−12m) in KG200 binding buffer.

The magnitude of the free energy change obtained for substitutions in this region demonstrates that these positions are absolutely critical for Tus binding. A second class of important base pairs, where all substitutions resulted in aΔΔG 0 of 1.5–3 kcal/mol, are located at the front of the Tus-Ter complex and include positions 8, 9, and 11. The third class of substitutions were located at the edges of the complex and included the highly conserved GC base pair at position 6, as well as bases 7, 20, and 21. All substitutions but one in this third class imposed energetic penalties of less than 1.5 kcal.Examination of in Vivo Replication Arrest Ability of Mutant Ter SitesThe mutant Ter sites were also assayed in vivo to determine the effect base pair substitutions had on the ability of the altered Tus-Ter complexes to arrest DNA replication. For this purpose, an assay was used that identifies replication intermediates arising from arrested DNA replication. First, plasmids containing the mutant Ter sites (pS/Ter) were transformed into the tus + strain TH463, which also contains a compatible internal control plasmid, pACtet. Cells were grown to mid-log phase and whole cell DNA was isolated under conditions that leave replicative intermediates intact. The extracted DNA samples were then digested with EcoRV, which cuts pS/Ter between the origin and the Ter site, and subjected to electrophoresis. If DNA replication was not arrested at the mutant Ter site, only a linear pS/Ter DNA was produced by EcoRV digestion. However, if DNA replication was arrested at the mutant Ter site, the EcoRV digest produced a double Y structure which migrates slower on an agarose gel than the linear fragment. Therefore, the appearance of a slower-migrating band indicated that the mutant Ter site still retained in vivo replication arrest activity. Replication intermediate and linear bands were visualized by Southern blot analysis using labeled pSPORT1 and pACtet as probes (Fig.4).Figure 4Replication arrest activities of selected substitutions in vivo. Whole cell DNA was isolated under nondenaturing conditions and digested with EcoRV prior to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The Southern blot of the gel was then probed with 32P-labeled pSPORT1 and pACtet plasmids to visualize the pS/Ter and the internal control plasmid pACtet. The linear pS/Ter band is 4.0 kilobases in length; arrest of DNA replication produces two slower migrating bands (∼6.5 kilobase) containing a single or double Y-fork.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In a previous study using the replication intermediate assay to examine mutant Tus proteins (6Skokotas A. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. O'Donnell L. Hill T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30941-30948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), two factors were influenced by in vivo replication arrest activity. First, the ratio of the replication intermediate band to the linear band differed from one mutant to the other, depending on the efficiency of the Tus-Ter complex. Second, the total amount of plasmid DNA, which is related to the plasmid copy number, varied in each mutant as well. These factors were expected to vary in the replication intermediate assay because it was previously shown that the presence of a functional Ter site affected the copy number of pBR322-type plasmids (14Hidaka M. Akiyama M. Horiuchi T. Cell. 1988; 55: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Bierne H. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4165-4167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also affected the accumulation of replication intermediates relative to the amount of linear plasmid (26Bierne H. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4165-4167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine the efficiency of replication arrest in this previous study, the copy number of the plasmid and the ratio of replication intermediate to linear plasmid forms were considered when making quantitative comparisons between the mutant and wild-type Tus proteins.In this study, we also observed a general correlation between the efficiency of the Ter site and the plasmid copy number; however, we were unable to include this effect when quantitating the efficiency of replication arrest by the mutant Ter sites. This is because the correlation between the effectiveness of theTer sites and the copy number of the plasmids was not always consistent with the pSPORT1 vector. The most obvious inconsistency was observed when comparing the pSPORT1 vector without a Tersite and the same plasmid with the wild type TerB site: the copy number of the two plasmids were almost identical (1:1.3 ratio; Fig. 4). In previous studies (6Skokotas A. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. O'Donnell L. Hill T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30941-30948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Bierne H. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4165-4167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the copy of theTer-less plasmid was always significantly higher (twice as much) than the same plasmid with the TerB site. We also observed a significant increase in the plasmid copy number when a weakTer site was substituted for the TerB site. In several cases, such as substitutions at 12, 13, 14, and 15, the copy number of the Ter-containing plasmid was as much as four times higher than the copy number of the pSPORT1 alone (Fig.4). 2F. F. Coskun-Ari and T. M. Hill, unpublished data. At this point, we cannot explain these inconsistencies. Consequently, only the ratio of the Y-fork to linear band was used to quantitate Ter site efficiency in this study.We also noted two distinct replication intermediate bands in samples of functional Ter mutants and in the WT 3The abbreviation used is: WT, wild type. TerB. We speculate that the doublet replication intermediate bands are generated from head-to-tail pSPORT dimers, which were found in significant quantities in our plasmid preparations (data not shown). Dimeric plasmids can contain either one or two replication bubbles, depending upon whether initiation has occurred at one or both of the replication origins. Subsequent digestion of the dimeric plasmids withEcoRV would produce replication intermediates with either a single or double Y. These two DNA species would migrate differently in an agarose gel, presumably giving rise to the replication intermediate doublet. The appearance of doublet replication intermediate bands has been observed previously in studies of Tus mutants, in which plasmid pHV750T2+ was used to measure replication arrest function (6Skokotas A. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. O'Donnell L. Hill T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30941-30948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because the two bands in the doublet are believed to result from replication arrest, both bands were excised together when measuring the relative replication arrest activity of the substituted Tersites.A final observation regarding the in vivo assay was that the relative amounts of the two replication arrest bands varied in samples according to the strength of the Ter site (Fig. 4, position 6 mutants). In the WT TerB and the 6T·A mutant the banding pattern was the same: the slower-migrating band of the doublet, which was assumed to be the double Y form, was predominant over the faster-migrating band of the doublet, or the single Y-fork form. However, in the 6C·G mutant the single Y-fork form was found to be the most predominant band. Finally, in the 6A·T mutant sample the two Y-fork forms were present in equal amounts. The observation that the double Y was predominant in strong Ter sites and the single Y was predominant in weak Ter sites was consistent and reproducible, and seen with several other Ter mutants (positions 8, 9, and 18; Fig. 4). The reason for such a banding pattern is currently unknown.The efficiency of replication arrest in each of Ter mutant is presented in Table I. Base pair substitutions in the core region of the Ter site had the most significant effects on replication arrest activity and correlated with loss of DNA binding (Fig.5). In general,ΔΔG 0 values greater than 2.5 kcal completely abolished the ability of the Tus-Ter complex to halt DNA replication in vivo (Table I). Substitutions that resulted in low levels of replication arrest activity (from 20 to 1% of wild type levels) were typically associated withΔΔG 0 values of 1.7 to 2.5 kcal, with the notable exception of the 6C·G substitution, which had aΔΔG 0 value of only 0.35 kcal. Intermediate levels of replication arrest activity (80–20%) also showed a strong correlation with loss of binding activity, withΔΔG 0 values ranging from about 1 to 1.75. Again, notable deviations occurred with position 6 substitutions (A·T and T·A), and with the 20T·A substitution, all of which resulted inΔΔG 0 values of less than 1.Figure 5Correlation between loss of DNA binding and replication arrest activity. The ΔΔG 0value and replication arrest activity of base pair substitutions resulting in ΔΔG 0 values of less than 3.0 kcal/mol were plotted and a least squares analysis was used to fit a line to the data points (n = 16, r = 0.94). The dashed lines show one standard deviation from the calculated line. The values for 6A·T, 6C·G, 6T·A, and 20T·A, which were not included in the linear regression calculation, are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONA systematic mutational analysis of the E. coli Tersequence was undertaken to investigate the contribution of individual base pairs to the binding and function of the Tus protein. Substitutions were made at positions 6–21, which were identified previously as highly conserved bases associated with Tus binding (13Hill T.M. Pelletier A.J. Tecklenburg M. Kuempel P.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,14Hidaka M. Akiyama M. Horiuchi T. Cell. 1988; 55: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is now known that position 5 is also contacted by Tus, through residue 198 (2Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto Morikawa K. Nature. 1996; 383: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, this information was unavailable to us at the time this project was initiated and substitutions at this position were not investigated.Effects of Substitutions at Positions 6 and 7The G·C base pair at position 6 is conserved in all known Ter sites, however, the results reported here and in studies with nucleoside analogs (15Duggan L.J. Hill T.M. Wu S. Garrison K. Zhang X. Gottlieb P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28049-28054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggest that this position contributes little to the stability of the Tus-Ter complex. The minimal change associated with the free energy of binding (ΔΔG 0 values of less than 1) may indicate that the Arg198 residue of Tus, which normally contacts the N-3 atom of G6 and the N-3 atom of A5 (Fig.6), remains anchored to position 5 when substitutions are made at position 6. Alternately, contact between Arg198 and the DNA could be completely lost when substitutions are made at position 6. In either scenario, it is possible that the position 6 substitutions do not have significant effects on Tus binding because the primary contacts for binding of this domain of Tus are made by other amino acids in the L3 loop and αVII domain (Ser193, Val200, and Trp208) with the phosphate group and deoxyribose moieties around base pair 6. With this in mind, it is of some interest to note that thetus gene of Salmonella has an alanine substituted for arginine at position 198, whereas the residues at positions 193, 200, and 208 are identical. 4A. Nilles and T. Hill, unpublished results. Figure 6Contacts between Tus andTer. Adapted from Kamada et al. (2Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto Morikawa K.

Replication arrest activities of the mutants were found to be significantly reduced (Fig. 4), with the C·G substitution showing the greatest effect (7% of the efficiency of the WT TerB). Furthermore, these substitutions showed the greatest deviance from the correlation between loss of DNA binding and loss of replication arrest activity (Fig. 5).In contrast to position 6, position 7 is not well conserved inTer sites (Fig. 7) and no amino acid residues of Tus contact this base pair (2Kamada K.

This ligand displayed a high affinity for the receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes, and specifically labeled two protein bands with apparent molecular mass at 85–90 and 46 kDa. Our results clearly show that the V1a receptor is degraded during incubation with the ligand and that the 46-kDa species is probably the result of the 85–90-kDa species proteolytic cleavage. Truncation of the receptor was then confirmed by deglycosylation withN-glycosidase F. A monoclonal antibody directed against a c-Myc epitope added at the receptor NH2 terminus allowed immunoprecipitation of the 85–90-kDa photolabeled species. The 46-kDa photolabeled protein never immunoprecipitated, indicating that the truncated form of the receptor lacks the NH2 terminus region. To localize photolabeled domains of the receptor, the 46-kDa protein was cleaved with V8 and/or Lys-C endoproteinases. The identity of the smallest photolabeled fragment, observed at approximately 6 kDa, was then confirmed by mutation of the potential V8 cleavage sites. Our results indicate that covalent labeling of the vasopressin V1a receptor with the photoreactive antagonist occurs in a region including transmembrane domain VII (residues Asn327-Lys370).

Neurohypophysial hormones, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine vasopressin; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane regions; 3-N3-Phpa-LVA, 3-(N3)phenylpropionyl-d-Tyr(Me)2-Phe3-Gln4-Asn5-Arg6-Pro7-Arg8-Tyr9-NH2; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2hydroxy-1,1-bis-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and oxytocin, exert a wide range of physiological effects through binding to specific membrane receptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. To date, three AVP receptor subtypes and one oxytocin receptor have been pharmacologically and functionally described (1Jard S. Elands J. Schmidt A. Barberis C. Imura H. Shizume K. Progress in Endocrinology. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988: 1183-1189Google Scholar). V1a, V1b, and oxytocin receptors activate phospholipase C, resulting in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C. V2 receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the accumulation of cyclic AMP and activation of protein kinase A. All receptor subtypes from several mammalian species have been recently cloned (2Birnbaumer M. Seibold A. Gilbert S. Ishido M. Barberis C. Antaramian A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W.

Analysis of the primary sequence of these receptors suggests that they possess the same general architecture with seven transmembrane helices as other well characterized G protein-coupled receptors. Moreover, the comparison of their amino acid sequence reveals significant homology within the putative transmembrane regions (TM) and within the first and second extracellular loops as well. The natural ligands for the receptors of the AVP/oxytocin family are also closely structurally related. All are nonapeptides composed of a 6-amino acid disulfide-linked ring and a COOH terminus tripeptide. Peptides of the AVP/oxytocin series were subjected to an extensive analysis of structure-activity relationships. These studies (for review, see Refs. 8Berde B. Boissonnas R.A. Berde B.

Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 119-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led to the production of a profusion of valuable pharmacological probes for assessing receptor selectivity and activity but failed to provide relevant information on the organization of the receptor-binding sites. Recently, we have tentatively localized and mapped the binding site of vasopressin on the V1a receptor subtype by combining three-dimensional molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis approaches (12Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the larger part of the vasopressin molecule is anchored within the transmembrane portion of the receptor in a position equivalent to that described for the cationic neurotransmitters. Since all amino acids in the receptor and hormone, potentially interacting in hormone binding, are conserved in the different members of the receptor family and natural neurohypophysial peptides, we proposed that the binding pocket identified in the V1a might be common to V2, V1b, and oxytocin subtypes (12Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In this model, only the side chain of vasopressin Arg8 residue is projecting outside the transmembrane core of the receptor in a direction allowing interaction with Tyr115 in the first extracellular loop. The position of the Arg8 side chain and its role in determining part of the receptor selectivity have been experimentally confirmed. Indeed, when Tyr115 was replaced by an Asp or a Phe, the amino acids naturally occurring in the V2 and the oxytocin receptor subtypes, respectively, the agonist selectivity of the V1a receptor switched accordingly (13Chini B. Mouillac B. Ala Y. Balestre M.N. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M. Manning M. Jard S. Barberis C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2176-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A more direct proof of the involvement of the first extracellular loop in peptide hormone residue 8 binding has also been provided for the bovine renal V2 vasopressin receptor by a photoaffinity labeling study with a modified vasopressin agonist (14Kojro E. Eich P. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13537-13544Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and was then confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (15Ufer E. Postina R. Gorbulev V. Fahrenholz F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). So far all point mutations affecting agonist binding to V1a receptors were found to have no or far less pronounced effect on antagonist binding, suggesting that agonist and antagonist-binding sites might be structurally distinct (12Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To further investigate structure-function relationships of AVP receptors, the aim of the present study was to localize the peptide antagonist-binding domains of the human V1a vasopressin receptor using a radiolabeled photoactivatable antagonist. Direct identification of the ligand-binding domains of membrane GPCR by the way of biochemical studies is still poorly investigated and is limited by the receptor scarcity, hydrophobicity, and fragility. However, as shown above, the photoaffinity labeling technique is an essential complement to modeling and mutagenesis approaches and allows direct determination of the contact regions of a receptor and its ligands. To date, several classes of specific V1a antagonists have been characterized, such as cyclic and linear peptides, as well as nonpeptides (10Manning M. Sawyer W.H. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 195-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Serradeil-Legal C. Wagnon J. Garcia C. Lacour C. Guiraudou P. Christophe B. Villanova G. Nisato D. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Guillon G. Cantau B. Barberis C. Trueba M. Ala Y. Jard S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Moreover, vasopressin antagonists with photoactivatable groups at positions 3, 4, 8, or 9 have also been developed (17Boer R. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15051-15054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Barbeau D. Guay S. Neugebauer W. Escher E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to photolabel the V1a receptor. The yield of the covalent binding of these antagonists was usually very low (reviewed in Ref. 18Barbeau D. Guay S. Neugebauer W. Escher E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Studies have been directed in our laboratory to the design of more promising candidates (19Carnazzi E. Aumelas A. Barberis C. Guillon G. Seyer R. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1841-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), all based on the structure of a previously reported potent and selective linear peptide antagonist, phenylacetyl-d-Tyr(Me)2-Phe3-Gln4-Asn5-Arg6-Pro7-Arg8-Tyr9NH2(20Schmidt A. Audigier S. Barberis C. Jard S. Manning M. Kolodziejczyk A.S. Sawyer W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taking into account results indicating that hydrophobic bulky desamino groups in position 1 can increase the affinity of the antagonist for the V1a receptor (21Manning M. Klis W.A. Kruszinski M.

Chan W.Y. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that a photoactivatable group at positions 3, 4, 8, or 9 usually give very low covalent yields, peptide antagonists containing an azido group at position 1 were synthesized. This work has led to the characterization of several iodinated photosensitive antagonists with high-affinity and high-selectivity for V1a receptors. One of these ligands, 3-(N3)phenylpropionyl-d-Tyr(Me)2-Phe3-Gln4-Asn5-Arg6-Pro7-Arg8-Tyr9-NH2(3-N3-Phpa-LVA) was radioiodinated and used in the present study. Here, we describe for the first time the photolabeling of the human V1a vasopressin receptor expressed in CHO cells. Moreover, combining photolabeling and proteolytic fragmentation of the receptor with several endoproteinases, a restricted antagonist-binding domain of the receptor has been identified. The human V1a receptor cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. M. Thibonnier (23Thibonnier M. Auzan C. Madhun Z. Wilkins P. Berti-Mattera L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A stretch of nucleotides coding for a 10-amino acid epitope (EQKLISEEDL) of the human c-Myc protein (24Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) was inserted after the initiating Met codon of the human V1a vasopressin receptor cDNA using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The phosphorothioate technique was used to select the mutant cDNA (Amersham Sculptor Kit). The presence of the sequence coding for the epitope was verified by direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Pharmacia T7 Sequencing Kit). The wild-type and epitope-tagged receptor cDNAs were then subcloned into an eukaryotic expression vector (pCMV) (25Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A. Lentz R. Raab H. Kohr W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1990; 61: 361-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected either with wild-type or epitope-tagged receptor cDNA using DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniun methylsulfate) and according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Stable cell lines were selected by their resistance to neomycine sulfate (geneticin G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) used at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. Clones were then screened for V1a receptor expression by radioligand binding assays using [125I]HO-LVA (26Barberis C. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Tribollet E. Arsenijevic Y. Dreifuss J.J. Bankowski K. Manning M. Chan W.Y. Schlosser S.S. Holsboer F. Elands J. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture in Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 500 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 400 μg/ml geneticin in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Depending on the experiment to be conducted, cells were treated overnight with 5 mm sodium butyrate to increase receptor expression (27Kassis S. Henneberry R.C. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4910-4916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Park C. Chamberlin M.E. Pan C.J. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9807-9814Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The pharmacological properties of the receptor were not modified by this treatment (data not shown). Membrane preparations and radioligand binding assays were performed as already described (12Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were harvested, washed two times in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Polytron-homogenized in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA), and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed in a Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2) and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membranes were suspended in a small volume of Buffer A and protein contents were determined. Aliquots of membranes were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Binding assays were performed at 30 °C using [125I]HO-LVA as the radioligand and 1–3 μg of membrane proteins. Affinities for [125I]HO-LVA were determined in saturation binding using concentrations ranging from 10 to 600 pm. Affinities for other ligands were determined from competition experiments using 50–70 pm[125I]HO-LVA as the radioligand. The concentrations of the unlabeled ligands varied from 1 pm to 100 μm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 200 nm HO-LVA. The ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using the computer program LIGAND (29Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate accumulation was determined as described (30Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 206: 587-595Crossref Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells expressing V1a receptors were plated and grown in 6-well dishes for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's supplemented medium and then labeled for 24 h with myo-[2-3H]inositol (10–20 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) at a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml in serum-free, inositol-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed twice with PBS, equilibrated at 37 °C in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated in PBS supplemented with 10 mmLiCl for 10 min. CHO cells were stimulated for 15 min with increasing concentrations of AVP (from 10−11 to 10−5m). After stopping the reaction with perchloric acid, total inositol phosphates were extracted and purified by anion-exchange chromatography column (Dowex AG 1-×8, formate form, 200–400 mesh; Bio-Rad). For each sample, a fraction containing total insoitol phosphates was collected and counted. The photoactivatable peptide was radioiodinated at position 9 on the phenyl moiety of the tyrosyl residue as described before (19Carnazzi E. Aumelas A. Barberis C. Guillon G. Seyer R. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1841-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and purified on a high performance liquid chromatography column (Waters C18 μBondapak) by two subsequent runs. The specific radioactivity of the labeled antagonist was 2,200 Ci/mmol. Usually, membranes (500 μg) were resuspended in 4 ml of binding Buffer A containing bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml). They were incubated in the dark in the presence of [125I]3-N3-Phpa-LVA (final concentration 1.5 nm) with or without 0.1 mm ZnCl2and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, 5 μg/ml; benzamidine, 10 μg/ml; and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml) and with or without vasopressin (10 μm) to define specific labeling. Several conditions were explored by varying the temperature and duration of incubation in the presence of [125I]3-N3-Phpa-LVA. Membranes were separated from unbound ligand by two subsequent centrifugations (20 min, 44,000 × g, 4 °C) and washed with Buffer A without bovine serum albumin. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A and irradiated with ultraviolet light (254 nm) for 5 min on ice. After photolysis, membranes were washed twice (1 ml of Buffer A) and finally resuspended in Laemmli buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 1-mm thickness 12% gels. Gels were fixed in glacial acetic acid:methanol:dimethyl sulfoxide:water (16:40:2:42), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C. To evaluate the yield of covalent binding, dried gels were also cut into slices and radioactivity contents in the slices determined. Immunoprecipitation of receptors was performed as described previously (32Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After photolysis, membranes were solubilized in 500 μl of Buffer B (NaCl, 100 mm; Tris-HCl, 10 mm, pH 7.4; EDTA, 5 mm; digitonin 2%; and protease inhibitors) for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged (20 min, 44,000 × g, 4 °C) and the supernatant containing photolabeled and solubilized receptors was washed and concentrated in supplemented PBS (EDTA, 5 mm, and protease inhibitors) using Centriplus-30 and Centricon-30 cartridges (Amicon). To immunoprecipitate c-Myc-V1a vasopressin receptors, samples (500 μl) were incubated 2 h on ice with monoclonal antibody 9E10 (dilution 1:20 of ascites fluid). An anti-mouse IgG second antibody coupled to agarose beads (250 μl) was added and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in supplemented PBS and dissociated in Laemmli sample buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by sonication for 10 s. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% slab gels. The fixed gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films at −80 °C. Photolabeled membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% gels. After electrophoresis, the labeled bands were excised from the preparative gel and human V1a vasopressin receptors were electroeluted with electroeluter model 422 (Bio-Rad) in Tris glycine running buffer (25 mm Tris, 182 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 0.1% SDS). Samples containing “partially” purified V1a receptors were washed and concentrated using Microcon-30 (Amicon). Deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F and/or protease digestions were performed on these concentrated samples. The photolabeled CHO membranes or the partially purified photolabeled V1a vasopressin receptors were resuspended in deglycosylation buffer (100 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% SDS) and digested with 2 units of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 days at 37 °C. Deglycosylated receptors were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels. The electroeluted receptors were subjected to digestion with Lys-C or V8 proteases. Double digestions were also performed (first digestion with Lys-C followed by a second one with V8). In some cases, deglycosylated receptors were also digested with Lys-C or V8 endoprotease. Endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim) was used at 0.2 μg/assay (50 μl). The digestion was performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 16–24 h. V8 protease (endoproteinase Glu-C, Boehringer Mannheim) was used at 40 μg/assay (50 μl) and digestion was realized in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 2 days. To perform double fragmentations, the Lys-C digestion was followed by sample washing and concentration using Microcon-3 (Amicon). Then, concentrated samples were diluted in V8 enzyme buffer and subjected to the second digestion. Results of protease digestions were analyzed by a Tricine discontinuous SDS-PAGE system (10–16.5% gels), which is better for the separation of small molecular mass species (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Gels were then fixed in glacial acetic acid:methanol:dimethyl sulfoxide:water (10:50:2:38), dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films at −80 °C. Point mutations (W304A, F307V, and F308L also named W613A, F616V, and F617L according to the modeling numbering (32Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were introduced in the VI transmembrane region of the vasopressin receptor using the cDNA template and the phosphorothioate technique described above (Amersham Sculptor Kit). The mutations were verified by direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The mutant receptors were then subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells by electroporation as described previously (32Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamate residues Glu324–Glu326 and Glu371–Glu376, corresponding to potential V8 cleavage sites, were substituted by aspartate residues using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Both mutations were directly done on the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV and again verified by sequencing. These two mutants (Asp324–Asp326V1a and Asp371–Asp376V1a) were transiently expressed in CHO cells with the same protocol developed for COS-7 cells. In all cases, membrane preparations and radioligand binding assays were conducted as described above. For receptors mutated at potential V8 cleavage sites, photolabeling and fragmentation experiments were also performed. The three-dimensional model of the human V1a vasopressin receptor was constructed using the procedure already extensively described in a previous paper (12Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) for the rat V1a vasopressin receptor. In a final step, the model was energy minimized with the “Amber All Atom” parameter set installed in SYBYL 6.2 (TRIPOS Associates Inc.) to relax the structure and remove bad steric contacts. The primary sequence of the human V1a vasopressin receptor, deduced from its cDNA cloning, and its possible transmembrane arrangement are shown on Fig. 1. The wild-type V1a vasopressin receptor was stably transfected in hamster CHO cells and its pharmacological properties determined using [125I]HO-LVA, a highly selective V1a receptor subtype antagonist (26Barberis C. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Tribollet E. Arsenijevic Y. Dreifuss J.J. Bankowski K. Manning M. Chan W.Y. Schlosser S.S. Holsboer F. Elands J. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as the radioligand. The affinity of the V1a receptor for this radiolabeled ligand was directly determined by saturation binding experiments (see Table I). AK d value of 38 ± 7 pm(n = 3) was associated with a maximum binding capacity reaching 5–7 pmol of receptors/mg of membrane proteins (increased to 15–17 pmol when cells were treated with sodium butyrate). The affinities of 5 agonists (AVP, oxytocin, Thr4Gly7OT, dDAVP, and Phe2Orn8VT) and 3 specific antagonists for the V1a subtype (cyclic, linear, and non-peptide) were deduced from competition binding experiments. The results obtained are reported in Table I. The observed high affinities for AVP, for the V1a agonist Phe2Orn8VT, and the three V1a selective antagonists together with the observed low affinities for oxytocin, for the oxytocin selective agonist Thr4Gly7OT, and the V2 selective agonist dDAVP, clearly indicate that the receptor expressed in CHO cells has the expected pharmacological profile of the human V1a receptor (23Thibonnier M. Auzan C. Madhun Z. Wilkins P. Berti-Mattera L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expressed receptor is functionally coupled to phospholipase C. Stimulation of transfected CHO cells by vasopressin induced a maximum 6–8-fold increase in inositol phosphate accumulation with an apparent K actvalue close to the measured K d value for vasopressin binding (see Table I). The linear photoactivatable antagonist used in this study to map peptide-binding domains of the human V1a receptor ([125I]3-N3-Phpa-LVA) binds with high affinity to membranes from transfected CHO cells. AK d value of 137 ± 37 pm(n = 3) was obtained, a value which is close to that reported for the rat liver plasma membrane receptor (54 ± 20 pm (19Carnazzi E. Aumelas A. Barberis C. Guillon G. Seyer R.

Cellular responsiveness to retinoic acid depends on its interaction with two distinct classes of receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoic X receptors (RXRs). Both receptor classes have three different subtypes (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ and RXRα, RARβ, and RARγ) that act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. To examine the involvement of the different receptor classes and subtypes in the biological responses of neuroblastoma cells to retinoids, we analyzed the effects of a panel of receptor-selective retinoids on cell growth, differentiation, and gene expression on in vitro cultured KCNR cells. Any association of per se inactive RXR-selective with RAR-selective ligands efficiently regulates growth inhibition, differentiation (neurite extension), and expression of RARβ, TrkB, and N-myc. SR11383 alone, a very potent retinoid, entirely reproduces the pattern of biological responses induced by naturally occurring retinoids. In contrast to other tumor cell lines, the growth of neuroblastoma cell lines is not altered using AP1-antagonistic retinoids. These studies raise the possibility that three distinct RXR/RAR heterodimers mediate the effects of retinoids on neuroblastoma cells through an AP-1 antagonism-independent mechanism.

Neuroblastoma (NB) 1The abbreviations used are: NB, neuroblastoma; RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; ATRA, all-trans retinoic acid; 9CRA, 9-cis retinoic acid; RARE, RA-responsive element; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. is the most common solid tumor of childhood, and it is thought to arise from an anomalous arrest in the differentiation of multipotent embryonal cells of the neural crest into normal adrenal medulla and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (1Albemayor E. Sidell N. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 80: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Despite its aggressive evolution when diagnosed after infancy, NB tumors have a high rate of spontaneous regression, due mostly to their maturation into benign ganglioneuroma (2Bolande R.P. Surv. Synth. Path. Res. 1985; 4: 296-311PubMed Google Scholar). Several agents induce differentiation of NB cellsin vitro (1Albemayor E. Sidell N. Environ.

Among them retinoic acid (RA) appears to be quite potent, and its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent is now being evaluated in clinical trials. At the transcriptional level, the effects of retinoids are mediated by two classes of ligand-dependent transcriptional activators: the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoic X receptors (RXRs), which are members of the nonsteroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (4Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Both receptor classes have three different subtypes (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ and RXRα, RARβ and RARγ) encoded by different genes, each of which can give rise to different isoforms (4Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar,5Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring retinoids, like all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA) have different affinities for these receptor classes. ATRA only binds to RARs, whereas 9CRA binds to both RARs and RXRs (6Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A.

Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). However, ATRA can activate RXRs presumably through its isomerization to 9CRA, which is known to occur in living cells (9Heyman R.A. Magelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated receptors undergo conformational changes (10Renaud J.P. Roche N. Ruff M. Vivat V.

Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4137-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This leads to selective transcriptional activation of specific target genes. Retinoid receptors may also regulate gene expression by functionally interacting with other transcription factors, i.e. AP-1 (13Salbert G. Fanjul A. Piedrafita F.J. Lu X.P. Kim S.J. Tran P. Pfahl M.

Although RXR/RXR homodimers can efficiently activate transcription of certain promoters (18Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), several studies have demonstrated that the RXR/RAR heterodimer is the transactivator responsible for transducing the signal in response to retinoids (19Kliewer S.A.

Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). RXRs also interact with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family like thyroid hormone receptors, the vitamin D3 receptor, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and several orphan receptors (23Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). A certain degree of functional redundancy among the various RXR/RAR heterodimers in the activation of complex genetic programs by retinoids is suggested by the absence of gross morphological alterations observed in single-receptor knockout mice (4Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 5Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and the analysis of RARs-null F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (24Taneja R. Bouillet P. Boylan J.F. Gaub M.-P. Roy B. Gudas L.J. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7854-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the distinct pattern of expression of the different RARs and RXRs in both developing and adult organisms suggests their involvement in at least partially distinct physiological functions (25Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ruberte E. Dolle P. Chambon P. Morriss-Kay G. Development. 1991; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RARα is ubiquitously expressed both during development and in adult tissues (25Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ruberte E. Dolle P. Chambon P. Morriss-Kay G. Development. 1991; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RARβ is apparently more involved in the differentiation of certain epithelia and in the ontogenesis of the nervous system (25Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ruberte E. Dolle P. Chambon P. Morriss-Kay G. Development. 1991; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential expression of RARγ in several developing mesenchymes and the subsequent restriction of its expression to cartilage and squamous keratinizing epithelia (25Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ruberte E. Friederich V. Chambon P. Morriss-Kay G. Development. 1993; 118: 267-282PubMed Google Scholar) indicates its prominent role in morphogenesis, condrogenesis, and epithelial cell differentiation. In defined cell culture systems, the RAR principally involved in the activation of complex biological responses to retinoids appears to be different. RARγ is the predominant class of receptor expressed in F9 cells, where it is necessary at least for the induction of differentiation by retinoids (28Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RARα, but not RARβ, can fully substitute for RARγ when overexpressed in RARγ null cells (24Taneja R. Bouillet P. Boylan J.F. Gaub M.-P. Roy B. Gudas L.J. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7854-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.-L.

RARα is the predominant subtype in P19 cells (29Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.-L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and it also seems to play a major role in the control of growth and differentiation of leukemia cells (30Brooks S.C.R. Kazmer S. Levin A.A. Yen A. Blood. 1996; 87: 227-237PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chen J.-Y. Clifford J. Zusi C. Starrett J. Tortolani D. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Upon treatment with RA, several in vitro cultured NB cell lines undergo growth inhibition and a morphological differentiation that is characterized by the extension of neurites. These phenomena are associated with and perhaps dependent on the regulated expression of several genes. In particular, the inhibition of N-mycexpression (33Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 34Peverali F.A. Orioli D. Tonon L. Ciana P. Bunone G. Negri M. Della-Valle G.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and the induction of RARβ (38Cheung B. Hocker J.E. Smith S.A. Reichert U. Norris M.D. Haber M. Stewart B.W.

Seeger R.C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1991; 366: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar) are thought to play a fundamental role in the induction of both morphological changes and growth inhibition by retinoids. Although the effects of retinoids on NB have long been known, very little information is available on the relative contribution of the specific RAR and RXR classes and subtypes. We have addressed this question by analyzing the effects of a panel of receptor-selective retinoids on the biology of KCNR NB cells. We show here that treatment with any association of an RAR-selective ligand and an RXR-selective ligand induced inhibition of cell growth, differentiation, and regulated gene expression in KCNR cells. Therefore we suggest that, in combination with RXRα, the three different subtypes of RAR contribute to NB cell responses to retinoids. Growth inhibition in particular is mediated by a mechanism independent of AP-1 antagonism. SR11383, an exceptionally potent retinoid, completely reproduced the pattern of biological responses to ATRA. Moreover, in combination with an RXRα-selective ligand, it induced growth inhibition and differentiation of NB cells more efficiently than ATRA and 9CRA. The SMS-KCNR (KCNR) cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For stimulation experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 140 cells/mm2 in medium containing charcoal-stripped FBS. After 24 h, cells were treated with the different retinoids dissolved in Me2SO or Me2SO alone as a solvent control. After 4 days, representative fields from each dish were photographed with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope to record morphological differentiation. For [3H]thymidine incorporation experiments, KCNR cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in medium containing charcoal-stripped FBS. After 24 h, the appropriate analogs or solvent control were added to quadruplicate wells, and the plates were incubated for 4 days under standard conditions. 16–20 h before harvest, cells were labeled with 1 μCi/well [3H]Thy (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were harvested using an Inotech harvester (Inotech, Lansing, MI) and counted in a 2500 TR Packard liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instruments Co.). For cell cycle analysis, appropriately treated cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, treated with RNase (0.5 mg/ml), and stained with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry in a linear scale using a FACscan cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Fluorescence data were analyzed by the CELL Quest software (Becton Dickinson). The selectivity of the different retinoids was studied in transfection experiments as described previously (22Zhang X.K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Briefly, CV-1 cells were cotransfected with the (TREpal)2-tk-CAT construct and each of the retinoid receptor expression vectors. After treatment with the different retinoids, CAT activity was analyzed. Following treatment, cells were detached from the dish by mild trypsin digestion, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for RNA extraction with the RNAeasy kit (Quiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon Gene Screen Plus hybridization membranes (DuPont) by overnight blotting. Blots were hybridized overnight with 3 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probes/ml. DNA probes were labeled by random priming to an efficiency of 0.5–1 × 109 cpm/μg. Filters were washed in a solution containing 0.3 m sodium chloride, 0.03 m sodium citrate dehydrate, and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C and autoradiographed at −70 °C with intensifying screens. DNase-treated total RNA (0.5 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription reaction using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit according to he manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 20 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. An aliquot (2 μl) of the reverse transcription reaction was subjected to 30 PCR cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 68 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) in 1 × PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 50 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Specific primers (PR1, 5′-TTCTCTGCCTGGCCTGTTTG-3′; PR2, 5′-TCACGCTAGTTCTTGCCACG-3′) were used to amplify a 154-base pair fragment from nucleotide 1554 to 1707 of the human RXRα sequence (40Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). In the same PCR reaction, the ribosomal protein S12 cDNA was amplified as an internal control by means of specific primers (A, 5′-GGAAGGCATTGCTGCTGG-3′; B, 5′-CTTCAATGACATCCTTGG-3′). To study which of the RAR subtypes contribute to the response of KCNR NB cells to retinoids, we first sought to analyze the expression of RARα, RARβ, and RARγ by Northern blot in control and ATRA- or 9CRA-treated cells. A readily detectable level of the 3.9- and 2.9-kilobase RARα transcripts and the 3.5- and 3.2-kilobase RARγ transcripts were constitutively expressed in KCNR cells (Fig.1 A). The 3.4- and 3.0-kilobase RARβ mRNAs were detected only after prolonged exposure of the same blot (not shown). Both ATRA and 9CRA induced a 2–3-fold increase in the steady state level of RARα and RARγ mRNAs, whereas RARβ mRNA was induced >30-fold compared with solvent-treated cells. RXRα mRNA expression was below the level of detection of our Northern blot analysis. Therefore RT-PCR was used to analyze its expression in KCNR cells (Fig. 1 B). We observed no major change in its expression after treatment of cells with either ATRA or 9CRA by an ordinary (Fig. 1 B) or semiquantitative (not shown) RT-PCR. KCNR cells maintained in a medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum grow in aggregated clumps of slightly fused or rounded cells, extending very rare and short neurites (Fig. 2 A). Exposure to either ATRA or 9CRA (10−6m) induces morphological changes starting with cell flattening and disaggregation and culminating with the extension of neurites exceeding at least twice the length of the cell soma. Extension of neurites occurs in most of the cell population after 4 days of treatment (Fig. 2 B), and >90% of the cells extend neurites by 7–8 days (not shown). To determine which of the retinoid receptor classes and subtypes are involved in transducing the signal(s) leading to such a morphological response to ATRA or 9CRA, various retinoid analogs were tested on KCNR cells in doses ranging from 10−10 to 5 × 10−6m. The selectivity of these SRI retinoids was previously established on the (TREpal)2 RARE, and the results are summarized in Table I. Am580 is a RARα-selective ligand extensively characterized (30Brooks S.C.R. Kazmer S. Levin A.A. Yen A. Blood. 1996; 87: 227-237PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gianni M. Li Calzi M. Terao M. Guiso G.

Rev. 1996; 28: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with SR11383 entirely reproduced the pattern of events observed after treatment with ATRA or 9CRA. In particular, cell flattening and disaggregation were observed after 4 days of treatment at as low as 10−8m (not shown), a concentration at which this ligand selectively activates the (TREpal)2 through RARβ (Table I). The extension of relatively long neurites on the majority of the cells was also readily detectable at 10−8m (not shown), and the maximum, at 10−7m (Fig. 2 C). However, at the latter concentration, SR11383 showed 58% of the activity of ATRA on the (TREpal)2 through RARβ and 31% through RARα (Table I). Similar morphological changes were also observed upon treatment of the cells with 10−8m (not shown) or 10−7m Am580 (Fig. 2 D), which at this concentration predominantly activated the (TREpal)2 through RARα (30Brooks S.C.R.

In contrast, SR11254 only induced cell flattening without a marked effect on cell spreading and neurite extension even at a concentration as high as 10−6m (Fig. 2 G). At this concentration SR11254 showed 84% of the activity of ATRA on the (TREpal)2 through RARγ and 46% through RARβ (Table I). No morphological changes were observed in response to the RXR-selective ligands SR11246 (Fig. 2 I) and SR11234 (not shown) at similar concentrations. However, both SR11246 (Fig. 2, E,F, and H) and SR11234 (not shown) increased the morphologic response to Am580 (Fig. 2 E), SR11383 (Fig.2 F), and SR11254 (Fig. 2 H), suggesting that ligand-induced activation of RXR cooperates with liganded RARα, RARβ, and RARγ to induce morphological differentiation in KCNR NB cells.Table IReceptor selectivity of the different retinoids on the (TREpal) 2RetinoidsRARαRARβRARγRXRαlogm1-aFor each concentration (log m) of the retinoid being used, results are expressed as percent activation compared with activation by 1 μm ATRA as 100% for the RARs and 1 μm 9CRA as 100% for RXRα.AC501-bAC50 indicates the concentration of each retinoid required to give 50% of the response of 1 μm ATRA for the RARs and 1 μm 9CRA for RXRα.logmAC50logmAC50logmAC50−9−8−7−6−5−9−8−7−6−5−9−8−7−6−5−9−8−7−6−5% activationnm% activationnm% activationnm% activationnmSR11383−2223166713401615871727−17−6−11715>10401670>104SR112547781339>10461024466416001734808495221110101320>104SR11246−1−326ND>1042−51712ND>104−13−9−59ND>104−43.56598ND55SR1123480000>10460049>10400070>10400226263140SR11286ND1-cND, not determined.64280ND150ND48187232ND11ND3666129ND30ND2756ND750SR11288−2−1542871500−5−449895310−8−43049681800153984104170SR11381−3−1429595000−12564667556−20−1374146>10400144>104The receptor activation by each retinoid was measured as CAT activity detected in CV-1 cells in which each receptor vector was cotransfected with a (TREpal)2-tk-CAT construct.1-a For each concentration (log m) of the retinoid being used, results are expressed as percent activation compared with activation by 1 μm ATRA as 100% for the RARs and 1 μm 9CRA as 100% for RXRα.1-b AC50 indicates the concentration of each retinoid required to give 50% of the response of 1 μm ATRA for the RARs and 1 μm 9CRA for RXRα.1-c ND, not determined.

ATRA induces a dose-dependent growth inhibition in NB cells (43Matsumoto K. Wada R.K. Yamashiro J.M. Kaplan D.R. Thiele C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1798-1806PubMed Google Scholar), which can be monitored by the decrease in [3H]Thy uptake. In the KCNR cell line, doses of ATRA ranging between 10−7 and 5 × 10−6m induced a 30–70% reduction in [3H]Thy uptake (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were observed upon treatment with 9CRA, although its maximum effect was detected at 1 × 10−6m (Fig.3 A). To investigate the contribution of the different retinoid receptors to the growth inhibitory response of KCNR cells to natural retinoids, we tested the effects of the above-mentioned selective compounds on thymidine incorporation experiments. Only SR11383 was able to induce growth inhibition as efficiently as ATRA or 9CRA, showing a 35 and 70% reduction in [3H]Thy uptake when applied at concentrations of 10−7 and 5 × 10−6m, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Within this concentration range, SR11383 activates the (TREpal)2 through both RARβ and RARα (Table I). Am580 decreased [3H]Thy uptake only by 20–25% between 1 × 10−6 and 5 × 10−6m(Fig. 3 A), which was confirmed in four independent experiments but was ineffective at lower and more selective concentrations. No growth inhibition occurred in cells treated with SR11254, SR11246 (Fig. 3 A), or SR11234 (not shown), even at micromolar concentrations. Since we observed a cooperative effect of RXR-selective ligands with RAR-selective ligands in inducing morphological differentiation of KCNR cells, we investigated the effect of these combinations on cell proliferation. A suboptimal concentration (10−7m) of SR11383 reduced [3H]Thy incorporation to 65% that of the control (Fig.3, A and B). A further reduction to 20 or 40% was obtained by adding 10−7m RXR-selective ligand SR11246 or SR11234, respectively, but not by adding Am580 (Fig.3 B). A more selective concentration (10−8m) of SR11383 was almost inactive alone, but in combination with 10−8m SR11246 reduced [3H]Thy uptake by >40% (not shown). At this concentration, SR11383 activates the (TREpal)2 mostly (61%) through RARβ and only to a lesser extent (21%) through RARα (Table I). These observations in KCNR cells and the identical responses we observed in the LAN-5 NB cell line 2G. Giannini, unpublished observation. suggest that RARβ mediates growth inhibitory signals in response to retinoids in these and possibly other NB cells. To further study the contribution of RARβ to NB cell growth inhibition by natural retinoids, we tested three additional synthetic analogs which, although not highly selective, preferentially activate RARβ in transactivation experiments (Table I). At 10−6m, the RAR/RXR panagonists SR11288 and SR11286 induced a 60 and 40% inhibition of [3H]Thy uptake in KCNR cells, respectively. RAR class-selective SR11381 was inactive, even between 1 × 10−6 (Fig.4 A) and 5 × 10−6m (not shown). Addition of RXR-selective SR11246 did not potentiate the growth inhibitory properties of the panagonist SR11288 (Fig. 4 A), which at this concentration strongly activates transcription of the (TREpal)2 through RARβ (98%), RXRα (84%), and to a far less extent, through RARα (42%) (Table I). SR11246 did increase to 60% the growth inhibition caused by SR11286 (Fig. 4 A), which is a less potent RXRα activator (56%) but a very strong RARβ activator (232%) on the (TREpal)2 (Table I). Moreover, in combination with SR11246, the otherwise inactive SR11381 inhibited [3H]Thy uptake to the same extent as did SR11286 (Fig. 4 A). At 10−7m, Am580 was inactive in inhibiting proliferation. However, the addition of 10−7mof either of the two RXR-selective SR11246 or SR11234 to 10−7m Am580 caused a 60–70% reduction in [3H]Thy incorporation (Fig. 3 C). This effect was not merely dependent on the combination of two retinoids, since the combination of 10−7 or 10−6mSR11254 with 10−7 or 10−6m Am580 failed to produce any additive or cooperative effect on cell proliferation (Fig."

Glucose stimulates both insulin secretion and proinsulin biosynthesis through signals associated with its metabolism in the β cell of the pancreatic islet (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

Glucose metabolism increases the ratio of ATP/ADP in the β cell causing the closure of a tonically active potassium (KATP+) channel. Subsequent membrane depolarization opens L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. The resulting calcium influx leads to secretion of stored insulin. Beyond the requirement for glucose metabolism, much less is known about the mechanisms by which proinsulin biosynthesis is regulated. Studies measuring aggregate responses of clonal, insulinoma cells or dispersed islet cells in culture have demonstrated that glucose stimulates insulin gene transcription through activation of the insulin promoter (4Goodison S.

Subpopulations of dispersed β cells have been isolated on the basis of differing rates of glucose metabolism measured by NAD(P)H autofluorescence. Differences in the glucose concentration dependence of insulin biosynthesis and secretion among isolated β cells demonstrated that β cells are functionally heterogeneous (12Bosco D. Meda P. Development (Camb .). 1991; 113: 1257-1265Google Scholar, 13Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F.

However, β cells are located within the 500–2,000 cell pancreatic islet, which provides potential interactions with other endocrine cell types: α (glucagon), δ (somatostatin), and PP (pancreatic polypeptide). Structural components such as intercellular matrix conform these cells to a specific microarchitecture (16Orci L. Diabetalogia. 1985; 28: 528-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, the significance of studies using isolated β cells has been challenged by observations which suggest that β cells within the intact islet may function as part of a uniformly linked network. Glucose stimulation induced coupled oscillations of intracellular calcium through the entire mouse islet, suggesting that for insulin secretion, the entire β cell population acts in unison (17Bergsten P.

Moreover, within the islet, β cells appeared to be interconnected by gap junctions containing connexin 43 which may allow for extensive cell-cell communication via diffusion of small molecules (21Soria B.

We propose that regulation of insulin production in the islet may not be fully explained by the behavior of transformed islet cell lines or isolated native β cells. We have developed an experimental approach to study insulin promoter function within the microenvironment of the intact islet and at the resolution of a single cell.

Construction of the recombinant Ad containing two independent transcriptional units (AdIns-GFP/CMV-β-gal) was carried out by homologous recombination in HEK 293 cells that were cotransfected with the Ins-GFP-containing shuttle vector pACIns-GFP (that allows the rescue of this transcriptional unit in the viral E1 region) and a derivative of the viral genome-containing plasmid pBHG11 (Microbix, Toronto, Canada) in which a second transcriptional unit (CMV-β-gal) had been inserted into a unique Pac-I restriction site located at the deletion of adenoviral E3 region sequences. 2L. Moitoso de Vargas and L. G. Moss, manuscript in preparation. Clonal viral stocks were isolated by single plaque purification, their DNA analyzed by polymerase chain reaction to confirm the incorporation of the desired transgene insert, amplified in HEK 293 cells, and purified and concentrated to 1012–13 plaque-forming units/ml by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Islets from pentobarbital-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated by pancreatic duct infiltration with collagenase, Histopaque gradient separation, and hand picking (31Gotoh M. Maki T. Satomi S. Porter J. Bonner-Weir S. O'Hara C.J. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1987; 43: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Following overnight culture in RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics) at 2 mm glucose, recipient islets were treated as a single pool with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 102–4plaque-forming units/cell, for 1 h at 37 °C. Ad-treated islets were divided into test media and incubated for 48 h and assayed. For determination of β-gal activity, islets were sonicated in small volumes, protein concentrations were determined, and extracts were assayed colorimetrically witho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. For determination of GFP fluorescence, islets were imaged in 35-mm coverslip bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp.) in phenol red-free medium. The GFP images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope (488 nm excitation line/505–525-nm emission filter). Islets were stained with propidium iodide (PI) prior to imaging (488 nm excitation/610-nm long pass emission filter). Data were acquired only from islets with minimal (<5% of cells) PI staining. To avoid variability caused by depth (z axis)-related changes in fluorescent intensity and wide range of islet diameters, a single section image was taken at az axis depth 13 the distance between the upper islet surface and its maximum diameter (i.e. equator). NIH Image and Adobe Photoshop were used to measure the planar area of each image and normalize the cell count to a standard area. Fluorescence intensities of individual cells were determined as the mean intensity within a manually demarcated cell area in terms of a 256 grayscale reading with a measurable (positive) background (threshold) level. Due to the limited dynamic range of signal acquisition (8-bit) some values exceeded the upper limit of measurement and were assigned a value of 255. While no direct standard could be used to establish directly absolute linearity between GFP fluorescence and intracellular protein concentration, by microinjection of purified GFP protein into zebrafish embryos (32Amsterdam A. Lin S. Moss L. Hopkins N. Gene (Amst .). 1996; 173: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) we detect a linear relationship for a similar range of fluorescence intensities used in these studies. Confocal microscope photomultiplier settings, pinhole diameter, and laser power were held constant for all determinations in each study. For coimaging of GFP fluorescence and β-gal immunofluorescence, after infection and incubation as above, islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, frozen sections were treated with an anti-β-gal monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) and a donkey-anti-mouse Cy-5-labeled antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cy-5 fluorescence imaging conditions were 633 nm excitation line and 670-nm long pass emission filter. Individual GFP and anti-β-gal (Cy-5) fluorescence values for each GFP-positive cell were determined as above. Correlation analysis was performed with Statview 4.01. For coimaging of GFP fluorescence and insulin immunofluorescence, isolated islets were treated with AdIns-GFP as above, incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked with donkey serum prior to incubation with guinea pig anti-human insulin IgG fraction antibodies (Linco Research) and a Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-guinea pig IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescence imaging conditions for Texas Red were 568 nm excitation/595 long pass emission. Pseudocolor images were generated using Adobe Photoshop. We utilized attenuated adenovirus gene transfer to measure glucose-stimulated insulin promoter activity in cultured, intact rat pancreatic islets. This approach allows for the efficient expression of transgenes in islets without detectable perturbations of normal islet function (33Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B.

Proc. 1994; 26: 756-757PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated rat islets were treated with a recombinant, type 5 adenovirus (see “Experimental Procedures”), which contains the rat Ins promoter (35Walker M.D. Edlund T. Boulet A.M. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) directing the expression of the lacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter gene (AdIns-β-gal). After a 48-h incubation period at differing glucose concentrations, extracts from islets that had been exposed to progressively higher levels of glucose yielded correspondingly higher levels of total β-gal activity (Fig. 1). We observed a 13-fold maximum stimulation from 2 to 20 mm glucose. In contrast, when a control adenovirus containing the CMV promoter-enhancer (AdCMV-β-gal) was utilized (Fig. 1), little effect of glucose on β-gal activity was observed. Our results are consistent with the observation that proinsulin mRNA abundance increases approximately 8–12-fold as a result of incubating islets in low or high glucose medium (36Nielsen D.A. Welsh M. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13585-13589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results established that the glucose induction of the insulin promoter could be detected after gene transfer into the whole islet, only the net islet response and not the contributions of individual β cells was measured. We generated a recombinant CMV GFP adenovirus (AdCMV-GFP) to provide a means for detection and quantification of promoter activity of individual cells within the intact, living islet. GFP fluorescence was detected by confocal microscopy imaging in a high percentage of living cells (Fig.2 A). Whereas transduction efficiencies approached 100% for small islets, they were lower for large islets. Vital staining of AdCMV-GFP transduced islets using PI (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that this decreased efficiency was often associated with islets exhibiting central necrosis (Fig. 2, B and C). The degree of necrosis varied between islet preparations but was not related to adenovirus exposure. Thus, the inherent lack of uniformity when using primary living tissue was taken into account by the simultaneous direct visualization of gene expression and a marker for cell viability (PI). When islets were treated with the β cell-specific AdIns-GFP, green fluorescence was detected only in cells positive for insulin immunostaining (Fig.2 D). This β cell restriction of GFP expression by the Ins promoter was not found when adenoviruses using other promoters, such as CMV, were tested (data not shown). To evaluate the effect of glucose on Ins-GFP expression, isolated islets were transduced with AdIns-GFP as a single pool and divided into separate dishes. Incubation proceeded for 48–72 h at glucose concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 mm. The islets were then imaged for GFP fluorescence by optical sectioning (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.3 A demonstrates that at 2 mm glucose, few GFP-positive cells were detected in these islets. Weak fluorescence with rare, brightly fluorescing cells was observed (arrows). With increasing glucose concentrations, progressively more cells demonstrated GFP fluorescence within an islet (Fig. 3 A). When corrected for islet size (cross-sectional area), 5–6-fold more GFP-positive cells were detected per islet at 20 mm glucose than at 2 mm glucose (Fig.3 C). No increase over background fluorescence was observed for a promoterless GFP adenovirus (data not shown) irrespective of glucose concentration. Moreover, a comparison of relative cell intensities revealed that the average GFP fluorescence per positive cell also increased as a function of glucose concentration (Fig.3 D). In contrast, no significant difference in the number of GFP-positive cells and only a slight increase in average fluorescence intensity were detected in AdCMV-GFP-treated islets incubated in high or low glucose medium (Fig. 3 B). These results clearly indicate that glucose stimulation does not result in a uniform β cell response. Glucose induction of the insulin transcriptional promoter involves the differential activation of β cell subpopulations with varying sensitivities to glucose. Insulin promoter activity within most β cells exhibits a graded dose response to glucose rather than a simple on/off behavior. To confirm that the differences among individual cells in insulin promoter function were not due to cell to cell variability in adenoviral transduction, we designed an adenovirus containing a second transcription unit to serve as an internal control (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.4 A shows a schematic representation of the AdIns-GFP/CMV-β-gal generated by insertion of a CMV-nlsLacZ expression cassette at the site of a deletion in the viral E3 region approximately 25 kilobase pairs rightward from Ins-GFP at ΔE1 (24Bett A.J.

We performed simultaneous measurement of anti-β-gal immunofluorescence and GFP fluorescence on fixed islet sections to compare respective levels of expression. Fig. 4,B through D, depict a section of an Ins-GFP/CMV-β-gal-transduced islet incubated at a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of glucose (6 mm) to generate a wide range of Ins-GFP signal intensities. More cells expressed β-gal than GFP, presumably representing transduced non-β cells or β cells whose GFP expression was below detection threshold. No cells exhibited GFP fluorescence in the absence of β-gal immunostaining. When averaged over the whole islet, the total number of GFP-positive cells correlates with the number of β-gal-positive cells with the same relationship holding for estimates of total fluorescence in a whole islet section. Thus, this construct provides a means to correct for overall transduction efficiency. The values of the relative signal intensities for GFP fluorescence and β-gal immunofluorescence were compared within a single islet section for every cell that expressed both transgenes (see “Experimental Procedures”). The plot of relative intensities in Fig. 4 E failed to demonstrate any general correlation between Ins-GFP and CMV-β-gal signals from individual cells. Therefore, even though transgene copy number undoubtedly affects the signal of a given cell, it cannot account for the heterogeneity of β cell response with respect to glucose stimulation of insulin promoter activity. This result reinforces other experimental data, 3L. Moitoso de Vargas, R. Siegel, and L. G. Moss, unpublished observations. suggesting that promoters inserted at these distant sites within the adenovirus genome can be shown to function independently. We then investigated whether inhibition of signaling pathways that are known to couple glucose metabolism with insulin secretion would affect the glucose response of insulin promoter activity. Treatment of islets with nifedipine or verapamil (inhibitors of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels) at concentrations that inhibit insulin secretion by >90% did not block insulin promoter induction by 20 mm glucose (Fig.5). Furthermore, treatment with the sulfonylurea glyburide, which stimulates insulin secretion through inhibition of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, failed to increase insulin promoter activity at low glucose (2 mm). Similar results were obtained using both reporter systems. Fig.5 A indicates the total β-gal activity after transduction with AdIns-β-gal. The number and intensity of fluorescent cells after treatment with AdIns-GFP is shown in Fig. 5 B. The absence of insulin promoter activation by the sulfonylurea and the failure of calcium channel antagonists to block glucose stimulation of the insulin promoter indicate that insulin release and insulin promoter activation must utilize different signaling pathways. Although the response of gene expression to glucose in individual β cells can be visualized in the intact islet, other differences, such as secretory behavior, may be masked by networked cell depolarization or the rapid diffusion of small molecule signals. Our studies suggest that, in terms of insulin promoter activity, functional β cell heterogeneity in the context of the intact islet provides an additional level of organizational complexity. The net β cell response may result from a unique integration of cells with individually specific stimulus-response characteristics. For example, even at very low glucose levels some β cells appear to be tonically “on.” These GFP-positive β cells could represent the insulin source which fulfills the basal, non-glucose requirements of the organism. Functional differences between β cells may arise by random phenotypic variation or by specific programmed assignment. No specific pattern relating β cell behavior and geographic location within the islet has yet been discerned. However, when dispersed islet cells were transduced with Ins- or CMV-GFP Ad and cultured under identical conditions as intact islets, we observed the same overall glucose response patterns as in Fig. 3 (data not shown). This suggests that the variation of insulin promoter activation by glucose observed in β cells may represent a cell autonomous phenomenon. Further investigation will be required to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for β cell heterogeneity. Our ability to measure gene expression in individual β cells in the living islet will allow for the direct analysis and manipulation of cellular signaling pathways. In addition, GFP fluorescence tagging based on promoter function will provide a means by which behaviorally disparate populations of β cells can be obtained and regulatory factors that mediate glucose responsiveness characterized. For example, glucokinase/hexokinase activity dictates the glucose concentration dependence of insulin secretion in the islet by serving as the rate-limiting step for β cell glycolysis (37Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in glucokinase activity, that could provide an explanation for these differences in β cell glucose responses, could be directly measured. A more complete understanding of islet function may aid in the development of bioprosthetic approaches to insulin replacement in diabetes mellitus and shed light on the origins of the β cell dysfunction seen in non-insulin-dependent diabetes (38Leahy J.L. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 992-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Finally, other apparently homogeneous cell types such as neurons can exhibit heterogeneous behaviors. Recently, prolactin-secreting pituitary cells with differing hormonal responses have been characterized (39Castano J.P. Kineman R.D. Frawley L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 599-605PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our findings sound an additional note of caution, not only for the extrapolation of data regarding physiological function obtained from transformed, clonal cell lines to native tissues, but also for the need to evaluate the contributions of individual cells within those tissues.

Comparison of the genes for CYP1B1 with the other two members of the CYP1 family, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, reveal several features that distinguish the CYP1B1 gene: (i) presence of only three exons versus seven (8Gonzalez F.J.

CYP1B1 mRNA is expressed constitutively in several organs, including the adrenal glands, ovaries, prostate, and testes, and is inducible by planar aromatic hydrocarbons, adrenocorticotrophin, and other peptide hormones (2Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.-Y.P. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Otto S. Marcus C. Pidgeon C.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2979-2984PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, CYP1A1 is not expressed constitutively; however, induced CYP1A1 mRNA and protein can be detected in human liver (16McKinnon R.A. Hall P.D. Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. McManus M.E. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The differential expression of constitutive CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 presumably is modulated by cis-acting regulatory elements located within or near to their respective promoters. In this regard, the CYP1A1 andCYP1A2 promoters have been shown to be silent when uncoupled from upstream enhancer elements (17Jones K.W. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 5098-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 66-71PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we present the mapping and characterization of functional modalities within the CYP1B1 promoter region. TheCYP1B1 promoter consists of at least four distinct regulatory elements. All are required for maximum promoter activity and are functional, when uncoupled from upstream enhancers. An 8-bp sequence surrounding the transcription start site was found to bind to sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins present in SCC12(c12c2) nuclear extracts and to function as a positioning element, assuring the fidelity of transcription from the single initiation site (TIS), identified previously (7Tang Y.M. Wo Y.-Y.P. Stewart J. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Sutter T.R. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28324-28330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Heterologous chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs containing progressive deletions of the CYP1B1 gene 5′-flanking region were made as described previously (7Tang Y.M. Wo Y.-Y.P. Stewart J. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Sutter T.R. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28324-28330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 5′-End deletions of the −164/+25 fragment in the pCATbasic(−164/+25) vector were made as follows: three oligonucleotides (20-mers), each containing a 5′-end HindIII site, and a vector-specific primer (spanning sequence from nt 2803 to nt 2783 in pCAT-Basic) were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the fragments containing theCYP1B1 sequence −101 to +25, −83 to +25, or −47 to +25, plus 540 base pairs of CAT gene sequence. These PCR products were digested with HindIII and BalI, and cloned into the HindIII/BalI-digested pCAT-Basic vector to generate the constructs pCATbasic(−101/+25), pCATbasic(−83/+25), and pCATbasic(−47/+25). Constructs containing part of exon 1 (pCATbasic(−164/+184)) and the entire exon 1 and intron 1 (pCATbasic(−164/+761)) of the CYP1B1 gene were made using the same approach. Mutations in theCYP1B1 promoter were created by oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis as described previously (19Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar). By using four primers (two vector-specific primers and two complementary mutagenic primers) and two-step PCR, three CYP1B1 promoter regulatory elements in the construct pCATbasic(−164/+25) were individually mutated to specific restriction sites. Two antisense GC boxes (i.e.GGGCGG, start from nt −84 and nt −68), which presumably could bind to the transcription factor Sp1, were altered to SalI sites. In contrast, the TATA-like sequence (i.e. TTAAAA, from nt −33 to nt −28) and the sequence surrounding the transcription start site (i.e. −3 TTGACTCT +5) were mutated to PstI andXbaI sites, respectively. Double mutations on both Sp1 recognition motifs were constructed exactly as described above, except that the template used in the PCR was derived from a mutant promoter that already contained a single Sp1 site mutation. All of the CAT reporter constructs were sequenced (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) and subjected to restriction analysis to confirm that the desired mutation was present and that no other alterations had occurred. The procedures for transient transfection of SCC12(c12c2) cells and assay of CAT gene activity were as described previously (8Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 243-288Google Scholar). The analysis of each construct was done on at least three sample dishes and was repeated at least twice. Nuclear extracts for gel shift assay were prepared from SCC12(c12c2) cells according to the method described (21Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 582-589Crossref Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 20% glycerol), and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined as described (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Two DNA probes were used for gel shift analysis. One was a PCR-amplified DNA fragment (spanning the sequence from −101 to −43) in which two consensus Sp1 binding motifs were encompassed. The PCR product, which was incorporated with HindIII andXbaI sites at its 5′-ends, was digested withHindIII and XbaI, filled in with [α-32P]dATP, and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For mobility shift assay, 5 μg of nuclear protein (or 20 ng of purified Sp1 protein (Promega)) was preincubated at room temperature in a reaction solution (15 μl) containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.25 mm DTT, 0.25 mm PMSF, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The probe (10,000 cpm) was then added, and the incubation was continued for another 15 min. The samples were analyzed at 4 °C on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), containing 6.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 3.3 mmsodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA. The other probe was made to examine the sequence surrounding the TIS of the CYP1B1. A pair of synthetic complementary oligonucleotides (5′-GCGCGCTTTGACTCTGGAGT-3′ and 5′-GACTCCAGAGTCAAAGCGCG-3′), which correspond to the sequence from −10 to +11 relative to the transcription start site, were prepared and annealed as described (23Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently purified by PAGE. The experimental procedure for the gel shift assay was similar to that described above, except using 10 μg of nuclear protein, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC), 20,000 cpm of probe, and a modified buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm PMSF. Competition studies were performed, to analyze the binding specificity, by using 100–400-fold molar excess of the unlabeled initiator sequences from TdT, the adenovirus major late promoter (AdML), or the mutated CYP1B1 Inr shown below (Sequences 1–3). The competitor was added immediately before the addition of radiolabeled probe. mCYP1B1Inr:5′­GCGCGCTTTTCTAGAGGAGTGGGA­3′ CGCGCGAAAAGATCTCCTCACCCT TdT Inr:5′­GCCCTCATTCTGGAGA­3′ GGGAGTAAGACCTCTG AdML Inr:5′­GTCCTCACTCTCTTCCG­3′ AGGAGTGAGAGAAGGCG SEQUENCES1–3 In vitrotranscription reactions were conducted on 550-bpPvuII/PvuII fragments obtained from the heterologous CAT reporter construct pCATbasic(−164/+25) and constructs containing mutations at either or both Sp1 sites, the TATA-like sequence, and the Inr (see above), using a HeLa cell nuclear extractin vitro transcription system (Promega). Briefly, a reaction mixture (23.5 μl total) containing 100 ng of DNA fragment, 8 units of HeLa nuclear extract, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 6 mmMgCl2, 3 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 44 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature. After this period, an aliquot of 1.5 μl of ribonucleotide mix (10 mm each of rNTP) was added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated at room temperature for another 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 175 μl of the stop mix (containing 0.3 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mmEDTA, and 3 μg/ml tRNA). After the extraction with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the synthesized RNA was precipitated with 95% ethanol, centrifuged, and dried. The RNA transcribed in vitro was subsequently analyzed by primer extension reaction. The primer used for the reaction was a 34-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CTCCTGAAAATCTCGCCAAGCTCAGATCCTCTAG-3′), which is complementary to the 5′-end of the CAT reporter gene. Primer extension was started by dissolving the RNA in a 10-μl buffer solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 × 105 cpm of32P-end-labeled primer. After heating at 85 °C for 5 min, the solution was incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. The extension reaction was then initiated by adding a 40-μl solution containing 12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 20 mmMgCl2, 12.5 mm DTT, 20 units of RNasin, 1.25 mm each of dNTP, and 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). After incubation for 1 h at 42 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of a solution containing 1% SDS and 20 mm NaCl. The reaction product was precipitated with 250 μl of ethanol and loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and the results were analyzed by a phosphorimage analyzer (Fuji BAS 1000). A series of reporter plasmids containing the various CYP1B1 5′-flanking fragments (from nt −2300 to nt −164) in the sense orientation upstream to the CAT gene were transfected into SCC12(c12c2) cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). The level of CAT activity for each construct was normalized with respect to a co-transfected β-galactosidase plasmid and then compared with the negative control (promoterless plasmid). The construct containing the longest 5′-flanking sequence (−2300/+25) exhibited 43-fold greater CAT activity than the promoterless control (Fig. 1). Removal of the region between −2300 and −1356 resulted in a 45% reduction of CAT activity. When the deletion was extended to nt −1022, a 2.5-fold increase in the activity was observed as compared with the construct with its 5′-end at nt −1356 (Fig. 1). This construct (−1022/+25) showed the highest transcriptional activity (greater than 60-fold relative to the promoterless plasmid) of all the constructs tested. A further removal in sequence to nt −835 dramatically decreased the CAT activity by 90%. The promoter activity gradually increased with progressive 5′-deletions from nt −835, with the shortest promoter sequence (−164/+25) possessing 33-fold greater activity than the promoterless control (Fig. 1). The results of this initial 5′-deletion analysis indicate that the fully active CYP1B1 promoter is contained within the −164/+25 fragment. The pattern of CAT activity for the various deletion constructs suggest that potential enhancer elements are located between nt −2300 and nt −1356 and between nt −1022 and −835. Potential negative regulatory elements are located between nt −1356 and −1022 and between nt −835 and −164 (Fig. 1). Based on sequence analysis, the −164/+25 fragment contains a TATA-like box (TTAAAA) from nt −33 to −28, two Sp1 sites (GGGCGG) starting at nt −84 and −68 on the antisense strand, and a potential initiator element (TTGACTCT) from nt −3 to +5. No known enhancer elements are located in the −164/+25 fragment. To determine if these putative regulatory elements in the CYP1B1 promoter are functional, a series of 5′-deletion constructs within the −164/+25 fragment were made (Fig. 2). A deletion of 53 base pairs, from the 5′-end to nt −101, only slightly altered the promoter activity, indicating that the region from −164 to −101 does not contain any critical cis-acting element(s) that contribute(s) to promoter activity. Deletions that removed one or both Sp1 binding motifs reduced CAT activity by 80–95%, respectively, from that observed with the −101/+25 construct (Fig. 2). The smallest 5′-flanking construct examined (−47/+25), which contained both the TATA-like box (TTAAAA) and putative Inr (TTGACTCT), exhibited 2–4-fold greater CAT activity than the promoterless control (Fig. 2) and is defined operationally as the basal promoter for CYP1B1. Full promoter activity requires both Sp1 motifs located within the −101/+25 fragment. The CAT activity measured for constructs containing sequences 3′-ward from the TIS of the CYP1B1 gene was reduced relative to the −164/+25 and −101/+25 constructs (Fig. 2). However, the longest 3-ward construct examined (−164/+761) containing the first exon and intron of the CYP1B1 gene displayed 8-fold greater CAT activity than the basal promoter (−47/+25). Mutations at the distal (nt −89 to −84) or proximal (nt −73 to nt −68) Sp1 binding motifs resulted in a 65% or 71% decrease, respectively, in CAT activity, as compared with the nonmutated (−164/+25) construct (Fig.3). Mutations at both Sp1 sites reduced CAT activity to 20% of the fully active promoter. Mutating the TATA-like motif (TTAAAA) to TGCAGA or the putative initiator element from TTGACTCT to TTTCTAGA suppressed promoter activity by 85% or 55%, respectively (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that all of the four regulatory elements identified by sequence analysis and deletion mapping (Fig. 2) are required for full CYP1B1promoter activity. Based on the mutational analysis supporting the involvement of both Sp1 sites for full promoter activity (Fig. 3), a radiolabeled −101/−47 probe containing both Sp1 sites was prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”) and incubated with nuclear extracts from SCC12(c12c2) cells. Two major complexes (shown by arrows) are observed, which co-migrate with complexes formed when the same probe is incubated with purified recombinant Sp1 protein (Fig. 4). The addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled −101/−41 fragment competed with the labeled probe (Fig. 4, lane 6), whereas little or no competition was observed with a nonspecific probe (Fig. 4,lane 7) or a probe containing double mutations in both Sp1 sites (Fig. 4, lane 8). The same pattern of competition was observed with the purified Sp1 protein (data not shown). These results support the findings from site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3) and indicate the involvement of Sp1 in regulating the activity of theCYP1B1 promoter. We have demonstrated previously that the transcription of the human CYP1B1 gene begins at a single site (7Tang Y.M. Wo Y.-Y.P. Stewart J. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Sutter T.R. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28324-28330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis, theCYP1B1 promoter does not contain a consensus TATA box, but does possess a potential Inr element from nt −3 to +5. When the Inr sequence in the CYP1B1 promoter is aligned with other reported Inr elements, considerable sequence homology is observed (Fig.5): identical matches with 9 of 12 nucleotides in the Inr found in the TATA-less promoter of TdT between nt −3 to +9 and with 5 of 8 nucleotides in the −3 to +5 sequence of the AdML. To determine if the Inr in the CYP1B1 promoter is responsible for maintaining accuracy of transcription from a single site, we transcribed in vitro a −164/+25 fragment containing the four CYP1B1 promoter regulatory elements (Fig. 3), as well as promoter fragments with mutations in each element. The transcribed RNA was then analyzed by primer extension with a labeled downstream primer (Fig. 6). A closely spaced doublet signal was observed with the nonmutated −164/+25 fragment. This most likely represents a single band, with the doublet signal resulting from capping of the transcribed RNA. This same doublet signal was observed with the fragments containing mutations in one or both Sp1 sites, or in the TATA-like box. In contrast, multiple bands were observed when the Inr sequence was mutated (Fig. 6). These results strongly support the position that the start site of transcription in the CYP1B1 promoter is determined by the −3 to +5 Inr sequence (TTGACTCT). Gel shift analysis was carried out to determine if proteins present in nuclear extracts from SCC12(c12c2) cells could bind specifically to the Inr in the CYP1B1 promoter. One major complex is observed when a radiolabeled probe containing the CYP1B1 Inr is incubated with nuclear extract proteins (Fig.7). Competition by a probe for the highly homologous murine TdT Inr competes with the CYP1B1 Inr for binding with nuclear extracts. Competition by a AdML Inr probe also is observed, but requires a higher concentration (400-fold) of unlabeled probe. Using a radiolabeled TdT Inr probe, a major DNA-protein complex was observed with SCC12(c12c2) nuclear extracts (Fig. 7). Specific competition occurred with either unlabeled TdT Inr or CYP1B1Inr probes, but not with the AdML Inr or a mutated CYP1B1probe. These results suggest that the Inr regions for both TdT andCYP1B1 can recognize DNA-binding proteins in SCC12(c12c2) cells. The CYP1B1 Inr appears to be less specific than the TdT Inr, as indicated by the differential competition with unlabeled AdML Inr. Stepwise deletion of the 5′-flanking region of theCYP1B1 gene indicated that the regions between nt −2300 and nt −1356 and between nt −1022 and nt −835 may contain transcriptional enhancer elements (Fig. 1). The −1022/−835 region has been shown previously to contain three dioxin-responsive core binding motifs that contribute to the TCDD-inducible expression of CYP1B1 (7Tang Y.M. Wo Y.-Y.P. Stewart J. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Sutter T.R. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28324-28330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although cells were not treated with TCDD in this study, it is possible that the dioxin-responsive enhancers or other cis elements were responsive to components in the serum or medium, or to constitutively expressed cell proteins. In this regard, two repeats of the motif GGGTGG are located within the −1022/−835 region, with a third at −1061. Although this motif contains a T in place of the C in the consensus Sp1 binding site (GGGCGG; Ref. 23Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated to bind the transcription factor Sp1 and activate a high level of transcription (24Kudo S. Fukuda M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sp1-dependent enhancer activity has been demonstrated for the human adenosine deaminase gene (25Dusing M.R. Wiginton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the ratα2MR/LRP gene (26Gaâta B.A. Borthwick I. Stanley K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 307-313Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and ornithine decarboxylase (27Kumar A.P. Mar P.K. Zhao B. Montgomery R.L. Kang D.-C. Butler A.P. J. Biol.

Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Sp1 also can act synergistically with either the androgen (29Faber P.W. van Rooij H.C.J. Schipper H.J. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9296-9301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucocorticoid (30Schåle R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) receptor to enhance gene expression. Deletion mapping (Fig. 2) and site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3) have identified four regulatory elements that are required for maximum activity of the CYP1B1 promoter: two Sp1 binding motifs, a TATA-like sequence, and an Inr overlapping the TIS. Sp1 sites as far removed as 87 bp upstream from the TIS have been shown to be functional and to act in a bidirectional manner (32Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). In this regard, both of the active Sp1 sites in the CYP1B1 promoter were located on the antisense strand at nt −68 and −84, respectively. These sites functioned in an additive manner to activate transcription. The human CYP1B1 promoter does not contain a consensus TATA box (TATAAA) but, instead, a closely related TATA-like sequence (TTAAAA) at nt −34 (Fig. 3). The transcription factor TFIID binds to sites in the nt −30 region of several promoters lacking consensus TATA boxes (33Atchison M.L. Meyuhas O. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Ayer D.A. Dynan W.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2021-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Chen M.-J. Shimada T.

Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) including the AT-rich elements (37Hahn S. Buratowski S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) such as the ATAAAA sequence found in the bovine elastin gene (38Manohar A. Anwar R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 233-236Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For this group of TATA-less promoters, the level of transcriptional activity correlates with differences in the affinity of TFIID for binding to the nt −30 region (39Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5814-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). By extension, it would be predicted that the TATA-like element of the CYP1B1 promoter, which is highly similar to the consensus TATA box sequence, would have a high affinity for TFIID and thus high promoter activity. This position is supported by the results shown in Fig. 3. Mutation of the TATA-like element to TGCAGA decreased promoter activity by 75%. The contribution of the Inr that overlaps the TIS to CYP1B1promoter activity is less than either Sp1 sites or the TATA-like box (Fig. 3). However, the in vitro transcription analysis carried out here (Fig. 6) strongly supports the position that the Inr is essential for maintaining fidelity of CYP1B1 transcription from a single site, as demonstrated previously (7Tang Y.M. Wo Y.-Y.P. Stewart J. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Sutter T.R. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28324-28330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Either a consensus TATA box or an initiator sequence is sufficient to direct the Sp1-dependent activated transcription from a single site (40O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). When a promoter contains both core elements, the TATA and Inr can act cooperatively to enhance the transcription levels and to assure the specificity of the start site. In the absence of a functional Inr, mutations in the TATA sequence can result in the initiation from multiple sites (42Grosveld G.C. Shewmaker C.K. Jat P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1981; 25: 215-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 43Grosschedl R. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Other studies on TATA-less promoters have suggested the involvement of Sp1 motifs in transcription start site selection (27Kumar A.P. Mar P.K. Zhao B. Montgomery R.L. Kang D.-C. Butler A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4341-4348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Kollmar R. Sukow K.A. Sponagle S.K. Farnham P.J. J. Biol.

Our data indicate that for theCYP1B1 promoter the Inr alone determines that transcription initiates from a single site, even in the absence of the upstream TATA counterpart (Fig. 6). Similar results have been reported for three mouse ribosomal protein promoters (46Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and for the Inr-containing adenovirus IVa2 and major late promoters (47Hu S.L. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1981; 78: 820-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 48Carcamo J. Maldonado E. Cortes P. Ahn M. Ha I. Kasai Y. Flint J. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutation of the consensus TATA box in AdML and the TATA analog in Iva2 significantly decreased the transcriptional activity, but the position of the transcriptional start site was maintained. A strict sequence conservation is missing in many of the known Inr elements. However, we found the CYP1B1 Inr is highly homologous to the TdT Inr (match of 9 of 12 nucleotides) and closely related to the AdML Inr beginning at nt −3 (Fig. 5). Consistent with this observation based on nucleotide sequence, we found that DNA-binding proteins present in SCC12(c12c2) nuclear extracts can bind specifically to oligonucleotide probes for either the CYP1B1or TdT Inr element (Fig. 7). Further, nuclear extract protein binding to the CYP1B1 Inr probe was competed by either the TdT or AdML Inr probes. Thus, it is likely that the same or closely related nuclear proteins interact with the CYP1B1, TdT, and AdML Inr elements.

https://openalex.org/W2053095031,"The RIZ (G3B orMTB-Zf) zinc finger gene is structurally related to the myeloid leukemia gene, MDS1-EVI1, and the transcription repressor/differentiation factor, PRDI-BF1/BLIMP1, through a conserved amino-terminal motif, the PR domain. Similar toMDS1-EVI1, RIZ gene normally produces two protein products that differ by the PR domain. The smaller protein RIZ2 lacks the PR domain of RIZ1 but is otherwise identical to RIZ1. Here we show that RIZ proteins bind to GC-rich or Sp-1-binding elements and repress transcription. Both RIZ1 and RIZ2 repressed the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter, one of the best characterized eukaryotic promoters. Recombinant RIZ1 proteins were able to bind to HSV-TK promoter. This binding was mediated by the GC-rich Sp-1 elements of the promoter and the first three zinc finger motifs of RIZ1. RIZ also encodes a repressor domain that was mapped to the central region of the protein. Fusion of this region to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain generated GAL4 site-dependent transcriptional repressors. We also show that RIZ1 protein can efficiently repress the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, which primarily consists of Sp-1 sites; RIZ2, however, only weakly repressed this promoter, suggesting a role for PR in modulating RIZ protein function. The data have implications for a role of RIZ proteins in the regulation of cellular gene promoters, many of which are characterized by GC-rich elements.

The data have implications for a role of RIZ proteins in the regulation of cellular gene promoters, many of which are characterized by GC-rich elements. The RIZ zinc finger gene was isolated in a functional screening for proteins that can interact with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (1Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Buyse I.M. Huang S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6200-6203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role of this interaction remains unclear because of the limited understanding of RIZgene function. The predicted rat and human RIZ proteins are of 1706 and 1719 amino acids respectively, and are highly homologous (84% amino acid identity). RIZ gene normally produces two different products, RIZ1 and RIZ2, that are widely expressed (3Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An internal promoter generates RIZ2, which is identical to RIZ1 except that it lacks the RIZ1 PR domain that defines a subclass of Krüppel-like family of zinc finger genes. This RIZ gene structure is remarkably similar to a related PR domain gene MDS1-EVI1involved in human and murine leukemia (4Fears S. Mathieu C. Zeleznik-Le N. Huang S. Rowley J.D. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). An internal promoter withinMDS1-EVI1 gene generates the EVI1 myeloid transforming gene product that lacks PR but is otherwise identical to MDS1-EVI1(5Bartholomew C. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The PR domain of MDS1-EVI1 is a common target of viral insertions and chromosomal translocations in leukemogenesis (6Morishita K.

EVI1 has been shown to bind to DNA specifically and can function either as a repressor or a weak activator of transcription (9Morishita K. Suzukawa K. Taki T. Ihle J.N. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The function ofMDS1-EVI1 remains uncharacterized. It is of considerable interest to determine whether EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1, or RIZ1 and RIZ2, may function differently because of the PR domain. Another PR domain gene is the PRDI-BF1/BLIMP1 transcription repressor/differentiation factor (11Huang S. Cell. 1994; 78: 9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It can repress the β-interferon gene promoter (12Keller A.D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and can induce B-lymphocyte maturation (13Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). BLIMP1 maps to human chromosome band 6q21-q22.1, a region often deleted in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, suggesting that it might serve as a candidate tumor suppressor for this B cell tumor (14Mock B.A. Liu L. LePaslier D. Huang S. Genomics. 1996; 37: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, BLIMP1 has recently been shown to be a physiological transcriptional repressor of the c-myc oncogene (15Lin Y. Wong K.-k. Calame K. Science. 1997; 276: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Like its related PR domain genes, RIZ also display properties of transcription factor with a potential role in cell growth and tumorigenesis. RIZ gene products encode DNA-binding as well as transcription factor-binding activities as evidenced by the independent isolation of RIZ as an retinoblastoma-binding protein (RIZ), a DNA-binding protein (MTB-Zf), or as a GATA3 transcription factor binding protein (G3B) (1Buyse I.M.

MTB-Zf is essentially identical to RIZ2 (3Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and binds to the MTE DNA element GTCATATGAC of human heme-oxygenase-1 gene and can weakly activate transcription (16Muraosa Y. Takahashi K. Yoshizawa M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RIZ gene maps to human chromosomal band 1p36, a region thought to harbor one or more tumor suppressor genes for a variety of human cancers including those of neurocrest, colon, liver, and breast tissues (16Muraosa Y.

RIZ1 mRNA was commonly found absent or at reduced levels in tumor cell lines and tissues while RIZ2 was always found expressed, 1L. Liu, I. Buyse, S. Simon, G. Brodeur, and S. Huang, manuscript in preparation. consistent with RIZ1 as a potential tumor suppressor. Better characterization of RIZ gene function is clearly needed to elucidate its potential role in transcriptional regulation and in cell growth control. Here, we have found that RIZ proteins function as transcription repressors and can bind to GC-rich Sp-1 elements. Using the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) 2The abbreviations used are: HSV-TK, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase; SV40, simian virus 40; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TBE, Tris-borate-EDTA. promoter as a model system (19McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), we show that RIZ proteins repress this promoter and can bind to it in vitro. Repression requires DNA-binding domain as well as a repressor domain that is transferable to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. We also show that RIZ proteins repress the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter, which is primarily governed by GC-rich Sp-1 elements(19). Given that many cellular gene promoters, especially those of growth regulated genes, are characterized by GC-rich elements (20Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar), these results have implications for a potential role of RIZin the transcriptional regulation of a broad spectrum of cellular genes. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum. For transfections of these cells, a calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used (21Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, the cells were split to a density of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. The cells were given fresh media 0.5 h prior to transfection. The standard co-transfection included 1.5 μg of reporter gene, 8 μg of expression construct, and 1 μg of a β-galactosidase expression construct driven by the CMV promoter (pCMVβ) (22MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The DNA precipitate was left on the cells for 16–20 h, and then the medium was changed. Cells were processed 24 h after withdrawal of DNA for immunoblot and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase analysis. Equivalent amounts of cell extracts, made by freeze-thaw lysis, were incubated with acetyl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol for 1–2 h, and percent conversion of the chloramphenicol to the acetylated form was measured by thin layer chromatography followed by quantitation on a phosphoimager radioanalytic imaging system scanner. Luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined by measurement of chemiluminescence usingd-luciferin-potassium salt as substrate (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and the MicroLumat LB96P microplate luminometer system (EG&G Berthold). The cell extracts were also assayed for β-galactosidase activity using standard procedures (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). All CAT or luciferase values were normalized based on the respective β-galactosidase activities. The data represent the average of at least three independent experiments. Multiple independent transfections did not show any correlation between RIZ protein expression and β-galactosidase activities, showing that RIZ did not affect CMV promoter, which drives β-galactosidase expression. GAL4-(1–147) antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) was used for immunoblot analysis to verify the expression of GAL4-RIZ fusion proteins. Monoclonal antibodies 2D7 and P4E1 were used for immunoblot analysis to verify expression of RIZ proteins (1Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells by rapidly suspending cells in lysis buffer for 3 min (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 1 mm EDTA). Nuclei were then pelleted at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed once with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. Nuclear proteins were then extracted with high salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm aprotinin) by shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The extracts were then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, which were then analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot was performed on Immobilon P filters (Millipore) using RIZ or GAL4 antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts was performed using 2D7 or P4E1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose as described (3Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). pBLCAT2 contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter sequence −105 to +51 linked to the CAT gene (24Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). pGL3-promoter (Promega) contains SV40 early promoter linked to luciferase gene. pGL3-control (Promega) contains SV40 early promoter plus enhancer linked to luciferase gene. RIZ1 and RIZ2 protein expression plasmids p3RIZr and p3RIZrKK were previously described (3Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For carboxyl-terminal-half deletion mutant p3RIZrB (deleting amino acid 901–1706), p3RIZr plasmid was linearized by BstEII digestion. The linearized plasmid was treated with Klenow and self-ligated. The elimination of BstEII site generated a frameshift and a stop codon at the destroyedBstEII site. For mutant p3RIZrA (deleting amino acids 659–1706), p3RIZr plasmid was linearized by AflII followed by Klenow treatment and self-ligation generating a frameshift and a stop codon. For deletion of zinc finger 1–3 region in p3RIZrB (deleting amino acids 216–575), the fragment from StuI to Spe1 was deleted from p3RIZrB to generate p3RIZrBΔZf1–3. The plasmid pGAL4-TK-CAT contains five copies of GAL4 DNA-binding site in front of the HSV-TK promoter-CAT cassette in pBLCAT2 (generous gift of Dr. Yang Shi) (25Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). For GAL4 (amino acids 1–147)-RIZ fusion protein constructs, pSG424 vector was used that expresses the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) (26Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). A KpnI-BamHI 5′ fragment of rat RIZ1 cDNA was first cloned into theKpnI-XbaI sites of pSG424 to generate pSGNTRwr. The unique EcoRI site in pSGNTRwr was then eliminated by Klenow treatment to generate the in-frame fusion construct pSGNTR. For plasmids pGRIZ1-(18–901) or pGRIZ1-(18–659), aKpnI-NotI fragment from p3RIZrB or p3RIZrA was cloned into the KpnI-StuI sites of pSGNTR. To construct pGRIZ1-(738–948), a PCR fragment of amino acid 738–948 region was cloned into pSG424. The PCR primers were RP68 (5′-TCT CCA CAG CAC AGC CCT G-3′) and RP32 (5′-GGA TAA GGA GGC TGT CTG-3′). To make pGRIZ1(K755N) (point mutation in the GTPase motif), single nucleotide substitution was achieved by using the primer RP89 (5′-ATG ATG GGA AAG CAGCAT GGA-3′) and the T7 GEN mutagenesis kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To make pGRIZ1(L745P) (point mutation in the SH3 motif), the Quick-change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with primers L745P.S (5′-CAC AGC CCT GCC CCT CGA GAC TTC GGG A-3′) and L745P.AS (5′-TCC CGA AGT CTC GAG GGG CAG GGC TGT G-3′). All PCR-derived constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. To construct pGST-RIZ1-Zf1–3, the SphI to StuI fragment of human RIZ1 cDNA (amino acid 300–520) containing zinc finger motifs 1–3 was cloned into pGEX-KG vector. For pGST-RIZ1-Zf4–6 plasmid, a PCR fragment of rat RIZ cDNA (amino acid 1114–1260) was amplified using primers RP72 (5′-GTG GTC CAA GAA ACA TTC-3′) and RP51 (5′-TCG TGT AAA GCT CTT CAG-3′) and was cloned into pGEX-KG vector. For pGST-RIZ1-Zf7–8 fusion plasmid (amino acid 1310–1524), anNcoI to SacI 0.26-kb fragment of human RIZ cDNA was first cloned into pGEX-KG vector to generate pKGhRIZ0.3k. The 0.17-kb SalI-SacI fragment of this plasmid was then replaced with a 0.57-kb SalI-SacI fragment of rat cDNA to make pGST-RIZ1-Zf7–8. Plasmids bearing log-phase Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells were induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) for 3 h at 30 °C. Protein extract was made and recombinant GST fusion protein was purified as described in (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The HSV-TK promoter probe was prepared by isolating the 0.1-kb fragment produced fromBamHI and MluI digestion of pBLCAT2 plasmid. The isolated fragment was end-labeled using Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. EMSA using low ionic strength polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The binding buffer contains 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Oligonucleotides used for competition experiments were as follows: Sp-1 consensus oligonucleotide, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.); Sp-1 mutant oligonucleotide, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GTT CGG GGC GAG C-3′); CTF, 5′-CTT GTC ATT GGC GAA TTC GAA CAC-3′; and E-box, 5′-CTA GAA CAC GCA GAT G CAG T-3′. This assay was performed essentially as described (27Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The 100-base pair TK promoter probe, as used in EMSA, and protein A-Sepharose-bound RIZ (P4E1) immunoprecipitation products were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 200 μl of binding buffer as described for EMSA. The reaction was washed three times with binding buffer, processed as described (27Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide TBE gel or 1% agarose TBE gel, followed by autoradiography. During the course of experiments examining the transcriptional regulatory function of RIZ proteins, we found that a commonly used reporter plasmid (pBLCAT2) was consistently repressed by RIZgene products in transient transfections in 3T3 cells (Fig.1). Both RIZ1 and RIZ2 proteins can similarly repress the promoter in a dose-dependent manner. The plasmids (p3RIZr and p3RIZrKK) used for transient expression of RIZ1 and RIZ2 proteins have been previously described; the amount of RIZ1 protein produced from plasmid p3RIZr is similar to that of RIZ2 from plasmid p3RIZrKK (3Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The construct pBLCAT2 contains the −105 to +51 sequences of the HSV-TK promoter (24Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Inspection of the sequence revealed no MTE element (GTCATATGAC), the known binding site for RIZ2/MTB-Zf. The data suggest that RIZ can repress transcription independent of binding to the MTE DNA element. RIZ proteins contain eight zinc finger motifs of the C2-H2 and C2-HC classes that are well known DNA-binding motifs; one such motif can be sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (28Berg J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It is likely that the MTE site might represent only one of the DNA-binding sites to which RIZ could bind. We thus examined whether RIZ proteins could directly bind to HSV-TK promoter, which might, at least in part, be responsible for the repression in Fig. 1. For these experiments, several GST fusion proteins containing various RIZ zinc finger motifs were expressed inE. coli and purified as shown in Fig.2 B. GST fusion protein of zf7–8 migrated slower than predicted in SDS gel; this is likely a result of anomalous migration that is also displayed by full-length RIZ proteins (1Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We next examined the DNA-binding activities of these GST fusion proteins using HSV-TK promoter probe. As shown in Fig. 2 C, dose-dependent binding was observed for GST-RIZ-Zf1–3 protein containing the amino-terminal three zinc finger motifs. No binding activity was observed for zinc finger 4–6 or 7–8 GST fusion proteins. The results show that the amino-terminal three zinc finger motifs of RIZ can directly bind to HSV-TK promoter. To examine whether full-length RIZ1 protein could also bind to HSV-TK, we performed DNA immunoprecipitation assay. Nuclear extracts prepared from p3RIZr- or pcDNA3-transfected 3T3 cells were first immunoprecipitated with P4E1 monoclonal antibody or M73 anti-E1A antibody serving as negative control. The protein A-Sepharose bound products were then incubated with HSV-TK DNA probe. DNA-binding was specifically observed for RIZ1 but not for vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that full-length RIZ1 can bind to HSV-TK. Whether this is a direct interaction requires future experiments using purified full-length RIZ proteins. The HSV-TK promoter is one of the best characterized eukaryotic promoters. Two types of DNA elements, Sp-1 or GC-rich (GGGCGG), and CTF (CCAAT) sites, have been well established to be essential for the expression of HSV-TK (19McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). Inspection of the sequence also revealed an E-box like element CAGATG that partly resembles the core sequence of MTE element GTCATATGAC. We next asked whether the binding as shown in Fig. 2 could be mediated by one or more of these elements. Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing each site were used to compete for binding to HSV-TK promoter probe in EMSA assays (Fig. 3 B). A consensus Sp-1 site oligonucleotide inhibited binding in a dose-dependent manner. A mutant oligonucleotide with a “GG” to “TT” substitution in the Sp-1 binding site weakly inhibited binding only at high dose. Both the CTF and the E-box oligonucleotides derived from HSV-TK did not significantly inhibit binding. The results show that GC-box Sp-1 site mediates binding of HSV-TK promoter to RIZ. Binding of RIZ protein to Sp-1 site was also more directly demonstrated by EMSA assays using Sp-1 oligonucleotide as probe (Fig. 3 C). A typical transcriptional repressor contains both a DNA-binding domain and a repressor domain. Results described above mapped a GC-rich DNA-binding domain to zinc finger 1–3 of RIZ. To determine whether RIZ1 protein also encodes a repressor domain, we made several deletion mutants of RIZ1. Mutant p3RIZrB (amino acid 1–901) expressing the amino-terminal half of RIZ1 protein (amino acid 1–901) was found to be sufficient for repression; mutant p3RIZrA (amino acid 1–659) showed 2–4-fold less repression activity than p3RIZrB (Fig.4 A). The result suggested that amino acid 659–901 might encode transcriptional repressor activity. To show that repression by p3RIZrB also requires DNA-binding, we constructed mutant p3RIZrBΔZf1–3 that deleted zinc finger 1–3 region (amino acid 216–575) from p3RIZrB. This deletion completely abolished repression activity (Fig. 4 A). Similar levels of expression of these mutant proteins were confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4 B). The DNA binding activities of these mutant proteins were also examined by DNA immunoprecipitation assay using antibody P4E1, which can immunoprecipitate all these mutant proteins. As expected, mutant p3RIZrA and p3RIZrB retained DNA binding but p3RIZrBΔZf1–3 showed no activity (Fig. 4 C). The results suggest that repression by RIZ1 requires an intact DNA-binding domain as well as a repressor domain. We next asked whether the repressor domain can also function when linked to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. The GAL4 system for mapping transcriptional regulatory motifs was used (26Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Several GAL4-(1–147)-DNA-binding domain fusion proteins of RIZ1 were constructed. These fusion protein constructs were assayed by using pGAL4-TK-CAT construct as reporter, which contains five copies of GAL4 binding sites linked to the HSV-TK promoter. Similar to results of Fig.4, pGRIZ1-(18–901) fusion protein strongly repressed transcription but pGRIZ1-(18–659) did so only weakly (Fig.5 A). Amino acids 738–948 were found to be sufficient to confer repression function to GAL4-(1–147) protein, demonstrating that this region encodes repressor activity. This region has been noted to contain putative GTPase and SH3 motifs (1Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To examine whether some of these conserved sequence motifs might play a role in repression function, two point mutations were generated. The point mutation K755N altered a conserved residue in the G1 motif of the putative GTPase domain and did not affect repression. The point mutation L745P that alters the SH3 motif completely disrupted repression activity. Immunoblot analysis of transfected cells showed that these different GAL4 fusion constructs expressed similar levels of proteins (Fig. 5 B). The results suggest that sequences encoding the putative SH3 motif but not the GTPase motif might be involved in repressor function. The results described above suggest that RIZ proteins may function to repress promoters containing GC-rich Sp-1 sites. To test a distinct promoter regulated by Sp-1, we analyzed the effect of RIZ on the SV40 early promoter, which is primarily controlled by Sp-1 sites (19McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 29Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Two reporter constructs were tested: pGL3-promoter, which contains the SV40 early promoter linked to the luciferase gene, and pGL3-control, which also contains the SV40 enhancer in addition to the promoter. As shown in Fig. 6 A, RIZ1 efficiently repressed both reporters (3–4-fold), whereas RIZ2 repressed weakly (∼1.5-fold). Immunoblot analysis showed that similar levels of RIZ1 and RIZ2 proteins were produced by transient transfection (Fig. 6 B). The results suggest a role for PR in regulating the transcriptional repressor function of RIZ proteins. The predicted protein structure and the ways through which theRIZ/G3B/MTB-Zf gene was isolated suggest that this gene might function as a DNA-binding transcription factor. MTB-Zf or RIZ2 has previously been shown to bind to the MTE element GTCATATGAC and to function as a weak transcription activator (16Muraosa Y. Takahashi K. Yoshizawa M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that RIZ gene products can bind to a different type of DNA element and function to repress transcription. We show that RIZ gene products can efficiently repress the transcriptional function of HSV-TK promoter, one of the best characterized eukaryotic promoters. The Sp-1 and CTF sites are well established essential elements for basal expression of this promoter (19McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Disruptions of either element impaired promoter function (30McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of repression of HSV-TK by RIZ probably involves direct binding of RIZ proteins to the Sp-1 sites of the promoter. We show that RIZ proteins could directly interact with this promoter which can be blocked by consensus Sp-1 oligonucleotide. We also show that the DNA-binding motif of RIZ is required for repression of HSV-TK. Definitive proof for a role of binding to GC-rich elements requires demonstration of loss of RIZ-mediated repression as a result of Sp-1 site mutation. Here, the requirement of Sp-1 sites for basal expression as demonstrated previously (30McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) could make such an experiment uninformative. An impaired basal activity caused by Sp-1-site mutation may obscure RIZ repression effects. Nevertheless, demonstrating site dependence represents an important future study. It should be noted that several factors other than Sp-1 can also bind to GC-rich motifs such as E2F1 (31Shin E.K. Tevosian S.G. Yee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12261-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and others (20Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). If DNA binding is directly involved in RIZ repression of HSV-TK, a simple mechanism for repression might be through competition with Sp-1 proteins for binding sites. While our results do not rule out this passive mechanism, two lines of evidence suggest that RIZ exerts repression through an active mechanism. First, truncation mutant p3RIZrA showed significantly impaired repression relative to truncation mutant p3RIZrB. While they differ by the central region of RIZ which encodes repressor activity, both mutant proteins contain zinc finger motifs 1–3, which were sufficient for binding to HSV-TK. The observation suggests that DNA-binding alone cannot confer maximal repression. Second, conforming to the commonly observed modular nature of transcriptional regulatory domains, the repressor region of RIZ (amino acid 738–948) could act in a heterologous context. Fusion of this region to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain generated a GAL4-binding site-dependent repressor. As noted previously (1Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), this region of RIZ bears sequence similarity to the consensus sequence of SH3 and GTPase motifs. However, functional significance of this similarity remains unclear. It appears that a GTPase function is unlikely involved in repressor function. The mutant protein p3RIZrB-(1–901), lacking part of the conserved GTPase structure (missing the G4 motif, TQPD), retained full repressor function. A point mutation (K755N), changing the conserved Lys residue in the G1 motif of GTPase domain, did not affect repressor function but is known to disrupt GTP binding of other GTPases (32Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). In contrast, another point mutation (L745P) outside the GTPase domain completely abolished repressor function. Although substituting to Pro may appear to represent a drastic change, this region is Pro-rich to begin with (Fig.5 C). The result seems to implicate a role for SH3 sequence because the mutated residue is conserved among different SH3 motifs. Evidence for a role of SH3 requires future demonstration of SH3 function for this region, such as binding to proline-rich peptides (33Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistent with binding to Sp-1 site, we show that RIZ1 can also efficiently repress the SV40 early promoter, another well characterized eukaryotic promoter whose function is primarily governed by Sp-1 sites (19McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 29Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Using SV40 promoter as a model, we also show that RIZ1 is a stronger repressor than RIZ2. This demonstrates a functional difference between a PR-plus and a PR-minus “twin” protein and suggests a role for PR in modulating protein function. How PR domain might confer a stronger repression function on RIZ1 protein represents an important future investigation. The PR domain appeared not to have intrinsic repressor function: the deletion mutant p3RIZrA protein contains PR and DNA-binding domain and yet is a much weaker repressor than the mutant p3RIZrB, which contains repressor domain. Also, no repression activity was found for a GAL4-PR fusion protein (data not shown). 3G. Shao and S. Huang, unpublished data. These observations suggest that PR domain might be indirectly involved in transcriptional repression. It is not clear why the difference between RIZ1 and RIZ2 as seen for the SV40 early promoter was not observed for the HSV-TK promoter. This may indicate a dependence for RIZ protein function on promoter context. Indeed, some promoters were not affected by RIZ proteins, such as the CMV promoter in pCMVβ reporter mentioned in Experimental Procedures. Certain promoter can even be activated by RIZ as in the case of human heme-oxygenase-1 gene promoter (16Muraosa Y. Takahashi K. Yoshizawa M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We note that this promoter contains a single Sp-1 site, but this site appears dispensable for basal expression (34Muraosa Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7881-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the emerging theme that promoter function is determined by specific combination or interaction of multiple factors assembled on a specific promoter (35Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that other PR domain genes also function in transcription repression. The PRDI-BF1/BLIMP1 gene has been shown to repress transcription through competition for DNA-binding sites with transcription activators (12Keller A.D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It remains to be examined whether it also contains a repressor domain. The EVI1 gene has been shown to repress transcription through competition with positive factors for DNA binding sites (36Kreider B.L. Orkin S.H. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6454-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been shown recently to contain a repressor domain that is required for its transforming activity (10Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It will be important to examine whether MDS1-EVI1 might function as a better or worse repressor relative to EVI1, which might provide a molecular rational for the specific disruption of MDS1-EVI1 PR in leukemogenesis. The repressor domain of EVI1 bears no similarity to that of RIZ and has been noted to be proline-rich (10Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is a common feature of some repressor domains (37Cowell I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The repressor region of RIZ has multiple prolines but is clearly not the most proline-rich region of the protein. It is intriguing that the RIZ repressor region resembles SH3 domain, which is known to bind to proline-rich peptides. As transcriptional activation or repression domains are known to act through protein-protein contact, it is not inconceivable that a SH3-proline-type interaction could be involved in the mechanisms of transcriptional repressor domain action. Because GC-rich elements are extremely common in cellular gene promoters, the results presented here suggest a role for RIZ proteins in the regulation of a potentially large number of cellular genes. In particular, many growth-regulated genes are characterized by GC-rich and TATA-less promoters including oncogenes, growth factors, and their receptors, transcription factors, and housekeeping enzymes (20Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases where it has been studied, the GC-rich element appears to be essential for either basal expression or for activation in response to growth regulatory signals. Future investigations will be needed to determine whether RIZ proteins might repress cellular growth-regulated genes and in turn exert control over cell growth.

Thus, PKA-anchor protein complexes may be involved in controlling these crucial biological processes. Evaluation of this proposition requires knowledge of PKA binding/targeting proteins in the fly. We now report the discovery and characterization of cDNAs encoding a novel, DrosophilaA kinase anchor protein, DAKAP550. DAKAP550 is a large (>2300 amino acids) acidic protein that is maximally expressed in anterior tissues. It binds regulatory subunits (RII) of both mammalian andDrosophila PKAII isoforms. The tethering region of DAKAP550 includes two proximal, but non-contiguous RII-binding sites (B1 and B2). The B1 domain (residues 1406–1425) binds RII ∼20-fold more avidly than B2 (amino acids 1350–1369). Affinity-purified anti-DAKAP550 IgGs were exploited to demonstrate that the anchor protein is expressed in many cells in nearly all tissues throughout the lifespan of the fly. However, DAKAP550 is highly enriched and asymmetrically positioned in subpopulations of neurons and in apical portions of cells in gut and trachea. The combination of RII (PKAII) binding activity with differential expression and polarized localization is consistent with a role for DAKAP550 in creating target loci for the reception of signals carried by cAMP. The DAKAP550 gene was mapped to the 4F1.2 region of the X chromosome; flies that carry a deletion for this portion of the X chromosome lack DAKAP550 protein.

In part, targeting is accomplished by establishing a non-uniform distribution of PKA molecules within cells.

Prototypic neuronal anchor proteins (AKAPs 75, 79, and 150) possess a binding site for regulatory subunits (RII) of PKAII isoforms and distinct domains that non-covalently link AKAP·PKAII complexes to the microtubule-based dendritic cytoskeleton of neurons and the cortical actin cytoskeleton of non-neuronal cells (5Rubin C.S.

Thus, anchored PKAII is placed in proximity with a signal generator (adenylate cyclase) and multiple PKA substrate/effector proteins (e.g.myosin light chain kinase, microtubule-associated protein-2, ion channels, serpentine receptors that couple with Gs and adenylate cyclase). This arrangement generates target sites for cAMP action (5Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 6Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol.

A distinct group of RII-binding proteins mediates association of PKAII isoforms with mitochondria, Golgi membranes, peroxisomes, centrioles, and other organelles in numerous cell types (5Rubin C.S.

Although substantial progress has been made in identifying and characterizing AKAPs, knowledge of anchor protein functions in vivo is limited. One approach toward linking AKAP structure with physiological function is to complement studies on PKA anchoring in mammalian systems with investigations on a lower organism that is amenable to concerted biochemical, cellular, molecular, and genetic analysis. Drosophila melanogaster provides an attractive model system because classical and molecular genetics have implicated PKA in signaling pathways that (a) generate cell or tissue polarity and/or (b) require accumulation of PKA at a discrete intracellular location (17Perrimon N. Cell. 1995; 80: 517-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Li W. Ohlmeyer J.T. Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Cell. 1995; 80: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2986-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Lane M.E.

For example, localized activation of PKA negatively modulates hedgehog signaling during Drosophila development. Hedgehog is a secreted protein that binds with serpentine receptors in plasma membrane. Receptor occupancy activates a signaling pathway that elicits expression of genes (dpp, wg etc.) that control anterior-posterior patterning in developing tissues. PKA accumulates selectively along segments of plasma membrane (or underlying cytoskeleton) that constitute adhesive junctions between oocytes and supporting nurse cells (20Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Mech. Dev. 1995; 49: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Localized PKA activity appears to be essential for assembly and stabilization of intercellular bridges at these junctions. The bridges enable the flow of critical proteins and RNAs from nurse cells to developing oocytes. Finally, PKA-mediated phosphorylation controls a re-orientation of microtubule organizing centers in germ cells during oogenesis (19Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2986-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Remodeling of the microtubule-based cytoskeleton generates a polarized structure that enables differential segregation of specific mRNAs to anterior or posterior locations via kinesin motors. Subsequent translation of spatially-segregated mRNAs establishes gradients of proteins (e.g. biocoid, oskar) that are essential for normal morphogenesis and development. It has been suggested that a subset of PKA molecules, that is anchored at the microtubule organizing center, governs the polarity and positioning of microtubules via the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (19Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2986-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cited studies suggest that PKA-anchor protein complexes may be intimately involved in controlling critical aspects ofDrosophila reproduction and development. No information is currently available concerning RII (PKAII)-binding proteins in the fly. Thus, initial steps in evaluation of the PKA anchoring model entail the identification and basic characterization of DrosophilaAKAPs (DAKAPs). We now report the discovery of a novelDrosophila AKAP (DAKAP550), the cloning and sequencing of DAKAP550 cDNA, the differential expression of DAKAP550 protein during embryogenesis, the chromosomal location of the DAKAP550 gene, and the mapping of a binding site in DAKAP550 that complexes both mammalian and Drosophila RII subunits. Expression libraries of D. melanogaster (Canton S strain) cDNAs were searched for inserts encoding A kinase anchor proteins by both functional (RII binding) assays and classical DNA hybridization. cDNAs in the libraries were generated by reverse transcription of template mRNAs isolated from embryos 0–24 h after fertilization. Initially, cDNA libraries in bacteriophages λZAP (provided by Dr. R. Reinke, Deptartment of Developmental Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) and λgt11 (CLONTECH) were screened by the procedure of Bregman et al. (8Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method detects AKAP-β-galactosidase fusion proteins in phage plaques by their ability to bind 32P-labeled RIIβ. Six recombinant phage clones (see Fig. 2, below) that contain overlapping cDNA sequences were retrieved from an initial population of 106 plaques and were characterized. A 5′ EcoRI-NcoI fragment (300 bp) from clone Z cDNA (Fig. 2) was employed as a template to synthesize a random-primed 32P-labeled probe for further screening. Screening via DNA hybridization (22Lu X. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yielded 13 independent cDNA clones from a 5′ stretched cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 (CLONTECH). Four of these cDNAs were characterized as described under “Results.” A filter, which contains a gridded array of DNA fragments (in cosmids) that span the Drosophila genome (23Hoheisel J.D. Lennon G.G. Zehetner G. Lehrach H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. J. Hoheisel (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). Two overlapping genomic DNA clones (named 64G6 and 81C9) hybridized strongly with each of three 32P-labeled cDNA probes: the cDNA insert from clone II-1 and the 2- and 1-kbp cDNA fragments released from clone number 8 by EcoRI digestion (see Fig. 2, below). Collectively, these cDNAs encode a segment of DAKAP550 that includes >2000 amino acids. Cosmids 64G6 and 81C9 were obtained from Dr. J. Hoheisel. Complementary DNA inserts from recombinant λZAP phage were isolated in the plasmid pBluescript SK (Stratagene) via M13 phage-promoted, plasmid excision inEscherichia coli (24Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts obtained from λgt11 phage clones were subcloned into the plasmid pGEM7Z (Promega). Nested deletions were prepared by exonuclease III digestion according to the procedure of Henikoff (25Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Intact and truncated cDNAs and genomic DNA fragments were sequenced by a dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using T7, T3, SP6, and custom oligonucleotide primers. Taq Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA products were separated and analyzed in a model 377 automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) in the DNA Analysis Facility of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountainview, CA) and BLAST programs (27Altschul S.R. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70322) Google Scholar) provided by the NCBI server (National Institutes of Health). Overlay binding assays have been described in several papers (8Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a Western blot is probed with 32P-labeled RIIβ (using a subunit concentration of 0.3 nm and 2 × 105 cpm of 32P-radioactivity/ml) and RIIβ-binding proteins are visualized by autoradiography. Results were quantified by scanning laser densitometry (Pharmacia LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer) or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (28Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polytene chromosomes were isolated from salivary glands of second instar Drosophila larvae as described by Ashburner (29Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 44-49Google Scholar). DAKAP550 cDNAs were labeled with biotinyl-16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) via DNA polymerase I-catalyzed nick translation. Chromosomes were hybridized with the biotinylated cDNAs indicated under “Results” for 16 h at 58 °C, using conditions described by Ashburner (29Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 44-49Google Scholar). Gene-cDNA complexes were visualized by using a Detek I-horseradish peroxidase kit (Enzo Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The basis for detection of the gene is that biotinylated DAKAP550 cDNA hybridized with complementary sequences in DAKAP550 exons will avidly bind streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase. Subsequent incubation with diaminobenzidine and H2O2 results in peroxidase-catalyzed synthesis of an insoluble precipitate at the site of cDNA-genomic DNA hybridization. Photographs of hybridized, peroxidase-stained chromosomes were obtained with a Zeiss axioplan microscope, using phase-contrast optics. The peroxidase-generated precipitate appears as an intense black stripe on the chromosome (see Fig. 4, below). A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1472–1676 in DAKAP550 (see Fig. 3 below) was excised from clone number 8 (Fig. 2) by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and was subcloned into the expression plasmid pGEX2T (Pharmacia), which was cleaved with the same enzymes. This places cDNA encoding the partial DAKAP550 polypeptide downstream from and in-frame with the 3′ terminus of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in the vector. Transcription of the GST-fusion gene is driven by an inducibletac promoter. A high level of chimeric GST-partial DAKAP550 polypeptide (designated fu-A) was produced when E. coliDH5α was transformed with recombinant pGEX2T plasmid and then induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-glactopyranoside as described previously (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After induction, bacteria were disrupted in a French press and the soluble fu-A protein (∼5 mg) was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding residues 1001–1676 in DAKAP550 (Fig. 3) was cloned into the expression plasmid pET14b as described previously (15Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This enables isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced synthesis of a (His)6-tagged partial DAKAP550 fusion protein (designated fu-B) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with recombinant pET14b. The fusion protein is described in more detail under “Results.” Induced E. coli BL21 were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fu-B protein was recovered in the soluble fraction and purified to near-homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography as previously reported (31Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several batches of purified fu-B (∼6 mg of protein from 1 liter of E. coli) were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as described previously (9Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified fu-A protein (see above) was injected into rabbits (0.35 mg of initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of three booster injections) at Covance Laboratories (Vienna, VA) to generate antisera. Serum was collected at 3-week intervals. Antibodies that bind GST were eliminated by passing serum over a column of GST-Sepharose 4B (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, adsorbed serum was applied to a column of fu-B Sepharose 4B (see above). The fu-B protein includes the complete sequence of fu-A (and therefore, all fu-A epitopes). The resin was extensively washed and anti-DAKAP550 IgGs were then isolated by successive elutions at pH 2.5 and 11.8, as described previously (30Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis was performed via exonuclease III digestion or polymerase chain reaction as described previously (11Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Amplified cDNAs were cloned in pET14b and fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified, as described previously (31Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Intact Drosophila or separated fly heads and bodies were suspended in 4 volumes of buffer A (20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 40 μg/ml leupeptin) and disrupted in a Polytron homogenizer (two 30-s cycles of homogenization at the maximum setting). All operations were performed at 0–4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant solution (cytosol) was collected. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of buffer A and then was homogenized and centrifuged as described above. The resulting supernatant solution (designated “wash”) was collected; the pelleted, particulate fraction of Drosophila homogenates was dispersed in the starting volume of buffer A by a final round of homogenization. The concentration of protein in subcellular fractions fromDrosophila and in purified samples of partial DAKAP550 polypeptides (see above) was determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in 5.5, 10, or 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (8Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylase b (M r = 97,000), transferrin (77,000), albumin (68,000), ovalbumin (45,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), and cross-linked phosphorylase (195,000–584,000) were used as standards for the estimation of M rvalues. Size-fractionated proteins were transferred from denaturing polyacrylamide gels to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.) as described previously (8Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were blocked, incubated with affinity-purified IgGs directed against DAKAP550 (1:2000, relative to serum), and washed as described previously (11Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-IgG complexes were visualized by an indirect chemiluminescence procedure (28Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signals were recorded on Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. No signals were observed when Western blots were probed with antibodies in the presence of 5 μg/ml fu-A or fu-B protein (see above). The Canton S strain was used for all experiments. A mutant line (DfC1) JC70, which is deficient in the X chromosome region 4C15-16; 5A1-2, was obtained from the Bowling GreenDrosophila Stock Center (Bowling Green, OH).Drosophila carrying ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations in the 4F1.2 region of the X chromosome (fs(1)456v24, fs(1) M60) were generously provided by Dr. N. Perrimon (Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School) and Dr. R. Nagoshi (Department of Biology, University of Iowa). Embryos (0–24 h) were collected, dechorionated, and fixed according to the procedure of Mitchison and Sedat (34Mitchison T.J. Sedat J. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Specimens were blocked, washed, and then incubated with anti-DAKAP550 IgGs for 16 h at 4 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline), 20% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 as described previously (12Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-DAKAP IgGs were used at 1:160 dilution (relative to serum). After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, samples were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep IgGs directed against rabbit immunoglobulins (Bio-Rad) in the buffer specified above. DAKAP550·IgG complexes were detected by incubation of the specimens with diaminobenzidine and H2O2 (12Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the presence of these substrates, peroxidase catalyzes the synthesis of an insoluble reaction product that is observed as a dark precipitate by light microscopy. To determine whether Drosophila expresses AKAPs, cytosolic and particulate proteins from fly embryos were size-fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and incubated with 32P-labeled bovine RIIβ. In this “overlay assay” binding sites in immobilized AKAPs renature and sequester radiolabeled RII subunits (8Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiography revealed a group of cytosolic RII-binding proteins with molecular weights ranging from 70,000 to >200,000 (Fig.1, lane 2). Candidate cDNA clones for Drosophila AKAPs (DAKAPs) were retrieved from an embryo expression library (in bacteriophage λZAP) by using a modification of the overlay assay (8Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five cross-hybridizing clones were isolated (Fig. 2). After recombinant pBluescript phagemids were excised from λZAP (24Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), nested deletions of the cDNAs were prepared by exonuclease III digestion and religation. Sequencing of these overlapping cDNAs yielded an open reading frame of 3.2 kbp. To obtain contiguous flanking cDNA, a 5′-stretched embryonic cDNA expression library (λgt11) was screened for β-galactosidase fusion proteins that bound32P-RIIβ with high affinity. A cDNA named clone Z was obtained (Fig. 2). Subsequently, a 5′-terminalEcoRI-NcoI fragment (330 bp) from clone Z was employed as a template for synthesis of random-primed,32P-labeled cDNA. This probe was used to re-screen the λgt11 library via DNA hybridization. Four of 13 positive recombinant phage contained cDNAs that extended the 5′ end of the open reading frame (clones II-1, II-2, II-5, and II-7, Fig.2). Comparison of sequences for clones II-1 and II-7 revealed a 618-bp deletion in the latter cDNA (Fig. 2). This is probably due to alternative retention/excision of an exon because sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA fragment deleted in clone II-7 correspond to consensus splice donor and acceptor sites. Alternative splicing was not detected at other sites in DAKAP cDNAs. Exhaustive screening of available Drosophila cDNA libraries failed to yield clones containing contiguous segments of upstream or downstream cDNA. Sequencing of fragments of the DAKAP gene enabled extension of the coding region ∼900 bp downstream. Unfortunately, the presence of very long introns at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DAKAP gene have impeded determination of the translation initiation and termination codons. Nevertheless, a composite 7.1-kbp DNA coding region has been established for a novel, invertebrate PKA-binding protein by assembling overlapping DNA sequences. Each segment of DNA was sequenced at le"

Soluble CaM kinase II was autophosphorylated with ATP in the presence of Ca2+and calmodulin, and then it was incubated with PSDs. Autophosphorylated CaM kinase II was precipitated with PSDs by centrifugation. The kinase that was not autophosphorylated did not precipitate with PSDs. These results indicate that the soluble previously autophosphorylated CaM kinase II associates with PSDs and forms PSD-CaM kinase II complex. A maximum of about 60 μg of soluble CaM kinase II bound to 1 mg of PSD protein under the experimental conditions. Ca2+-independent activity generated by autophosphorylation of the kinase was retained in the PSD-CaM kinase II complex. The CaM kinase II thus associated with PSDs phosphorylated a number of PSD proteins in both the absence and presence of Ca2+. When the CaM kinase II-PSD complex was incubated at 30 °C, its Ca2+-independent activity was gradually decreased. This decrease was correlated with dephosphorylation of the kinase and its release from PSD-CaM kinase II complex.

Neuronal CaM kinase II regulates a broad array of nerve functions, including the synthesis and secretion of neurotransmitters, receptor function, structural modification of the cytoskeleton, axonal transport, long term potentiation, and gene expression (6Nairn A.C.

The enzyme was originally isolated from rat brain, and four isoforms (α, β, γ, δ) have now been identified using molecular techniques (9Lin C.R. Kapiloff M.S. Durgerian S. Takemoto K. Russo A.F.

The α and β isoforms are predominantly and exclusively expressed in the nervous system, whereas the γ and δ isoforms are expressed in all tissues including brain. Autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II has profound effects on its activity (13Saitoh T. Schwartz J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. Cell. 1986; 44: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner, CaM kinase II is converted to a partially Ca2+-independent form. Thr-286 and -287 of the α and β isoforms, respectively, are autophosphorylation sites that generate Ca2+-independent activity (15Fong Y.-L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Presumably, protein phosphatases contribute to the regulation of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation in vivo by dephosphorylating the site. Subcellular localization and compartmentalization of specific proteins generally play a significant role in the functioning of the signal transduction pathway. Consistent with its diverse roles, CaM kinase II exhibits broad distribution within neurons, and discrete localization of CaM kinase II may play an important role in its physiological function. It is concentrated at postsynaptic densities (PSDs), which are specializations of the submembranous cytoskeleton and are visible in the electron microscopy as tight complexes of post-synaptic junctional proteins. The PSDs are believed to be involved in the regulation of synaptic events such as receptor function, structural modification, and synaptic plasticity (19Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The most abundant protein in PSDs has been identified as the α isoform of CaM kinase II (20Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 21Kelly P.T. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The concentration of a calcium-regulated kinase in PSDs might modulate synaptic activity in response to a rise in postsynaptic calcium levels. In contrast to the soluble CaM kinase II, most of the PSD CaM kinase II appear to be inactive (23Rich D.P. Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Sahyoun N. Le Vine III, H. Bronson D. Siegel-Greenstein F. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible whether originally all the PSD CaM kinase molecules have a low specific activity, or the majority of the kinase molecule is inactive, or the active site of the kinase is masked in the PSD structure. However, PSD CaM kinase II is very similar to soluble CaM kinase II in terms of regulation by autophosphorylation (24Sahyoun N. Le Vine III, H. Bronson D. Siegel-Greenstein F. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rich D.P. Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.S. Mol. Cell.

Recently, we demonstrated that PSD CaM kinase II was solubilized and activated 4- to 5-fold by limited proteolytic digestion with prior autophosphorylation, suggesting that many of the active sites of PSD CaM kinase II are masked in the PSD structure (27Yoshimura Y. Nomura T. Yamauchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To elucidate the relationship between soluble and PSD CaM kinase II, we investigated the association of soluble CaM kinase II with PSDs and the effect of autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II on this association. [γ-32P]ATP and125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Fab′)2 were purchased from Amersham Corp. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse goat IgG was from Bio-Rad, immunoblot chemiluminescence reagent was from NEN Life Science Products, okadaic acid was from Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan, microcystin-LR was from Life Technologies, Inc., and protein phosphatase 2A from human red cells was from Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan. The CaM kinase II substrate syntide 2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK) was synthesized and purified as described (28Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II was prepared through the step of Sepharose CL 4B column from rat forebrain as described previously (5Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and concentrated to about 8 mg of protein/ml by ultrafiltration. CaM kinase II was also purified to homogeneity (5Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The specific enzyme activity of CaM kinase II of partially purified and homogeneous preparations was 270 ± 9.9 and about 11,000 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. A monoclonal antibody specific to the α isoform of CaM kinase II (3E11) was raised as described previously (29Ichikawa T. Sekihara S. Ohsako S. Hirata Y. Yamauchi T. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 1992; 5: 383-390Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PSD fraction was prepared from rat forebrain by two methods. One was the conventional method as described by Wu et al. (30Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The other was the method of Wu et al. (30Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as modified by Suzuki et al. (31Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). According to the latter method, the forebrain of Wistar rat (about 250 g of body weight) was quickly dissected and then immediately homogenized at 600 rpm at 0 °C in 4 ml of a solution containing 0.32 msucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm NaHCO3. It should be noted that the homogenization finished within 60 s after decapitation. Homogenates of about 16 rat forebrains were pooled, and a crude synaptosomal fraction was isolated. The crude synaptosomal fraction was exposed to 0.5% Triton X-100 and then separated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The yield of the PSD fraction was about 3.9 mg of total PSD protein. The α isoform of CaM kinase II in the PSD fraction accounted for about 3% of the total protein, which is consistent with previously published results (31Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This preparation of PSDs was used for the association of CaM kinase II. The specific enzyme activity of PSD CaM kinase II was 75 ± 3.0 nmol/min/mg protein, which was about 3-fold lower than that of the PSDs (195 ± 4.0 nmol/min/mg protein) prepared by the method of Wuet al. (30Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction of rat liver was used as a control of the cytoskeletal fraction obtained from a non-neuronal organ, since a cytoskeletal fraction from liver was not obtained by the same method as the purification of PSDs from the forebrain. Microsomal fraction of liver was prepared by differential centrifugation. Rat liver was homogenized in solution containing with 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm NaHCO3. After centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged 10,000 × for 30 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged 105,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitate was obtained and used as microsomal fraction. Protein concentration was determined as described (32Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. CaM kinase II activity was assayed in terms of the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of syntide 2 as described (26Ochiishi T. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Brain Res. 1992; 610: 97-107Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3–5 × 105 cpm), 8 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 20 μm syntide 2, 2 μm calmodulin, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, and a suitable amount of enzyme in a total volume of 50 μl. Ca2+-independent activity was assayed under the same conditions except for the presence of 1 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 min. One unit of CaM kinase II activity was defined as 1 nmol of phosphate transferred per min under the standard conditions. Autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II was carried out at 0 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, 50 μm nonradioactive ATP or [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 μmcalmodulin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm okadaic acid, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin A), and a suitable amount of CaM kinase II in a total volume of 50 μl. In some experiments, ATPγS was used in place of ATP to prevent dephosphorylation of CaM kinase II by protein phosphatase. When CaM kinase II was autophosphorylated with ATPγS, the reaction was carried out at 0 °C for 30 min under the same conditions. Non-phosphorylated CaM kinase II was prepared without ATP under the same conditions. After incubation for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 67 mm EDTA. The PSD fraction (about 30 μg of protein) was added to either an autophosphorylated or non-phosphorylated reaction mixture terminated with EDTA in a total volume of 60 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 0 °C, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 0 °C. The precipitate was washed once with 200 μl of 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10% ethylene glycol, and 0.05% Tween 40, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate was then suspended in the same buffer and used as PSD-CaM kinase II complex. Under the conditions, PSD protein was almost completely recovered in the precipitate. If the precipitate was solid and difficult to suspend homogeneously with a vortex, the suspension was briefly sonicated. PSD-CaM kinase II complex was incubated at 30 °C in 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.05% Tween 40, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). After appropriate times for incubation, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 36,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. To avoid the incomplete precipitation of PSDs, the force of centrifugation was 2-fold stronger than that for isolation of PSD-CaM kinase II complex. The amount of CaM kinase II released to the supernatant was measured. SDS-PAGE proceeded on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (29Ichikawa T. Sekihara S. Ohsako S. Hirata Y. Yamauchi T. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 1992; 5: 383-390Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with 5% non-fat skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 1 h, and then with 3 μg/ml of a monoclonal antibody specific to the α isoform of CaM kinase II at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the transblots were incubated with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (1:3000 dilution) for 60 min at room temperature. CaM kinase II was detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. The extent of CaM kinase II α isoform protein associated with PSDs was determined by immunoblotting as described previously (34Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Brain Res. 1992; 593: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The PSD-CaM kinase II complex was separated on SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane; the membrane was then incubated with a monoclonal antibody to the α isoform of CaM kinase II as described above. The transblots were incubated with 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Fab′)2 (2 μCi/ml) for 1 h. The level of protein of radioactive bands was measured by an imaging analyzer BAS 1500 Mac (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo). The concentration of the α protein was calibrated from the standard curve obtained by purified CaM kinase II. The PSD fraction and PSD-CaM kinase II complex were phosphorylated in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2–5 × 106 cpm), 8 mmMg(CH3COO)2, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin A), 2 μmokadaic acid, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 10 mm NaF in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm CaCl2 and 2 μm calmodulin. After phosphorylation, an aliquot of the mixture was withdrawn, mixed with SDS sample mixture, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The level of phosphorylation was measured by an imaging analyzer BAS 1500 Mac. The partially purified CaM kinase II preparation incubated with the PSD fraction at 0 °C for 10 min, and then the PSD fraction was precipitated by centrifugation. The CaM kinase II activity of the precipitate was determined. Upon centrifugation of the mixture, more than 95% PSD protein was recovered in the precipitate. As shown in Fig.1, the activity of CaM kinase II precipitated with PSDs increased about 6-fold as the amount of of CaM kinase II was raised. The specific enzyme activity of CaM kinase II in the precipitate was 511 ± 22.8 nmol/min/mg PSD protein, which was about 2.6-fold higher than that of PSDs prepared by the method of Wuet al. (30Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ca2+-independent activity induced by autophosphorylation of the kinase also increased. If the kinase was not phosphorylated previously, the enzyme activity did not significantly increase. When CaM kinase II was incubated with the microsomal fraction of rat liver, the enzyme activity was not significantly associated with the microsomal fraction whether the enzyme was phosphorylated or not (data not shown). These results indicate that autophosphorylated CaM kinase II specifically binds to PSDs and forms PSD-CaM kinase II complex. The association of CaM kinase II with PSDs was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The α isoform protein of CaM kinase II, a 50-kDa band, increased specifically when the PSD fraction was incubated with autophosphorylated CaM kinase II as shown in Fig.2. The extent to which CaM kinase II associated with PSDs increased as the concentration of CaM kinase II was raised (Fig. 2 A). The protein staining pattern of PSD-CaM kinase II complex was almost the same as that of PSDs except the 50-kDa band, indicating that other cytosolic proteins contained in the preparation of CaM kinase II did not significantly associate with PSDs. Although the 50-kDa band was a major protein of the PSD-CaM kinase II complex, it accounted for only about 8% of the total protein as measured by densitometry. This band did not increase significantly when the PSD fraction was incubated with non-phosphorylated CaM kinase II. Similar results were obtained using CaM kinase II thiophosphorylated with ATPγS (data not shown). Thiophosphorylated CaM kinase II is insensitive to protein phosphatase (14Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. Cell. 1986; 44: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The association of CaM kinase II with PSDs was confirmed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody specific to the α isoform of CaM kinase II (Fig. 2 B) and by autoradiography using CaM kinase II autophosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). The protein band of the β isoform of CaM kinase II (60-kDa band) was not detected by protein staining, but it was detected by autoradiography (data not shown). When the binding of CaM kinase II α isoform protein to PSDs was measured by immunoblotting using 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG, a generally hyperbolic form was observed approaching saturation at 2.5 μm CaM kinase II α polypeptide (Fig.3). Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with an apparent K d of about 1 μm CaM kinase II α polypeptide (about 100 nm holoenzyme) and a B max of about 1.2 nmol of CaM kinase II α polypeptide/mg of PSD protein (about 60 μg of CaM kinase II/mg of PSD protein) under the experimental conditions (Fig. 3). These results indicate that PSD binds to autophosphorylated CaM kinase II but not to non-phosphorylated enzyme. PSD-CaM kinase II complex was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of Ca2+ at 30 °C for 5 min under the standard conditions. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4, a number of PSD proteins of PSD-CaM kinase II complex were phosphorylated in the absence as well as in the presence of Ca2+, and the pattern of phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+ was similar to that in the presence of Ca2+ (lanes 3and 4). Under the same conditions, proteins of control PSDs were not significantly phosphorylated in the absence of Ca2+ (lane 1), whereas some were phosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+ (lane 2). Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of control PSDs was much lower than Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of PSD-CaM kinase II complex. These results suggest that cytosolic CaM kinase II translocates to PSDs and phosphorylates PSD proteins. PSD-CaM kinase II complex was incubated at 30 °C. Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II was gradually decreased as shown in Fig.5 A. After 15 min of incubation, about 70% of the activity was lost. More than 90% of Ca2+-dependent activity was retained. At this time, the reaction mixtures were subjected to autophosphorylating conditions. The Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II associated with PSDs was recovered upon autophosphorylation as shown in Table I. Specifically, it was originally 1.52 nmol/min, decreased to 0.51 nmol/min with incubation (about 33% of original activity), and then the activity recovered to 2.20 nmol/min (about 144% of original activity) upon exposure to autophosphorylating conditions. These results suggest that the decrease in the activity was due to dephosphorylation of the enzyme catalyzed by an endogenous protein phosphatase and that a part of the PSD-CaM kinase II complex was already dephosphorylated during preparation of the complex.Table IInactivation of Ca2+ independent activity of PSD-CaM kinase II complex by incubation and its reactivation by exposure to autophosphorylating conditionsIncubationAssayPSD-CaM kinase II complexPSDsTotal−PSDsCaM kinase II activity (nmol/min)0 min+Ca2+7.16 ± 0.264.81 ± 0.042.35 ± 0.25−Ca2+2.05 ± 0.091.52 ± 0.510.03 ± 0.0115 min+Ca2+6.61 ± 0.024.35 ± 0.142.26 ± 0.28−Ca2+0.54 ± 0.030.51 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.0115 min and then autophosphorylation+Ca2+7.88 ± 0.195.52 ± 0.062.36 ± 0.22−Ca2+2.97 ± 0.102.20 ± 0.160.78 ± 0.06Partially purified CaM kinase II (120 μg of protein) was autophosphorylated with ATP under the standard conditions and incubated with the PSD fraction (30 μg of protein), and then PSD-CaM kinase II complex was isolated.

PSD-CaM kinase II complex was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. After incubation for 15 min, 50 μm ATP and 8 mm Mg(CH3COO)2 were added to the reaction mixture, and autophosphorylation was carried out for 10 min at 0 °C. CaM kinase II activity was determined in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Control experiments were carried out using the PSD fraction without incubation with CaM kinase II. To confirm dephosphorylation of CaM kinase II, PSD-32P-labeled CaM kinase II complex was prepared and then incubated at 30 °C. After the incubation, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Dephosphorylation of the α isoform of32P-labeled CaM kinase II (50-kDa band) was observed depending on the incubation time as shown in Fig. 5 , B andC. The β isoform (60-kDa band) was also dephosphorylated, indicating that PSDs contain a significant amount of protein phosphatase activity. About 40 and 50% of radioactivity was lost at 15 and 30 min of incubation, respectively (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II associated with PSDs was reduced by dephosphorylation. The amount of [32P]phosphate remaining at 15 min was high relative to the decrease in Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II. Dephosphorylation of CaM kinase II was inhibited by 1 μmmicrocystin-LR (cyclic heptapeptide toxin isolated fromMicrocystis aeruginosa), an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (35Ichinose M. Endo S. Critz S.D. Shenolikar S. Byrne J.H. Brain Res. 1990; 533: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 C). PSD-CaM kinase II complex was incubated at 30 °C and then centrifuged. CaM kinase II activity of the supernatant increased depending on the incubation time as shown in Fig.6 A. At 15 min incubation, about 20% CaM kinase II activity was released from the complex. Under this condition, about 60% of Ca2+-independent activity was lost. The extent of release was significantly low relative to the decrease of Ca2+-independent activity and of dephosphorylation, suggesting that the dissociation of CaM kinase II from the complex took place slowly as compared with its formation. Protein phosphatase 2A (6 units/ml) from human red cells did not stimulate dephosphorylation of the CaM kinase II of the complex (data not shown). CaM kinase II activity was not released from control PSDs at all. Thiophosphorylated CaM kinase II is insensitive to protein phosphatase (14Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. Cell. 1986; 44: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). When thiophosphorylated with ATPγS, CaM kinase II was not released to the supernatant to any significant extent (Fig.6 A), consistent with the previous report (14Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. Cell. 1986; 44: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The release of CaM kinase II from its complex with PSD was investigated by immunoblotting (Fig. 6 B). When PSD-CaM kinase II complex was prepared with ATP, CaM kinase II was released from the complex by incubation at 30 °C. But the enzyme was not released to any significant extent when PSD-CaM kinase II complex was prepared with ATPγS. These results indicate that CaM kinase II was released from the complex by dephosphorylation of the kinase. The most abundant protein in PSDs has been identified as the α isoform of CaM kinase II (20Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 21Kelly P.T. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite its potential functional significance, the identity of PSD CaM kinase II and its relationship to the soluble CaM kinase II remain controversial. It has been reported that PSD CaM kinase II is immunologically different from but structurally related to soluble CaM kinase II (36Wu K. Huang Y. Adler J. Black I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PSD CaM kinase II is tightly associated with PSDs and is not solubilized by non-ionic detergents in the active form. Suzuki et al. (31Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), however, demonstrated that cytosolic CaM kinase II translocated rapidly into the PSD fraction after decapitation of rat. The PSD fraction prepared from rat forebrain immediately after dissection (within 30 s after decapitation) contains the α isoform of CaM kinase II at a level of merely 2.7% of total PSD protein, and the content of the protein is increased to about 10% by placing the forebrain on ice for a few minutes. Recently, McNeil and Colbran (37McNeil R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) found 190- and 140-kDa proteins (designated as p190 and p140, respectively) capable of binding CaM kinase II in isolated PSDs by the use of the gel overlay assay. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Thr-286 of the kinase promotes its binding to p190. These results suggest that interaction of CaM kinase II with specific anchoring proteins produces specific effects within cells. However, these studies have not investigated whether CaM kinase II activity, either Ca2+-dependent or independent, correlates with the association of the kinase with PSDs or its dissociation from PSDs. In contrast to the soluble CaM kinase II, most of the PSD CaM kinase II had been considered to be inactive (23Rich D.P. Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Sahyoun N. Le Vine III, H. Bronson D. Siegel-Greenstein F. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we succeeded in demonstrating that many of the active sites of PSD CaM kinase II are masked in the PSD structure (27Yoshimura Y. Nomura T. Yamauchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of the physiological role of PSD-CaM kinase II, we studied the translocation of CaM kinase II and found that cytosolic CaM kinase II translocated reversibly to the PSDs and formed PSD-CaM kinase II complex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. About 60 μg of soluble CaM kinase II bound to 1 mg of PSD protein in the active form, and the specific enzyme activity of the complex was about 511 ± 22.8 nmol/min/mg PSD protein. The kinase activity is about 2.6-fold higher than that of PSDs prepared by the method of Wu et al. (30Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The content of CaM kinase II in PSD-CaM kinase II complex was somewhat lower than that of mPSDp prepared by a conventional method (30Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II activity of mPSDp is completely dependent on Ca2+ and calmodulin and is low compared with that of the soluble CaM kinase II (27Yoshimura Y. Nomura T. Yamauchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Taken together, mPSDp may be associated with PSD irreversibly after decapitation by an unknown mechanism, whereas PSD-CaM kinase II complex may be native and may not be inactivated. McNeill and Colbran (37McNeil R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have reported that 32P-labeled CaM kinase II binds to p190 with an apparent K d of 609 nm (α polypeptide concentration) and aB max of 7.0 pmol of α CaM kinase II polypeptide/mg of cytoskeletal proteins (P2), as determined by gel overlay assay. The apparent K d is similar to our results. The extent of binding of CaM kinase II to PSDs is much lower than that obtained in our results, suggesting that the binding efficiency is underestimated by gel overlay assay. Under our experimental conditions, CaM kinase II was almost specifically autophosphorylated at Thr-286 and Thr-287 of the α and β isoforms, respectively, although it contains some different autophosphorylation sites (8Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). PSDs contain significant quantities of protein phosphatase activity which catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated CaM kinase II at Thr-286/287. The dissociation of CaM kinase II from PSD-CaM kinase II complex is induced by dephosphorylation of CaM kinase II. Although it has been reported that phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates autophosphorylated CaM kinase II (38Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), protein phosphatase 2A from human red cells did not stimulate dephosphorylation of CaM kinase II of the complex. Release of CaM kinase II activity from the complex was about 20%, which was significantly lower than the decrease in Ca2+-independent activity. Ca2+-independent activity was recovered to almost the original level by autophosphorylation, suggesting that the dissociation of CaM kinase II from the complex is slow as compared with its formation. Protein phosphatases may contribute to the regulation of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation in vivo by dephosphorylating the site. Characterization of the protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of the translocation of CaM kinase II in the PSD fraction remains to be determined. CaM kinase II is required for long term potentiation in the hippocampus and acquisition of spatial learning (39Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Wang Y. Science. 1992; 257: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 40Silva A.J. Paylor R. Wehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Science. 1992; 257: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 41Bach M.E. Hawkins R.D. Osman M. Kandel E.R. Mayford M. Cell. 1995; 81: 905-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration mediates the effects of various stimuli on nerve cells. The primary intracellular receptor for Ca2+is calmodulin, and CaM kinase II is one of the major calmodulin targets. Ca2+ concentration may regulate CaM kinase II in discrete subcellular compartments. When Ca2+ increases in postsynapse, CaM kinase II is autophosphorylated and activated and then translocates to PSDs. CaM kinase II associated with PSDs phosphorylates a number of functional proteins of the PSD fraction and may modulate synaptic transmission. The Ca2+-independent activity may prolong the effects triggered by the transient Ca2+ signal after the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. McGladeMcCulloh et al. (42McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.-E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) suggested that activated CaM kinase II in the PSDs phosphorylated α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate/kinate type glutamate receptor resulting in enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness as occurs during synaptic plasticity. After dephosphorylation of CaM kinase II by a phosphatase contained in PSDs, the kinase dissociates gradually from PSDs. Identification and regulation by phosphorylation of CaM kinase II substrates of PSDs may provide insight into the physiological processes regulated by Ca2+ mobilization.

E. & Koren, G. (1994) Neuron12, 615–626). Recently, we showed that expression ofKv1.1N206Tag in the heart of transgenic mice resulted in the creation of mice with prolongation of the surface electrocardiogram's QT interval (London, B., Han, X., Folco, E. & Koren, G. (1996) Biophys. J. 70, A2601). To study the dominant negative mechanism of Kv1.1N206Tag, we overexpressed it in GH3 cells, a pituitary cell line expressing Kv1.5 and Kv1.4. RNase protection analysis comparing the steady-state levels of native Kv1.5 and Kv1.1N206Tag transcripts revealed an excess of Kv1.1N206Tag transcript. Immunoprecipitation analysis using 12CA5 monoclonal antibody detected a 25-kDa polypeptide in the transfected cells. The half-life of Kv1.1N206Tag was 2.6 h. Subcellular fractionation of cell lysates labeled with [35S]methionine revealed that Kv1.1N206Tagpolypeptide is detectable in the particulate (membranous) fraction, but not in the soluble (cytosol) fraction. A series of double immunoprecipitations with 12CA5 and polyclonal antibodies against Kv1.5 and Kv1.4 revealed that Kv1.1N206Tag forms heteromultimeric complexes with the native Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 polypeptides. The steady-state levels of Kv1.5 were not affected by the overexpression of Kv1.1N206Tag. Immunofluorescence colocalization and confocal microscopy analyses revealed thatKv1.1N206TagFlag did not reach the plasma membrane, and its distribution pattern was characteristic to that of a resident endoplasmic reticulum polypeptide. Our observations establish that the negative effect of Kv1.1N206Tag is mediated by the formation of heteromultimeric complexes with the native channels and by the retention of these complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum. We demonstrated that overexpression of a cRNA encoding a truncated potassium channel polypeptide that contains the NH2 terminus and the first transmembrane segment (Kv1.1N206Tag) abolished the expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.5 outward currents in Xenopus oocytes (Babila, T., Moscucci, A., Wang, H., Weaver, F.

Voltage-gated potassium channels form a symmetric tetrameric complex around an aqueous pore. The proper order of assembly of channel complexes involves selective association of four α subunits, which are polytopic membrane polypeptides with four cytoplasmic β subunits (3MacKinnon R.

Assembly of most hetero-oligomeric membrane glycoproteins takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum immediately after the termination of translation and folding, and failure to fold or assemble correctly often leads to retention in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and degradation (5Hurtley S.M.

However, none of the experiments carried out as part of the analysis of channel assembly provided a biochemical mechanism for the dominant negative effect of overexpression of truncated channels. Interestingly, this dominant negative experimental approach may explain the underlying mechanism involved in episodic ataxia, an autosomal dominant human disease characterized by persistent myokymia and recurrent attacks of generalized ataxia. This disease is caused by distinct missense mutations of Kv1.1 gene (10Adelman J.P. Bond C.T. Pessia M. Maylie J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mechanism may also underlie long QT syndrome, a lethal disease caused by missense mutations in voltage-gated potassium channels such as HERGand KVLQT1 (11Curran M.E. Splawski I.

A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This autosomal dominant disease is characterized by a typical electrocardiographic phenotype of a prolonged QT interval and by sudden death caused by ventricular arrhythmias.The clonal cell line GH3 expresses the transcripts and polypeptides of voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and Kv2.1, all of which are also expressed in the heart (14Chung S. Saal D.B. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5955-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Takimoto K. Fomina A.F. Trimmer J.S. Levitan E.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The expression of Kv1.5 in GH3 cell line and primary rat cardiocytes is modulated by cAMP, depolarization, and the glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone (14Chung S. Saal D.B. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5955-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Takimoto K. Fomina A.F. Trimmer J.S. Levitan E.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transcription regulation of the Kv1.5 promoter in these cells is similar to that of the Kv1.5 gene in rat cardiac myocytes (16Mori Y. Folco E. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the GH3 cell line provides a useful model system to study the regulation of synthesis and assembly of potassium channel polypeptides in a cell in which they are naturally expressed.Here we report that overexpression of a truncated potassium channel polypeptide resulted in the formation of heteromultimeric complexes with the native Shaker-like channels expressed in GH3 cells. These complexes were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and did not reach the plasma membrane. The truncated channel was subsequently degraded with a half-life of 2.6 h. These experiments confirm that channel assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and that interference with the proper assembly results in the retaining of the misassembled complexes in the ER. The results provide a biochemical mechanism that explains the dominant negative effects observed inXenopus oocytes and more recent observations, which revealed that overexpression of Kv1.1N206Tag polypeptide in the heart of transgenic mice resulted in a long QT phenotype (1Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2London B. Han X. Folco E. Koren G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): A260Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe hypothesized that overexpression of a truncated segment of a voltage-gated potassium channel essential for assembly would either result in association with the whole channel protein in vivoand retention in the ER or in the formation of nonfunctional complexes in the plasma membrane. We based our hypothesis on our previous experimental data, in which we demonstrated that in vitrotranslated Kv1.1N206 formed homomultimeric and heteromultimeric complexes with Kv1.5 polypeptides. Furthermore, overexpression of Kv1.1N206 abolished the expression of Kv1.5- and Kv1.1-encoded currents in Xenopus oocytes (1Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that overexpression of Kv1.1N206, a truncated polypeptide that contains the NH2 terminus and the first transmembrane segment, resulted in the trapping of the truncated peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results confirm that potassium channels assemble in the ER and document the trapping of channel complexes consisting of truncated and native channel polypeptides. Although we do not provide direct evidence of the shift of the native Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 polypeptides from the plasma membrane to the ER, the exclusive localization of Kv1.1N206Tag in the ER has led us to conclude that the dominant negative effect is most likely due to the trapping of heteromultimeric complexes that containKv1.1N206Tag and the native channels in the ER.We propose that this mechanism underlies the dominant negative effect that we and others have observed in several experimental systems, including Xenopus oocytes and various cell lines such as GH3 cells. Our findings are consistent with the model of ER retention proposed by Helenius (5Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 227-307Crossref Scopus (775) Google Scholar), in which the heteromultimeric, misfolded complexes that contain one or more truncated polypeptides are trapped in the ER. This model may explain the dominant negative effect of the mutations in the first transmembrane segments of Kv1.1 that are associated with episodic ataxia (10Adelman J.P. Bond C.T. Pessia M. Maylie J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the dominant negative effect observed in long QT syndrome associated with a deletion mutation ofHERG gene that results in the truncation of the polypeptide after the first transmembrane segment (11Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 18Li X. Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The cytoplasmic T1 domain specifies the subunit that can form heteromultimeric complexes (20Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An increasing amount of evidence suggests that interactions between transmembrane segments may play an important role in the final structure of polytopic membrane proteins. The association of transmembrane segments may depend primarily on van der Waals interactions that can mediate either promiscuous or stable and specific associations (21Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 23Peled-Zehavi H. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6828-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of a truncated subunit interferes with the folding and assembly pathway resulting in retention of the heteromultimeric complexes in the ER. Similarly, it seems likely that changes in several amino acids or even one missense mutation may lead to major effects on folding, recognition, and assembly, and therefore trapping in the ER. A more detailed analysis of the folding and assembly of these polytopic membrane proteins is needed to extend the implications of this study to other potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium channels form a symmetric tetrameric complex around an aqueous pore. The proper order of assembly of channel complexes involves selective association of four α subunits, which are polytopic membrane polypeptides with four cytoplasmic β subunits (3MacKinnon R.

Assembly of most hetero-oligomeric membrane glycoproteins takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum immediately after the termination of translation and folding, and failure to fold or assemble correctly often leads to retention in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and degradation (5Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 227-307Crossref Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The proper assembly requires inter- and intrasubunit interactions that facilitate the formation of the proper complexes in the plasma membrane. Recent work from our laboratory (1Babila T. Moscucci A.

We and other investigators used overexpression of truncated polypeptides in a dominant negative approach to determine whether a specific domain plays a role in channel assembly (1Babila T.

However, none of the experiments carried out as part of the analysis of channel assembly provided a biochemical mechanism for the dominant negative effect of overexpression of truncated channels. Interestingly, this dominant negative experimental approach may explain the underlying mechanism involved in episodic ataxia, an autosomal dominant human disease characterized by persistent myokymia and recurrent attacks of generalized ataxia. This disease is caused by distinct missense mutations of Kv1.1 gene (10Adelman J.P. Bond C.T. Pessia M. Maylie J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mechanism may also underlie long QT syndrome, a lethal disease caused by missense mutations in voltage-gated potassium channels such as HERGand KVLQT1 (11Curran M.E. Splawski I.

A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This autosomal dominant disease is characterized by a typical electrocardiographic phenotype of a prolonged QT interval and by sudden death caused by ventricular arrhythmias. The clonal cell line GH3 expresses the transcripts and polypeptides of voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and Kv2.1, all of which are also expressed in the heart (14Chung S. Saal D.B. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5955-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Takimoto K. Fomina A.F. Trimmer J.S. Levitan E.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The expression of Kv1.5 in GH3 cell line and primary rat cardiocytes is modulated by cAMP, depolarization, and the glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone (14Chung S. Saal D.B. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5955-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Takimoto K. Fomina A.F. Trimmer J.S. Levitan E.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transcription regulation of the Kv1.5 promoter in these cells is similar to that of the Kv1.5 gene in rat cardiac myocytes (16Mori Y. Folco E. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the GH3 cell line provides a useful model system to study the regulation of synthesis and assembly of potassium channel polypeptides in a cell in which they are naturally expressed. Here we report that overexpression of a truncated potassium channel polypeptide resulted in the formation of heteromultimeric complexes with the native Shaker-like channels expressed in GH3 cells. These complexes were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and did not reach the plasma membrane. The truncated channel was subsequently degraded with a half-life of 2.6 h. These experiments confirm that channel assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and that interference with the proper assembly results in the retaining of the misassembled complexes in the ER. The results provide a biochemical mechanism that explains the dominant negative effects observed inXenopus oocytes and more recent observations, which revealed that overexpression of Kv1.1N206Tag polypeptide in the heart of transgenic mice resulted in a long QT phenotype (1Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2London B. Han X. Folco E. Koren G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): A260Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONWe hypothesized that overexpression of a truncated segment of a voltage-gated potassium channel essential for assembly would either result in association with the whole channel protein in vivoand retention in the ER or in the formation of nonfunctional complexes in the plasma membrane. We based our hypothesis on our previous experimental data, in which we demonstrated that in vitrotranslated Kv1.1N206 formed homomultimeric and heteromultimeric complexes with Kv1.5 polypeptides. Furthermore, overexpression of Kv1.1N206 abolished the expression of Kv1.5- and Kv1.1-encoded currents in Xenopus oocytes (1Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that overexpression of Kv1.1N206, a truncated polypeptide that contains the NH2 terminus and the first transmembrane segment, resulted in the trapping of the truncated peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results confirm that potassium channels assemble in the ER and document the trapping of channel complexes consisting of truncated and native channel polypeptides. Although we do not provide direct evidence of the shift of the native Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 polypeptides from the plasma membrane to the ER, the exclusive localization of Kv1.1N206Tag in the ER has led us to conclude that the dominant negative effect is most likely due to the trapping of heteromultimeric complexes that containKv1.1N206Tag and the native channels in the ER.We propose that this mechanism underlies the dominant negative effect that we and others have observed in several experimental systems, including Xenopus oocytes and various cell lines such as GH3 cells. Our findings are consistent with the model of ER retention proposed by Helenius (5Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 227-307Crossref Scopus (775) Google Scholar), in which the heteromultimeric, misfolded complexes that contain one or more truncated polypeptides are trapped in the ER. This model may explain the dominant negative effect of the mutations in the first transmembrane segments of Kv1.1 that are associated with episodic ataxia (10Adelman J.P. Bond C.T. Pessia M. Maylie J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the dominant negative effect observed in long QT syndrome associated with a deletion mutation ofHERG gene that results in the truncation of the polypeptide after the first transmembrane segment (11Curran M.E.

Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An increasing amount of evidence suggests that interactions between transmembrane segments may play an important role in the final structure of polytopic membrane proteins. The association of transmembrane segments may depend primarily on van der Waals interactions that can mediate either promiscuous or stable and specific associations (21Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6828-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of a truncated subunit interferes with the folding and assembly pathway resulting in retention of the heteromultimeric complexes in the ER. Similarly, it seems likely that changes in several amino acids or even one missense mutation may lead to major effects on folding, recognition, and assembly, and therefore trapping in the ER. A more detailed analysis of the folding and assembly of these polytopic membrane proteins is needed to extend the implications of this study to other potassium channels.

In this disease, electron transfer from nine primary flavoprotein dehydrogenases to the main respiratory chain is impaired. Among these dehydrogenases are the four chain length–specific flavoprotein dehydrogenases of fatty acid β-oxidation. In this investigation, two mutations in the α subunit that have been identified in patients were expressed inEscherichia coli. Of the two mutant alleles, αT266M and αG116R, the former is the most frequent mutation found in patients with ETF deficiency. The crystal structure of human ETF shows that αG116 lies in a hydrophobic pocket, under a contact residue of the α/β subunit interface, and that the hydroxyl hydrogen of αT266 is hydrogen-bonded to N(5) of the FAD; the amide backbone hydrogen of αT266 is hydrogen-bonded to C(4)-O of the flavin prosthetic group (Roberts, D. L., Frerman, F. E. and Kim, J-J. P. (1996)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 14355–14360).Stable expression of the αG116R ETF required coexpression of the chaperonins, GroEL and GroES. αG116R ETF folds into a conformation different from the wild type, and is catalytically inactive in crude extracts. It is unstable and could not be extensively purified. The αT266M ETF was purified and characterized after stabilization to proteolysis in crude extracts. Although the global structure of this mutant protein is unchanged, its flavin environment is altered as indicated by absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy and the kinetics of flavin release from the oxidized and reduced protein. The loss of the hydrogen bond at N(5) of the flavin and the altered flavin binding increase the thermodynamic stability of the flavin semiquinone by 10-fold relative to the semiquinone of wild type ETF. The mutation has relatively little effect on the reductive half-reaction of ETF catalyzed by sarcosine and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases which reduce the flavin to the semiquinone. However, kcat/K m of ETF-QO in a coupled acyl-CoA:ubiquinone reductase assay with oxidized αT266M ETF as substrate is reduced 33-fold; this decrease is due in largest part to a decrease in the rate of disproportionation of the αT266M ETF semiquinone catalyzed by ETF-QO.

In mammalian systems, ETF transfers electrons from nine mitochondrial flavoprotein dehydrogenases to the main respiratory chain via the iron-sulfur flavoprotein, ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) (1Thorpe C. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). Porcine ETF is apparently closely related to human ETF (2Frerman F.E. Goodman S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4517-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Frerman F.E. Goodman S.I. Biochem. Med. 1985; 33: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both proteins stabilize an anionic flavin semiquinone upon reduction by the flavoprotein dehydrogenases (4Gorelick R.J. Schopfer L.M. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6830-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of ETF to the hydroquinone oxidation state by the dehydrogenases is very slow and not kinetically significant (4Gorelick R.J. Schopfer L.M. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6830-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Ramsay R.R. Steenkamp D.J. Husain M. Biochemistry J. 1987; 241: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, kinetic studies of the ETF-QO-catalyzed reduction of ubiquinone by reduced ETF by Ramsayet al. indicated that ETF hydroquinone, and not the semiquinone, is the reductant of ubiquinone (6Ramsay R.R. Steenkamp D.J. Husain M. Biochemistry J. 1987; 241: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This paradox is explained by the rapid disproportionation of ETF semiquinone catalyzed by ETF-QO; ETF-QO then catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone by ETF hydroquinone. The x-ray crystal structure of oxidized human ETF was recently solved by Roberts et al. (7Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 90: 14355-14360Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This structure has provided insight into the side chains of amino acid residues that may be involved in stabilization of the anionic ETF semiquinone and hydroquinone and suggested a possible structure for a binary complex of ETF and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (7Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 90: 14355-14360Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The protein is composed of three domains, two contributed by the α subunit (αI and αII), and a third contributed entirely by the β subunit, which contains the noncovalently bound AMP (8Sato K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The FAD cofactor is bound primarily in the αII domain although the dimethylbenzene ring makes van der Waals contact with Tyr-16, Pro-40, and Phe-41 in the β subunit. The structure also provides some insight into the structural bases for the effects of several missense mutations in ETF that result in the inherited metabolic disease glutaric acidemia type II (9Freneaux E. Sheffield V.C. Molin L. Shires A. Rhead W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1670-1686Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The most frequent mutant allele thus far identified in patients with ETF deficiency is the substitution of Thr-266 by a methionine residue in the α subunit (9Freneaux E. Sheffield V.C. Molin L. Shires A. Rhead W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1670-1686Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl hydrogen of Thr-266 is hydrogen-bonded to N(5) of the flavin, and the backbone amide hydrogen of this residue is hydrogen-bonded to the C(4)-O of the flavin pyrimidine ring (7Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 90: 14355-14360Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This mutation would be expected to influence the properties of the flavin since the chemical properties of bound flavin are modulated by the protein environment (11Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 18: 1-17Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The αT266M allele yields a stable antigen on immunoblots, and the specific activity of this mutant ETF in the fibroblasts of a patient who is homozygous for this mutation is about 15% of control values (10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A second mutation, G116R, has also been identified in the α subunit of a patient with glutaric acidemia type II (9Freneaux E. Sheffield V.C. Molin L. Shires A. Rhead W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1670-1686Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Gly-116 lies just below the surface of an α/β subunit interface. This mutant allele does not yield an active protein (10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of a fibroblast line carrying this mutation yield no useful information regarding the stability of the α subunit of αG116R ETF because this allele is present in a patient who is a compound heterozygote, i.e. αT266M/αG116R (9Freneaux E. Sheffield V.C. Molin L. Shires A. Rhead W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1670-1686Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar,10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have constructed vectors bearing these mutations and investigated their expression in Escherichia coli and characterized the structural, redox, and kinetic properties of these proteins. The G116R α subunit is unstable in crude extracts, except when coexpressed with the chaperonins GroEL and GroES. When coexpressed with the chaperonins, this ETF apparently folds into an alternate conformation. However, attempts to extensively purify this protein, which exhibits no detectable activity in crude extracts, were unsuccessful. The three-dimensional structure suggests that the instability and alternate conformation of the protein is due to the inability to sterically accommodate the guanidinium side chain of arginine at position 116 and the thermodynamic barriers to sequestering this side chain in a hydrophobic environment. The αT266M mutant ETF is stable after inactivation of proteases in crude extracts, but spectral investigations and the kinetics of flavin dissociation from the oxidized protein indicate that the flavin environment is significantly altered in the mutant protein. The altered environment modifies the redox behavior of the protein and the turnover with ETF-QO in the oxidative half-reaction. The steady-state kinetic constants of the reductive half-reactions of the mutant ETF with several primary dehydrogenase are scarcely altered. These changes accurately reflect the alteration of ETF activity in fibroblast extracts from a patient homozygous for the αT266M mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a human metabolic disease resulting from a change in the oxidation-reduction behavior of a protein. Wild-type and mutant human ETFs were purified as described by Herrick et al. (5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration of wild-type ETF was determined using ε436 nm = 13,300m−1. The concentration of αT266M ETF was calculated using ε438 nm = 14,600m−1, determined after release of FAD from the mutant protein with 5% SDS (12McKean M.C. Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1866-1870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of porcine medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, porcine sarcosine dehydrogenase, and porcine ETF-QO were determined spectrophotometrically using ε448 nm = 15,400 m−1, ε436 nm = 11,300 m−1, and ε430 nm = 24,000 m−1, respectively (4Gorelick R.J.

FAD (ε448 nm = 11,300m−1), riboflavin, tosyl-l-leucine-chloromethylketone, and pepstatin were purchased from Sigma, and leupeptin, aprotinin, and Pefabloc were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. FAD was purified as described (14Massey V. Swoboda B.E.P. Biochem. Z. 1963; 338: 474-484PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium dithionite was from George F. Smith Chemicals. SDS was purchased from Bio-Rad. Restriction endonucleases and Taq polymerase were purchased from Promega. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources, Fort Collins, CO. Pyocyanine (E′ 0 = −0.037 V) (15Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1960: 184-203Google Scholar) was prepared from phenazine methosulfate by the method of McIlwain (16McIlwain H. J. Chem. Soc. 1937; 2: 1704-1711Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and gallocyanine was purchased from Acros (E′ 0 = +0.021 V) (15Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1960: 184-203Google Scholar). Milk xanthine oxidase was the gift of Dr. Russ Hille. Other reagents were the best grade available and were obtained from commercial sources. The αT266M and αG116R mutations were generated in the wild-type human ETF cDNA by the overlapping primer method of polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (17Higuchi R. Kummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). All reactions contained 200 ng of DNA template, 2 units ofTaq polymerase, 80 μm each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and primers at a final concentration of 25 pmol in a 50-μl reaction. Primers to the human wild-type ETF expression vector pJR46–1 were as follows. The primer 5′-ATCAGTGTGGAGGACCCG-3′ anneals upstream of aStuI site (nucleotide 1381) and was used with a reverse mutagenic primer 5′-ACTATTTTTCCCA*TCTGTCCA-3′ to amplify one-half of the αT266M mutant cassette. The primer 3′-GATATCACTCAGCATAA-5′ anneals downstream of a KpnI site (nucleotide 2184) and, with a forward mutagenic primer 5′-GGACAGAT*GGGAAAAATA-3′, was used to create the second half of the mutant cassette. For the αG116R mutation, the same external primers were used with the following mutagenic primers: 5′-TCTGCCTTCA*GAAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-AGGTTCTTTCT*GAAGGCAG-3′ (mutagenic nucleotides are indicated by * and nucleotide positions are as designated in Ref. 5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small aliquots of the two individual PCR reactions were mixed, and the products were annealled before being amplified with the flanking primers for 30 cycles at 48 °C. The final full-length mutant cassette was trimmed with StuI and KpnI, and the digested fragment was isolated from a low melting agarose gel and ligated into StuI/KpnI cut pJR46–1 to yield pJR46TM3 or pJR46GR, which expressed the αT266M and αG116R ETFs, respectively. The presence of the desired C797T mutation resulting in the replacement of threonine 266 with methionine, and the G347A mutation converting glycine 116 to an arginine was verified by dideoxy sequencing (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) with Sequenase 2.0. Dideoxy sequencing also showed that no unwanted mutations were incorporated. Wild-type human ETF was purified from E. coliextracts by chromatography on DEAE-Bio-Gel and carboxymethyl-Sepharose as described (5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications indicated. The protease inhibitors, aprotinin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), Pefabloc (0.5 mm), leupeptin (2 μm), and tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (50 μm) were added to suspensions of cells expressing αG116R and αT266M ETFs when the cells were disrupted. Cells were disrupted with two passes through a French pressure cell at 1300 p.s.i. When theA 270 nm/A 436 nm of the αT266M ETF exceeded 6.5 after chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sepharose, the mutant protein was further purified by chromatography on hydroxylapatite (19Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid, pGroESL, which encodes the E. colichaperonins GroEL and GroES, has been described (20Gatenby A.A. Plant Molec. Biol. 1992; 19: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Anthony Gatenby. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and sarcosine dehydrogenase were assayed spectrophotometrically as described previously, with ETF as the varied substrate and 60 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as the terminal electron acceptor (5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ETF-QO was assayed spectrophotometrically, with ETF as the varied substrate as described (5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by following the reduction of 70 μm ubiquinone-1 (Q-1) in the presence of 0.5 μm medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 50 μm octanoyl-CoA. Catalytic activity of purified and crude ETF was also determined spectrophotometrically as described by Loehr et al. (10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures containing 0.5 μm medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 100 μm octanoyl-CoA, 0.5 μmETF-QO, and 70 μm Q-1 in 20 mmHepes-K+ buffer, pH 7.5. The rates of the reactions were determined by following Q-1 reduction at 275 nm using Δε = 7,500m−1. ETF-QO-catalyzed disproportionation of ETF semiquinone was assayed under anaerobic conditions as described by Beckmann and Frerman (13Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3913-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rates are expressed as mole ETF semiquinone converted per second. Ultraviolet/visible absorption spectra were determined with a Shimadzu UV2401 spectrophotometer. ETF flavin and tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were determined with a Shimadzu RF5301 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C. ETF flavin was excited at 436 nm, and emission was measured from 450 to 560 nm. Intrinsic fluorescence due to tryptophan and tyrosine was determined by excitation at 280 nm; emission was measured from 290 to 400 nm. Infrared spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Magna Model 550 spectrometer (Nicolet Instruments Corp.) using a deuterated tungsten-gallium-selenium detector as we have previously described (21Griffin K.J. Dwyer T.M. Manning M.C. Meyer J.D. Carpenter J.F. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4194-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Flavin circular dichroism spectra were measured with an Aviv 60DS spectropolarimeter at 4 °C in semimicro quartz cuvettes with a 1-cm light path, and molar ellipticities were calculated based on flavin concentration. The equilibrium constant for the disproportionation, K dis, of ETF1ewas determined by ETF-QO-catalyzed disproportionation of ETF semiquinone, which was generated by dithionite reduction as described (13Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3913-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at pH 7.5 and 15 °C as follows. 2ETF1e−⇌ETFox+ETF2e−Equation 1 and Kdis=[ETFox][ETF2e−][ETF1e−]2Equation 2 This equilibrium constant is, in turn, related to the separation of redox potentials (ΔE) between the oxidized/semiquinone couple, E 2, and the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple, E 1, as described by Clark (15Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1960: 184-203Google Scholar), ΔE=E2−E1=2.3RTFlog(1/Kdis)Equation 3 where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is Faraday's constant. Redox potentials for the oxidized/semiquinone couple (E 2) were estimated by the method of Massey (22Massay V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 59-66Google Scholar) using 250 μm xanthine, 20–70 nm xanthine oxidase, 1.5 μm benzyl viologen, 10–30 μmwild-type or mutant ETF and pyocyanine or gallocyanine equimolar with the ETF. Reactions were conducted at 10 °C in 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 5% glycerol. Data were plotted according to Minneart (23Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values for the potentials of the indicator dyes are from Clark (15Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1960: 184-203Google Scholar), and appropriate corrections were made to account for any contributions of the dye to the protein spectrum. Reduction to the semiquinone, without further reduction to hydroquinone, was judged by maintenance of isosbestic points for the oxidized/semiquinone species at 402 and 482 nm for the wild-type and 394 and 495 nm for αT266M ETF. Potentials for the semiquinone/hydroquinone couples (E 1) were calculated from the value of E 2 and ΔE. The extinction coefficient of the oxidized αT266M ETF at 438 nm was estimated after release of the flavin from the protein with 5% SDS as described previously (12McKean M.C. Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1866-1870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant protein was titrated with sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions, and the extinction coefficient of the flavin semiquinone was determined from the intercept of the extrapolated linear portions of a plot of the absorbance at 438 nm versus the absorbance at 377 nm, the absorption maximum of the semiquinone. The extinction coefficient of the hydroquinone at 377 nm was determined by complete reduction of the ETF with dithionite. The values for the wild-type protein were determined previously and are given in Table I with the corresponding values for αT266M ETF.Table ISpectral properties of wild-type and αT266M ETFs in the oxidized, semiquinone, and hydroquinone oxidation statesAbsorption maxima (λ)ε at maximummm −1 cm −1Wild-type human ETF Oxidized436, 37213.3, 12.7 Semiquinone37317.8 Hydroquinone3736.5αT266M human ETF Oxidized438, 38314.6, 13.9 Semiquinone37719.7 Hydroquinone3774.9 Open table in a new tab FAD and AMP were released from αT266M ETF by heating in the dark for 10 min at 100 °C. After centrifugation to remove precipitated protein, the extracts were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a Microsorb C-18 column (5 μm, 4.5 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min as described by Griffin et al.(21Griffin K.J. Dwyer T.M. Manning M.C. Meyer J.D. Carpenter J.F. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4194-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Flavin dissociation from oxidized wild-type and αT266M ETFs was continuously monitored by increase in fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 450 nm. Incubation mixtures contained 1 μm ETF in 3 murea, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, as described by Madden et al. (24Madden M. Lau S.-M. Thorpe C. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 577-580Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored at 19 °C until about 90% of the flavin was released; the cuvette was then heated to 55 °C for 5 min to release remaining protein-bound flavin and cooled to 19 °C, and fluorescence intensity was measured to obtain a fluorescence at t ∞. Data were fitted to first order curves, from which the rate constants were calculated. The stability of the reduced ETF flavin in the presence of buffered 3 m urea was estimated at 19 °C, essentially as described by Madden et al. (24Madden M. Lau S.-M. Thorpe C. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 577-580Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) except that ETF activity was determined in the octanoyl-CoA ubiquinone reductase assay described by Loehr et al. (10Loehr J.P. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 27: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ETF (2 μm) was reduced with octanoyl-CoA (60 μm) plus medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (0.5 μm) in 315 μl under anaerobic conditions. Deoxygenated buffer was then added such that the final concentration of ETF was 1 μm. Samples were removed with a gas-tight syringe at 0 time and after 2 and 6 h, corresponding to 3 and 9 half-lives of the oxidized wild-type protein in buffered 3 m urea. ETF activity was determined in triplicate. Under these conditions, ETF was reduced to the hydroquinone oxidation state. In the absence of urea, wild-type and αT266M ETFs were stable for at least 15 h at 19 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, as determined in the catalytic assay. Initial attempts to purify the ETFs bearing the αT266M and αG116R mutations were unsuccessful. Based on immunoblots, the antigens were present in whole cells containing the mutant constructs at levels similar to the wild type; however, the α subunits of the mutant proteins appeared unstable in the supernatant fractions of disrupted cells and were absent in eluates of DEAE-Bio-Gel columns where the wild-type ETF is normally eluted (Fig. 1, A andB) (5Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αT266M subunit was stabilized easily by the addition of protease inhibitors and 100 μm FAD when the cells were disrupted (Fig. 1 C). The addition of protease inhibitors with FAD did not yield a stable αG116R subunit. However, when the chaperonins GroES and GroEL were coexpressed, the stabilized and β subunits were detected immunologically through the first chromatography step on an analytical DEAE-Bio-Gel column (Fig.1 D) and when purification was attempted on a preparative scale. When coexpressed with the chaperones, a single immunoreactive protein was detected on a blot of the crude extract after nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The protein detected on the nondenaturing gel had a greater mobility than the wild-type protein, suggesting that it is folded differently than the wild-type protein (Fig.2). In crude extracts, the specific activities of the wild-type and αG116R ETFs were 34 nmol/min/mg protein and <0.02 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Although the αG116R ETF was apparently structurally stabilized through the chromatographic step on DEAE-Bio-Gel, the protein remained very unstable and could not be purified further by the several methods that were attempted.Figure 2Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of wild-type ETF and crude αT266M ETF. Wild-type ETF (50 ng),lane 1, and a crude extract (20 μg) of cells expressing αG116R ETF, GroES, and GroEL, lane 2, were subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis at 4 °C and detected by immunoblotting. The cells expressing αG116R were disrupted in the presence of protease inhibitors and 100 mm FAD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the αG116R ETF, the αT266M ETF was purified after initial stabilization to proteolysis. The yield of highly purified αT266M ETF averaged about 0.2 mg/g of wet cells. The yield of wild-type ETF was at least 0.6 mg/g of cells. Both proteins were highly purified; theA 270 nm/A 436 nm ratios of wild-type and mutant ETFs were 5.9 and 5.6, respectively. The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of αT266M ETF showed marked differences whe"

Our laboratory has recently shown that primate prothymosin α contains stoichiometric amounts of phosphate on the glutamyl groups of the protein and that in vitro the phosphate undergoes rapid hydrolysis or transfer to a nearby serine residue. Here an assay for the presence of acyl phosphates in vivo has been developed by measuring stable phosphoserine and phosphothreonine in vitro. The assay was used to determine the half-life of the acyl phosphates on prothymosin α in vivo by pulse-labeling HeLa cells with [32P]orthophosphate and chasing using three different techniques: permeabilization with digitonin to allow extracellular ATP to equilibrate with the intracellular pool; electroporation in the presence of ATP to reduce the specific activity of [32P]ATP by expansion of the pool; and incubation with inorganic phosphate. Regardless of the method, the phosphate turned over with a half-life of 75–90 min. The ability of cells to phosphorylate old prothymosin α molecules was established by demonstrating equivalent labeling of the protein with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence and absence of cycloheximide. The half-life of the acyl phosphates was also studied in resting and growing NIH3T3 cells, with measured values of 30–35 and 70 min, respectively. Our data suggest that the “activity” of prothymosin α involves the turnover of its acyl phosphates and that it participates in a function common to all nucleated mammalian cells regardless of whether they are quiescent or undergoing rapid proliferation.

When cells are disrupted with detergents, the protein readily leaks out of the nucleus, suggesting that stable interactions with nucleosomes or with the nuclear matrix are not an inherent part of its activity (2Sburlati A.R.

Nevertheless, a role in cell proliferation has been proposed based on the following observations: prothymosin α mRNA is plentiful only in rapidly dividing cells (13Eschenfeldt W.H. Berger S.L. Proc.

Hence, a deficiency in prothymosin α is associated with failure to complete the cell cycle. Prothymosin α has several unusual features.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The absence of all aromatic residues renders the protein transparent at 280 nm; it also lacks methionine, cysteine, and histidine. Based on biophysical data, it is believed to have an unfolded structure (19Gast K. Damaschun H. Eckert K. Schulze-Forster K. Maurer H.R. Müller-Frohne M. Zirwer D. Czarnecki J. Damaschun G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13211-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), a conclusion consistent with the presence of only seven widely dispersed hydrophobic residues in the human protein. Prothymosin α does not bind SDS and stains anomalously with silver stain (2Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein and the peptides derived from it exhibit poor immunogenicity. However, due to yet another aberrant property, the ability to partition quantitatively into the aqueous phase of a phenol extraction, prothymosin α can easily be obtained as a single band in a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Recently, we have shown that prothymosin α contains phosphorylated glutamic acid residues (20Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Acyl phosphates occur in proteins when a glutamic or aspartic acid residue undergoes a posttranslational modification producing a mixed anhydride of a carboxylic acid with phosphoric acid. Such phosphates are highly unusual, energy-rich, and easily transferred to any convenient hydroxyl group. In the prokaryotic world, in yeast, and in plants, they are found as aspartyl phosphates on the response regulator proteins of two component systems (reviewed in Refs. 21Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 532Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 22Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These reactive acyl phosphates are acquired from phosphorylated histidine residues on the sensor components; they readily hydrolyze, with half-lives from 6 s to 3.5 min when measured in vitro (23Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 24Keener J. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In higher eukaryotes, aspartyl phosphates occur as catalytic intermediates of P-type ATPases (reviewed in Ref. 26Pederson P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (823) Google Scholar) with ATP as the physiological donor. Glutamyl phosphate has been identified on only one mammalian protein (prothymosin α), one amphibian protein (nucleoplasmin from Xenopus laevis), 1S. A. Enkemann, M. W. Trumbore, and S. L. Berger, manuscript in preparation. and one avian protein (bone collagen of the chicken (27Cohen-Solal L. Cohen-Solal M. Glimcher M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4327-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). Little is known about the origins of glutamyl phosphates, and virtually nothing is understood about their contribution to cellular metabolism. To expand our grasp of the function of prothymosin α, we have determined the half-life of its glutamyl phosphates in vivo. To do so, we made use of the properties established by Trumboreet al. (20Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), who showed that these phosphates are unstable in cell lysates and undetectable, except for a small fraction that apparently transfer to serine 1 of the human protein (12Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or to unspecified threonine residues located within the first 14 amino acids of the murine protein (28Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. González C.G. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The degree of accumulation of the stable component depends on the conditions experienced by prothymosin α at the moment of cell lysis. Here we demonstrate that the fortuitous, albeit inefficient, migration of the labile glutamyl phosphate to positions of stability on serine or threonine on the same molecule can form the basis of a quantitative assay. When this technique was used together with three independent pulse-chase methods, we found that both new and old prothymosin α molecules were indistinguishable targets for phosphorylation on glutamic acid and that all acyl phosphates were rapidly lost in vivo with half-lives slightly in excess of 1 h. We believe that turnover of prothymosin α's phosphates might reflect a role that is continuously required by all cells, regardless of their metabolic state, and we present evidence for associating prothymosin α with processes required both for the maintenance of cells and for their growth. HeLa S3 cells, African green monkey kidney cells (COS-1), and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 2The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCl; DEAE, diethylaminoethyl; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PTMA, prothymosin α. from Life Technologies, Inc. (catalog number 15240-039) or Biofluids (catalog number 172; Rockville, MD). Human and monkey cells were cultured with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc. or HyClone (Logan, UT)), whereas the murine cells grew in 10% calf serum. All culture fluids contained 2 mm glutamine, 90 units/ml of penicillin, 90 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.22 μg/ml amphotericin B, and all cells were maintained in an environment of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Quiescent NIH3T3 cells were obtained by incubating cells for 48 h in 0.25% calf serum. Cells were harvested from culture flasks by washing with Puck's saline and treating with 0.05% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salts containing 0.53 mm EDTA. A two-step approach was employed for relating 32P found in isolated prothymosin α on serine or threonine to the amount of glutamyl phosphate existing on the protein inside the cell. First, the relationship between the amount of 32P recovered stably on prothymosin α and the amount of prothymosin α was determined by transfecting 106 COS cells in 60-mm dishes with 0–3 μg of pRSV PTMA, a vector containing the prothymosin α gene (29Mol P.C. Wang R.-H. Batey D.W. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6999-7009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the DEAE-dextran method (30Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). These cells, expressing varying amounts of prothymosin α, were labeled 44 h post-transfection with 100 μCi/ml of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 4 h. Prothymosin α was isolated by means of a phenol extraction (2Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), further purified electrophoretically, and quantified both as a Coomassie Blue-stained band of protein and as a radioactive band on an autoradiograph (see below). Direct comparisons were carried out only with samples analyzed on the same gel and subjected to the same conditions of staining and autoradiography. The relationship between the amount of prothymosin α and the amount of glutamyl phosphate was determined by resuspending ∼4–10 × 107 COS cells in 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide containing 30 mm [3H]NaBH4 (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity, 1000 mCi/mmol) at a specific activity of 47 mCi/mmol (low specific activity method) and allowing the reaction to proceed for 10 min at room temperature (20Trumbore M.W.

Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, COS cells were lysed in 1 ml of 5 mCi of [3H]NaBH4 (222 mCi/mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide (high specific activity method), and reactions were carried out for 1–3 h. In both cases, the insoluble material was washed in dimethyl sulfoxide, centrifuged, and suspended in water. Prothymosin α was recovered from the soluble component with the aid of phenol (2Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and purified using high pressure liquid chromatography (20Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a result of the borohydride reaction, tritium is incorporated into hydroxynorvaline, which is recovered as [3H]proline after acid hydrolysis, derivatization, and amino acid analysis (20Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Cohen-Solal L. Blouquit Y. Cohen-Solal M. Glimcher M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The reaction is specific, but even in well defined solutions yields are low (31Degani C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in crude solutions yields are quite poor (20Trumbore M.W. Wang R.-H. Enkemann S.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26394-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Radioactivity incorporated into prothymosin α was measured in a Packard Tri-Carb model 1500 liquid scintillation analyzer in Hydrofluor (National Diagnostics), and protein was quantified from the amino acid analysis. The two sets of data, 32P and 3H found in measured quantities of prothymosin α, form the basis of the assay. Cell volume was ascertained using two techniques. In the first case, the volume occupied by 1.9 × 106 or 3.8 × 106HeLa cells in a total volume of 20 or 25 μl of medium was measured in a calibrated capillary tube. An average value of 1.65 μl was obtained. The second method is a dilution assay; 106 cells in quadruplicate were allowed to take up 1 or 2 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 1.5 h. They were washed free of external radioactivity, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and used for a determination of Cerenkov radiation to measure the amount of label imbibed. The cells were then removed from scintillation vials and recovered by centrifugation. The pellets from two samples were resuspended in 10 μl of PBS, while the pellets from the remaining two samples were lysed with 10 μl of 10 n NaOH. It should be understood that, at this point in the experiment, the total volume is 10 μl of PBS plus the volume of the cell or cell lysate and that the amount of radioactivity, but not its concentration, is known. To determine the concentration, aliquots of 2 and 4 μl of the cell suspension or lysate were subjected to scintillation counting. If the cells had contributed nothing to the volume, these samples would have contained 20 or 40%, respectively, of the initial radioactivity imbibed by the cells. However, because the intact cells or the lysed cells do occupy space, their volume can be determined by measuring the reduction in radioactivity caused by the dilution of the buffer or base by the cells or their contents. These measurements resulted in average values of 1.49 and 1.52 μl/106 cells for intact and lysed cells, respectively; they were essential for determining the degree of equilibration of ATP across a permeabilized plasma membrane (see below). The method of Lee et al. (33Lee J.J. Calzone F.J. Davidson E.H. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), based on the work of Sasvári-Székely et al. (34Sasvári-Székely M. Vitez M. Staub M. Antoni F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 395: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was used to determine the specific activity of the ATP pool of HeLa cells. Briefly, the technique makes use of the fact that the number of AMP residues equals the number of UMP residues when RNA is polymerized using poly(dA-dT) as the template. The ATP, which is synthesized in vivo by cells in the presence of [3H]adenosine, is supplied by the cell extract, whereas UTP of known specific activity is provided exogenously in amounts which are large relative to the amount of endogenous UTP in the same cell extract. Under these conditions, all of the ATP in the extract is used to generate polymer, with no free ATP remaining in the reaction mix. More specifically, an aliquot of 1% of a neutralized perchloric acid extract from 5 × 106cells labeled for 2 h with 50 μCi/ml [2,8-3H]adenosine (specific activity, 30.6 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was used as a source of ATP for the polymerization of RNA in a 50-μl reaction containing 0.2 μg of poly(dA-dT) as template, 0.1 μCi of [U-14C]UTP (609 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) 0–5 nmol of nonradioactive UTP, and 3 units of RNA polymerase holoenzyme from Escherichia coli. The bacterial polymerase initiates synthesis of RNA at any location without the need for specific promoter sequences. Synthesis terminates when the limiting nucleotide, in this case ATP supplied by the extract, is exhausted. The specific activity of ATP given by the expression, (dpm in 3H/dpm in 14C) × specific activity of UTP, was 6.3 × 105 cpm/nmol. Thus, 106 cells with an average cell volume of 1.6 μl contained 1.4 nmol of ATP at a concentration of 0.88 mm. Conditions for the use of digitonin were selected after the evaluation of several parameters. Each dish of 5–6 × 106 HeLa S3 cells in a variation of a solution termed “cytomix” (35van den Hoff M.J.B. Moorman A.R.M. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (120 mmKCl, 150 mm CaCl2, 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) or complete DMEM was treated with 20–40 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) at either 0 or 37 °C for periods ranging from 5 to 30 min. In some experiments, the cells were labeled with [3H]glutamic acid before initiating the permeabilization treatment. After removal of digitonin by gentle aspiration and washing with Puck's saline, the chase conditions were simulated by incubating the cells in either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]UTP in either cytomix or DMEM without serum at 37 °C for 0.5–4 h; here radioactive ATP or UTP served only as a marker for measuring the rate at which permeabilized cells could imbibe external substances. Optimal conditions appeared to be treatment with 5 ml of 20 μg/ml of digitonin for 10 min in cytomix on ice. Such conditions allowed labeled ATP, placed outside the cell in either DMEM or cytomix, to equilibrate with the interior in less than 1 h. For pulse-chase experiments, HeLa cells at 37 °C were labeled in 60-mm dishes with 100 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (catalog number NEX-053, NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h in 2 ml of phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing the additions noted above. The cells were washed sequentially with warm Puck's saline followed by cytomix at 37 °C, permeabilized using the optimized conditions noted, and chased in 5 ml of DMEM (without serum and additives) containing 10 mm ATP and 10 mmMgCl2 at pH 7.0. Our methods were developed from published procedures (36Messing Eriksson A. Zetterqvist M.-A. Lundgren B. Andersson K. Beije B. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were maintained at 37 °C in the incubator during the chase. A separate dish was used for each time point. At the stated time, the cells were harvested by aspirating the ATP-containing chase medium and by immersing them, still in the dish, in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 12% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCl (AEBSF, Sigma)). Cells and debris were scraped free with a cell lifter (Costar), transferred to an Eppendorf tube, cooled in ice, mixed vigorously with a vortex mixer, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 15,000 rpm in a Tomy model MTX-150 centrifuge. The supernatant fluid was transferred to a 15-ml polypropylene tube, brought to 4 ml with cold filter-sterilized water, and extracted with phenol as described below. It is important to note that prothymosin α in its entirety leaks out of the nuclei when digitonin-treated cells, as well as electroporated or normal cells, are lysed with nonionic detergents (2Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that prothymosin α yields in all cases are virtually identical. HeLa S3 Cells were electroporated in the presence of [32P]ATP in the medium to determine the degree to which molecules outside the cell had equilibrated with the internal environment. An aliquot consisting of 1 ml of cells was placed in a disposable electroporation chamber with a 0.4-cm gap (catalog number 11601-028, Life Technologies, Inc.); the chamber was cooled in ice for 10 min and shocked with an electrical discharge of 875 V/cm and 330 microfarads in a Life Technologies, Inc. Cell-Porator at room temperature with the low resistance setting. The amount of a known concentration of [32P]ATP taken up by the cells, 70–80% of which survived, was measured and found to represent 70% equilibration. For pulse-chase experiments, HeLa S3 cells were labeled in 175 cm2 flasks under the conditions noted above, trypsinized, washed in Puck's saline, and resuspended at 5 × 106cells/ml in warm cytomix to which 20 mm ATP and 20 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.0 had been added. The chase was initiated by electroporating as noted above. These conditions resulted in a 14–15-fold instantaneous decrease in the specific activity of intracellular ATP. Following electroporation, the chamber was again cooled to 4 °C for 10 min and brought to room temperature for 10 min. Cells recovered from each chamber were washed thoroughly with Puck's saline, centrifuged free of the wash solution, resuspended in 5 ml of complete DMEM (DMEM containing serum and additives), seeded into a 60-mm dish, and maintained in an incubator as described earlier. The unphysiological concentration of ATP achieved inside the cells after electroporation did not significantly affect the viability of the cells for the duration of the chase. For the harvest, the cells in each dish were scraped free with a cell lifter, transferred to a centrifuge tube, cooled to 4 °C, washed with PBS, recovered as a pellet, and disrupted in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer. After removing the nuclei by centrifugation, the supernatant fluids were transferred to a clean polypropylene tube, diluted with water as detailed above for digitonin-treated cells, and subjected to a phenol extraction (see below). HeLa S3 cells were labeled in flasks in phosphate-free complete DMEM for 4 h as indicated for the electroporated cells. To initiate the chase, the cells were washed free of the labeling solution, trypsinized, washed again, resuspended in complete DMEM containing 40 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0, and seeded into dishes at a concentration of 6 × 106 cells/dish. At the end of the chase, the cells were recovered and lysed using the methods for electroporated cells. Supernatant fluids from lysed cells containing virtually all of the prothymosin α in the cell in 4 ml were made 0.5% in SDS and extracted at 65 °C with 2 ml of phenol saturated with 2 × ACE buffer (20 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.1, 100 mm NaCl, and 6 mm disodium EDTA). The aqueous phase was recovered by centrifugation and extracted twice with phenol using the same methods. The final aqueous phase was precipitated with 4 volumes of acetone in dry ice for 1 h or overnight at −20 °C, and the sample was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, washed in 80% acetone, 20% 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, and dissolved in 400 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. RNA was destroyed by adding 40 μg of pancreatic ribonuclease A and incubating the sample at 37 °C for 20 min. Ribonuclease was removed by two additional phenol extractions. The sample was recovered by precipitation in acetone, and the pellet was dissolved in water and analyzed in an 18% polyacrylamide gel (catalog number EC6506, Novex). A general description of our methods for purification of the protein and for electrophoresis has appeared (2Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L.

Our data indicate that most of prothymosin α's phosphates are subject instantaneously to hydrolysis, based on the observation that greater than 90% of the phosphate initially found at pH 7 disappeared at the extremes of pH. Rapid loss of phosphate was not affected by the presence of phosphatase inhibitors including 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm okadaic acid, and 0.5 mmcalyculin A. The amount of phosphate missing could not be ascertained, but the trifling amount recovered on Ser or Thr depended heavily on conditions favoring the transient survival of labile phosphate. Further analysis using COS cells lysed in the presence of sodium borohydride showed that: 1) phosphate recovered on prothymosin α decreased 8-fold when lysates were treated with borohydride; 2) the reagent caused 4–8 glutamic acid residues/molecule to vanish; 3) using [3H]NaBH4, label was introduced into proline, a product derived from reductive cleavage of phosphoglutamate; and 4) [3H]proline was localized almost exclusively to a peptide with pronounced homology to the histone binding site of nucleoplasmin, a chromatin remodeling protein found in Xenopus laevis.

Our data demonstrate that prothymosin α is energy-rich by virtue of stoichiometric amounts of glutamyl phosphate. Prothymosin α is a highly unusual protein with an unfortunate name. The protein is neither a precursor for processed polypeptides nor specifically associated with the thymus nor a member of a family with β or γ homologues (1Eschenfeldt W.H. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9403-9407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein possesses a potent nuclear localization signal and is present in amounts equivalent to those of histone H1 (5Manrow R.E. Sburlati A.R. Hanover J.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the amount of prothymosin α mRNA (and presumably protein) found in a cell is directly proportional to cell growth, the protein is believed to play a role in cell proliferation (1Eschenfeldt W.H. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9403-9407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This idea was reinforced by the observation that synchronized human myeloma cells, in the presence of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides directed at prothymosin α mRNA, were unable to divide while detectable amounts of the antisense oligonucleotides remained inside the cell (7Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). There are now many examples of a link between prothymosin α and growth in systems as diverse as developing mouse embryos (8Franco del Amo F. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); normal, mitogen-stimulated, and malignant lymphocytes (9Gómez-Márquez J. Segade F. Dosil M. Pichel J.G. Bustelo X.R. Freire M.

There are also positive correlations among prothymosin α mRNA levels and those of growth-related molecules such as histone H3, proliferating nuclear antigen, and Myc (11Dosil M. Freire M.

Despite a report to the contrary, prothymosin α is not present in yeast, nor are there close relatives, with the exception of the X.laevis protein, nucleoplasmin. Both prothymosin α and nucleoplasmin share a presumptive histone binding sequence, localize to the nucleus, and achieve high concentrations (5Manrow R.E. Sburlati A.R. Hanover J.A. Berger S.L. J.

De Robertis E.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), prothymosin α persists as an abundant protein in proliferating cells throughout the life of the organism. Other observations from which prothymosin α's function can be intimated include 1) binding to histones in vitro (17Papamarcaki T. Tsolas O. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Dı́az-Jullien C. Pérez-Éstez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), implicating a role in chromatin remodeling; 2) interacting with the Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus in vitro (19Kubota S. Adachi Y. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting involvement in RNA export from the nucleus; 3) up-regulation in the presence of Myc in specialized cells (20Eilers M. Schirm S. Bishop J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 21Gaubatz S. Meichle A. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3853-3862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) phosphorylation (16Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Gonzàlez C.G. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).There are two views of prothymosin α's phosphates. According to Sburlati et al. (16Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the human and bovine protein occurs on the N-terminal acetylserine residue, and not on Ser at positions 8 and 9 or Thr at positions 7, 12, 13, 100, and 105 (see Fig. 1). Ser83, which is an alanine in most other mammals, and Thr85 were not rigorously excluded as possible sites in this study. The second study of phosphoprothymosin α, a much less exhaustive analysis in mouse splenic lymphocytes, placed the labeled phosphate(s) on unspecified threonine residue(s) near the N terminus (22Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Gonzàlez C.G. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because prothymosin α sequences from different species are nearly identical, with ∼95% sequence homology over the entire protein and 100% sequence homology within the amino-terminal 30 residues (23Eschenfeldt W.H. Manrow R.E. Krug M.S. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Frillingos S. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Seferiadis K. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Tsolas O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 108: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the discrepancy was unsettling.The dynamic aspects of prothymosin α's phosphates were equally puzzling. Prothymosin α is metabolically stable and becomes phosphorylated equivalently at all stages of the cell cycle (16Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally, only 2% of the bovine protein is phosphorylated at steady state (16Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on these properties, prothymosin α seemed to be involved in the continuing activities performed by the cell and not, as previously postulated (25Vareli K. Tsolas O. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in the regulation of an intermittent function of the cell cycle.Here, both the location and the stability of prothymosin α's phosphates have been evaluated. We find that the initial sites of phosphorylation are glutamic acid residues, that the phosphates are extremely labile and readily hydrolyze during the earliest steps of the isolation procedure, and that phosphorylation on serine or threonine may occur solely in vitro when labile phosphates transfer to stable positions. Our data resolve the discrepancies between observations of Ser/Thr phosphorylation made in the human and mouse systems and explain the minute amount of phosphate found on the protein regardless of the organism studied. Based on an analysis of the peptides of human and monkey prothymosin α, the phosphorylated residues have been localized to an extremely acidic region that is homologous with the histone binding site of nucleoplasmin. Since the free energy of hydrolysis of a glutamyl phosphate is higher than that of ATP (26Jencks W.P. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1976: 296-304Google Scholar) and since our evidence suggests that several of prothymosin α's glutamic acids bear phosphate simultaneously, we surmise that the protein is able to supply abundant energy for processes in the nucleus.DISCUSSIONProthymosin α contains acyl phosphates based on the following five observations. 1) Mutant human prothymosin α molecules lacking Ser1, the sole confirmed repository of phosphate, continued to become phosphorylated. Because prothymosin α in solution is unfolded (38Gast K. Damaschun H. Eckert K. Schulze-Forster K. Maurer H.R. Müller-Frohne M. Zirwer D. Czarnecki J. Damaschun G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13211-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the data cannot readily be understood by invoking cryptic sites of phosphorylation in mutants. Rather, our data fit a model in which both mutant and wild type prothymosin α molecules initially acquire phosphate at the same site and subsequently transfer it to a stable location. 2) The pH stability curves of fresh [32P]prothymosin α and the histidine-tagged mutant were similar to the bell-shaped curve exhibited by acetyl phosphate (32Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 2286-2292Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Neither phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, which are resistant to base at mild temperatures and stable in acid, nor the phosphoramidates (lysyl and arginyl phosphate) demonstrate such behavior (35Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). 3) A short incubation of crude solutions at pH 7 changed the pH stability curve of the phosphate in [32P]prothymosin α from the pattern expected for an acyl phosphate, with rapid hydrolysis at the extremes of pH, to that displayed by serine or threonine phosphate. Loss of phosphate was unaffected by the presence of a series of phosphatase inhibitors, suggesting that phosphate instability is an inherent property. From these experiments, it can be argued that the amount of stable phosphate found in prothymosin α depends heavily on the lysis conditions and that larger amounts of stable phosphate are recovered under conditions that favor the survival of unstable phosphate. 4) Reductive cleavage of prothymosin α with sodium borohydride diminished the amount of radioactive phosphate attached to prothymosin α by 5–8-fold and reduced the number of acidic residues observed upon acid hydrolysis by 4–8. Since borohydride is unreactive toward phosphate esters, the data rule out phosphoserine or phosphothreonine as significant components of in vivophosphorylation events. Instead, the disappearance of phosphate and the deficit in acidic residues after hydrolysis point to the presence of activated carbonyl groups bearing phosphate as an integral part of prothymosin α. 5) When [3H]NaBH4 was the reducing agent, tritium was incorporated into prothymosin α specifically and localized to a peptide composed of residues 48–87. Upon amino acid analysis, the label was found in proline, which arises only when a hydroxynorvaline residue, the initial product obtained from borohydride treatment of a protein-bound glutamic acid anhydride (29Degani C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Malin E.L. Dower H.J. Piotrowski E.G. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), is converted first to chloronorvaline during acid hydrolysis and later to proline during derivitization in base (31Cohen-Solal L. Blouquit Y. Cohen-Solal M. Glimcher M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although borohydride reduction of proteins produces few artifacts beyond a low level of β-amino alcohols, the reaction is clearly not stoichiometric even in well defined solutions (29Degani C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, where reduction was carried out in the presence of the contents of the entire cell, under conditions in which proteins were largely insoluble, the proline generated did not begin to equal the glutamic acid residues lost. Indeed, radioactivity was essential for discovering reduced products. The low yield is probably caused by competing reactions in very crude solutions which do not favor hydrolytic regeneration of the acid.These data strongly support the idea that prothymosin α contains glutamyl phosphates which are synthesized in vivo. Our experiments with sodium borohydride in aprotic solvents show clearly that some glutamic acid residues in a restricted region of prothymosin α from position 48 to 87 have activated carbonyl groups (i.e. they give rise to proline) and that32P-labeled groups are lost. One can postulate structures in which glutamic acid residues are covalently connected via anhydride linkages to more complex 32P-labeled entities, but such fabrications appear to be inconsistent with the pH stability curves of [32P]prothymosin α, which match those of acyl phosphates. Furthermore, measurements of the molecular weight of purified prothymosin α by mass spectrometry indicate the absence of unsuspected adducts (data not shown). We therefore conclude that prothymosin α contains phosphoglutamate. This study is the first to demonstrate phosphoglutamate in a mammalian protein and the first to use borohydride reduction in very crude solutions as an element of proof.The acquisition of phosphate on glutamic acid residues as a posttranslational modification raises questions about the relationship, if any, between these labile phosphates and other phosphorylated residues on prothymosin α, such as the phosphate found on Ser1 in 2% of bovine prothymosin α molecules (16Sburlati A.R. De La Rosa A. Batey D.W. Kurys G.L. Manrow R.E. Pannell L.K. Martin B.M. Sheeley D.M. Berger S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the 32P-labeled phosphothreonine residues found in much lower amounts in mouse prothymosin α (22Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Gonzàlez C.G. Freire M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the stable phosphates of prothymosin α are artifacts that arise upon transfer of labile glutamyl phosphates, intramolecularly, to any convenient hydroxyamino acid. 1) The amount of stable phosphate found on prothymosin α varies with the solutions used to rupture cells; buffers that support the transient survival of acyl phosphates enhance the recovery of stable phosphate. Since 90% of the stable phosphate found at pH 7 disappears at the extremes of pH, our data suggest that 10% of 2% or, at most, 0.2% of prothymosin α molecules might possess a stable phosphate obtained in vivo. Such low, erratic levels of phosphorylation should always be scrutinized. 2) The recovery of stable phosphate does not improve in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Thus, there is no reason to believe that stable phosphate is attacked during protein purification and that the amounts obtained should be greater than those noted above. Instead, the amount of phosphate could be abnormally high, due to kinase activity in vitro. 3) Prothymosin α does not acquire phosphate directly on serine or threonine during and after cell lysis. Using buffers with EDTA, it proved impossible to label prothymosin α in vitro with [32P]ATP in the presence or absence of added nonradioactive ATP or to label histidine-tagged prothymosin α in nonradioactive, transfected cells with molecules from 32P-labeled untransfected cells when both populations were mixed and lysed together. Hence, prothymosin α neither acquires new label nor loses label to phosphatases as a consequence of the disruption of cells; label has already been incorporated. 4) A short incubation in the cell lysate converts pH-sensitive phosphate to pH-resistant phosphate. These data strongly suggest that prothymosin α's phosphates are in flux, with a hydroxyamino acid (or water) as the ultimate destination. 5) The polyglutamate stretch, which we have shown contains glutamyl phosphatein vivo, mediates the transfer of phosphate to stable positions on an irrelevant molecule, β-galactosidase. In contrast, the N terminus of prothymosin α, which contains the phosphorylated serine and threonine residues, does not cause β-galactosidase to accumulate phosphate. Hence, we have been able to stably phosphorylate a non-phosphate-bearing bacterial protein expressed in mammalian cells by inserting the prothymosin α sequence that bears the glutamyl phosphates. We conclude that the phosphate flux is a transferable property mediated by the acidic region of prothymosin α. 6) Cells cannot phosphorylate Ser1 of prothymosin α (36Wang R.-H. Tao L. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26405-26412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When specific peptides bearing N-terminal acetylserine or the amino-terminal sequence of prothymosin α were added to the lysis buffer under a variety of conditions including those most conducive to phosphorylation by a traditional kinase ([γ-32P]ATP and Mg2+) or incubated with extracts of whole cells labeled with [32P]inorganic phosphate in vivo, no phosphorylated specific peptides were recovered (36Wang R.-H. Tao L. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26405-26412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These experiments argue against a cellular activity capable of phosphorylating prothymosin α directly on Ser1 in vivo. We have failed to find the tools for direct stable phosphorylation of prothymosin α and, therefore, propose that the mechanism must be indirect. By eliminating the traditional kinase pathway and discovering the ability of specific prothymosin α sequences to direct phosphorylation of a heterologous substrate, our experiments lead to a model in which labile phosphate obtained in vivo migrates during cell lysis to any conformationally available stable position at sufficient concentration, e.g. those on prothymosin α, those remaining on mutant prothymosin α, or those on fused β-galactosidase.Glutamyl phosphates are largely invisible. Rapid hydrolysis in vitro is the hallmark of an acyl phosphate; prothymosin α loses its glutamyl phosphates, which were acquired in vivo, almost instantaneously upon cell lysis, and the aspartyl phosphates of Che Y (39Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and NtrC (40Weiss V. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1988; 85: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which were labeled in vitro under carefully defined conditions, disappear with half-lives of ∼6 s and 3.5 min, respectively. Che Y and NtrC, each with one aspartyl phosphate, are examples of bacterial response regulator proteins, which comprise the second member of two-component systems (reviewed in Refs.42Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 43Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 532Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Appleby J.L. Parkinson J.S. Bourret R.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated proteins, as well as examples drawn from the ATPases (reviewed in Ref. 45Pederson P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (818) Google Scholar), have an acyl phosphate as the sole element of homology with prothymosin α. Very few bona fide examples of glutamyl phosphates in eukaryotes have been described. The best documented case is that of the α2 chains of type I chicken bone collagen (46Cohen-Solal L. Cohen-Solal M. Glimcher M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4327-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), where 4–5 atoms of organic phosphorus/mol of collagen were found in the absence of phosphorylated hydroxyamino acids, phosphoamidated amino acids, or phosphorylated sugars (47Cohen-Solal L. Lian J.B. Kossiva D. Glimcher M.J. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These glutamyl phosphate groups, which survived in part during the several hours needed for purification of the protein, were later localized to a specific peptide (48Landais J.-C. Cohen-Solal L. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Glimcher M.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The enrichment in glutamyl phosphate found in collagen from mineralized tissues compared with that from unmineralized tissues prompted speculation that these groups play a role in mineralization (48Landais J.-C. Cohen-Solal L. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Glimcher M.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Such γ-glutamyl phosphates on a structural protein appear to be functionally unrelated to those of prothymosin α.Two other examples of glutamyl phosphates have been cited: guinea pig brain (Na+, K+) ATPase (49Kahlenberg A. Galsworthy P.R. Hokin L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and ATP-citrate lyase from rat liver (50Suzuki F. Fukunishi K. Takeda Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the hydroxamate derivatives used in the identification in both cases have been questioned. The acyl phosphate of the ATPase is now thought to be an aspartyl phosphate, as in the kidney enzyme (51Post R.L. Orcutt B. Nakao M. Packer L. Organization of Energy Transducing Membranes. Tokyo University Press, Tokyo1973: 25-36Google Scholar), whereas the unusual phosphate in the lyase has been assigned to a histidine residue (52Cottam G.L. Srere P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1979700634,"Galectins are a family of soluble β-galactoside-binding lectins distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates and, more recently, found also in fungus. The 32-kDa galectin isolated from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(Hirabayashi, J., Satoh, M., and Kasai, K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15485–15490) was the first “tandem repeat-type” galectin, containing two homologous carbohydrate-binding sites. Here, we report the structure of the nematode 32-kDa galectin gene. Physical mapping by yeast artificial chromosome polytene filter hybridization revealed that the 32-kDa galectin gene is located on chromosome II. Analysis of the transcript (1.4 kilobases) showed the presence at its 5′-end of a 22-nucleotide trans-spliced leader sequence (SL1). The entire genomic structure spanning >5 kilobase pairs (kbp), including the 5′-noncoding region, two intervening sequences (introns 1 and 2), and the 3′-noncoding region, was completely determined by the combination of genomic polymerase chain reaction and conventional colony hybridization. Intron 1 was relatively long (2.4 kbp) and was found to be inserted after the ninth codon (TAC) from the initiation codon. This position proved to be almost homologous to the conserved first intron insertion position in the vertebrate galectin genes (i.e. genes of mammalian galectin-1, -2, and -3 and chick 14-kDa galectin). On the other hand, intron 2 was much shorter (0.6 kbp), and it was inserted into the central region of the second carbohydrate-binding site. Although such an insertion pattern has never been observed in the vertebrate galectin genes, it seems to be common in C. elegans tandem repeat-type galectin genes, as predicted by the C. elegans genome project (Coulson, A., and the C. elegans Genome Consortium (1996) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 24, 289–291). Based on extensive sequence comparison, the origin and molecular evolution of the tandem repeat-type galectins are discussed. Galectins are a family of soluble β-galactoside-binding lectins distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates and, more recently, found also in fungus. The 32-kDa galectin isolated from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(Hirabayashi, J., Satoh, M., and Kasai, K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15485–15490) was the first “tandem repeat-type” galectin, containing two homologous carbohydrate-binding sites. Here, we report the structure of the nematode 32-kDa galectin gene. Physical mapping by yeast artificial chromosome polytene filter hybridization revealed that the 32-kDa galectin gene is located on chromosome II. Analysis of the transcript (1.4 kilobases) showed the presence at its 5′-end of a 22-nucleotide trans-spliced leader sequence (SL1). The entire genomic structure spanning >5 kilobase pairs (kbp), including the 5′-noncoding region, two intervening sequences (introns 1 and 2), and the 3′-noncoding region, was completely determined by the combination of genomic polymerase chain reaction and conventional colony hybridization. Intron 1 was relatively long (2.4 kbp) and was found to be inserted after the ninth codon (TAC) from the initiation codon. This position proved to be almost homologous to the conserved first intron insertion position in the vertebrate galectin genes (i.e. genes of mammalian galectin-1, -2, and -3 and chick 14-kDa galectin). On the other hand, intron 2 was much shorter (0.6 kbp), and it was inserted into the central region of the second carbohydrate-binding site. Although such an insertion pattern has never been observed in the vertebrate galectin genes, it seems to be common in C. elegans tandem repeat-type galectin genes, as predicted by the C. elegans genome project (Coulson, A., and the C. elegans Genome Consortium (1996) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 24, 289–291). Based on extensive sequence comparison, the origin and molecular evolution of the tandem repeat-type galectins are discussed. Galectins are a group of animal lectins characterized by metal independence and specificity for β-galactosides (Refs. 1Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Drickamer K. Feizi T.

Glycotechnol. 1997; 9 ($$): 1-84Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although biological phenomena in which galectins are involved are extremely diverse, all members of the galectin family must meet two criteria: specific affinity for β-galactosides and an evolutionarily conserved sequence motif in the carbohydrate-binding site (1Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Drickamer K. Feizi T. Gitt M.A. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K. Leffler H. Liu F.-T. Lotan R. Mercurio A.M. Monsigny M. Pillai S. Poirier F. Raz A.

Galectins had been found only in vertebrates until we found a 32-kDa lectin that has a primary structure homologous to those of vertebrate galectins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (8Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Ohyama Y. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This worm was considered to be an excellent model animal (10Brenner S.

Shakes D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48 ($$)Google Scholar) in which to study the genetics of galectins. Since we recently found thatC. elegans also has a prototype galectin (13Hirabayashi J. Ubukata T. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it has become evident that the nematode has a set of galectins similar to that of mammals. Therefore, galectins may have been playing fundamental roles in the animal kingdom since the Precambrian era, conserving their fundamental structures and sugar binding specificity. This view is supported by the finding that a primitive metazoan, the marine spongeGeodia cydonium (14Pfeifer K. Haasemann M. Gamulin V. Bretting H. Fahrenholz F. Müller W.E.G. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), also has galectins. More recently, galectins were also found in fungus (15Cooper D.N.W. Boulianne R.P. Charlton S. Farrell E.M. Sucher A. Lu B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1514-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 32-kDa galectin of C. elegans was the first example not only of an invertebrate galectin, but also of a “tandem repeat-type” galectin. It is composed of two domains, each of which is homologous to typical vertebrate 14-kDa type galectins (∼25% amino acid identity). Subsequently, it was suggested that all known galectins can be classified into three types in terms of molecular architecture, i.e. prototype, chimera-type, and tandem repeat-type (3Hirabayashi J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1993; 5: 251-270Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, the number of tandem repeat-type galectins found has recently been increasing. Although neither the biological functions nor the overall three-dimensional structures of tandem repeat-type galectins have been established, we recently proposed a possible role as a “heterobifunctional cross-linker” (37Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the observation that the first and second domains of rat galectin-4 show significantly distinct saccharide specificities (31Oda Y. Herrmann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C.W. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent immunohistochemical studies showed that the 32-kDa galectin is localized most abundantly in the adult cuticle of C. elegans(38Arata Y. Akimoto Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Hirano H. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), implying that it may be an essential component of the adult cuticular matrix for the construction of the tough and durable outer barrier of the worm's body. It is of interest to examine whether or not nematode and mammalian tandem repeat-type galectins originated from a common ancestor molecule. Here, we report the genomic structure of the 32-kDa galectin of the nematode C. elegans. By comparing the elucidated intron-exon organization with those of mammalian galectin genes identified so far (and also with those of several tandem repeat-type galectin genes in C. elegans identified by the recent genome project (44Coulson A. the C. elegans Genome Consortium Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), we may find a clue to the molecular evolution of the tandem repeat-type galectin genes. The fact that tandem repeat-type galectins are commonly found in nematodes (protostomes) and mammals (deuterostomes) implies that these cross-linking molecules are of fundamental importance. The nematode C. elegans was cultivated in liquid medium as described previously (13Hirabayashi J. Ubukata T. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The worms were harvested by conventional methods, and the genomic DNA was prepared as described (11Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). YAC 1The abbreviations used are: YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; kbp, kilobase pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. -gridded polytene and Suppoly filters, YAC clone Y61H10, and the cosmid clones B0553, C13F7, C15B1, C18B8, F31B9, and W06D10 were provided by Dr. Alan Coulson (Sanger Center, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The filters were screened by hybridization using the α-32P-labeled probe as described previously (12Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48 ($$)Google Scholar). The DNA from Y61H10 and cosmids was prepared as described (12Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48 ($$)Google Scholar). The genomic DNA isolated from the nematode C. elegans or DNA isolated from YAC Y61H10 was digested with several restriction enzymes and subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA fragments were transferred to a nylon membrane filter (Hybond-N, Amersham Life Science, Inc.) in an alkaline solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. A fragment (0.8 kbp) of the 32-kDa galectin cDNA amplified by PCR was labeled using the Megaprime™ DNA labeling system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) with [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol). For probing introns 1 and 2, intron fragments were amplified by PCR, and the products isolated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis were purified using Prep-A-Gene® DNA purification systems (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated dNTPs and excess primers. Purified intron fragments were also α-32P-labeled using the Megaprime™ DNA labeling system. Southern hybridization was performed essentially as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), except that Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Corp.) was used both for prehybridization and hybridization. Oligonucleotide primers were distinguished by the position number in the cDNA sequence (position 1 corresponds to A of the ATG translation initiation codon) (9Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The letters “F” and “R” stand for “forward primer” and “reverse primer,” respectively. These primers were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems Model 392A DNA synthesizer. The sequences and positions of the primers are shown in Fig. 1. LA Taq(Takara Shuzo Corp.), which has a proofreading activity, was used for the polymerase chain reaction. Plasmids for DNA sequencing were prepared using the Wizard™ Plus miniprep DNA purification system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequences were determined by the dye termination cycle sequencing method using an ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Sequencing FS Ready Reaction kit with an Applied Biosystems Model 373S DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify fragments of the 32-kDa galectin gene using cDNA (9Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and genomic DNA as templates. The PCR products obtained using genomic DNA were ligated to pCRII (Invitrogen). For intron 1, primers −14F and 273R were used to generate a PCR product, which, in turn, served as a template for an additional round of PCR using primers −5F and 171R. For intron 2, primers 574F and 654R were used. These vectors were used to transform competent INVαF′ cells, and the cloned DNAs were sequenced. Since, for an unknown reason, it was not possible to read the mostly internal sequences of intron 2 with primers specific for the pCRII vector, a secondary PCR product obtained using the 1.05-kbp PCR product (primers 422F and 840R) as a template and two internal primers (INT-F (5′-TGCTCCGATGTTATGCGT-3′ and INT-R (5′-GTTTGTTGAAGAGCGCCA-3′)) was analyzed. For cloning the genomic fragment including the 5′-upstream region, the coding region between the 5′-untranslated region and intron 1, and a part of intron 1, the genomic DNA was cleaved at the SalI site in the upstream region predicted by Southern analysis and at the PstI site in intron 1. For cloning the genomic fragment from the 3′-end region of intron 1 to the 3′-noncoding region of the galectin gene, which includes intron 2, the genomic DNA was cleaved at the XbaI site in intron 1 and at the XhoI site in the downstream region predicted by Southern analysis. The predicted sizes of the SalI/PstI and XbaI/XhoI fragments were 1.5–2 and 2–2.5 kbp, respectively. After digestion of the genomic DNA, DNA fragments were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Sea Kem® GTG® agarose, FMC Corp. BioProducts) and visualized in the presence of ethidium bromide, and then the gel blocks containing the desired bands were cut out with a razor blade. DNA was extracted using Prep-A-Gene® DNA purification systems. After ligation to the plasmid vector pBluescript, the vector was used to transform competent JM109 cells. The genomic library composed of SalI/PstI fragments of ∼1.5–3 kbp was screened with a probe prepared by PCR using primer −5F and a reverse primer corresponding to the site just upstream of the PstI site in intron 1 (5′-CTGCAGAAGCAATTTGAAATTCG-3′). The genomic library composed ofXbaI/XhoI fragments of ∼1.5–4 kbp was screened with an intron 2 probe. Colony hybridization was performed using Rapid-hyb buffer both for prehybridization and hybridization. After two rounds of screening, a single clone was isolated, and the DNA sequence was determined. For DNA sequencing the 1.8-kbp SalI/PstI fragment in pBluescript, a Kilo-Sequence Deletion kit (Takara Shuzo Corp.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate deletion mutants. Briefly, the fragment in pBluescript was digested with eitherSalI plus KpnI or SpeI plusSacI for removal of the 5′-region or the 3′-region of the fragment, respectively. After treatment with exonuclease III for varying lengths of time, the single-stranded part of the digested DNA was removed by mung bean nuclease treatment, and blunt-ending was conducted using the Klenow fragment. The pBluescript plasmid with blunt ends on both sides was recircularized with DNA ligase and used for transformation of competent JM109 cells. Approximately 50 colonies were picked up, and the plasmid was isolated from each colony using the Wizard™ Plus miniprep DNA purification system. Several colonies with inserts of varying length were chosen and subjected to DNA sequencing using the vector-specific T7 promoter primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) or the T3 promoter primer (5′-CAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′). For DNA sequencing the 2.2-kbp XbaI/XhoI genomic fragment in pBluescript, inner primers (151F, 361F, 554F, 818F, 1006F, 1036F, 171R, 239R, 486R, 676R, 840R, 903R, and 1071R) corresponding to the coding region of the 32-kDa galectin, an intron 2-specific forward primer (5′-TGCATGTGTCTATTTCTATTGG-3′), and vector-specific primers (T7 and T3 promoter primers) were used for sequence walking. A cDNA fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used as a probe for transcripts of the nematode 32-kDa galectin. Total RNA or poly(A)+ RNA from C. elegans (11Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar, 12Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48 ($$)Google Scholar) was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the probe as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A λZAP cDNA library of C. elegans (mixed stages) (provided by Dr. R. H. Waterston, Washington University School of Medicine) or cDNA obtained from C. elegans was used as a template for amplification of the 5′-end of the 32-kDa galectin cDNA by PCR. Two specific primers for two kinds oftrans-spliced leader sequences (SL1 and SL2, 5′-GTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3′ and 5′-GGTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG-3′, respectively) were used as forward primers, and primer 239R was used as the reverse primer. The derived product of this primary PCR was diluted 100-fold and used as the template for the secondary PCR, in which the SL1 primer plus primer 214R or the SL2 primer plus primer 214R were used as primers. The main product (∼270 bp) obtained with the SL1/214R primer set was used as the template for the third PCR using the SL1 primer and primer 171R. The product was inserted into the TA cloning vector pCRII, which was used to transform competent INVαF′ cells. The DNA sequence of the inserted fragment was determined. Using several combinations of primers corresponding to the coding region of the 32-kDa galectin and comparing the PCR product size of the reactions using cDNA and genomic DNA as templates, we found that an intron (which turned out to be intron 2 described below) exists in the coding region of the second lectin domain. A 1.05-kbp PCR product, obtained using primers 422F and 840R, contained intron 2 and parts of the neighboring exons. This fragment was used to screen polytene filters to locate the 32-kDa galectin gene in the genome of C. elegans. YAC polytene filters consist of a grid of 958 YAC clones (12Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48 ($$)Google Scholar, 40Coulson A. Kozono Y. Lutterbach B. Shownkeen R. Sulston J. Waterston R. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which were selected to give a 2-fold coverage of the whole genome ofC. elegans. YAC clone Y61H10 was found to give a positive hybridization signal (Fig.2 A). We isolated DNA from cosmid clones that overlap YAC Y61H10 (B0553, C13F7, C15B1, C18B8, F31B9, and W06D10, provided by the Sanger Center) and conducted PCR with several combinations of primers. However, none of them gave a positive product. A supplementary (Suppoly) grid of 223 YAC clones (also provided by the Sanger Center) was screened with the intron 2 probe. Clones Y81G3 and Y48C3, which overlap with Y61H10, were found to be positive (data not shown). When the DNA isolated from YAC Y61H10 was digested with various restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blot analysis with the cDNA probe (Fig. 2 C), the size of each positive hybridization signal matched those obtained by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the worm (Fig.2 B). We conducted PCR using Y61H10 DNA as a template with primers 422F and 840R and obtained only one product, the size of which (1.05 kbp) was the same as that produced using the genomic DNA as a template. These results confirmed that the 32-kDa galectin gene is mapped to Y61H10 and thus is located on chromosome II (where Y61H10 is mapped). Since it is important to know the sizes and insertion points of introns to elucidate the structure of the 32-kDa galectin gene, the sizes of the PCR products obtained using cDNA and genomic DNA as templates were compared. The primers used are indicated in Fig. 1. First, the region connecting the two lectin domains was searched. Primers 361F and 486R were used, but no evidence for the existence of an intron was obtained. Then, >20 combinations of primers covering the whole coding sequence were used. When the sizes of the two reaction products were different, inner primers were used for the next PCRs to narrow the location of the intron. The results, summarized in TableI, suggested the existence of at least two introns: one between primers −5F and 171R and the other between primers 574F and 654R (Fig. 1). Amplification of the −5F/171R fragment of the genomic DNA was possible only using the LA Taq system containing Pfu polymerase, which has a proofreading activity, since the product size (2.5 kbp) was too big for the conventional Taq polymerase.

Open table in a new tab The sequences of the above two PCR products inserted in the pCRII vector were determined by dideoxy cycle sequencing. For the −5F/171R product, the vector-specific T7 promoter primer and the M13 reverse primer (5′-ACACAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) were used. Since the maximum length that can be determined in one dideoxy cycle sequencing reaction is ∼500–600 base pairs, inner primers corresponding to the region near the 3′-end of the determined sequence were synthesized and used for the next cycle sequencing reactions. In this way, using five primers (including four inner primers) each for the two directions, the whole sequence of the −5F/171R product was determined. The primers were RP-1 (5′-GATGTCTTGTGCCTTCTTGAA-3′), RP-2 (5′-AAATGCGGTAAACAGTAATGC-3′), RP-3 (5′-GGTCGTCAGTTCTTCGTTTGA-3′), RP-4 (5′-TCTTCCGCTTTTTCGGGTCTC-3′), F104 (5′-GCTCCCCAGACTTTCATACAG-3′), F103 (5′-GCGAGTCAAACGAAGAACTGA-3′), F203 (5′-GAACGGAACTTTCTGGAGAGG-3′), F102 (5′GGTGGGCGGCAAACGATTTTT–3′), and F101 (5′-TTCAAGAAGGCACAAGACATC-3′). Comparison with the cDNA sequence indicated that this intron is inserted between C (27th nucleotide of cDNA from the ATG start codon) and C (28th nucleotide) near the 5′-end of the cDNA (Fig.3, intron 1). The whole sequence of intron 1 will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bases with accession number D85886. For the analysis of the 422F/840R product, the vector-specific T7 promoter primer and the M13 reverse primer were used. Although the insert was not long (∼0.6 kbp), determination of the whole sequence by one reaction in either the forward or reverse direction was not possible. Fluorescence signals on the electropherogram always weakened significantly at a certain position and became undetectable beyond this position, probably due to the secondary structure of the template. Therefore, two intron-specific inner primers, INT-F (5′-TGCTCCGATGTTATGCGT-3′) and INT-R (5′-GTTTGTTGAAGAGCGCCA-3′), were synthesized to amplify the inner part. The product of the secondary PCR was inserted into the pCRII vector, and its whole sequence was determined. It appeared that a single intron (intron 2) is inserted between G (603th nucleotide of cDNA) and C (604th nucleotide). This region corresponds to the central part of the second lectin domain (Fig. 3, intron 2). The whole sequence of intron 2 will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bases with accession number D85887. Since introns in C. elegans genes are generally smaller than those of other eukaryotes (41Blumenthal T. Thomas T. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 305-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), some small introns might have been overlooked by the present procedure, which is based on comparison of the PCR products of the genomic DNA and cDNA. Moreover, the primers used corresponded only to the coding region. Therefore, if there were introns in the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions, they would not be detected. We tried to isolate genomic clones containing the 32-kDa galectin gene from the phage genomic library."

Yet, the adult small intestine also retains the plasticity to respond to cues both internal and environmental to modulate intestinal function. The components that regulate this development, differentiation, and modulation at the molecular level are only now being elucidated. We have used the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene as a model to identify potential cis-regulatory components involved in these processes within the small intestine. In mammals, high levels of ADA in the small intestine are limited specifically to the differentiated enterocytes within the duodenal region. These studies describe the identification of a region of the human ADA gene, completely distinct from the previously identified T-cell enhancer, which is capable of directing the human intestinal expression pattern in the intestine of transgenic mice. The reporter gene expression pattern observed in these transgenic mice is identical to the endogenous gene along both the cephalocaudal and crypt/villus axis of development. Timing of this transgene activation, however, varies from that of the endogenous mouse gene in that the transgene is activated approximately 2 weeks earlier in development. Even so, this precocious activation is also limited to the epithelium of the developing villi strictly within the duodenal region of the small intestine.

Free nucleotides and nucleosides have been shown to be intimately involved in the normal function and regulation of a wide variety of systems, including but not limited to neurotransmission, vasodilation, platelet aggregation, energy transportation, and the synthesis of nucleic acids. A balance of purine and pyrimidine pools in some cells is critical. Excess amounts of some purine compounds cause cell death in developing thymocytes (1Kizaki H. Shimada H. Ohsaka F. Sakurada T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1652-1657PubMed Google Scholar) and in neural cells (2Wakade A.R. Przywara D.A. Palmer K.C. Kulkarni J.S. Wakade T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17986-17992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Insufficient intracellular pools have been shown to be involved in precocious differentiation of cultured intestinal cells (3He Y. Chu S.H. Walker W.A. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1017-1027PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, some of the most effective chemotherapy agents are those that are able to interfere with purine metabolism (4Elion G.B. Science. 1989; 244: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Maintenance of these pools within acceptable limits is accomplished by enzymes of the purine and pyrimidine de novo and salvage pathways. Adenosine deaminase (ADA), 1The abbreviations used are: ADA, adenosine deaminase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); LCR, locus control region; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; A/P, anterior/posterior; C/V, crypt/villus. 1The abbreviations used are: ADA, adenosine deaminase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); LCR, locus control region; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; A/P, anterior/posterior; C/V, crypt/villus. a member of the purine salvage pathway, catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. ADA is expressed in all human tissues, yet levels vary in a specific fashion from the highest levels in thymus (790 nmol/min/mg) and duodenum (570 nmol/min/mg) to much lower levels in tissues such as liver (10 nmol/min/mg; Refs.5Adams A.

The absence of this enzyme in humans leads to a severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by an absence of both B- and T-cells as well less dramatic changes in other tissues (8Kredich N.M.

Studies in our laboratory have concentrated on the identification and characterization of cis-regulatory elements controlling the tissue-specific pattern of ADA expression. Basal promoter activity for the human ADA gene has been mapped in vitro to 81 bp of 5′-flanking sequence. This basal promoter has no inherent tissue specificity. The proximal promoter region contains no consensus CCAT or TBP binding sites, but it does possess multiple functional Sp1 binding sites that are necessary for both basal and T-cell enhancer-driven activation of this promoter in vitro(11Dusing M.R. Wiginton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Neither this minimal promoter nor an additional 3.7 kb of 5′-flanking sequences are capable of consistently activating transcription of a reporter gene in transgenic mice. Even low level activation was absent in a wide variety of tissues examined (7Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J. McNeish J. Potter S. Witte D. Wiginton D.

Consistent, high level transgene expression was observed in the thymus of mice with transgenes containing both the promoter fragment and a T-cell-specific cis-regulatory region from the first intron of the human ADA gene (7Aronow B.

This region directs high level, thymus-specific expression of a linked reporter gene in transgenic mice in an insertion site-independent, copy-proportional manner. It is also able to drive variable low level expression in all tissues examined. Characterization of this region revealed an enhancer element of 230 bp capable of elevating reporter gene expression in transient assay systems and containing consensus binding sites for the E box (13Ephrussi A.

Compared with the information regarding regulation of human ADA in thymocytes, much less has been discovered about its regulation in other human tissues. A region in the 5′-flank of the mouse ADA gene has been described which is involved in expression in mouse forestomach and fetal placenta (24Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J.

Previously, no region of either the mouse or the human ADA genes has been identified which is involved in driving high level expression in either maternal decidua or small intestine.

No positive clones could be detected after repeated transformation into rubidium chloride-treatedEscherichia coli (DH5α, Life Technologies, Inc.). Poor transformation efficiency by this method seemed to be directly related to the large size of these plasmids. Ligation products were introduced successfully into E. coli by electroporation (Bio-Rad), and this method was used routinely. A 7,685-bp HindIII fragment from p5′acba L117 was isolated and ligated to HindIII-cut pUC 18. A 7,685-bp SphI fragment was removed from the resulting plasmid and ligated to SphI-cut p5′acba to create p5′acba L117 Δ1. p5′acba L117 was digested with ApaLI, filled using T4 polymerase and dNTPs, and subsequently digested withSalI to isolate a 8,765-bp fragment. A 49-bpSalI-SphI fragment from pGEM-5Zf- (Promega) was ligated to SalI-SphI-cut p5′acba. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRV and SalI and ligated to the 8,765-bp fragment described above to create p5′acba L117Δ2. A 9,612-bp ApaLI fragment from p5′acba L117Δ1 was filled with T4 and dNTPs, digested with SacI, and a 5,723-bp fragment was isolated and ligated into p5′acba plasmid that had been BamHI cut, T4 filled, and then SacI cut to generate p5′acba L117Δ3. All clones were chosen by restriction analysis such that the ADA genomic segments that they contain are in the same relative position and orientation to each other as in the human ADA gene. Plasmid DNAs for transgene isolation were prepared as described previously (12Aronow B.J. Silbiger R.N. Dusing M.R. Stock J.L. Yager K.L. Potter S.S. Hutton J.J. Wiginton D.A. Mol. Cell.

Both of these transgene fragments were analyzed in C57/C3H hybrid mice. Transgene III is a 17,364-bp BssHII-PvuI fragment from p5′acba enh L4. Transgene IV is a 20,732-bp NdeI-PvuI fragment from p5′acba enh L117. Transgene V is an 18,464-bpNdeI-PvuI fragment from p5′acba L117. Transgene VI is a 14,237-bp NdeI-PvuI fragment from p5′acba L117Δ1. Transgene VII is a 13,149-bp NdeI-PvuI fragment from p5′acba L117Δ2. Transgene VIII is an 8,915-bpNdeI-PvuI fragment from p5′acba L117Δ3. All transgene fragments were isolated from low melting point agarose by digestion with β-agarase, phenol extraction, precipitation, and purification over an Elutip-D column (Schleicher & Schuell). Transgenic mice prepared with Transgenes III–VIII were produced from FVB/N mice. Tail DNA samples from F0 mice bearing Transgenes III or IV were digested with EcoRI, and those containing Transgenes V–VIII were digested with EcoRI and BamHI. DNA was electrophoresed, Southern blotted onto MAGNANT membranes (MSI), and probed with a radiolabeled 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment from pBLCAT6 (31Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) encompassing most of the CAT coding sequence. Mice that possessed a band of the appropriate size, 1.9 kb for Transgenes III and IV and 1.4 kb for Transgenes V–VIII, were mated with non-transgenic littermates to establish lines from each founder. Offspring were analyzed by both polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot for transmission of the transgene. F1 transgenic mice were analyzed for CAT and/or ADA activity between 4 and 12 weeks of age except where noted. Small intestine segments were isolated from duodenum (2-cm section adjacent to pyloric sphincter), jejunum (2-cm section from the center of the small intestine), and ileum (2-cm section anterior to the cecum). Other tissues routinely assayed included thymus, liver, tongue, esophagus, colon, and stomach. An extended panel of tissues which was assayed once for each transgene also included quadriceps muscle, lung, heart, ovary/testes, kidney, bone marrow, and brain. For studies examining maternal decidua, transgenic F1 females were superovulated and mated to non-transgenic males. Superovulated but unmated transgenic females were used as control. The uterus was harvested 9.5 days postcoitus and assayed for ADA and CAT. Protein concentrations, CAT activity, and ADA activity were assessed as described previously (7Aronow B. Lattier D.

Liver DNA was isolated from the same mice used to determine CAT activity and digested with EcoRI (Transgenes III and IV) or EcoRI andBamHI (Transgenes V–VIII). Samples of 20, 10, 5, 3, and 1 μg of each digested liver DNA and 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 25 copy equivalents of a CAT-containing plasmid were electrophoresed, Southern blotted, and probed with the radiolabeled 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment from pBLCAT6. Blots were scanned and bands quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). A copy number standard curve was generated, and the copy number was determined by averaging the estimated copy number from each lane. Female transgenic mice containing Transgene III, line 1, or Transgene IV, line 2, were superovulated, mated to non-transgenic males, and sacrificed on day 9.5 postcoitus. Superovulated, unmated transgenic females were used as control. The uterus from a mouse containing Transgene III, line 1, was homogenized in toto and assayed for ADA and CAT and the results compared with the control. Although a 10-fold activation of ADA was observed in pregnant versus non-pregnant uterus, no significant change in CAT reporter gene activity was observed between the two. Low levels of CAT were observed for each, in the range observed for other low level tissues. This low level expression was attributed to the ubiquitous expression generated by the T-cell enhancer/facilitators. Mice from Transgene IV, line 2, were subjected to finer dissection in their analysis. Embryo and yolk sac were dissected from the uterine implantation site. Tissue samples containing the implantation site were dissected away from the non-implantation uterus. Implantation site uterine extracts contained ADA activity (5,240 nmol/min/mg) that was 65 times higher than that from either non-implantation or non-pregnant uterus. Both implantation site and non-implantation site extracts, however, had similar CAT activities that were very low (0.1–0.2% of that in thymic or duodenal extracts). Probes for in situhybridization were prepared from a pGEM-4Z plasmid containing a 550-bpHindIII-NcoI fragment from pSV0-CAT (32Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) which encompasses the 5′-end of the reporter gene. 35S- or33P-labeled probes were synthesized from linear templates with T7 or SP6 polymerases using an in vitro transcription system (Promega). Duodenal samples from transgenic mice were isolated, rinsed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C in 30% sucrose, 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were frozen in M1 embedding matrix (Lipshaw) and cut into 10-μm sections. Tissue sections were then fixed, acetylated, prehybridized, and hybridized (33Harper M. Masselle L. Gallo R. Wong-Stahl F. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 34Hayashi S. Gillam I.C. Delaney A.D. Tener G.M. J. Histochem.

After overnight hybridization at 48 °C, sections were washed at high stringency and treated with RNase A (50 μg/μl, Worthington Biochemical Corp.) and RNase T1 (50 units/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 30 min. Sections were dehydrated and exposed to Kodak NTB-2 emulsion for 1 week at 4 °C. Histological staining of sections was performed with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were observed by light- and dark-field microscopy. Tissues were isolated from four adult transgenic mice, pooled, and nuclei isolated as described previously (7Aronow B. Lattier D.

Duodenal mucosa was removed by scraping, and nuclei were isolated from the mucosa only. Polyamine buffer was supplemented with 50 mm N-acetyll-cysteine. PEFABLOC (Boehringer Mannheim) was substituted for phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at the same concentration in all solutions. DNase I digestion was carried out on 107 nuclei using 2 units of DNase I in a total volume of 0.4 ml. DNA was digested with XbaI and Southern blotted. A region from the human ADA gene (GenBank accession number M13792, residues 23293–23603; Ref. 30Wiginton D.A. Kaplan D.J. States J.C. Akeson A.L. Perme C.M. Bilyk I.J. Vaughn A.J. Lattier D.L.

A 40-kb locus containing the human ADA gene located at 20q13.11 has been cloned and sequenced previously (30Wiginton D.A. Kaplan D.J. States J.C. Akeson A.L. Perme C.M. Bilyk I.J. Vaughn A.J.

A number of fragments from this locus have been included previously in constructions with the CAT reporter gene to identify cis-regulatory elements by testing them in either transient transfection assays or transgenic mouse systems (7Aronow B.

A 0.2-kb minimal promoter, defined by transient transfection, is capable of low level reporter gene activation in a number of cell types (7Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J. McNeish J. Potter S. Witte D. Wiginton D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1384-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This low level activation is dependent upon the presence of multiple Sp1 binding sites because no TATA binding site is present within this 200-bp fragment (11Dusing M.R. Wiginton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The addition of more of the 5′-flanking region up to 3.7 kb did not improve activation levels above this low level observed in transient transfection assays. Neither of these promoter fragments, 0.2 or 3.7 kb, is able to activate even low level reporter gene expression consistently in transgenic mice in a large panel of tissues assayed (7Aronow B.

When a 12.0-kb fragment from the ADA first intron (a in Fig. 1) was included 3′ of the CAT reporter in transgenes with either the 3.7-kb (Transgene I, Fig. 1; Ref. 7Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R.

Reporter gene expression for these transgenes is both insertion site-independent and copy number-proportional in this tissue (7Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J.

Transgenic mice containing fragment a also expressed the transgene at variable low levels in all non-lymphoid tissues assayed, including duodenum (TableI and Ref. 7Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R.

A 2.3-kb fragment (b in Fig. 1) is the smallest subregion of fragmenta which was able to generate a transgene expression profile like that seen with Transgene I (Transgene II in Table I; Ref. 12Aronow B.J.

Further characterization of this 2.3-kb region has revealed a 230-bp core enhancer in the center and facilitators that flank the enhancer core. The facilitator segments have been implicated in assisting in the formation of a region of stable open chromatin at the enhancer and are associated with the LCR-like function that results in position-independent expression of the transgene (12Aronow B.J.

EBNA1 binds cooperatively to four recognition sites in the dyad symmetry (DS) element oforiP, causing alterations in the origin DNA structure, which can be detected by the increased sensitivity of one Thy residue in two of the binding sites to permanganate oxidation. To better understand the significance of this EBNA1-induced origin distortion, we have investigated the DNA sequence and EBNA1 amino acid requirements for permanganate sensitivity. We have shown that the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization domains are sufficient to induce permanganate sensitivity and that amino acids 463–467, which form an extended chain that travels along the minor groove of the EBNA1 recognition site, play an important role in generating the DNA distortion. The EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity is independent of cooperative interactions between EBNA1 molecules on the origin and requires a specific sequence within the EBNA1 binding site. Using synthetic EBNA1 binding sites, we found that the inversion of a single AT base pair in the EBNA1 recognition sequence is sufficient to confer EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity. These studies indicate that permanganate oxidation can detect very minor alterations in DNA structure.

These studies indicate that permanganate oxidation can detect very minor alterations in DNA structure. The first step in the initiation of DNA synthesis in all replication systems involves the melting of the origin DNA. In many systems the disruption of the hydrogen bonds between the bases is a function of the origin binding protein, but in others the interaction of the origin binding protein with the origin is not sufficient to melt the DNA and additional factors are required (for review, see Refs.1Brush G.S.

Origin binding proteins that do not melt DNA might, however, contribute to the melting process by destablizing the structure of the DNA helix. To better understand how localized DNA distortions caused by origin-binding proteins contribute to origin melting, we have examined the structural changes in origin DNA induced by Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). 1The abbreviations used are: EBNA1, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1; bp, base pair(s); DS, dyad symmetry; FR, family of repeats; CS, consensus binding site; CSA/T, consensus binding site with an inversion of the AT base pairs; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DMS, dimethyl sulfate. DNA replication from the Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of DNA replication, oriP, occurs once every cellular S-phase and is activated by EBNA1 (4Adams A. J.

Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). EBNA1 binds as a dimer to an 18-bp recognition site present in multiple copies in the two sub-elements oforiP, the dyad symmetry (DS) element and the family of repeats (FR) (7Rawlins D.R. Milman G.

The DS element contains four EBNA1 binding sites and likely the initiation site for DNA synthesis (7Rawlins D.R. Milman G. Hayward S.D. Hayward G.S.

Virol. 1989; 63: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of EBNA1 with the DS element has been studied by several laboratories. In vivo studies have shown that EBNA1 remains bound to the DS throughout most or all of the cell cycle (12Niller H.H. Glaser G. Knuchel R. Wolf H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12864-12868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,15Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and that the minimum requirement for origin activation is the binding of EBNA1 to the two recognition sites in either half of the DS element (sites 1 and 2 or sites 3 and 4) (14Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, EBNA1 dimers have been shown to assemble cooperatively on the four sites of the DS element (14Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating a single EBNA1 complex that sharply bends the DS DNA (17Frappier L. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10875-10879Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). EBNA1 on its own does not appear to melt oriP DNA sequences; however, two lines of evidence indicate that EBNA1 does cause localized structural distortion of the DS element. First, EBNA1 binding to the DS element induces the permanganate sensitivity of one Thy residue in each of the two outer recognition sites (sites 1 and 4). This permanganate sensitivity has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro (15Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hearing J. Mulhaupt Y. Harper S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 694-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, modeling studies with the EBNA1-DNA co-crystal structure suggest that a change in the DNA structure is necessary to accomodate binding of EBNA1 to two adjacent sites in the DS element (20Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The nature of the structural change in the DS DNA that leads to the EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity is not known nor is it clear if the DNA distortions predicted from the modeling and permanganate studies are the same or different. Localized distortion of the DS DNA by EBNA1 is of interest because it could be the first step in the melting of the origin for the initiation of DNA synthesis. To further understand the nature and importance of the EBNA1-induced distortion of the DS DNA, we have examined the requirements for the EBNA1-induced permanganate reactivity of sites 1 and 4. The construction of pGEMdyad, which contains the DS element of oriP, and pGEMs1, which contains only EBNA1 binding site 1 from the DS element, have been previously described (17Frappier L. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10875-10879Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,21Goldsmith K. Bendell L. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3418-3426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the palindromic EBNA1 consensus binding site (CS) or the consensus binding site with an inversion of the AT base pairs at position 6 and −6 (CSA/T) were constructed from the oligonucleotides 5′-GGGTAGCATATGCTACCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAAGCATATGCTTCCC-3′, respectively. Each of these oligonucleotides was annealed to itself and then cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescriptKS to generate pCS and pCSA/T. The construct for the expression of EBNAWFwas generated by amplifying the EBNA1 gene in two fragments, which encode amino acids 452 to 463 and amino acids 464 to 641, by PCR. The 452–463 fragment was amplified using the primers 5′-CGTCGACATATGGGTCAGGGTGAT-3′ (452 primer) and 5′-CCCTCCTTTTTTGCGCCT-3′. The 464–641 fragment was amplified using the primers 5′-GCGGCGGGAAAGCATCGTGGTCAA-3′ and 5′-CCTCCAGGATCCTCACTCCTGCCCTTCCTCACC-3′ (641 primer), which converts the Trp and Phe residues at positions 464 and 465 to alanines. The two fragments of the EBNA1 gene were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated together. The ligation products were amplified by PCR using the 452 and 641 primers listed above, which generates anNdeI site at the N terminus and a BamHI site at the C terminus. PCR products were digested with NdeI andBamHI and inserted between the NdeI andBamHI sites of expression vector pET15b (Novagen), downstream of a 6-histidine tag. The EBNA1 fragment in this construct was sequenced and confirmed to be correct except that amino acid 465 was converted to a serine instead of an alanine. bEBNA1 was produced in SF-9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (9Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7819-7826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EBNA459–619, EBNA463–607, and EBNA468–607 were produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (16Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Barwell J. Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R. Tong H. Yang D. Frappier L. Edwards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20556-20559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For expression of EBNAWF, the pET15b expression construct was used to transform the BL21(DE3) pLysS strain of E. coli(23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), and transformants were grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of Super Broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A 600 was 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were harvested 3 h postinduction. Cell pellets were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then stored at −70 °C. For protein purification, cells were thawed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine and 1 mm PMSF) and sonicated to reduce the viscosity. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a DE52 column containing 4 g of resin equilibrated in lysis buffer. The DE52 flow-through was diluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, to a final NaCl concentration of 200 mm and then loaded onto a 20-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine). The column was washed with buffer A and then developed with buffer A containing 750 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine) and loaded onto a 1-ml metal chelating column charged with nickel and equilibrated in buffer B plus 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with buffer B plus 5 mm imidazole and then with buffer B plus 50 mmimidazole. The 6-histidine-tagged EBNAWF was eluted with buffer B plus 300 mm imidazole and was dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. CaCl2 was added to 2.5 mm, and the 6-histidine tag was removed from EBNAWF by thrombin digestion (10 units/mg protein) overnight at 4 °C followed by dialysis against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Permanganate assays were performed as described previously (18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, EBNA1 proteins were incubated with 0.5 μg of supercoiled pGEMdyad, pGEMs1, pCS, or pCSA/T for 10 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. KMnO4 was then added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and, after a 4-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched, the protein was removed, and the plasmid DNA was heat-denatured. 32P-End-labeled oligonucleotide primers were then hybridized to the denatured plasmids and extended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to detect the position of any oxidized thymine residues, which act as a block to the polymerase. The extension products were separated on 8% polyacrylamide/50% urea sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of the oxidized thymines were determined by comparison with dideoxy sequencing ladders generated from the same primers used for the permanganate assays. EBNA1 proteins were incubated with 0.5 μg of supercoiled pGEMdyad, pGEMs1, pCS, or pCSA/T in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 10 mm dimethyl sulfate (DMS). After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped, phenol was extracted, and the DNA was cleaved with piperidine as described previously (18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragments generated were denatured and hybridized to the same primers used in the permanganate assays, and the primers were extended with the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment as for the permanganate assays. Extension products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide/50% urea sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography. Structural changes in the DS element of oriP, which can be detected by permanganate oxidation, are induced by wild type and internally deleted versions of EBNA1 (15Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hearing J. Mulhaupt Y. Harper S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 694-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to determine if the DNA binding and dimerization domains of EBNA1 were sufficient to induce this DNA distortion or if other EBNA1 domains were required. To this end, we compared the permanganate reactivity patterns of the DS element when bound by EBNA459–619, which contains only the DNA binding and dimerization domains, with that induced by a biologically active version of EBNA1 (bEBNA1; Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, bEBNA1 and EBNA459–619 generated identical permanganate reactivity patterns when titrated onto the DS element. Both proteins caused one Thy residue within EBNA1 binding site 1 and one Thy residue within EBNA1 binding site 4, on the opposite DNA strand, to become oxidized by KMnO4. For simplicity, results are shown for one DNA strand only (detecting the oxidized T in site 1); however, in all cases where permanganate sensitivity was detected in site 1, it was also detected in site 4 (data not shown).Figure 2EBNA1 amino acid requirements for DS permanganate sensitivity. A, bEBNA1, EBNA459–619, EBNA463–607, and EBNA468–607 were titrated onto supercoiled plasmids containing the DS element, and permanganate assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of the four EBNA1 binding sites in the DS element are indicated as is the position of the permanganate-sensitive Thy residue in site 1 (arrow).

Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). An EBNA1 truncation mutant lacking this extended chain (EBNA468–607) retains the ability to bind to high affinity EBNA1 recognition sites, such as sites 1 and 4, but is severely impaired in its ability to bind to lower affinity sites, such as sites 2 and 3 of the DS element (16Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if this interaction with the minor groove of the DNA causes the distortion that results in permanganate sensitivity, we repeated the permanganate assays using EBNA468–607 and EBNA463–607, which lack all or part of the extended chain, respectively. The results in Fig. 2 A show that EBNA463–607, but not EBNA468–607, causes the permanganate reactivity pattern seen with bEBNA1. The same results were obtained for site 4 on the opposite DNA strand (data not shown). These results suggest that the minor groove-extended chain of EBNA1 is responsible for the permanganate sensitivity. To verify that the failure of EBNA468–607 to induce permanganate reactivity was not due to failure to bind the DS element, we performed methylation protection footprints with EBNA468–607 on the DNA templates used for the permanganate experiments. The results in Fig. 2 B show that all of the EBNA1 proteins, including EBNA468–607, bound to the DS element at the protein concentrations used in the permanganate experiments. For bEBNA1, EBNA459–619, and EBNA463–607, simultaneous filling of the four recognition sites of the DS was observed, at 10 to 30 pmol of protein for both bEBNA1 and EBNA459–619 and at 90 pmol for EBNA463–607. This is the same pattern of filling of the DS that has been reported previously for bEBNA1 (18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, binding to each of the four binding sites is indicated by the lightening of the bands indicated by the arrows in Fig.2 B. Binding to site 4 is also detected by the appearance of the band indicated by the asterisk, which represents a DMS-hypersensitive adenine. Unlike the larger EBNA1 proteins, EBNA468–607 was observed to bind only to sites 1 and 4 of the DS (at 90–270 pmol of protein); interactions with sites 2 and 3 were not detected at any of the protein concentrations tested. The failure of EBNA468–607 to induce permanganate reactivity within sites 1 and 4 of the DS element could be interpreted in either of two ways. First, it might indicate that EBNA1 sequences between amino acid 463 and 468 are required to distort sites 1 and 4. Second, it might indicate that binding to sites 2 and/or 3 is required for the induction of permanganate reactivity within sites 1 and 4 since EBNA468–607 was the only EBNA1 protein tested that did not bind sites 2 and 3. To distinguish between these possibilities, we repeated the permanganate assays on DNA templates that contained only EBNA1 binding site 1 (pGEMs1). The results in Fig.4 show that the binding of EBNA459–619 and EBNA463–607 to site 1 alone is sufficient to cause permanganate oxidation of the same Thy residue that is reactive in the complete DS sequence. As was the case with the DS DNA templates, induction of permanganate reactivity within site 1 with the pGEMs1 template was not induced by EBNA468–607. These results indicate that EBNA1 sequences between amino acids 463 and 468 are required to distort site 1 and that binding to additional sites in the DS is not required for this distortion. This DNA distortion is independent of the supercoiling of the DNA template since the same permanganate-sensitive T was induced in site 1 when experiments were performed on linear, as opposed to supercoiled, DNA templates (Fig.4 A). The methylation protection footprints shown in Fig. 4 Bverify that all of the EBNA1 proteins tested, including EBNA468–607, bound to site 1 at the concentrations used in the permanganate reactions. The degree of protection of the diagnostic band in site 1 (arrow) by EBNA468–607 was somewhat less than that seen for the larger EBNA1 proteins; however, the intensity of this band was still reduced compared with that seen in the absence of protein (in the absence of protein the diagnostic band is equal in intensity to the band just above it; with EBNA468–607 it is less intense than the band above it). These results suggest that EBNA468–607 may bind less stably to site 1 than the other EBNA1 proteins. The crystal structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization domains bound to DNA revealed a peculiar arrangement of the Trp-464 and Phe-465 side chains within the minor groove of the DNA (20Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). The aromatic rings of these residues are oriented parallel with the minor groove and appear to be pushing on the two sugar phosphate backbones. The minor groove of the DNA is widened by 2–3 Å at this point (20Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine whether Trp-464 and Phe-465 are responsible for generating the DNA disortion that leads to permanganate reactivity within site 1, we repeated the permanganate assays using a version of EBNA1 that contains the complete DNA binding and dimerization domains in which Trp-464 and Phe-465 have been changed to alanine and serine residues, respectively (EBNAWF; see Fig. 1). EBNAWF was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays to bind site 1 with a 10–20-fold reduced affinity relative to the same EBNA1 fragment containing the wild-type sequence. 2A. Fleming, and L. Frappier, unpublished data. When EBNAWF was titrated onto pGEMs1, it was observed to induce permanganate oxidation of the same Thy residue as that seen with wild-type EBNA1 (Fig. 5). The amount of protein required for this reactivity (30–90 pmol) corresponded to the amount of protein required to bind site 1, as determined by methylation protection footprints perfomed on the same DNA template (Fig. 5). Therefore, the aromatic side chains of Trp-464 and Phe-465 are not responsible for the DNA distortion that leads to permanganate reactivity within site 1. The results described above show that EBNA1 binding to some individual recognition sites causes a change in DNA structure leading to permanganate sensitivity. Ultimately, we would like to determine the nature of the structural change in the DNA that results in permanganate reactivity. Previously we solved the structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding domain bound to a single EBNA1 binding site (20Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This binding site is a palindromic consensus sequence (Fig.6) to which EBNA1 binds with high affinity but which does not actually exist in oriP. In the EBNA1-consensus DNA structure, there was no disruption of the hydrogen bonds between the bases of the two DNA strands nor was there any other obvious distortion of the DNA structure that might be expected to cause permanganate sensitivity. However, since little is known about the DNA structural requirements for permanganate oxidation, we tested the EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity of the consensus EBNA1 binding site. For these experiments, the consensus 18-bp binding site shown in Fig. 6 was cloned into pBluescriptKS to generate pCS. When bEBNA1 and EBNA459–619 were titrated onto pCS, binding to the consensus site was detected by DMS footprint analysis at as little as 10 pmol of protein (Fig. 7 B), but no EBNA1-induced permanganate reactivity was detected at any amount of protein tested (10–90 pmol) (Fig. 7 A). Some degree of permanganate reactivity was observed for Thy residues at positions 2 and −1 within the consensus sequence, but this sensitivity was independent of EBNA1.Figure 7The effect of the inversion of the AT base pair at position 6/−6 on permanganate sensitivity. bEBNA1 and EBNA459–619 were titrated onto pCS or pCSA/T plasmids (numbers shown are pmol of dimer), and permanganate assays (A) or methylation protection footprints (B) were performed. The position of the EBNA1 binding site is indicated by theopen box. In panel A, the 6 and −6 positions of the EBNA1 recognition sites are indicated, and sequencing reactions (G, A, T, C) are shown for each DNA template. In panel B, bands from the two DNA templates that become protected by EBNA1 are indicated by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A comparison of the sequences of the EBNA1 binding sites in the origin and the consensus EBNA1 binding site is shown in Fig. 6. For both of the EBNA1 binding sites that have been shown to be permanganate sensitive (sites 1 and 4 of the DS element), the permanganate-sensitive T residue is located at position 6, relative to the axis of symmetry of the 18-bp palindromic sites (see Fig. 6). Of the 24 EBNA1 bindings sites in oriP (4 in the DS and 20 in the FR element), only sites 1 and 4 of the DS have a Thy in this position. For the other EBNA1 binding sites (and for the other half of the imperfect palindrome in sites 1 and 4), there is an Ade at position 6 (and a Thy at position −6) i.e. an inversion of the AT base pair relative to the permanganate-sensitive Thy in sites 1 and 4. The lack of permanganate reactivity of the Thy residues at position −6 suggests that inversion of the AT base pair at position 6/−6 affects the structure of the EBNA1-bound DNA. To determine if the inversion of this AT base pair is sufficient to elicit the EBNA1-induced structural change, we constructed a perfect palindromic EBNA1 binding site that is identical to the consensus site except that the AT base pair at position 6/−6 in both halves of the palindrome has been inverted (Fig. 6, AT inversion). When bEBNA1 and EBNA459–619 were titrated with a plasmid containing this sequence, both proteins were observed to induce permanganate oxidation of the Thy at position 6 (Fig. 7). Therefore, the inversion of the AT base pair at position 6/−6 of the EBNA1 binding site enables the structural change that accompanies EBNA1 binding. Permanganate oxidation is commonly used to detect alterations in the structure of DNA helices, but the structural requirements for permanganate sensitivity are not well understood. While double-strand DNA is largely insensitive to permanganate oxidation, pyrimidines (particularly Ts) in single-strand DNA are oxidixed at the 5,6-double bond by this reagent to form pyrimidine glycols (24Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Iida S. Hayatsu H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 213: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore permanganate is useful for the detection of melted regions of double-strand DNA (26Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, however, permanganate-sensitive residues have been detected in regions of double-strand DNA that, by other criteria, are not melted. For example, the lac repressor (27Boroweic J.A. Zhang L. Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), SV40 large T antigen (28Boroweic J.A. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), repressor activator protein 1 (RAP1) (29Gilson E. Roberge M. Giraldo R. Rhodes D. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and EBNA1 (18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hearing J. Mulhaupt Y. Harper S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 694-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have all been reported to induce localized structural changes in the DNA to which they bind, resulting in the increased sensitivity of one or more T residues to permanganate oxidation. The nature of the structural changes that cause these permanganate sensitivities are not clear. Although EBNA1 does not appear to melt oriP DNA, several observations suggest that the interaction of this protein with its recognition sites in the DS element of oriP structurally alters the DNA helix. First, electron microscopic studies of EBNA1 on the DS element show pronounced bending of the DS DNA at the position where the four EBNA1 dimers are assembled (17Frappier L. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10875-10879Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, modeling studies using the EBNA1-DNA co-crystal structure suggest that the cooperative assembly of EBNA1 dimers on adjacent binding sites in the DS must be accompanied by a change in structure of the DNA, most likely unwinding and/or unbending of the DNA (20Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Third, EBNA1 binding to the DS element, both in vivo and in vitro, has been shown to induce permanganate sensitivity in one Thy residue in each of the two outer EBNA1 binding sites (15Hsieh D.-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hearing J. Mulhaupt Y. Harper S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 694-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies presented here were conducted to better understand the nature of and the requirements for the EBNA1-induced distortion of the DS element that results in permanganate sensitivity. We have shown that this permanganate sensitivity occurs on single EBNA1 binding sites, and therefore the DNA distortion detected by permanangate is distinct from that predicted by the modeling studies to accompany cooperative assembly of EBNA1 on two adjacent sites of the DS. This conclusion is consistent with the results of Harrison et al. (14Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that point mutations in sites 2 or 3 in the DS element did not abrogate the EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity of sites 1 and 4 and that this sensitivity was independent of the spacing between the EBNA1 binding sites. In their experiments, Harrison et al.(14Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used the full-length EBNA1 protein, which contains a domain that mediates interactions at a distance between DNA-bound EBNA1 molecules (21Goldsmith K. Bendell L. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3418-3426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Frappier L. Goldsmith K. Bendell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Laine A. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30914-30918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Mackey D. Middleton T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6199-6208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, although the cooperative filling of adjacent sites was disrupted by virtue of their DNA templates, it is likely that interactions occurred between EBNA1 molecules on distant sites (i.e. between sites 1 and 4, 2 and 4, or 1 and 3, and between different DNA molecules). Since EBNA1 interactions at a distance might have substituted for the interaction between EBNA1 molecules on adjacent sites in inducing permanganate sensitivity, we felt that it was important to test permanganate sensitivity under conditions in which neither type of EBNA1 interaction was possible (i.e. on individual binding sites using EBNA1 proteins that lack the domain that mediates interactions at a distance). We have explored the EBNA1 amino acids required to induce permanganate reactivity and found that amino acids 463–607, containing the DNA binding and dimerization domains of EBNA1, are sufficient to elicit this response. Deletion of part of the flanking DNA binding domain that forms an extended chain positioned along the base of the minor groove of the EBNA1 binding site (amino acids 463–467) abrogated the ability of EBNA1 to induce permanganate reactivity. We have previously shown, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, that this deletion had little effect on the ability of EBNA1 to bind to site 1 from the DS element (K d for EBNA463–607 and EBNA468–607 was 110 and 125 nm, respectively) (16Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The methylation protection footprints presented here also confirm that EBNA468–607 binds site 1, both in the context of the DS element and in isolation. However, the weaker footprint generated by this protein suggests that EBNA468–607 binds less tightly to site 1 than the larger versions of EBNA1 tested. Therefore, the requirement for amino acids 463–467 for permanganate reactivity could either reflect a specific requirement for the extended chain in the minor groove of the DNA or a requirement for tight binding. We favor the former possibility because other mutations in the EBNA1-flanking DNA binding domain that reduce binding to site 1 still induce permanganate sensitivity. An example of this is the EBNAWFmutant. This mutant gives a weaker footprint on site 1 (Fig. 5) and binds site 1 with an affinity that is approximately 15-fold lower than the same fragment of EBNA1 with the wild-type sequence (as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays),2 yet EBNAWF still induces permanganate reactivity in site 1. Investigation of the DNA sequence requirements for EBNA1-induced permanganate reactivity revealed that the differences in permanganate sensitivity of different EBNA1 binding sites is soley due to the inversion of a single AT base pair at position 6/−6 relative to the axis of dyad symmetry of the palindromic binding site. Permanganate sensitivity is only seen when the Thy residue is at position 6, generating the sequence CCCTTCGTA. This suggests that EBNA1 binding to this sequence causes a distortion in the DNA structure that does not occur when EBNA1 binds to recognition sites containing the sequence CCCATCGTA. This distortion might be facilitated by the 6-bp polypurine/polypyrimidine tract that is generated by the AT inversion since polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts have a tendency to adopt alternative DNA structures (33Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1095-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the structures of the EBNA1-bound CCCTTCGTA and CCCATCGTA binding sites might be the same, and the Thy residue at position −6 might simply be inaccessible to the permanganate reagent due to postioning of EBNA1 amino acids. These two alternative interpretations can only be resolved by solving the high resolution structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization domains on binding sites that are and are not permanganate-sensitive. We have already solved the structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization domains on the consensus binding site that is not permanganate sensitive (20Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In keeping with the results of the permanganate assays on the consensus site, distortion of the DNA helix at position 6/−6 was not apparent from this structure. We have also solved the structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding domain on the permanganate-sensitive site 1 at 2.8 Å resolution. 3A. Bochkarev, A. Edwards, and L. Frappier, unpublished data. The structure of the site 1 DNA was indistinguishable from that of the consensus site, however the particular packing arrangement of EBNA1 in the crystal form used to solve the structure would permit the EBNA1-DNA complex to crystallize in either of two orientations. As a result, the final structure of the site 1 DNA might represent an average of the two halves, and hence even moderate structural perturbations on one side of the pseudopalindromic DNA may not be revealed. To conclusively determine the structure of EBNA1-bound permanganate-sensitive DNA, we require a palindromic permanganate-sensitive EBNA1 binding site in which the structural distortion would be manifested on both halves of the palindrome. We have shown that we can generate such a binding site by inverting the AT base pair at position 6/−6 in both halves of the consensus palindrome. This finding should facilitate the structural determination of permanangate-sensitive DNA bound by EBNA1, which in turn will help us to understand the structural requirements for permanganate oxidation.

Re-LPS from Escherichia coli K12, D31 m4, lot 5 (KDO content 11.7%); Re-LPS from Salmonella minnesota R595, lot 30437B (KDO content 11.3%); and Rd-LPS from S. minnesota R7, lot 3 (KDO content 16.5%) were from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). DeOA-LPS prepared from Re-LPS R595 by mild hydrazinolysis as described previously (8Kiang J. Szu S.C. Wang L.X. Tang M. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. S. C. Szu (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Melting points were determined with a Fisher-Johns apparatus and were not corrected. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Bruker AMX-300 spectrometer at 300 and 100 MHz for 1H NMR and13C NMR, respectively. Mass spectra were recorded with a VG 70-S mass spectrometer in a chemical ionization mode (reagent gas, NH3) or a fast atom bombardment-positive mode (matrix: 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol). TLC was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates, and the carbohydrate components were detected by charring at 140 °C after spraying the plates with 15% H2SO4 in 50% ethanol or by UV absorption. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel. Ratios of solvents for TLC and column chromatography were expressed by volume. All evaporation and concentration was carried out below 40 °C under reduced pressure using a water aspirator unless specified otherwise. Compound 1, methyl 2,4,5,7,8-penta-O-acetyl-3-deoxy-α-d-manno-2-octulopyranosonate, was prepared by the acetylation of 20 g of KDO (ammonium salt) with acetic anhydride:pyridine (1:1; 160 ml). After 20 h at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was evaporated and co-evaporated with toluene, and the residue was partitioned between water (50 ml) and CHCl3 (150 ml). The organic layer was separated and washed with 5% HCl and water, dried (Na2SO4), and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to give a pale yellow foam. TLC (ethyl acetate:AcOH:H2O, 3:2:1) revealed that it contained the 2,4,5,7,8-penta-O-acetyl-3-deoxy-α-d-manno-2-octulopyranosonic acid (R F 0.5) as the major component, together with several unknown, fast-moving components. Treatment of the mixture with excess diazomethane in CH2Cl2 (200 ml), followed by silica gel column chromatography using toluene:ethyl acetate (2:1) as the eluent, gave compound 1 (18.8 g, 52% from KDO) as a white solid: R F 0.30 (toluene:ether, 1:1); m.p. 154–156 °C; m.p. (literature) 155–158 °C (9Unger F.M. Stix D. Schulz G. Carbohydr.

The data for sugar protons are listed in TablesI and II. To prepare compound 2, dry hydrogen chloride gas was bubbled into a solution of 1 (3.85 g, 7.96 mmol) in acetyl chloride (40 ml) in a 100-ml flask at 0 °C for 30 min, then the flask was sealed and kept at 4 °C. After 24 h the solution was evaporated and the residual solvent was co-evaporated with toluene to give compound 2 (3.6 g, quantitative) as a colorless oil,R F 0. 55 (toluene:ether, 1:1). This glycosyl chloride of 1 was used as the glycosyl donor (2) without further purification.Table I1H NMR data for the sugar protons of KDO derivativesHydrogenChemical shift (δ)1-aChemical shift (δ) was expressed in ppm. and multiplicity1-bMultiplicity: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet.13456H-3a2.209 t2.459 t2.237 t2.115 t1.938 tH-3e2.261 dd2.488 dd2.410 dd2.483 dd2.224 ddH-45.335 ddd5.014 ddd5.548 ddd3.865 m4.255 dddH-55.407 m5.394 m5.452 m4.002 m4.032 mH-64.184 dd4.588 d4.193 dd4.044 d3.466 dH-75.232 ddd5.231 ddd5.289 ddd3.936 m3.894 dddH-8a4.488 dd4.428 dd4.356 dd3.819 m3.706 ddH-8b4.123 dd4.372 dd4.076 dd3.819 m3.123 ddThe NMR spectra were measured at 300 MHz in CDCl3 (for 1, 3, and 4) or D2O (for 5 and6).1-a Chemical shift (δ) was expressed in ppm.1-b Multiplicity: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet.

The conjugation of 2 with 4-methyl-umbelliferone was accomplished by SN2 coupling in DMF and catalyzed phase-transfer reaction as described below. To a solution of2 (2.5 g, 5.7 mmol) in DMF (20 ml), 4-methylumbelliferone (sodium salt) (1.70 g, 8.5 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 4 h, and TLC (toluene:ethyl acetate, 1:1) indicated the disappearance of 2. DMF was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was partitioned between water (20 ml) and CHCl3 (80 ml). The organic layer was separated and washed with aqueous NaHCO3 and water, dried (Na2SO4), and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated, and the residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography using toluene:ethyl acetate (3:1) as the eluent to give a mixture of two UV-absorbing and carbohydrate-containing compounds that migrated closely on TLC (toluene:ethyl acetate, 2:1 or toluene:ether, 1:1). The mixture was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography using toluene:ether (1:1) as the eluent to obtain the β-anomer 3 (2.5 g, 76%) and the α-anomer4 (224 mg, 6.8%). Alternatively, the two anomers could be simply separated by agitation of the mixture in toluene. The β-anomer3 is quite soluble in toluene but the α-anomer4 is not. Filtration of the suspension gave pure3 in toluene and pure 4 as a solid. A mixture of 2(440 mg, 1.0 mmol), 4-methylumbelliferone (sodium salt) (324 mg, 1.5 mmol), and tetrabutylammonium bisulfate (399 mg, 1.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 ml) and aqueous NaHCO3(0.5 m, 10 ml) was shaken vigorously at 25 °C for 12 h. Then, the organic layer was separated and washed with brine and water, dried (Na2SO4), and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated and the products were purified by the procedure described above to give the β-anomer 3 (463 mg, 80%) and α-anomer 4 (44 mg 7.6%).

After 1.5 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated to 10 ml and diluted with water (50 ml). The solution was adjusted to pH 11 and maintained at this pH by adding 2 mNaOH. TLC (CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:AcOH, 65:25:4:1) indicated the complete saponification of the methyl ester after 2 h. The solution was neutralized by Dowex 50W-X8 (H+ form) to pH 4 and filtered. The filtrate was then adjusted to pH 8 by adding 0.1 m NH4OH and evaporated. The residue was applied onto a Sephadex G-10 column (2.5 × 95 cm), which was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm NH4OH, to obtain β-KDO-MU (5) as its ammonium salt (601 mg, 84%):R F 0.26 (CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:AcOH, 65:25:4:1); m.p. 117–120 °C; MS (m/z, fast atom bombardment-positive mode) 419 ((M + Na)+, 2%), 397 ((M + H)+, 3%), 154 (100%); 13C NMR (D2O set the external dioxane at δ 66.67): δ 173.73 (C-1), 164.85, 158.52, 156.68, and 153.95 (C-2′, 4′, 7′, 9′), 126.77, 117.83, 116.00, 111.99, 107.81, and 103.56 (C-2, 3′, 5′, 6′, 8′, 10′), 75.51, 70.21, 68.00, 66.43, and 64.86 (C-4, 5, 6, 7, 8), 36.09 (C-3), 18.70 (CH3); 1H NMR (D2O, set the internal HDO at δ 4.778): δ 7.573 (d, 1 H, J = 8.5 Hz, H-5′), 7.060 (dd, 1 H, J = 2.2 and 8.5 Hz, H-6′), 7.046 (d, 1 H, J = 2.2 Hz, H-8′), 6.114 (s, 1 H, H-3′), 2.320 (s, 3 H, CH3).

The data for sugar protons are listed in Tables I and II. When the KDO-cleaving activity of α-KDOase was assayed using Re-LPS or DeOA-LPS as substrate, 40 μg of LPS were incubated with an appropriate amount of enzyme in 70 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 at 37 °C for a predetermined time. The amount of KDO released was determined by high performance anion exchange chromatography (8Kiang J. Szu S.C. Wang L.X. Tang M. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and/or the periodate-thiobarbituric acid method (7Unger F.M. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1981; 38: 323-388Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). For detection of the free KDO released from LPS or α-KDO-MU by TLC, the reaction mixture contained 5 nmol of LPS or 20 nmol of α-KDO-MU in 40 μl of 50 mm sodium formate buffer pH 4.5 or 3.0 and an appropriate amount of the enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C for a preset time, the reaction was stopped by adding 40 μl of ethanol followed by brief centrifugation. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac, dissolved in 12 μl of methanol:water (1:2) and analyzed by TLC using chloroform:methanol: 12 mmMgCl2 (45/40/12) as the developing solvent. The plate was sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (10Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. 1954; : 249Google Scholar) and heated at 120 °C for 20 min to reveal glycoconjugates. The fluorometric assay of α-KDOase activity using α-KDO-MU as substrate was carried out according to the procedure described by Potier et al. (11Potier M. Mameli L. Bélisle M. Dallaire L. Melancon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The enzyme was incubated with 0.5 mm α-KDO-MU in 50 mmsodium formate buffer, pH 3.0, in a total volume of 100 μl at 37 °C. After a preset time, 1.5 ml of 0.2 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.8, was added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The released MU was determined using a Sequoia-Turner Model 450 fluorometer. One unit of α-KDOase is defined as the amount of the enzyme that liberates 1 nmol of KDO per min at 37 °C. All operations were carried out at a temperature between 0 and 5 °C. Centrifugations were routinely carried out at 20,000 ×g for 30–40 min using a Sorvall RC5C refrigerated centrifuge. Ultrafiltration was carried out with an Amicon stirred cell using a PM10 membrane. The hepatopancreas (450 g) dissected from 1 gallon of fresh oysters was homogenized with 3.2 liters of cold acetone using a Polytron homogenizer, quickly filtered through a Buchner funnel, and immediately dried under vacuum to obtain 90 g of the acetone powder of oyster hepatopancreas. The acetone powder was extracted with 2.25 liters of water containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors using a Polytron homogenizer, followed by centrifugation. The pH of the water extract was adjusted to 4.3 with a saturated solution of citric acid, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was brought to 45% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate (277 g/liter). After standing for 2 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was brought to 85% saturation with ammonium sulfate (295 g/liter). After standing overnight, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 40 ml of 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, and applied onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (5 × 100 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer at 1 ml/min, and 20-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing α-KDO-MU cleaving activity, as shown in Fig. 2 A, were pooled, concentrated to 5.0 ml, and applied onto a SP-Fractogel column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2. After washing with the same buffer, the column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5m (total volume, 170 ml). The fractions containing α-KDO-MU-cleaving activity as shown in Fig. 2 B were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. This preparation (1.4 ml) was applied to a Con A-Sepharose column (1.0 × 5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was washed with the same buffer; the α-KDOase activity was then eluted with 0.5 m methyl-α-mannoside. Fractions with α-KDO-MU-cleaving activity were concentrated, dialyzed against 1.5m ammonium sulfate, and applied to an octyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 9 cm) that had been equilibrated with 1.5m ammonium sulfate. After washing with the same buffer, the column was successively eluted with 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, and water. The majority of α-KDO-MU-cleaving activity was eluted with 1.0 m ammonium sulfate. This α-KDOase preparation was concentrated, dialyzed against 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and used for subsequent studies.

Two procedures, which have been used for the preparation of 4-methylumbelliferyl ketoside of NeuAc, were applied for the coupling of 2 with the sodium salt of 4-methylumbelliferone, namely, the direct coupling in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF (12Myers R.W. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Thomas G.H. Reynolds L.W. Uchida Y. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the catalyzed phase transfer reaction (13Rotherrnel J. Failland H. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 196: 29-40Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In both cases, the methyl (4-methylumbelliferyl 4,5,7,8-tetra-O-acetyl-3-deoxy-β-d-manno-2-octulopyranoside)onate (3) was obtained as the major product (∼80%), together with the α-anomer (4) as the minor product (∼7%). Compounds 3 and 4 could be separated either by repeated column chromatography or by taking advantage of their differential solubility in toluene. The β-anomer 3 was more soluble in toluene than the α-anomer 4. The structures of 3 and 4 were determined by mass spectrometry and by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Although it is difficult to deduce the anomeric configuration by 1H NMR analysis, we assigned the major product as the β-anomer 3 based on the following considerations. First, it is reasonable to assume that due to the anomeric effect, compound 2 should exist predominantly in the α-anomeric configuration. Second, the coupling reaction under a given condition should occur by the usual SN2 mechanism to give the product an anomeric inversion. This assignment was confirmed by the proton-coupled 13C NMR signals for C-1 in the final products. Several attempts to improve the yield of the α-anomer 4were unsuccessful. For example, silver triflate-catalyzed reaction of2 with anhydrous 4-methylumbelliferone in CH2Cl2 in the presence of molecular sieves (MS4A) led to the formation of methyl 4,5,7,8-tetra-O-acetyl-2,6-anhydro-3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-enonate (14Claesson A. Luthrnan K. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B. 1982; 36: 719-720Crossref Google Scholar) (the glycal derivative of KDO) in 82% yield instead of the coupling product. It is noteworthy that the reaction of 2with the sodium salt of 4-methylumbelliferone in DMF in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride (2 molecular equivalents) did not improve the yield of 4. Therefore, the formation of the α-anomer4 did not result from in situ anomerization of the glycosyl chloride by chloride ion that was generated during the coupling reaction, but instead, the α-anomer must have come from the contaminated β-glycosyl chloride. It should be pointed out that the formation of isomeric products was not reported in the similar preparation of MU-ketoside of sialic acid (12Myers R.W. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Thomas G.H. Reynolds L.W. Uchida Y. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Rotherrnel J. Failland H. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 196: 29-40Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). De-O-acetylation of 3 and 4, followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the methyl ester and purification by Sephadex G-10 chromatography, gave the β-anomer 5 (84%) and the α-anomer 6 (91%), respectively, as their ammonium salts. The 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 3) of 5 and 6 revealed that the sugar protons of the two anomers had distinctly different chemical surroundings. In5, the signals for H-4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were overlapping in a narrow area ranging from δ 4.04 to 3.82; whereas in 6, the signals for each proton of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 were completely separated in a wide range (δ 4.26–3.12). Some empirical 1H NMR rules have been used for deducing the anomeric configurations of KDO derivatives. One such rule is that the difference in chemical shift between H-3a and H-3e in β-anomer is usually bigger than that in α-anomer (9Unger F.M. Stix D. Schulz G. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 80: 191-195Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, these empirical rules often lead to ambiguous assignments. For example, in the present case, the difference between δ (H-3e) and δ (H-3a) in β-anomer 5 is bigger than that in α-anomer6, whereas the difference between δ (H-3e) and δ (H-3a) in β-anomer 3 is actually smaller than that in α-anomer4. This is due to the fact that the substituents could greatly influence the chemical shifts of neighboring protons. A definitive determination of the anomeric configurations of KDO derivatives could be achieved by comparison of the proton-coupled13C NMR signals of the C-l in α- and β-anomers (9Unger F.M. Stix D. Schulz G. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 80: 191-195Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In a typical 5C2 chair conformation of KDO derivatives, the dihedral angles of (C-1)–(C-2)–(C-3)–(H-3a) in α- and β-anomers are nearly 60° and 180°, respectively. Therefore, the α-anomer would give a small value for the coupling constant between C-l and H-3a (J C-1, H-3a < 1 Hz), and the β-anomer would give a relatively large coupling constant (J C-1, H-3a = 5–6 Hz), according to the Karplus relationship (15Schwarcz J.A. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1972; 50: 3667-3670Crossref Google Scholar). In the proton-coupled 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 4), the C-1 signal of 5appeared at δ 173.73 as a doublet (J C-1, H-3a= 5.5 Hz), whereas the C-1 signal of 6 appeared at δ 174.18 as a broad singlet (J C-1, H-3a < 1 Hz). Accordingly, 5 should be in the β-d-configuration and 6 in the α-d-configuration. This method was previously used for the determination of the anomeric configurations of sialic acid derivatives (16Hori H. Nakajima T. Nishida Y. Ohrui H. Meguro H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 6317-6320Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The present study shows that this assignment is equally applicable for KDO derivatives. Under mildly acidic conditions (0.2 macetate buffer, pH 4.5, 70 °C), the β-anomer was found to be much more labile than the α-anomer (Fig. 5). A similar observation was reported for the anomeric pairs of the ketosides of sialic acid, in which the equatorial aglycon was hydrolyzed much faster than the axial aglycon (17Itoh M. Shitori Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1986; 34: 1479-1484Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Furuhata K. Anazawa K. Itoh M. Shitori Y. Ogura H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1986; 34: 2725-2731Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). KDO-containing glycoconjugates have been found to contain both α- and β-linked KDO (7Unger F.M. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1981; 38: 323-388Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, α- and β-KDO-MU should be useful for studying α- and β-KDOases, and the availability of these two enzymes will facilitate the studies of the structure and function of KDO-containing glycoconjugates. Despite the medical importance of LPSs, virtually nothing is known about their degradation. The enzyme (α-KDOase) that cleaves α-linked KDO from LPSs has never been reported. The hepatopancreas of the oyster, C. virginica, was found to be rich in various glycoconjugate-cleaving enzymes. Using the periodate-thiobarbituric acid reaction (7Unger F.M. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1981; 38: 323-388Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and TLC, the crude extract of oyster hepatopancreas was found to liberate KDO from Re-LPS prepared from E. coli and S. minnesota. Since KDO residues in LPSs have been shown to be α-ketosidically linked (19Strain S.M. Fesik S.W. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13466-13477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strain S.M. Fesik S.W. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2906-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used the synthesized α-KDO-MU as substrate to follow the enzyme activity to purify α-KDOase from the crude extract of oyster hepatopancreas. Before α-KDO-MU was synthesized, we used Re-LPS as substrate, and the liberated KDO was determined by the periodate-thiobarbituric acid reaction. Initially, this method was used to monitor the purification of α-KDOase during Sephacryl-S-200 gel filtration. We subsequently found that in the column fractions, the enzyme activity detected by the Re-LPS/periodate-thiobarbituric acid reaction coincided well with that detected using α-KDO-MU as substrate. The availability of α-KDO-MU greatly facilitated the purification of α-KDOase. The oyster α-KDOase was found to be stable in the pH range of 3–8. Interestingly, the pH optima for this enzyme using the synthetic and the natural substrates were found to be significantly different. The pH optimum of this enzyme was determined to be 4.5 for releasing KDO from Re-LPS, whereas that for the hydrolysis of α-KDO-MU was 3.0 (Fig.6). Thus, the optimal pH for the hydrolysis of KDO from KDO-containing glycoconjugates cannot be inferred from the hydrolysis of α-KDO-MU. The time courses of the liberation of KDO from DeOA-LPS by α-KDOase and by acid hydrolysis are compared in Fig.7. The oyster α-KDOase was able to completely detach the KDO from DeOA-LPS. The amount of KDO released by the enzyme was found to be comparable to that liberated by acid hydrolysis. Fig. 8 shows the TLC analysis of the release of KDO from DeOA-LPS and α-KDO-MU. α-KDOase isolated from oyster hepatopancreas was able to cleave KDO efficiently from all LPS substrates tested, including Re-LPS from E. coli, Re-LPS from S. minnesota R595, Rd-LPS from S. minnesotaR7, and DeOA-LPS. However, β-KDO-MU was found to be refractory to this enzyme. Thus, the specificity of α-KDOase also supports the assignment of the anomeric configurations of the two KDO-MU anomers. The oyster α-KDOase represents the first α-KDO-cleaving enzyme, and the presence of such an enzyme in the hepatopancreas of oyster may suggest the wide occurrence of KDO in marine organisms. α-KDOase capable of liberating KDO from LPSs should be important and useful for studying the structure and function of LPSs and other α-KDO-containing glycoconjugates.Figure 8TLC analysis showing the liberation of KDO from DeOA-LPS and α-KDO-MU by oyster α-KDOase.

Here we demonstrate the formation of complexes paired between two DNAs containing such repeats in vitro and show enhancement of the pairing by glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of high mobility group protein 1 and histone H1. This assembly depends on incubation time at 37 °C and concentrations of the proteins and DNA, and the enhancement is inhibited by distamycin and actinomycin D interacting DNA through the minor groove. Structure of the DNA-DNA complex is deduced by comparison of its mobility in gel electrophoresis with those of synthetic markers of heterotetramers. Three synthetic and genomic DNA fragments containing repeats that have different arrangements exhibit different efficiencies of DNA pairing, implying that the pairing is affected by the number of repeat units and the arrangement of repeats in a sequence. Intriguingly, pairing occurs between homologous fragments but not between heterologous DNAs among the three. These results suggest that the repeat-mediated DNA pairing plays a role in organization of higher order architecture of chromatin and possibly chromosome segregation requiring sequence-specific association events of DNA molecules.

Yeast S-II was found to contain an N-terminal region of 73 residues and a C-terminal region, including a zinc ribbon motif, that are relatively well conserved in the S-II proteins of many other species (33Qian X. Gonzani S.N. Yoon H.S. Jeon C.J. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9944-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Qian X. Jeon C. Yoon H.S. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A gene disruption experiment revealed that the S-II null mutant is viable but becomes sensitive to 6-azauracil.During the study of yeast S-II, we found that there is a strict species specificity in the combination of S-II and RNA polymerase II. Yeast S-II did not stimulate mouse RNA polymerase II and vice versa. To identify the region of the S-II molecule that prescribes species specificity, we constructed various hybrid clones between yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II. We found that the region between Pro-131 and Phe-270 is needed for yeast S-II to interact with yeast RNA polymerase II and thus to suppress 6-azauracil sensitivity of S-II null mutant in vivo. The N- and C-terminal regions were shown to be interchangeable between yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II without loss of function.DISCUSSIONIt is known that the N- and C-terminal regions of S-II are relatively well conserved among various species. In particular, the sequence identity of the first 30–40 C-terminal residues is over 70% among S-II family proteins. Previously, we demonstrated that yeast S-II consists of 309 amino acid residues and that at least the first 147 N-terminal residues are dispensable for the stimulation of RNA polymerase II in vitro and the suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity in S-II null mutants in vivo. Of the remaining 162 residues, 49 C-terminal residues were shown to be essential for S-II activity, but nothing was known about the remaining 113 residues.In this paper we have demonstrated for the first time that most of these residues are related to species specificity in the interaction with RNA polymerase II. It is known that Ehrlich cell S-II has polymerase specificity and cannot stimulate mouse RNA polymerase I (17Sekimizu K. Kobayashi N. Mizuno D. Natori S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5064-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sequences of S-II are relatively well conserved among various organisms, so the species specificity of S-II in terms of the stimulation of RNA polymerase II had not been examined. We clearly demonstrated that yeast S-II cannot stimulate mouse RNA polymerase II and vice versa, and this species specificity was roughly ascribed to the above mentioned 113 residues.By constructing various hybrid molecules of yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II, we have demonstrated that the region 132–270 (or 262 in the case of Ehrlich cell S-II), consisting of 138 residues, determines the species specificity and that the above mentioned 113 residues are included in this region. Recent structural analysis of yeast S-II revealed that it is composed of three distinctive structural domains, termed domains I (1–105/124), II (106/125–246), and III (247–309) (47Morin P.E. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Sci. Acad. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We divided yeast S-II into three regions on the basis of previous deletion experiments (32Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and sequence comparison with Ehrlich cell S-II. The region 132–270 is located between domain II and domain III and does not contain the zinc ribbon.Agarwal et al. (48Agarwal K. Baek K.H. Jeon C.J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that the region 100–230 of human S-II is required for binding to human RNA polymerase II in vitro. As human S-II and Ehrlich cell S-II are very similar, the region 100–230 of human S-II may correspond to the region 132–262 of Ehrlich cell S-II; however, it is not known whether Ehrlich cell S-II stimulates human RNA polymerase II. Cipres-Palacin and Kane (49Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) prepared two mutants of human S-II, named TFIIS5 (E174A, E175A) and TFIIS7 (K187A, E175A), and showed that those residues are critical for arrest relief activity of S-II. As all these residues are located in the region corresponding to the region 132–262 of Ehrlich cell S-II, these mutants are likely to have lost the ability to interact with RNA polymerase II of the same species.This report presents two unique findings as follows: 1) yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II were not interchangeable in either in vitro or in vivo transcription systems, and 2) less conserved sequences in the region 132–270 (or 262) of S-II were found to define species specificity. These findings suggest that this region and possible S-II binding site of RNA polymerase II co-evolved in yeast and mice. The other two regions were shown to be interchangeable between yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II. The third region, region 271–309 (262–301 in the case of Ehrlich cell S-II), is crucial for the stimulation of RNA polymerase II (32Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), so the molecular mechanism of the stimulation of RNA synthesis by S-II is the same regardless of the species. Therefore, identifying the region of RNA polymerase II that interacts with the region 132–270 of S-II will provide a clue about the regulation of transcription at the level of elongation.It is noteworthy that both the YEY and YYE hybrid molecules were expressed in yeast and migrated into nuclei. It is difficult to assign the nuclear transport signal to a region of S-II, but these nuclear localization experiments rule out the possibility that the failure of YEY to suppress 6-aqzauracil sensitivity of an S-II deletion strain is simply due to mislocalization of this hybrid protein. Transcription initiation is a complex process that involves protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and factors participating in this process have been extensively characterized (1Buratowski S.

On the other hand, regulation of gene expression at the transcription elongation level has been less thoroughly studied. Recently, it has become evident that various cellular and viral genes are regulated at the level of transcription elongation (5Spencer C. Groudine M.

This report presents two unique findings as follows: 1) yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II were not interchangeable in either in vitro or in vivo transcription systems, and 2) less conserved sequences in the region 132–270 (or 262) of S-II were found to define species specificity. These findings suggest that this region and possible S-II binding site of RNA polymerase II co-evolved in yeast and mice. The other two regions were shown to be interchangeable between yeast and Ehrlich cell S-II. The third region, region 271–309 (262–301 in the case of Ehrlich cell S-II), is crucial for the stimulation of RNA polymerase II (32Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), so the molecular mechanism of the stimulation of RNA synthesis by S-II is the same regardless of the species. Therefore, identifying the region of RNA polymerase II that interacts with the region 132–270 of S-II will provide a clue about the regulation of transcription at the level of elongation. It is noteworthy that both the YEY and YYE hybrid molecules were expressed in yeast and migrated into nuclei. It is difficult to assign the nuclear transport signal to a region of S-II, but these nuclear localization experiments rule out the possibility that the failure of YEY to suppress 6-aqzauracil sensitivity of an S-II deletion strain is simply due to mislocalization of this hybrid protein."

In this paper, we have characterized this 30-kDa laminin-binding protein (LBP30). LBP30 was extracted from the crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes at pH 12 or by 0.5m NaCl but not by 2% Triton X-100. LBP30 bound to heparin-Sepharose in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. The results of lectin staining indicated that LBP30 contained both terminally sialylated and nonsialylated Ser/Thr-linked oligosaccharides. LBP30 bound laminin-2 as well as laminin-1 but not fibronectin or collagen type IV. When immobilized LBP30 was incubated with the crude peripheral nerve membrane extracts, all of the endogenous peripheral nerve laminin chain isoforms, the α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ1 chains, were detected bound to LBP30. The binding of LBP30 to laminin was inhibited by heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, or NaCl but was not affected significantly by chondroitin sulfate, dextran, or EDTA. Although LBP30 bound to laminin-1 denatured with SDS in a nonreducing condition, the binding was reduced drastically when laminin-1 was denatured with SDS in a reducing condition, suggesting that the binding of LBP30 is somewhat dependent on the high order structure of laminin-1. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the broad distribution of LBP30 in the perineurium and endoneurium of bovine peripheral nerve. These results indicate that LBP30 is a laminin- and heparin-binding glycoprotein localized in the perineurium and endoneurium of bovine peripheral nerve.

Under these circumstances, it is of utmost importance to identify and characterize the proteins that interact with laminin in peripheral nerve. Recently, we have demonstrated that, in addition to α-dystroglycan, bovine peripheral nerve contains a protein with a molecular mass of about 30 kDa that binds laminin in blot overlay assay (33Yamada H.

Crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes were suspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors: benzamidine (0.75 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), pepstatin A (0.7 μm), aprotinin (76.8 nm), and leupeptin (1.1 μm) (buffer A). For pH 12 extraction, the suspension was titrated to pH 12, extracted by either gently stirring for 1 h or rigorously stirring for 2 h at room temperature, and centrifuged at 140,000 ×g for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatants were collected by decanting, cooled to 4 °C, and titrated to pH 7.4. The pellets were suspended in the original volume of buffer A. For 0.5 mNaCl extraction, NaCl was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 0.5 m. The suspension was extracted for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected by decanting, and the pellets were suspended in the original volume of buffer A. For Triton X-100 extraction, Triton X-100 and NaCl was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 2% and 0.15 m, respectively. The suspension was extracted for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected by decanting, and the pellets were suspended in the original volume of buffer A. Crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes (2 g) were suspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. The suspension was extracted for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were circulated over 50 ml of heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. The heparin-Sepharose was washed with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, and then eluted with 250 ml of buffer A containing 0.8 m NaCl. The pooled eluates were concentrated 50-fold using an Ultrafiltration Cell (Amicon). The 0.8 m NaCl eluates (20 μg) of heparin affinity chromatography of the crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon). The PVDF transfers were blocked with 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (LBB) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (MLBB) and then incubated overnight two times at 4 °C with 10 ml of the pH 12 extracts of the crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes (5 mg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. After washing three times for 10 min at room temperature in MLBB, the proteins that bound to LBP30 on the PVDF transfers were detected with specific antibodies against various extracellular matrix ligands as described previously (33Yamada H.

After washing three times for 10 min at room temperature in LBB, the proteins that bound to the laminin PVDF transfers were eluted with 2 ml of LBB containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA. Antisera were raised in Japanese white rabbits by injecting, as immunogen, the 0.8 m NaCl eluates of heparin affinity chromatography of the crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes.

Monoclonal antibody C4 against bovine laminin β2 chain was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Immunohistochemical analysis, 3–12% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (16Yamada H. Shimizu T. Tanaka T. Campbell K.P. Matsumura K.

Briefly, laminin overlay was performed using either mouse EHS sarcoma laminin-1 (10 nm) or human placenta laminin-2 (10 nm) (43Hori H. Kanamori T. Mizuta T. Yamaguchi N. Liu Y. Nagai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and laminin-1 or -2 that bound to the proteins on the PVDF transfer was detected with affinity-purified rabbit antibody against mouse EHS sarcoma laminin. Fibronectin overlay was performed using bovine plasma fibronectin (10 nm, Sigma), and the fibronectin that bound to the proteins on the PVDF transfer was detected with affinity-purified rabbit antibody against human fibronectin. Collagen type IV overlay was performed using human collagen type IV (10 nm, Chemicon), and the collagen type IV that bound to the proteins on the PVDF transfer was detected with monoclonal antibody against human collagen type IV. Lectin overlay assay was performed using biotinylated lectins (Seikagaku Corporation), followed by detection with ABC kit (Vector). We have reported previously that, in addition to α-dystroglycan with a molecular mass of 120 kDa, bovine peripheral nerve contains two proteins, LBP30 and LBP320, with molecular masses of about 30 kDa and 320 kDa respectively, that bind laminin in blot overlay assay (Fig.1 a) (33Yamada H.

To gain insights into the subcellular localization of LBP30 in peripheral nerve, we extracted the crude bovine peripheral nerve membranes under various conditions. Previously, we have reported that LBP30 is not extracted when the crude peripheral nerve membranes are stirred gently at pH 12 for 1 h (Fig. 1 a) (33Yamada H. Denzer A.J. Hori H. Tanaka T.

More recently, we have found that a substantial fraction of LBP30 is extracted when the crude peripheral nerve membranes are stirred rigorously at pH 12 for 2 h (Fig. 1 b). On close inspection, LBP30 comprised multiple bands with two prominent uppermost bands of about 30 kDa (Fig. 1). LBP30 was also extracted from the crude peripheral nerve membranes by 0.5 m NaCl but not 2% Triton X-100 (Fig.2). This was in sharp contrast to β-dystroglycan, an integral membrane protein of Schwann cells (16Yamada H. Shimizu T. Tanaka T. Campbell K.P. Matsumura K.

In addition, a substantial fraction of α-dystroglycan and LBP320 were extracted from the crude peripheral nerve membranes under all these three conditions (Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 20.5 m NaCl and 2% Triton X-100 extraction of the crude peripheral nerve membranes. The extracts and pellets after extraction with 0.5 m NaCl or 2% Triton X-100 of the crude peripheral nerve membranes were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Laminin O/L andAnti-βDG indicate the PVDF transfers overlaid with laminin-1 or reacted with antibody against β-dystroglycan, respectively. αDG and βDG indicate α- and β-dystroglycan, respectively. The 28-kDa band detected by antibody against β-dystroglycan is presumed to be a proteolytic fragment or the unglycosylated form of β-dystroglycan, as described previously (17Yamada H. Chiba A.

Although laminin and agrin, which are both well established as heparin-binding proteins, did not quantitatively bind to heparin-Sepharose in the presence of 0.5m NaCl, LBP30 was absorbed completely by heparin-Sepharose in this condition (Fig. 3, data not shown). LBP30 was eluted from heparin-Sepharose by 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 3). To determine whether LBP30 is glycosylated, we stained PVDF transfers of the 0.8 m NaCl eluates of heparin affinity chromatography with various lectins. LBP30 was not stained with concanavalin A, Lens culinalis lectin, wheat germ agglutinin, Phaseolus vulgaris E4, P. vulgaris L4, or Datura stramoniumagglutinin (Table I). In contrast, LBP30 was stained positively with Maackia amurensis agglutinin, peanut agglutinin, and Vicia villosa agglutinin isolectin B4, which recognize sialic acid-linked α2–3 to galactose, unsubstituted Ser/Thr-linked disaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAc unit, and nonreducing terminal β-GalNAc, respectively (Table I). These results indicate that LBP30 contains both terminally sialylated and nonsialylated Ser/Thr-linked oligosaccharides. LBP30 was also stained positive with Lotus tetragonobulus lectin andUles europaeus agglutinin 1 (Table I), indicating that it contained fucose residues.Table IReactivity of various lectins with LBP 30LectinsaReactivityPNA+VVA-B4+Lotus+UEA-1+MAA+ConA−LCA−WGA−DSA−PHA-E4−PHA-L4−The abbreviations used are: ConA, concanavalin A; DSA, D. stramonium agglutinin; LCA, L. culinalis lectin; Lotus,L. tetragonobulus lectin; MAA, M. amurensisagglutinin; PHA-E4, P. vulgaris E4; PHA-L4, P. vulgaris L4; PNA, peanut agglutinin; UEA-1, U. europaeus agglutinin 1; VVA-B4, V. villosa agglutinin isolectin B4; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin.

To identify the extracellular matrix ligands that bind to LBP30, we overlaid the PVDF transfer of the 0.8 m NaCl eluates of heparin affinity chromatography with laminin-1, laminin-2, fibronectin, or collagen type IV. Although LBP30 bound laminin-2, as well as laminin-1, it did not bind fibronectin or collagen type IV (Figs. 4 a and5). Previously, we have demonstrated that laminin heterotrimers are extracted from the crude peripheral nerve membranes at pH 12 (17Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Hori H.

To identify the endogenous peripheral nerve laminin isoforms that bind to LBP30, we overlaid the PVDF transfers of the 0.8 m NaCl eluates of heparin affinity chromatography with the pH 12 extracts of the crude peripheral nerve membranes. All of the laminin chain isoforms known to be present in peripheral nerve, the α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ1 chains, were detected bound to LBP30 (Fig. 4 b).Figure 5Inhibition of the binding of laminin-1 to LBP30 by various reagents. The 0.8 m NaCl eluates (20 μg) of heparin affinity chromatography of the crude peripheral nerve membranes were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF transfer was overlaid with laminin-1 in the absence (Control) or presence of 1 mg/ml heparin (Heparin), 1 mg/ml heparan sulfate (Heparan Sulfate), 1 mg/ml chondroitin sulfate (Chondroitin Sulfate), 10 mm EDTA (EDTA), or 1m NaCl (1 m NaCl). The higher molecular weight bands are the endogenous peripheral nerve laminin chains that were present in the 0.8 m NaCl eluates of heparin affinity chromatography and reacted with antibody against laminin-1. Molecular size standards (Da × 10−3) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested several reagents that might perturb the binding of LBP30 to laminin. The binding of laminin-1 (Fig. 5) and laminin-2 (data not shown) to LBP30 was inhibited by heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, or 1 m NaCl, but only mildly affected by chondroitin sulfate or EDTA and not at all by dextran (Fig. 5, data not shown). Laminin-1 migrated as a heterotrimer with a molecular mass of over 800 kDa in nonreducing SDS-PAGE, whereas it was dissociated into the three subunit chains upon reduction (data not shown). We incubated the pH 12 extracts of the crude peripheral nerve membranes containing LBP30 with laminin-1 transferred to the PVDF membrane after SDS-PAGE in a nonreducing condition. α-Dystroglycan and LBP320 did not bind to the laminin-1 PVDF transfer (Fig. 6, data not shown), indicating that the binding of these proteins to laminin-1 was lost upon denaturation of the laminin-1 heterotrimer by SDS. In sharp contrast, LBP30 was detected as a major component that bound to the laminin-1 PVDF transfer (Fig. 6). However, the binding of LBP30 to the laminin-1 PVDF transfer was reduced drastically when laminin-1 was separated by SDS-PAGE in a reducing condition (Fig. 6). The binding of LBP30 to the laminin PVDF transfer was also reduced drastically when excess amounts of heparin were present in the pH 12 extracts during incubation (data not shown). To determine the localization of LBP30 in bovine peripheral nerve, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using affinity-purified rabbit antibody against LBP30. LBP30 was distributed broadly throughout the perineurium and endoneurium (Fig. 7). Thus, the distribution of LBP30 partially overlapped with that of laminin in bovine peripheral nerve. Our results indicate that LBP30 is a laminin- and heparin-binding glycoprotein localized in the perineurium and endoneurium of bovine peripheral nerve. The molecular identity of LBP30 remains unclear at present. LBP30 appears distinct from the two previously reported laminin-binding proteins that resemble LBP30 in size, the 32/67-kDa laminin-binding protein and carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (for reviews, see Refs. 1Tryggvason K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Mecham R.P. FASEB J. 1990; 5: 2538-2546Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 32Mercurio A.M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), for two reasons. 1) The 32/67-kDa laminin-binding protein and carbohydrate-binding protein 35, but not LBP30, can be extracted by detergents; and 2) the binding of LBP30 to laminin is not affected by the YIGSR peptide, galactose, or lactose. 2F. Saito and K. Matsumura, unpublished data. Also remaining unclear is the molecular nature of the interaction of LBP30 with laminin. In contrast to α-dystroglycan, LBP30 bound to laminin-1 denatured by SDS in a nonreducing condition, indicating that the binding of LBP30 to laminin-1 is not as dependent on the high order structure of laminin as that of α-dystroglycan. However, the binding of LBP30 to laminin-1 was reduced drastically when laminin-1 was denatured by SDS in a reducing condition, indicating that this binding is somewhat dependent on the high order structure of laminin. In contrast to α-dystroglycan, in addition, the binding of LBP30 to laminin was not affected significantly by EDTA, indicating that the binding is not critically dependent on divalent cations. On the other hand, the binding of LBP30 to laminin was inhibited by heparin, heparan sulfate, or dextran sulfate, but was affected only mildly by chondroitin sulfate and not at all by dextran. These findings raise the possibility that the binding of LBP30 to laminin may be mediated by glycosylation. The interaction of laminin with HSPGs through the heparin-binding sites located in the distal ends of both short and long arms of the α chain is important for both cell surface and basement membrane anchorage (38Skubitz A.P.N.

The facts that 1) both LBP30 and laminin bind heparin, 2) heparin inhibits the binding of LBP30 with laminin, and 3) the distribution of LBP30 and laminin partially overlaps raise an intriguing possibility that LBP30 may modulate the biological activities of laminin by binding cooperatively and/or competitively to the same HSPG in peripheral nerve. In addition, LBP30 may indirectly modulate the interaction of laminin-2 with the Schwann cell dystroglycan complex, because HSPGs are known to differentially affect the interaction of various isoforms of laminin with α-dystroglycan (46Pall E.A.
