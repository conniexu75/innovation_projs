SUMO-1-modified proteins display altered subcellular targeting and/or stability. We have purified the SUMO-1-activating enzyme from human cells and shown that it contains two subunits of 38 and 72 kDa. Isolation of cDNAs for each subunit indicates that they are homologous to ubiquitin-activating enzymes and to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes responsible for conjugation of Smt3p and Rub-1p. In vitro, recombinant SAE1/SAE2 (SUMO-1-activating enzyme) was capable of catalyzing the ATP-dependent formation of a thioester linkage between SUMO-1 and SAE2. The addition of the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubch9 resulted in efficient transfer of the thioester-linked SUMO-1 from SAE2 to Ubch9. In the presence of SAE1/SAE2, Ubch9, and ATP, SUMO-1 was efficiently conjugated to the protein substrate IκBα. As SAE1/SAE2, Ubch9, SUMO-1, and IκBα are all homogeneous, recombinant proteins, it appears that SUMO-1 conjugation of IκBα in vitrodoes not require the equivalent of an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity.

Although the best characterized example of such a modification is the addition of ubiquitin to proteins destined for proteolysis, it is now recognized that a number of other small protein molecules can be linked to target proteins in a similar fashion. Ubiquitin addition is accomplished via a thioester cascade with ubiquitin first being activated by a unique E11 enzyme that utilizes ATP to adenylate the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. Release of AMP accompanies the formation of a thioester bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue in the E1 protein. In a transesterification reaction, the ubiquitin is transferred from the ubiquitin-activating enzyme to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which may in turn transfer the ubiquitin to an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. In many cases it is this enzyme that recognizes the protein substrate and catalyzes formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of lysine in the target protein. Proteins destined for degradation via the proteasome are coupled to multiple copies of ubiquitin by formation of further isopeptide bonds between additional ubiquitin molecules and lysine residues in the bound ubiquitin (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). In some instances protein ubiquitination functions not as a signal for degradation but to alter the properties of the linked protein. Thus histone ubiquitination alters chromatin structure (2Bradbury E.M. Bioessay. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), whereas ubiquitination of a plasma membrane receptor modifies ligand-stimulated endocytosis (3Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Whereas addition of multiple copies of ubiquitin targets proteins for degradation, it is now widely recognized that covalent attachment of other ubiquitin-related molecules does not result in degradation of the modified protein. The protein UCRP, which contains two ubiquitin-like domains, is conjugated to a number of intracellular proteins by a series of reactions that are separate from ubiquitination (4Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently a small ubiquitin-like protein variously known as sentrin, GMP1, SUMO-1, UBL1, and PIC1 has been found covalently linked to Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) and associated with a variety of other proteins (6Kamitani T.

Covalent modification of RanGAP1 appears to be necessary for its interaction with the Ran-GTP-binding protein RanBP2 at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (8Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 11Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas SUMO-1 modification of PML targets the protein to PML nuclear bodies (12Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 13Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 modification of IκBα takes place on the same residues used for ubiquitination, thus rendering the protein resistant to signal-induced degradation and consequently blocking NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation (14Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 and Smt3p, a yeast homologue of SUMO-1, are conjugated to target proteins by a pathway that is distinct from, but analogous to, ubiquitin conjugation. A separate E1-like enzyme is responsible for SUMO-1 modification (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and in yeast, the enzyme responsible for Smt3p activation has been shown to consist of a heterodimer of Uba2p and Aos1p (16Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Also found in the complex between SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 and RanBP2 is a protein designated Ubc9, which is homologous to the E2 class of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (11Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In yeast, Ubc9 is essential for cell cycle progression (17Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and mammalian homologues have been isolated repeatedly from yeast two-hybrid screens in association with a wide variety of proteins. In both yeast and human cells, the product of the Ubc9 gene acts as the SUMO-1/Smt3p E2-conjugating activity (11Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently an additional protein modification pathway involving the ubiquitin-like protein Rub1p has been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 22Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A major substrate for Rub1p is CDC53/cullin, which is a common component of SCF (Skp1, CDC53, F-box) ubiquitin ligase complexes. In this system the products of the ULA1 and UBA3 genes act as a heterodimeric E1 enzyme, whereas the product of the UBC12 gene acts as the E2-conjugating enzyme. It also appears that this conjugation system is active in higher eukaryotes with the Rub1p homologue Nedd8 also being conjugated to CDC53 (23Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In all of the above cases, the protein conjugated has been similar to ubiquitin. However, a separate protein conjugation system, which is required for autophagy in S. cerevisiae, involves conjugation of a protein unrelated to ubiquitin. In this case, the C terminus of Apg12, a 186-residue protein, is conjugated to a lysine side chain in Apg5. Although Apg12 is unrelated to ubiquitin, it appears that it is activated by Apg7, which is homologous to ubiquitin E1 enzymes, and conjugated by Apg10, an E2 equivalent (24Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). To fully characterize the SUMO-1 modification reaction, we have purified the SUMO-1-activating enzyme and shown that it contains subunits of 38 and 72 kDa. cDNAs corresponding to these subunits (SUMO-1-activating enzyme (SAE)1 and SAE2) are homologous to enzymes involved in the activation of ubiquitin, Smt3p, and Rub1p. In the presence of recombinant SAE1/SAE2, Ubch9, and ATP, SUMO-1 was efficiently conjugated to the protein substrate IκBα. Thus it appears that SUMO-1 conjugation in vitro does not require the equivalent of an E3 protein ligase activity. The SV5 Pk tag 336 monoclonal antibody (25Hanke T. Szawlowski P. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was obtained from R. E. Randall, University of St. Andrews and was used to immunodetect and immunoprecipitate SAE1 containing an N-terminal SV5 epitope tag. Five mg of SUMOGG-1 (1–97 amino acids) purified as described (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were coupled to a 1-ml N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 40% of the added protein was coupled to the beads. After the affinity chromatography procedure, the column was regenerated by washing with 10 column volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 1 m KCl, 2 mmdithiotheitrol, followed by 10 column volumes of 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.2, buffer containing 0.02% NaN3. The affinity column was stored at 4 °C. HeLa cell extracts were prepared and fractionated on a Q-Sepharose column into Fr I and Fr II.1 to Fr II.5 as described previously (26Kroll M. Conconi M. Desterro M.J. Marin A. Thomas D. Friguet B. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Rodriguez M.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fr II.4 and Fr II.5 (eluted with 0.4 m and 0.5m of KCl) containing SUMO-1-activating enzyme activity (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm DTT, and affinity chromatography was carried out essentially as described for ubiquitin (27Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis, fractions were adjusted to 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 2.5 units/ml yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2 units/ml creatine kinase and applied at a flow rate of approximately 0.5 ml/min to the SUMOGG-1-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 3 column volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT (Buffer A). The column was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer A followed by 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl, and then 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. SUMO-1 E1 activity was eluted with 3 column volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm DTT, 2 mm AMP, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate (AMP eluate) and finally with 3 column volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, containing 10 mm DTT and 1m NaCl. Column eluates were 10-fold-concentrated using Centricon 30 microconcentrators that had been pretreated with bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific adsorption. The buffers were changed by 3 successive 10-fold dilutions in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT followed by 10-fold reconcentration using the same microconcentrator. The final volume of the column eluates was brought to 10% of the starting volume of loading fraction. Column operations were carried out at room temperature, but all fractions were collected on ice. The enzymatic activity present in each fraction was determined using a thioester assay as described below. The concentrated AMP eluate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE using freshly prepared acrylamide:piperazine diacrylamide solution (30:0.8) and with the addition of sodium thioglycolate to 0.1 mm in the upper electrophoresis buffer. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and proteins were stained with 0.1% Amido Black in 40% methanol, 1% acetic acid, for 30 s before bands were excised. Excised membrane bands were extensively washed in distilled water, and the peptide sequence was determined using a Procise microsequencer (Applied Biosystems) with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis. Samples to be digested in the gel were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described for N-terminal peptide sequencing. The gel was stained in 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 20% methanol, 0.5% acetic acid and then destained in 30% methanol until the bands were visible above a clear background. After excision, gel slices were washed for at least 1 h in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and 30 min at 60 °C in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, 3 mm DTT. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 6 mm, and after 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, gel slices were washed with 50% acetonitrile,100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 1 h with shaking. Acetronitrile was added to shrink gel pieces, and after 10–15 min of incubation, the solvent was removed, and the samples were dried in a rotatory evaporator. Gel slices were reswollen with 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing modified trypsin (Promega) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was acidified by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%, and peptides were extracted from gel slices twice with 60% acetonitrile,0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. All supernatants were combined, and after evaporation to near dryness, peptides fragments were reconstituted in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and separated by HPLC using a microbore HPLC system. The amino acid sequence of selected peptides was determined as described for N-terminal peptide sequencing. Three and 8 peptides were sequenced from the 38-kDa and 72-kDa species, respectively. Each peptide sequence was searched for mammalian homologues using BLAST similarity search program and EST public data base. ATCC clones were obtained for some of the peptides (AA236737 for 38 kDa and AA 373795 for 72 KDa). Tentative of Human Consensus (THC) 183945 for the 38-kDa and THC 167372 for the 72-kDa protein were obtained when the sequences were used for search in the data base of THC. Analysis of DNA sequencing data allowed us to set up upstream and downstream primers flanking the coding sequence. A cDNA encoding the complete open reading frame of SAE1 was obtained as a single fragment by reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) using Boehringer Titan™ one-tube RT-PCR system. The following primer containing an EcoRI restriction site was used as the downstream primer for reverse transcription (5′-GCGGGAATTCTCACTTGGGGCCAAGGCACTCCACAA-3′). The upstream primer used for PCR amplification (5′-AACGGATCCATGGTGGAGAAGGAGGAGGCTGGC-3′) contains a BamHI site at the 5′ end. PCR products were cloned as a BamHI/EcoRI insert in pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal Pk-SV5 tag that is recognized by the 336 monoclonal antibody (25Hanke T. Szawlowski P. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding the Pk-SV5 peptide (IPNPLLGLE) was inserted into pcDNA3 using KpnI and BamHI cloning sites and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CATGGGAAAGCCGATCCCAAACCCTTTGCTGGGATTGGACTCCACCG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGGTGGAGTCCAATCCCAGCAAAGGGTTTGGGATCGGCTTTCCCATGGTAC-3′. The cDNA of SAE2 was obtained from two different RT-PCR reactions and a final PCR. An intermediate upstream and downstream primer (5′-GATATCAAATCAATGGCAGGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCCCTGCCATTGATTTGATATC-3′) were used in each RT-PCR reaction to generate two different fragments that were later used in the final PCR reaction as template with the following primers: 5′-GAGGAATTCATGGCACTGTCGCGGGGGCTG-3′ and GAGGAATTCTCAATCTAATGCTATGACATC-3′, both containing anEcoRI restriction site. The final PCR fragment was inserted into the EcoRI restriction site of pcDNA3. The DNA sequence of all plasmids was determined by Alex Houston of the University of St. Andrews DNA sequencing facility (ABI377). In vitrotranscription/translation was performed using 1–2 μg of plasmid DNAs and a TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. [35S]Methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in the reactions to generate radiolabeled proteins. IκBα, Ubch9, and SUMOGG-1 were expressed and purified as described previously (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-SAE1 was expressed in Escherichia coli B834 and purified as described for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα (28Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS7 cells were maintained in exponential growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 1–2 μg of plasmid DNAs were transfected for 14 h in subconfluent 75-cm2 flasks using LipofectAMINE™ according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 36 h of expression, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and extracts were prepared by lysis in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate containing complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. 10 μl of each lysate was fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma). Protein expression was checked by Western blotting using the SV5 Pk tag monoclonal antibody with an ECL detection system and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary antibody. Extracts from COS 7-transfected cells or in vitro transcribed/translated SAE proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 336 anti-SV5 antibody either in lysis buffer or 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2 buffer containing 1 mm ATP and complete® protease inhibitor mixture, respectively. Antigen-antibody complexes were collected by adding 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h on a rotating shaker. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation, and after extensive washing with ice-cold 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 containing complete® protease inhibitor mixture, antigen-antibody complexes were used as the source of SUMO-1-activating enzyme in thioester or conjugation assays. GST or GST-SAE1 beads were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro transcribed/translated SAE2 for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing complete® protease inhibitor mixture and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Washing buffer was removed, and beads, after resuspension in 3× disruption buffer (5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72m β-mercaptoethanol) were fractionated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen to detect 35S radioactivity. In vitrotranscribed/translated SAE proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 336 anti-SV5 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 containing 1 mm ATP and complete® protease inhibitor mixture. Antigen-antibody complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed as described for GST pull-downs. Recombinant SUMOGG-1 was acetylated and radiolabeled with carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the chloramine T method as described (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To detect the activity of SUMO-1-activating enzyme, formation of thioester adducts between either immunoprecipitated or affinity-purified SAE and SUMOGG-1 was determined essentially as described (29Haas A.L. Warms J.V.B. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated protein A beads or 200 ng of affinity-purified SAE were incubated with 1 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 0.5 μg of125I-SUMOGG-1 in the presence or absence of 0.6 μg of recombinant Ubch9 in a final volume of 20 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated either by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 2% (w/v) SDS, 4% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm DTT (+DTT) or by incubating the samples at 30 °C for 20 min in the same buffer containing 4 m urea instead of DTT and mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%), and dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Fujix BAS1500, MacBAS software). SUMO-1 conjugation using recombinant proteins was accomplished in a 20-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine kinase, and 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase and 0.6 μg of human recombinant IκBα (or mutants), 0.5 μg of125I-SUMOGG-1, 0.6 μg of Ubch9, and either recombinant SAE-immunoprecipitated protein A beads (rSAE) or 90 ng of affinity-purified SAE. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and terminated by boiling in 3× disruption buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%), and dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging. The purification procedure for the SAE used an affinity procedure previously described (27Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for isolation of ubiquitin-activating enzymes based on covalent binding of the enzyme to ubiquitin-Sepharose beads in the presence of ATP. FrII.4 containing SUMO-1-activating activity from HeLa cells (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) was thus applied to SUMO-1-Sepharose beads in the presence of ATP and inorganic pyrophosphatase to suppress the reverse reaction. Under these conditions, SAE activates the immobilized SUMO-1, forming a thioester bond that retains the SAE on the column. The affinity column was washed sequentially with buffers containing ATP, 1 mKCl, Tris buffer alone, and AMP + pyrophosphate. Column eluates were assayed for their ability to form a thioester with125I-SUMO-1 (Fig. 1). SAE activity was detected in the column load and was substantially reduced in the column flow-through, indicating that the activity was bound to the column (Fig. 1 A). The bulk of the SAE activity was eluted with AMP and pyrophosphate, which reverses the activation reaction (Fig. 1 A). Eluates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Two polypeptide species with apparent molecular weights of 40,000 and 90,000 were detected in the AMP eluate in addition to bovine serum albumin, which was added to the fractions to prevent nonspecific adsorption to surfaces during concentration (Fig. 1 B). Proteins present in the AMP eluate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the location of bound species was detected by Amido Black staining. Both the 90-kDa and 40-kDa species were excised and subjected to direct N-terminal sequencing. Although the N terminus of the 90-kDa species appeared to be blocked, a unique sequence was obtained from the N terminus of the 40-kDa species. To obtain sequences from the 90-kDa species and additional sequences from the 40-kDa species, peptides generated by in-gel trypsin digestion were fractionated by microbore HPLC. Unambiguous sequence was obtained from 3 40-kDa- and 8 90-kDa-derived peptides (Fig. 2 A,underlined sequences). BLAST searching of the EST public data base allowed the identification of ATCC clones, which were used in combination with RT-PCR to construct full-length cDNAs for each species. The 40-kDa species was designated as SAE1 and has a predicted molecular mass of 38 kDa, whereas the 90-kDa species was designated as SAE2 and has a predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa (Fig.2 A). Amino acid sequence alignments of different E1s demonstrate that SAE is similar to Smt3p (Aos1p/Uba2p) and Rub1p (Ula1p/Uba3p)-activating enzymes (16Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 22Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although SAE1 displays significant similarities to the N terminus of human and S. cerevisiae Uba1, the SAE2 protein contains the putative active-Cys (Cys-173) and is homologous to the C terminus of Uba1. The apparent molecular mass of the125I-SUMO-SAE thioester conjugate of 100 kDa (Fig.2 A) confirms the presence of the active-site cysteine in SAE2. Most of the sequence similarity (Fig. 2 B) is concentrated in a limited number of previously identified domains (16Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar,22Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). cDNA corresponding to SAE1 and SAE2 obtained by RT-PCR was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector permitting proteins to be produced and 35S-labeled by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (Fig.3 A). SAE1 was fused at the N terminus to an epitope from simian virus 5 that is recognized by the previously characterized SV5 Pk Tag (336) monoclonal antibody (25Hanke T. Szawlowski P. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although SAE1 and SAE2 copurified in equimolar amounts (Fig.1 B) during SUMO-1 affinity chromatography, it was not clear that they were associated. To obtain direct evidence for such an interaction, different mixtures of 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed-translated proteins were immunoprecipitated with a specific (336) and a nonspecific (214) monoclonal antibody. In the presence of SV5-tagged SAE1, SAE2 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-SV5 antibody (336). Labeled SAE2 protein was not immunoprecipitated with either the control antibody (214) or when SAE2 was in vitro transcribed-translated in the absence of SAE1 (Fig. 3 C). Confirmation of the interaction between SAE1 and SAE2 was obtained when glutathione S-transferase SAE1 beads were used to pull down 35S-labeled in vitrotranscribed-translated SAE2. (Fig. 3 B). To demonstrate that SAE1 and SAE2 are required for SUMO-1 activationin vitro, its ability to form a stable adduct with radioactively labeled SUMO-1 in an ATP-dependent reaction was tested. SAE proteins were either in vitrotranscribed-translated or expressed in transfected COS7 cells. In both situations, the activity was immunoprecipitated using anti-SV5 protein A beads. The ability of recombinant SAE to form a thioester with125I-SUMO-1 in presence of MgATP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. This immunoprecipitated activity was capable of catalyzing formation of a Ubch9-125I-SUMO-1 thioester when recombinant Ubch9 was added to the reaction (Fig.4, A and B). The linkages formed between SAE2 and 125I-SUMO-1 or Ubch9 and125I-SUMO-1 were labile to reducing agents such as DTT (Fig. 4 A), indicating that they are likely to be thioester bonds. Neither SAE1 nor SAE2 alone were capable of forming a thioester complex with SUMO-1. Some activity is detected when SAE1 is immunoprecipitated from COS7 SAE1-transfected extracts, probably because of endogenous SAE2 activity (Fig. 4 B). These results together suggest that the SUMO-1-activating enzyme is composed of SAE1/SAE2. To demonstrate that the cloned SAE is functional in an Ubch9/ATP-dependent SUMO-1 conjugation reaction, its ability to mediate SUMO-1 conjugation to recombinant IκBα was investigated. Although SUMO-1 conjugation of IκBα is dependent on Ubch9, ATP, and FrII.4 (14Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), a complete description of the biochemical activities present in the HeLa cell fraction or in the in vitro transcribed-translated substrate was lacking. The SAE was affinity-purified from FrII.4, but by analogy with ubiquitin modification, it is not clear if other activities such as an E3 equivalent would be required. In the presence of recombinant, immunoprecipitated SAE, Ubch9, and ATP,125I-SUMO-1 was efficiently conjugated to recombinant IκBα (Fig.5 A). This reaction was dependent on SAE, Ubch9, ATP, and IκBα substrate (Fig.5 B). The enzymatic properties of rSAE were identical to those of the protein isolated from HeLa FrII.4. rSAE formed a thioester adduct with 125I-SUMO-1 (Fig. 4) and produced similar IκBα SUMO-1 conjugates under identical reactions conditions (Fig.5). Because SUMO-1, Ubch9, and IκBα are all homogeneous recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria and the SAE is either highly purified (Fig. 5 B) or recombinant anti-SV5-immunoprecipitated (Fig.5 A), it appears that SUMO-1 conjugation of IκBα in vitro does not require an equivalent E3 activity and that after SUMO-1 activation by SAE, the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubch9 is capable of recognizing, then transferring, SUMO-1 onto IκBα. To demonstrate specificity in vitro, two deleted forms of IκBα and GST were used as substrates in reactions also containing purified SAE, Ubch9, 125I-SUMO-1, and ATP. SUMO-1 is efficiently conjugated to IκBα and IκBαΔC (lacks the C-terminal 61 amino acids) but is not conjugated to either ΔN IκBα (lacks the N-terminal 70 amino acids) or GST (Fig.5 C). That the lysine involved in SUMO-1 modification is present in wild type IκBα and IκBαΔC but absent in ΔN IκBα indicates that the purified conjugation system is displaying the expected specificity. Targeting of proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is an irrevocable decision, and as such, the process needs to be highly specific and tightly regulated. This specificity appears to be accomplished by a combination of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. In many cases, the E3 appears to consist of a multiprotein complex that recognizes the substrate and brings it in to intimate contact with the E2, which catalyzes the addition of ubiquitin to the substrate. Because the E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme is unique, it does not appear to play a role in selecting protein substrates for ubiquitination. However, ubiquitin co-exists with a number of ubiquitin-like molecules, and the E1 enzymes must distinguish between these molecules. Because distinct E1 activities have been described for ubiquitin (31Handley P.M. Mueckler M. Siegel N.R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Smt3p (16Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and Rub1p (21Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 22Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we undertook the isolation and characterization of the SAE. By taking advantage of the mechanism of ubiquitin-activating and -conjugating enzymes, which involves formation of a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin, we have used SUMO-1 affinity chromatography to isolate a novel enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of SUMO-1, the first step in the conjugation pathway. Furthermore this enzyme could also transfer activated SUMO-1 to Ubch9, the conjugating enzyme involved in this process (11Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T.

A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Although the E1 activity for ubiquitin is contained within a single large polypeptide, the E1 activity of SUMO-1, like that of Smt3p and Rub1p, is partitioned between two smaller polypeptides, SAE1 and SAE2. Sequence comparisons between the E1 enzymes indicates that SAE1 is homologous to Aos1p, Ula1p, and the N terminus of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (Fig. 2), whereas SAE2 is homologous to Uba2p, Uba3p, and the C terminus of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes. The association between SAE1 and SAE2, confirmed by immunoprecipitations and GST pull-downs (Fig. 3), brings together conserved domains present in each subunit. Because purified SAE contains equimolar amounts of SAE1 and SAE2 and the two proteins associate in vitro, it is probable that, like the Smt3p E1, the activating enzyme is a heterodimer. Each SAE subunit contains a conserved nucleotide binding motif, GXGXXG (positions 24–29 in SAE2 and positions 43–48 in SAE1, domainI, Fig. 2 B). The putative cysteine (Cys-173), which forms a thioester bond with the C-terminal glycine of SUMO-1, is in an active-site consensus sequence (KXXPZCTXXXXP) found in conserved domain III. Conserved domain II is present in SAE1, whereas conserved domain IV is found in SAE2. The function of conserved domains II and IV has yet to be determined. The C-terminal extension of SAE2 contains a region that matches with two consensus sequences for nuclear localization signals (RKRK, 610–613, and RKRKLDEKENLSAKRSR, 610–626), which are also present in the C-terminal region of Uba2p (32Dohmen R.J.

To further investigate the enzymatic properties of the SUMO-1-activating enzyme, recombinant SAE protein was tested for the ability to activate SUMO-1 in a purified in vitro SUMO-1 conjugation system together with an ATP regenerating system, Ubch9, and a recombinant IκBα substrate. Under the conditions employed in this assay, SUMO-1 was efficiently conjugated to IκBα, indicating that conjugation does not require the presence of an E3-like protein ligase activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that in vivo, such proteins may increase the efficiency of the conjugation process. Because our initial yeast two-hybrid screen demonstrated a protein-protein interaction between Ubch9 and IκBα (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), it is likely that substrate specificity is achieved by Ubch9. A diverse range of proteins have been shown to interact with Ubc9 in yeast two-hybrid experiments, and this may be a direct consequence of substrate recognition by Ubc9. Again it is not possible to rule out the participation of yeast proteins in these interactions. Within the cell it appears that virtually all of the SUMO-1 is present in protein conjugates, and there is a very low concentration of free SUMO-1(7). Thus it is likely that the availability of free SUMO-1 is tightly controlled by a dynamic equilibrium between SAE/Ubc9-mediated conjugation of SUMO-1 and deconjugation mediated by the highly active but as yet uncharacterized SUMO-1-deconjugating and processing enzymes. However the cellular signals that regulate this process have yet to be defined. The large number of ubiquitin-specific proteases and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH) already identified (33Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) suggest that they may be involved in the recognition of different types of ubiquitin conjugates, but little is known about their biological roles. It is likely that some of the known ubiquitin-specific proteases and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases will be responsible for processing of ubiquitin-like proteins. UCH-L3, a putative ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, was recently identify as a NEDD8 (23Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar)-interacting protein, able to cleave the C terminus of NEDD8 but not bind to sentrin-1, sentrin-2, or sentrin-3 (34Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The availability of the genes for the SUMO-1-activating and -conjugating enzymes, SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9, will facilitate further biochemical and cell biological studies aimed at defining the role of these proteins in vivo. We would like to thank Ellis Jaffray for large scale growth of HeLa cells, Paul Talbot for protein sequencing, and Alex Houston for DNA sequencing."

(1998) Diabetes 47, 1562–1569). In this study we further characterize the cellular mechanisms responsible for this observation. Two-hour exposure to ∼25 μm H2O2 (generated by adding glucose oxidase to the medium) resulted in disruption of the normal insulin stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase cellular redistribution between the cytosol and an internal membrane pool (low density microsomal fraction (LDM)). This was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and p85-associated PI 3-kinase activities in the LDM (84 and 96% inhibition, respectively). The effect of this finding on the downstream insulin signal was demonstrated by a 90% reduction in insulin stimulated protein kinase B (PKB) serine 473 phosphorylation and impaired activation of PKBα and PKBγ. Both control and oxidized cells exposed to heat shock displayed a wortmannin insensitive PKB serine phosphorylation and activity. These data suggest that activation of PKB and GLUT4 translocation are insulin signaling events dependent upon a normal insulin induced cellular compartmentalization of PI 3-kinase and IRS-1, which is oxidative stress-sensitive. These findings represent a novel cellular mechanism for the induction of insulin resistance in response to changes in the extracellular environment. In a recent study we have demonstrated that 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to low micromolar H2O2 concentrations display impaired insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation from internal membrane pools to the plasma membrane (Rudich, A., Tirosh, A., Potashnik, R., Hemi, R., Kannety, H., and Bashan, N.

Exposure of tissues to free radicals in a variety of experimental systems leads to apoptosis and to cell damage (2Papa S. Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, reactive oxygen species have been demonstrated to participate in normal cellular responses including in signal transduction pathways and in gene regulation (1Palmer H.J. Paulson K.E. Nutr. Rev. 1997; 55: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol.

H2O2, for example, has been shown to be produced intracellularly following stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor and to mediate the normal response to this growth factor (5Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Similarly, insulin was reported to activate an adipocyte membrane bound NADPH oxidase (6Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin.

J. 1995; 307: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), further supporting a potential role for reactive oxygen species as second messengers. In agreement with this concept, direct exposure of cells to H2O2 has been demonstrated to result in insulinomimetic effects, as demonstrated both by mimicking the metabolic response to insulin as well as by activating components of its signal transduction machinery (8Czech M.P.

However, prolonged exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 resulted in impaired insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, activation of glycogen synthase, glucose transport, and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (PM)1 (12Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bahan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kannety H. Bashan N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation has been suggested to depend upon the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which in fat cells occurs in various cellular fractions (14Kelly K.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the concept that the activation of PI 3-kinase in the low density microsomal fraction (LDM) or in GLUT4 containing vesicles is necessary for the specific ability of insulin to promote GLUT4 translocation has been suggested (16Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand Brustel Y. Eur. J.

In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active p110 (the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase), which resulted in increased total and LDM PI 3-kinase activity in primary adipocytes or in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, dramatically stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation (18Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Grillo S. Calleja V. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand Brustel Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In a recent study we observed that impaired insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation following oxidation could not be attributed to defects in activation of PI 3-kinase as detected in total cell lysate (13Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kannety H. Bashan N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, impaired compartment-specific activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin may represent a putative cellular mechanism for oxidation induced insulin resistance. The events leading to the specific activation of PI 3-kinase in the LDM are not clear. Recently, insulin-induced redistribution of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) was suggested to play a role in the compartment-specific activation of PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (21Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation was found to induce a reduction in the amount of IRS1/2 in the LDM, while IRS tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated. The tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS in the LDM was suggested to serve as a docking molecule for PI 3-kinase, leading to a rapid translocation of the p85 subunit from the cytosol to the LDM, resulting in increased PI 3-kinase activity in this fraction (21Inoue G.

Although the insulin signaling steps toward GLUT4 translocation distal to PI 3-kinase activation are currently not fully understood, a number of downstream targets for PI 3-kinase have been identified (23Hajduch E.

PI 3-kinase is both necessary and sufficient for insulin-dependent phosphorylation and activation of PKB, although the exact mode of activation has not been fully elucidated (reviewed in Ref. 29Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). It was suggested that binding of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB and its translocation to the membranes are necessary for PKB phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 by its upstream kinases PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. In the search for its relevant biological activity, PKB was found to mediate some of insulin's effects, such as the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (30van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries Smits A.M. van Lint J.

Several lines of evidence strongly support a crucial role for PKB in mediating GLUT4 translocation. In agreement with this notion, insulin activation of PKB precedes the hormonal effect on glucose transport (33Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The respective role of the different isoforms of PKB in mediating insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in various cell types is as yet unclear. Although the involvement of IRS, PI 3-kinase, and PKB cellular redistribution and activation in the normal response to insulin is increasingly recognized, their relevance for the understanding of the cellular mechanisms leading to insulin resistance is largely unclear. In this study we report that impaired insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation induced by oxidative stress is associated with disruption of insulin-induced IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase intracellular trafficking and with inhibition of PKBα and PKBγ activation. This represents a novel cellular mechanism for the understanding of insulin resistance in response to a change in the extracellular environment. Tissue culture medium, serum, and antibiotic solutions were obtained from Biological Industries (Beit-Haeemek, Israel). Recombinant human insulin was from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Anti-GLUT4 antibodies were from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA).

Protein G-Sepharose and protein A-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). 2-Deoxy-[3H]glucose was purchased from Nuclear Research Center-Negev (Dimona, Israel). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, as described previously (12Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bahan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h following confluence cells were induced to differentiate to adipocytes by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml recombinant human insulin, 0.5 mm3-isobutylmethylxanthine and 0.25 μm dexamethasone for 48–72 h. Cells were used 9–10 days following differentiation induction when exhibiting >90% adipocyte phenotype. H2O2 was generated by adding 100 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase (type II from Aspergillus niger, 20,000 units/g solid in non-oxygen-saturated conditions, Sigma) to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin. The addition of 100 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase resulted in medium H2O2 concentration that achieved a steady state of 27.4 ± 0.3 μm after 15 min. Following a 2-h incubation, medium glucose concentrations determined with hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (38Slein M.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, New York1965: 117-123Crossref Google Scholar) were 18.2 ± 2.1 and 17.4 ± 1.3 mm for control and glucose oxidase-treated cells, respectively. Following treatment with or without glucose oxidase, cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 7 or 20 min with or without 100 nm insulin in freshly prepared medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade). Membrane preparations (4 × 10-cm plates per condition) were performed following the procedure described by Clancy and Czech (39Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the PM marker 5′-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) was determined as described previously (39Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity (nmol/min/mg protein) of PM 5′-nucleotidase for control and glucose oxidase-treated cells was 28.1 ± 3.3 and 27.9 ± 1.9, respectively, which reflected purification of more then 10-foldversus homogenate. Protein recovery of the different membrane fractions was not altered by glucose oxidase treatment. The various cellular compartments were resuspended in the original fractionation buffer (255 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotonin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A), with no addition of detergent, as described (13Rudich A.

Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 min with 0.5 mg/ml poly-d-lysine followed by three washes with hypotonic buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). The cells were then covered with sonication buffer (3 × hypotonic buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated with a probe membrane disrupter. Following sonication, the plasma membrane sheets were washed three times with sonication buffer and were used for immunoblotting as described below. Cells (1 × 10-cm plate per condition) were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated in the absence or presence of insulin for 7 min. Cells were then scraped into 0.6 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmaprotonin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A). Lysates were gently shaken for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C), supernatant collected, and protein content determined (BCA method, Pierce). Laemmli buffer was added and samples boiled for 10 min. Protein samples were resolved on 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blot, followed by quantitation using video densitometry analysis, as described (12Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bahan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in ice-cold deoxycholate based buffer, as described above. For immunoprecipitation, either 0.5 mg protein of cell lysate and cytosols or 75 μg of protein of LDM were used and assayed as described (13Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kannety H. Bashan N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase assay was performed following the protocol described by Hadari et al. (10Hadari Y.R. Tzahar E. Nadiv O. Rothenberg P. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Yarden Y. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17483-17486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using phosphatidylinositol and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. The phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols were separated using thin layer chromatography and quantified by video densitometry. Cell lysates were prepared as described above using PKB lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM aprotonin, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin A). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford procedure (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the different PKB antibodies and were assayed for kinase activity using Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as a substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (31Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed as described previously (12Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bahan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed for 10 min using 50 μM 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (1 μCi/ml). Nonspecific uptake (less than 10% of the total) was determined in the presence of cytochalasin B (50 μM) and was subtracted from the total uptake. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Each treatment was compared with control, and statistical significance between two groups was evaluated using the Student'st test. The criterion for significance was set atp < 0.01. In order to study the effect of oxidative stress on the ability of insulin to activate PI 3-kinase in various cellular fractions, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed for 2 h to 27.4 ± 0.8 μmH2O2 continuously generated by addition of 100 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase to the culture medium. In agreement with recent reports (16Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), insulin induced a 2.8-fold increase in p85 content in the LDM (Fig. 1 A), which was associated with a 50% reduction in its abundance in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1 C). PI 3-kinase activity measured in p85 immunoprecipitates revealed an approximately 7-fold increase by insulin in the LDM and a 50% reduction in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.1, B and D, respectively). These results indicate that insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase in the LDM can be attributed to both translocation of this enzyme from the cytosol, as well as to its activation in the LDM fraction. Oxidative stress induced a 3-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity in the LDM in the absence of insulin, which was not associated with increased LDM p85 content (Fig.1, B and A). This may suggest that oxidative stress increased LDM PI 3-kinase activity primarily by inducing activation rather than translocation of this enzyme in the LDM. Yet, oxidative stress resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of insulin to increase p85 content in the LDM (Fig. 1 A) or to reduce its cytosolic content (Fig. 1 C). This was associated with inhibition of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation in the LDM (Fig. 1 B), as well as in impaired insulin induced reduction in its cytosolic activity (Fig. 1 D). In total cell lysates, both p85 content as well as the activation of p85-associated PI 3-kinase activity by insulin were not affected following oxidation (Fig. 1, E and F, respectively). Taken together these data suggest that both the insulin-stimulated translocation of PI 3-kinase to the LDM and its activation in this fraction are impaired following oxidative stress and are associated with retention of this enzyme in its cytosolic pool. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes most of PI 3-kinase activation by insulin occurs via its interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (21Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether altered IRS-1 cellular compartmentalization may account for the impaired PI 3-kinase activation in the LDM, IRS-1 content and interaction with PI 3-kinase were evaluated in the LDM and cytosolic fractions. In control cells, an approximately 50% reduction in IRS-1 LDM content following 7-min insulin stimulation was observed (Fig.2 A). In oxidized cells, IRS-1 content in the LDM was significantly reduced by approximately 35%, with no further reduction following insulin stimulation. In control cells, insulin induced an inhibition in IRS-1 gel mobility (Fig.2 A), which could be attributed to increased serine/threonine phosphorylation, since incubation of LDM with alkaline phosphatase diminished this change in gel mobility (data not shown). In addition, despite the reduction in LDM IRS-1 content (Fig. 2 A), insulin induced a marked elevation in IRS tyrosine phosphorylation in this fraction (Fig. 2 B). In LDM prepared from oxidized cells, insulin stimulation failed to induce the change in IRS gel mobility (Fig. 2 A), suggesting inhibition of its insulin stimulated serine/threonine phosphorylation. Moreover, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was significantly impaired following oxidation (Fig. 2 B). In accordance with this finding, the 16-fold increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity observed in the LDM of control cells was markedly impaired by oxidative stress (Fig. 2 C). In the cytosolic fraction, insulin stimulation of either control or oxidized cells did not result in changes in IRS-1 gel mobility, as in the LDM fraction (Fig. 2 D). Yet, both the increase in cytosolic IRS-1 content induced by insulin (Fig. 2D), as well as the stimulation of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in this fraction (Fig. 2E), were significantly impaired by oxidative stress. Taken together these results suggest that oxidation disrupted IRS-1 cellular redistribution and tyrosine phosphorylation in the LDM. This in turn resulted in the reduced ability of IRS-1 to serve as a LDM docking protein for PI 3-kinase. To assess whether the defect in PI 3-kinase redistribution is associated with impairment in the activation of PKB by insulin, PKB phosphorylation and activation were evaluated following oxidative stress. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates using anti-phospho-Ser473 PKB antibody demonstrated that oxidative stress induced a 3.47 ± 0.85-fold increase in PKB phosphorylation, which was wortmannin-sensitive (Fig.3 A). Exposure to insulin led to a rapid, time-dependent stimulation of PKB phosphorylation reaching maximal stimulation by 10 min in control cells, while in oxidized cells PKB phosphorylation was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3 B). To correlate changes in PKB phosphorylation with its activity, total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti PKB antibodies raised against its C-terminal tail. The efficiency of the immunoprecipitation protocol was not affected by oxidation, as assessed by immuno- blotting the supernatant above the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). Fig.3 C demonstrates a 12.2 ± 2.3-fold increase in PKB activity following 7-min exposure to insulin. In accordance with the serine phosphorylation pattern, oxidative stress induced a 3.6 ± 1.7-fold increase in PKB activity, while the net insulin effect on PKB activity was markedly reduced from 24.10 ± 2.7 to 4.65 ± 0.9 milliunits/mg of protein/min (p < 0.001). Both basal activation of PKB induced by oxidative stress, as well as its stimulation by insulin, were completely inhibited by wortmannin, indicating the involvement of PI 3-kinase in both processes. To further characterize the effect of oxidative stress on basal and insulin stimulated PKB activity, the various isoforms of PKB were studied using isoform specific antibodies. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, all known PKB isoforms were found to be"

We recently reported that the overexpression of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, together with its activator TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) stimulates NF-κB activation. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. Dominant negative mutants of IκB kinase (IKK) α and IKKβ inhibited TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. TAK1 activated IKKα and IKKβ in the presence of TAB1. IKKα and IKKβ were coimmunoprecipitated with TAK1 in the absence of TAB1. TAB1-induced TAK1 activation promoted the dissociation of active forms of IKKα and IKKβ from active TAK1, whereas the IKK mutants remained to interact with active TAK1. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-α activated endogenous TAK1, and the kinase-negative TAK1 acted as a dominant negative inhibitor against tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activation. These results demonstrated a novel signaling pathway to NF-κB activation through TAK1 in which TAK1 may act as a regulatory kinase of IKKs.

Diverse extracellular stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-1β, phorbol esters, and environmental stresses lead to NF-κB activation utilizing the common mechanism for the IκB degradation, suggesting the diversity of the upstream signaling pathways for phosphorylation of IκB proteins. Several regulatory kinases involved in the signal-induced phosphorylation of IκB proteins have recently been reported. Two closely related kinases designated IκB kinase (IKK) α and IKKβ have been identified as components of the multiprotein IKK complex (500–900 kDa) that directly phosphorylates the critical Ser residues of IκB proteins (16DiDonato J.A.

Together, IKKα and IKKβ form a heterodimer through their C-terminal leucine zipper motifs, and the functional IKK complex contains both IKK subunits. NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family, which was first identified as a TNF-α receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2-interacting protein (21Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The ligand-mediated trimerization of the TNF-α receptor triggers the recruitment of NIK to TRAF2, and this association results in the activation of NIK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates IKKs. NIK also interacts with TRAF6, another member of the TRAF family, which is required for interleukin-1β-induced NF-κB activation (22Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V.

In addition, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), another member of the MAPKKK family, stimulates NF-κB activation by preferentially activating IKKβ over IKKα (23Nakano H.

These findings suggest that several MAPKKKs play a key role in the NF-κB activation pathway by regulating the kinase activity of the IKK complex. However, little is known about the regulatory molecular mechanisms of the kinase activity of the IKK complex induced by diverse extracellular stimuli. Transforming growth factor (TGF) β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) was first identified as a MAPKKK that can be activated by TGF-β and bone morphological protein (26Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). TAK1 activity is regulated by its activator, TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) (27Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). TAK1 is suggested to act as a MAPKKK in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and the p38 MAPK cascades, in which TAK1 phosphorylates MAPK kinase (MKK) 4, MKK3, and MKK6 (28Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 induces the activation of the JNK pathway mediated by TAK1 but not MEKK1 and mixed lineage kinase 3 (30Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.T. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the biological role of TAK1 in the intracellular signaling pathways is poorly understood. We recently reported that the overexpression of TAK1 together with TAB1 stimulates NF-κB activation (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. We found functional interactions of TAK1 with IKKα and IKKβ. In the activation of TAK1-induced IKKs, two Ser residues in the activation loop of the IKKs were critically involved. In our previous study, three isoforms of human TAK1 cDNA were isolated (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TAK1a is the most abundantly expressed in HeLa cells and was used in the present study. Full-length TAK1 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI-XbaI site in pFLAG-CMV2 mammalian expression vector (Kodak) and expressed as a Flag epitope-tagged protein. The expression vectors for TAB1 and NIK624-947 were described previously (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ cDNAs were obtained from human monocytic THP-1 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The primers used were as follows: 5′-GGCCGCTTGAATTCCCGCCCCATGGA-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGAAGATATCCCATACG-3′ for the N terminus of IKKα, 5′-GACGTATGGGATATCTTCAGAAA-3′ and 5′-CGAGTCTAGAGTCATTCTGTTAACCAACTCC-3′ for the C terminus of IKKα, 5′-TGACGGTACCAATGAGCTGGTCACCTTCCCTG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGCCATGGAATTCTTCATTTTGG-3′ for the N terminus of IKKβ, and 5′-CCAAAATGAAGAATTCCATGGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TGACTCTAGATCATGAGGCCTGCTCCAGGC-3′ for the C terminus of IKKβ. Full-length IKKα and IKKβ cDNAs were subcloned into theEcoRI-NotI and KpnI-NotI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) and pcDNA3.1(+) HisB (Invitrogen), respectively. Expression vectors encoding the dominant negative mutants (TAK1 (K63W), IKKα (SS176, 180AA), IKKα (K44M), IKKβ (SS177, 181AA), and IKKβ (K44M)) were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. HeLa cells were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and gel shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts as described previously (32Sakurai H. Kurusu R. Sano K. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed by using pNFκB-Luc plasmid (Stratagene). pRSV-β-gal plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Tsuda (Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University). Twenty-four h after transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were diluted with 3 volumes of dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, lysates were incubated with a M5 anti-Flag antibody (Kodak) on ice for 1.5 h and rotated with protein G-conjugated Sepharose (Pharmacia) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The beads were washed five times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 50 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100), and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were anti-Xpress (Omni probe; M-21), anti-TAK1 (M-17), and anti-TAB1 (N-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody, the anti-Xpress antibody, or an anti-IKKα antibody (H-744; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by the procedure described above. After washes, the beads were incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm disodiump-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 30 min. For the IKK kinase assay, 2.5 μg of bacterially expressed GST-IκBα (1–54) or GST-IκBα (1–54) (SS32, 36AA) were added as a substrate. An expression vector for GST-IκBα (1–54) was generated by inserting human IκBα cDNA encoding amino acids 1–54 into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). An expression vector for GST-IκBα (1–54) (SS32, 36AA) was constructed by using the mutagenesis kit mentioned above. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The JNK activity was determined by anin vitro immunocomplex kinase assay. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-JNK1 (FL) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a kinase assay was performed with GST-c-Jun (1–79) as a substrate using the procedure described above. The GST-c-Jun expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Hibi (Osaka University). p38 MAPK activation was monitored by its phosphorylation status at both the Thr180 and Tyr182 residues by the immunoblotting of cell lysates with an anti-phospho p38 antibody (New England Biolabs). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody. After washes, the beads were incubated with 2 units/μl calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Takara) at 37 °C for 30 min. Where indicated, sodium orthovanadate (1 μm) was added in the reaction mixture. We previously demonstrated the ability of TAK1 to activate p50/p65 NF-κB in a TAB1-dependent manner (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanism of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation, N-terminal Flag epitope-tagged wild-type TAK1 or a kinase inactive mutant (TAK1K63W) was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. A gel shift assay showed that wild-type TAK1 together with TAB1 induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, whereas TAK1K63W could not induce the translocation even when TAB1 was coexpressed (Fig.1 A). In contrast, the Oct-1 DNA binding activity was not affected by the overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 (Fig. 1 A). In addition, two major inhibitory proteins, IκBα and IκBβ, were degraded in cells expressing both wild-type TAK1 and TAB1 (Fig. 1 B). The degradation of IκBα was blocked by a proteasome inhibitor,N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (data not shown), indicating that TAK1 may activate NF-κB through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. TAB1 was first identified as a TAK1 activator in a yeast two-hybrid system (27Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Here, we characterized the molecular mechanism of the TAK1 activation by TAB1 in mammalian cells. Flag-TAK1 and Flag-TAK1K63W were expressed with or without TAB1 in HeLa cells, and anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the coprecipitation of TAB1 by immunoblotting. TAB1 was coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type and kinase inactive TAK1 (Fig.2 A). TAB1 migrated slowly on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel when coexpressed with TAK1, but not with TAK1K63W (Fig. 2 A). Wild-type TAK1, but not TAK1K63W, also migrated slowly when coexpressed with TAB1 (Fig. 2 A). In addition, TAK1 appeared to be stabilized as a consequence of the association with TAB1 (Fig. 2 A). The reduced mobility of coexpressed TAK1 and TAB1 may reflect the phosphorylation of both proteins induced by their functional interaction, as has been described for several protein kinases including interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (33Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, an in vitrokinase assay was conducted using the anti-Flag immunoprecipitates. The phosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1 was detected only when wild-type TAK1 and TAB1 were coexpressed (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, treatment of the immunoprecipitated TAK1/TAB1 complex with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase converted the slower-migrating forms to the faster-migrating forms (Fig. 2 C). A phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, blocked this mobility shift of TAK1. The mobility of TAB1 was partially reduced by the inhibitor, suggesting multiple phosphorylation sites in TAB1. These results suggest that the association of TAB1 with TAK1 causes the activation of TAK1, during which TAK1 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of TAB1 by TAK1 may be occurring. The marked degradation of IκB proteins by TAK1 raises the possibility of the involvement of the IKK complex in TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. To investigate this possibility, the effects of dominant negative mutants of the IKKs were examined. The TAK1-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was inhibited by the kinase inactive mutants IKKα (K44M) and IKKβ (K44M) (Fig.3 A). In contrast, TAK1-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation was not inhibited by these IKK mutants (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that TAK1-induced NF-κB activation is mediated by the IKK complex, but not through the MAPK signaling cascades. The TAK1-induced regulation of IKK kinase activity was investigated. First, the endogenous IKK kinase activity was determined by an in vitro anti-IKKα immunocomplex kinase assay using bacterially expressed GST-IκBα (1–54) as a substrate. The kinase activity was significantly increased when wild-type TAK1 and TAB1 were coexpressed, whereas TAK1K63W did not enhance the IKK activity (Fig.4). The specificity of the IKK activity was confirmed by using a mutant substrate, GST-IκBα (1–54) (SS32 and 36AA), in which the critical Ser residues for IKKs were replaced with Ala (Fig. 4). The anti-IKKα antibody was able to recognize IKKβ as well as IKKα, suggesting that both IKK subunits contribute to the IKK activity. Similar results were obtained by an immunocomplex kinase assay using an anti-MAPK phosphatase-1 antibody (data not shown), which has been shown to precipitate the multisubunit IKK complex (17Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the contribution of the two IKK subunits, N-terminal Xpress epitope-tagged IKKα and IKKβ were overexpressed with TAK1 and TAB1, and the kinase activities of the IKKs were measured by an anti-Xpress immunocomplex kinase assay. TAK1, but not TAK1K63W, induced the kinase activity of IKKα when coexpressed with TAB1 (Fig.5 A). Similarly, IKKβ activity was enhanced by TAK1 plus TAB1, whereas IKKβ alone showed constitutive activity (Fig. 5 B). In addition, TAK1K63W slightly inhibited the constitutive IKKβ activity (Fig.5 B). These results indicate that TAK1 acts as an activator for IKKα and IKKβ in the signaling pathway of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. NIK has been shown to directly associate with both IKKs and enhance their kinase activities (19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 20Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Because TAK1 is also a member of the MAPKKK family, we investigated the interaction of TAK1 with IKKs. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors for Flag-TAK1 or Flag-TAK1K63W with Xpress-IKKα and Xpress-IKKβ. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of IKKs by immunoblotting with the anti-Xpress antibody. The interaction of wild-type TAK1 with IKKα was detected in the absence of TAB1 (Fig.6 A). However, the interaction was not detected when TAK1 was activated by TAB1 (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, the interaction of TAK1 with IKKβ was detected only in the absence of TAB1 (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, interactions of NIK with both IKKα and IKKβ were detected through their active forms (data not shown). TAK1K63W interacted weakly with IKKα and IKKβ (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas this molecule had the potential to interact with TAB1 (Fig. 2 A). The immunoblotting of cell lysates with the anti-Xpress antibody showed that IKKα and IKKβ migrated slowly on SDS-PAGE when cotransfected with both TAK1 and TAB1 (Fig. 6). These results indicate that TAK1 interacts with both IKK subunits to induce their kinase activities. Most of the interactions between activated protein kinases and phosphorylated substrates have been shown to be transient. However, a stable interaction could be detected when the kinase defective mutant or the mutated substrate that lacks the target residues for phosphorylation was used. To examine the features of TAK1-IKKs interactions, Xpress-tagged IKK mutants (KM and SSAA) were coexpressed with Flag-TAK1 in HeLa cells. The coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that interactions between TAK1 and all IKK mutants were detectable in both the absence and presence of coexpressed TAB1 (Fig.7 A). These results indicate that the kinase activities of IKKs are necessary for the dissociation of TAK1 from IKKs, in which TAK1 may phosphorylate the Ser residues in the activation loop of the IKKs. In addition, the immunoblotting of cell lysates with the anti-Xpress antibody showed that all IKK mutants did not migrate slowly on SDS-PAGE even when in the presence of active TAK1, suggesting that the reduced mobility of wild-type IKKs reflects autophosphorylation. Furthermore, IKKα-SSAA and IKKβ-SSAA acted as dominant negative inhibitors in TAK1-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.7 B). These results indicate that the activation loop is critically involved in TAK1-induced IKKs activation. Interestingly, TAK1 and TAB1 appeared to be selectively depleted in cells cotransfected with IKKβ, whereas the expression of IKKβ was not affected (Figs.6 B and 7 A). Such a depletion was not observed in the presence of IKKα (Fig. 6 A). The depletion of TAK1 and TAB1 was dependent on the kinase activities of TAK1 and IKKβ, because this was not observed in cells expressing kinase-negative mutants of TAK1 and IKKβ (Figs. 6 B and 7 A). This observation may indicate a novel regulatory mechanism of TAK1 kinase activity. In A673 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, endogenous TAK1 is activated by TNF-α in which the TAK1 activity was measured for its ability to activate SEK1 (29Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effect of TNF-α on TAK1 activation in HeLa cells. The anti-TAK1 immunocomplex in vitro kinase assay using 6xHis-MKK6 as a substrate showed that TNF-α activated endogenous TAK1 transiently, and the maximal activation was observed at 2–5 min after stimulation (Fig.8 A). TAK1 activity was also detected together with its autophosphorylation and TAB1 phosphorylation (data not shown), which was similar to the data from the overexpression experiment (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, TAK1 activation was preceded by the activation of endogenous IKK complex, which was detected at 5–10 min after stimulation (Fig. 8 A). In contrast, TGF-β did not induce TAK1 activation as well as IKK activation (Fig. 8 A). These results suggest that TAK1/TAB1 might act as signal transducers of the NF-κB activation pathway through the TNF-α receptor. To clarify this possibility, we examined the effect of kinase-negative TAK1 on TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. TAK1K63W inhibited κB-dependent luciferase gene expression (Fig. 8 B). These results indicate that the TAK1/TAB1 complex plays a role in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. NIK plays a key role in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation through IKK activation (19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 20Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Here we further investigated the effect of the NIK mutant. A truncated mutant NIK (NIK624–947) acted as a dominant negative inhibitor against the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.9 A). Furthermore, the NIK mutant partially inhibited TAK1-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.9 B). TAK1 was first identified as a MAPKKK that can be activated by TGF-β and bone morphological protein (26Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) and was reported to play a role in bone morphological protein signaling in earlyXenopus development (34Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning ofXenopus TAK1 revealed that the amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain is highly conserved (98%) between XenopusTAK1 and human TAK1 (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Smad proteins are critically involved in the signaling pathway from TGF-β and bone morphological protein receptors (35Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar, 36Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The injection of kinase-negative TAK1 mRNA into the Xenopus embryo reverses the Smad1- or Smad5-induced expression of ventral mesoderm markers, suggesting cooperation between TAK1 and Smad proteins (34Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated a novel function of TAK1 as an activator of the IKK complex to stimulate NF-κB activation. However, little is known about the functional relationship between TGF-β signaling and the NF-κB activation pathways. We previously reported that TGF-β could not induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in HeLa cells (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that TAK1 was not activated by TGF-β in HeLa cells. These results suggest that TAK1 is involved in the NF-κB activation pathway induced by extracellular stimuli other than TGF-β. In this study, we demonstrated that TNF-α activated TAK1 to stimulate NF-κB activation. It has been shown that NIK plays a significant role in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Our previous study showed that NIK624–947 did not inhibit the TAK1-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB (31Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, the truncated NIK mutant inhibits TAK1-induced NF-κB-dependent luciferase gene expression in human embryonal kidney 293 cells. 2Tsuji, N. J., Kishimoto, K., Hiyama, A., Inoue, J., Cao, Z., Matsumoto, K. (1999) Nature, in press. We also observed the partial dominant negative effect of the NIK mutant in HeLa cells. These results suggest that TAK1 might be a regulatory kinase of NIK. Otherwise, TAK1 may regulate IKKs directly, when the NIK mutant could interact with and inactivate endogenous IKKs. Understanding the precise functional relationship between TAK1 and NIK in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation requires further investigation. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 is a serine/threonine kinase with restricted expression in hematopoietic tissues (37Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 38Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been shown that hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 activates the JNK pathway mediated by TAK1 (30Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.T. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is interesting to evaluate the ability of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 to stimulate NF-κB activation through TAK1, which may present a physiological function of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation in hematopoietic differentiation. In the present study, we demonstrated that the recruitment of TAB1 to TAK1 may trigger both TAK1 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of TAB1. The C-terminal 68 amino acids of TAB1 were shown to be sufficient for binding and activating TAK1 (27Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal domain lacking the TAK1 binding domain acts as a dominant negative inhibitor in TGF-β signaling (27Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In addition, the deletion of 20 amino acids from the N terminus of TAK1 renders the protein kinase constitutively active (26Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that TAK1 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of TAB1 and the N-terminal domain of TAK1. In fact, these domains contain a Ser/Thr-rich sequence (26Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 27Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The identification of the phosphorylation sites of TAK1 will provide more information regarding the molecular mechanism of TAK1 activation by TAB1. The functional implications of MAPK cascades in the signaling pathways to NF-κB activation have been characterized. The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90rsk) that lies downstream of the Raf-MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is involved in phorbol ester-induced NF-κB activation by phosphorylating Ser32 but not Ser36 of IκBα (39Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MAPK cascades that are sensitive to the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor PD098059 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were shown to enhance the TNF-α-induced transactivation of the p65 NF-κB subunit (40Vanden Berghe W.

Several MAPKKKs including NIK (21Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), MEKK1 (41Hirano M. Osada S. Aoki T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2668-2674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were recently shown to have the potential to activate NF-κB. NIK and MEKK1 preferentially activate IKKα and IKKβ, respectively (23Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 44Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that TAK1 is a new member of the MAPKKK family that activates IKKs. TAK1 as well as NIK interacts with both IKKα and IKKβ. In contrast, the interaction of MEKK1 with IKKs has not yet been demonstrated, although a MEKK1 catalytic subunit was copurified with the TNF-α-induced multiprotein IKK complex (17Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). A recent study attempting to isolate rat MEKK1 cDNA clarified that MEKK1 is a 195-kDa protein with a large N-terminal regulatory domain (45Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the regulatory domain may play a role in the interaction with IKKs. In fact, the human T cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein binds to the regulatory domain of MEKK1 to stimulate IKK kinase activity (24Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, these observations indicate that MAPKKKs stimulate NF-κB activation through direct interactions with IKKs, but not through the MAPKK-MAPK signaling pathways. MAPKKKs activate MAPKKs by phosphorylating Ser residues in the activation loop (S-X-X-X-S) located between kinase subdomains VII and VIII (46Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These Ser residues are conserved in both IKKα and IKKβ. The Ser residues in IKKβ were shown to be essential for NF-κB activation. In the signaling pathway to NF-κB activation, IKKβ mutants in which Ser177 and Ser181 are replaced with Ala or Glu act as a dominant negative inhibitor and a constitutively active mutant, respectively (17Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). In addition, NIK activates IKKα by phosphorylating Ser176 in the activation loop (44Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated the functional significance of the Ser residues in the activation loop of both IKK subunits in TAK1-induced IKK activation. Collectively, these findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of the regulation of IKKs by TAK1 may be as follows. TAK1 interacts with IKKs in unstimulated cells. The recruitment of TAB1 to TAK1 activates the kinase activity of TAK1, where TAB1 phosphorylation by TAK1 and the autophosphorylation of TAK1 may be occurring. The active TAK1 then phosphorylates the Ser residues in the activation loop of IKKs, resulting in the dissociation of TAK1 from IKKs, depending on the kinase activity of IKKs. Recently, the subunits of the multiprotein IKK complex NEMO (IKKγ) and IKAP were isolated (47Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 48Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 49Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The characterization of these subunits and the identification of other subunits of the IKK complex will provide more information on the regulatory mechanisms of IKK activation by TAK1. A selective depletion of TAK1 and TAB1 was detected in the presence of IKKβ. IKKβ activation leads to the phosphorylation of IκB proteins in the NF-κB/IκB complexes, which triggers the degradation of IκB proteins through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. These results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of TAK1 kinase activity in which selective protein degradation through a proteasome pathway might be involved. The IKK complex was first isolated from unstimulated HeLa cells as a ubiquitination-dependent kinase complex (50Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In addition, Seeger et al. (51Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) recently reported that a novel 450-kDa protein complex possessing similarities to 26 S proteasome subunits was involved in the phosphorylation of IκBα. Interestingly, the subunit similar to 26 S proteasome, signalsome (sgn) 6, and other components, sgn1 and sgn7, contain the Ser-X-X-X-Ser MAPKK activation loop motif, raising the possibility that MAPKKKs regulate proteasome-like activity by phosphorylating the Ser residues in the activation loop of these subunits. Future studies of the regulatory mechanisms of depletion of the TAK1/TAB1 complex will shed light on the role of protein degradation in the signaling pathways to NF-κB activation. In summary, we demonstrated that TAK1 is a new regulatory kinase of IKKs that stimulates NF-κB activation. Our findings, together with previous observations, indicate that the multiprotein complexes composed of core IKK subunits and regulatory kinases such as TAK1, NIK, and MEKK1 may be involved in the signaling pathways to NF-κB activation by diverse extracellular stimuli. Selective intervention of the activation and the function of TAK1 is likely to have therapeutic value in treating inflammatory diseases, in which NF-κB may play significant pathogenic roles.

Analysis of one of the bands consistently up-regulated by VEGF led us to the identification of a cDNA from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell library that is 77% identical to the human K+-Cl− cotransporter1 (KCC1). We have referred to the predicted protein as K+-Cl−cotransporter 3 (KCC3). Hydrophobicity analysis of the KCC3 amino acid sequence showed an almost identical pattern to KCC1, suggesting 12 membrane-spanning segments, a large extracellular loop with potentialN-glycosylation sites, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions. The KCC3 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, showing a distinct pattern and size from KCC1 and KCC2. The KCC3 mRNA level in endothelial cells increased on treatment with VEGF and decreased with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, whereas KCC1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Stable overexpression of KCC3 cDNA in HEK293 cells produced a glycoprotein of approximately 150 kDa, which was reduced to 120 kDa by glycosidase digestion. An increased initial uptake rate of86Rb was seen in clones with high KCC3 expression, which was dependent on extracellular Cl− but not Na+and was inhibitable by the loop diuretic agent furosemide. The KCC3 genomic localization was shown to be 15q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Radiation hybrid analysis placed KCC3 within an area associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. These results suggest KCC3 is a new member of the KCC family that is under distinct regulation from KCC1.

There are three CCC subclasses identified thus far on the basis of their structures, ligands, and inhibitors.

In addition to the classical roles of transepithelial salt transport (6Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the regulation of cellular volume (7Lauf P.K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5855-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have recently shown that tobacco protoplast growth becomes independent of the plant hormone, auxin, when NKCC1 is overexpressed, suggesting the possible involvement of the CCC family in cell cycle regulation. The physiological regulation of the NKCC and KCC family is complex. Other than the electrochemical gradient of their ligands, evidence suggests that activation of this passive transport system is regulated by phosphorylation (9Krarup T. Jakobsen L.D. Jensen B.S.

In addition, some stimuli can mediate differential effects on various members of the CCC family. For example, cell swelling activates KCC, whereas cell shrinkage activates NKCC (6Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lauf P.K. Bauer J. Adragna N.C. Fujise H. Zade-Oppen A.M.M. Ryu K.H. Delpire E. Am. J.

In cultured endothelial cells, transcriptional regulation has been reported for NKCC1 in response to sheer stress and proinflammatory cytokines (14Topper J.N. Wasserman S.M. Anderson K.R. Cai J. Falb D. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2941-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cellular differentiation has also been shown to be associated with changes in NKCC and KCC gene expression. In the intestinal epithelial cell line HT29, a change of NKCC1 mRNA level during differentiation has been reported (15Matthews J.B. Hassan I. Meng S. Archer S.Y. Hrnjez B.J. Hodin R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We report here the isolation and cloning of a new member of the KCC group of cotransporters, which we have named KCC3. KCC3 displays high homology to KCC1, and the characteristics of the ion flux mediated by KCC3 satisfies the criteria for a KCC. KCC3 is regulated at the mRNA level by the angiogenic factor VEGF and by the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, neither of which has any effect on KCC1 mRNA levels. Finally, KCC3 has been localized to chromosome 15q13, a region linked to the inherited disease juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (17Elslie F.V. Rees M. Williamson M.P. Kerr M. Kjeldsen M.J. Pang K.A. Sundqvist A. Mögens L.F. Chadwick D. Richens A. Covanis A. Santos M. Arzimanoglou A. Panayiotopoulos C.P. Curtis D. Whitehouse W.P. Gardiner R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). HUVECs were isolated as described previously (18Wall R.T. Harker L.A. Quadracci L.J. Striker G.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 96: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured on gelatin-coated culture flasks in medium 199 with Eagle's salts supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. After passage 1, the cells were grown in medium with 25 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Collaborative Research) and 25 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). For the differential display, HUVECs were cultured in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2% fetal calf serum for 2 days. HUVECs grown to approximately 70% confluency in Opti-MEM were stimulated with 50 ng/ml VEGF 165 (R & D Systems) and 25 μg/ml heparin for 4 h. For TNFα stimulation, HUVECs were grown in medium with 20% fetal calf serum and growth factor, then treated for 4 h with 2 ng/ml TNFα (R & D). Primary culture HUVECs with or without VEGF stimulation were lysed by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted using the manufacturer's protocol and was treated with RNA clean kit (Genhunter) to remove genomic DNA contamination. The RNA obtained was reverse-transcribed using three classes of anchor primers provided in the RNA Image Kit (Genhunter), and each of three cDNA pools were amplified on the GeneAmp PCR system 2400 model (Perkin-Elmer) with a combination of eight arbitrary primers and the same anchor primer used in reverse transcription. This resulted in the generation of 24 amplicons from one RNA sample. The primer-matched amplicons were electrophoresed side by side in a 6% acrylamide gel. The bands that were consistently regulated were retrieved from the gel, reamplified, and subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) to be sequenced using Dye terminator cycle sequence kit and the autosequencer (Perkin-Elmer-Applied Bio). One of the bands consistently up-regulated by VEGF treatment encoded a product whose DNA sequence was 90% identical to human KCC1. We used this sequence as a probe (7AV1 probe) to screen a λgt10/HUVEC library (a gift from Dr. Sawamura, Kyoto University). A 2.7-kb phage clone (clone 3) showed significant homology to KCC1 (U55054 in GenBankTM/EBI data bank). We further screened the library with a 5′ sequence of clone 3 (3R probe, a PCR product using primers 5′-CATTGACGTTTGCTCTAAGACC and 5′-GTTTGATCCAGCCATGATACC, see Fig. 2 A) to obtain a 2.1-kb clone (clone 9) that spanned a putative initiating ATG signal. Clone 3 and clone 9 shared an overlap of 1 kb including a BstB1 site, which enabled us to construct a 3.7-kb cDNA with an open reading frame for a 1099-amino acid protein (see Fig. 2 A, KCC3 protein, cDNA sequence deposited in GenBankTM data base, accession number AF108831). Analysis of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences was carried out using the programs provided by ANGIS (Australian National Genomic Information Service). Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs of primary and passaged cultures using Trizol reagent. Twenty μg of total RNA was prepared and separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membrane and UV-cross-linked. To produce a specific KCC3 probe, we generated a 942-base pair PCR product using KCC3-specific primers (GTCCCATCAAAGTTATG and GCAATAGCTTGTAGCAGCCTCG, corresponding to amino acids 349–548). This segment of cDNA was chosen because it had low homology to KCC1. After purification of this product from agarose gel using Bresa Clean Kit (Bresatec), the fragment was labeled with [32P]dATP (Giga label kit, Bresatec) in the presence of 1 ng/ml reverse primer to replace the random primers. To produce a KCC1-specific probe, TGGGACCATTTTCCTGACC and CATGCTTCTCCACGATGTCAC (corresponding to amino acids 254–394) were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and the same protocol was used. Hybridization was carried out with ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). For studying tissue-specific expression of KCC3, a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized to the KCC3-specific probe. A FLAG epitope-tagged full-length KCC3 cDNA expression construct was produced. By PCR, a FLAG sequence of DYKDDDDK was added to the N terminus of KCC3 using the following primers (GAATTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGATGCCACATTTTACTGTGACT and CTCCCTTGGGTAGGTAATTA (corresponding to amino acids 1–403). The PCR generated a 1-kb PCR product that was digested with XhoI and linked to the rest of the KCC3 sequence. The construct was introduced into the pcDNA zeo 3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), which was introduced to HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK293 cells were selected with 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen), and colonies were picked to generate clonal populations. Transfected HEK 293 cells were grown to confluency in 24-well dishes coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were washed twice with flux medium (135 mm NaCl, 3 mm glucose, 5 mm RbCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmNa2SO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm ouabain) and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 400 μl of flux medium containing 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (ICN). One hundred μl of flux medium containing 10 μCi/ml 86RbCl (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was quickly added. Cells were incubated for 3 min before washing 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For sodium-free experiments, sodium was replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine (ICN), and for chloride-free experiments, it was replaced by gluconate. Bumetanide (Sigma) and furosemide (Sigma) were administered at the indicated concentration at the start of the preincubation withN-ethylmaleimide. Cells were lysed with 2% SDS and assayed for protein content using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and for86Rb using Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. Synthetic KCC peptide 1 (SQNSITGEHSQLLDD) and peptide 2 (AIFHSDDALKESAA) were linked to chicken albumin (Sigma) to immunize rabbits, and anti-KCC3 peptide antibodies (P1 antibody by peptide 1 and P2 antibody by peptide 2) were prepared as described previously (19Tomiyama S. Andoh T. Manual for Monoclonal Antibody. Kodansha Scientific, Tokyo1987: 178-179Google Scholar). To digest KCC3 protein by N-glycanase F (Boehringer Mannheim), immunoprecipitated KCC3 was incubated with 250 milliunits/ml glycosidase overnight at 30 °C in the presence of 10% Nonidet P-40. The KCC3 coding sequence in the pGEM4Z vector was nick-translated with biotin-14-dATP and hybridized in situ at a final concentration of 15 ng/ml to metaphases from two normal males. The fluorescence in situ hybridization method was modified from that previously described (20Callen D.F. Baker E. Eyre H.J. Chernos J.E. Bell J.A. Sutherland G.R. Ann. Genet. 1990; 33: 219-221PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomes were stained before analysis with both propidium iodide (as counterstain) and 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (for chromosome identification). For the radiation hybrid analysis, we performed a screen of a medium resolution Stanford G3 panel of 83 clones to refine the map position of the KCC3 gene. PCR amplification was carried out on this panel using primers g5 (TGCCACATTTTACTGTGAC) and g6 (TCATCTGAATCCTGAATCC), both of which lie in the 5′ region of KCC3 gene. PCR results were analyzed using the radiation hybrid mapping facility at the Stanford Human Genome Center. In the differential display PCR using total RNA extracted from 4-h VEGF-treated HUVECs, a band was consistently up-regulated in experiments using three independent pools of primary and passaged HUVECs as RNA sources. A representative example of these differential displays is shown in Fig.1. We have characterized this product and generated a full-length cDNA from two overlapping clones (Fig.2 A). The cDNA sequence shows high homology to KCC1 and encodes a predicted protein of 1099 amino acids. The primary amino acid sequence of this protein, which we have named KCC3, is 77% identical to KCC1 and 73% identical to KCC2 (Fig. 3). Five N-glycosylation consensus sites are found in the large extracellular domain between the 5th and 6th membrane-spanning regions (Fig. 3). The hydropathy profile (by Kyte-Doolittle analysis) of KCC3 was almost identical to that of KCC1, predicting a protein with 12 membrane-spanning segments and large intracellular N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2 B). Considerable diversity is seen, relative to KCC1, in the N-terminal portion, the extracellular domain between the 3rd and 4th membrane-spanning segments and the 5th and 6th membrane-spanning segments and in the area near the C terminus. KCC3 does not have a glutamic acid residue at the beginning of the transmembrane domain 2. This residue has been suggested to be important for the enhanced extracellular potassium binding in KCC2 (21Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3Comparison of the primary structures of the KCC family members. Identical amino acids are shaded. Predicted transmembrane segments are highlighted bylines above the KCC3 sequence. Consensus motifs forN-glycosylation sites (Gly), casein II kinase phosphorylation sites (C), and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (PK) are also shown above the sequence. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the PILEUP and PRETTY BOX programs (ANGIS), and consensus sites were identified with the MOTIF program at ANGIS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig.4 A shows the tissue-specific expression of KCC3. Unlike ubiquitously expressed KCC1 and brain-restricted KCC2, strong expression of KCC3 was observed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Transcripts of approximately 9, 7.5, and 4.5 kb were detected (lanes 2, 3,7, and 8 in Fig. 4 A), and these showed tissue-specific differences in abundance. KCC3 mRNA level increased from as early as 1.5 h after VEGF administration, whereas KCC1 levels remained unchanged (Fig. 4 B). This was true not only in primary HUVECs but also in passaged cells (data not shown). We have also used semiquantitative PCR to analyze the VEGF responsiveness and have obtained results similar to the Northern blot data (not shown). It has been reported that NKCC1 is up-regulated by TNFα (14Topper J.N. Wasserman S.M. Anderson K.R. Cai J. Falb D. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2941-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, the KCC3 mRNA level showed a down-regulation in response to TNFα, whereas KCC1 remained unchanged (Fig. 4 B). To further analyze the KCC3 gene product, we have generated a KCC3 cDNA incorporating an N-terminal FLAG epitope (N-FLAG KCC3). We have produced stable HEK293 cell lines overexpressing N-FLAG KCC3. The FLAG-tagged protein, when immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2 antibody, Eastman Kodak Co.), was approximately150 kDa (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and2) and reduced to 120 kDa by digestion with glycosidase treatment (Fig. 5 B). Immunoprecipitation using M2 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-KCC3 synthetic peptide 1 antibody (P1 antibody, Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and4) and immunoprecipitation using P1 antibody followed by Western blotting with M2 antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6) gave the same results. These results were also reproduced when we used P2 antibody instead of P1 antibody (data not shown). KCC3 protein was also immunoprecipitated and blotted from cultured HUVECs using P1 antibody (Fig. 5 C). We used a86Rb uptake assay as a measure of K+ flux as described elsewhere (4Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). When the FLAG sequence was added to the C terminus of KCC3, there was no measurable difference in86Rb uptake between KCC3 clones and control populations (data not shown). Therefore the N-FLAG KCC3 construct was used for the functional analysis of KCC3. Expression of KCC3 in HEK293 cells was confirmed after selection in zeocin by Western blotting using M2 antibody. The results for 1 clone (clone 847) are shown in Fig.6, although similar results were seen in 5 other independent clones (data not shown). A 3-min assay was used because in both control and transfectants, 86Rb uptake was linear at least for the initial 15 min (data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 6 B demonstrate a significantly increased furosemide-sensitive 86Rb uptake in clone 847 that expresses a high level of KCC3 (Fig. 6 A). The magnitude of furosemide-sensitive 86Rb uptake was similar to that reported for KCC1 (4Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), because our value of 10 cpm/μg of protein/3 min is equal to 3.2 nmol Rb/μg of protein/min. Such an increase was not seen in clones that were zeocin-resistant but expressed a low level of KCC3 (data not shown). The uptake was dependent on extracellular Cl− with little dependence on extracellular Na+ (Fig. 6 C). The loop diuretics furosemide and bumetanide showed a dose-dependent inhibition of uptake with furosemide slightly more effective than bumetanide (K i of approximately10 μm versus 40 μm, Fig. 6 D). The KCC3 transfectants did not show a significant increase in 86Rb uptake in response to hypotonic treatment (data not shown). These results show that KCC3 satisfies the functional criteria of the KCC class of cotransporters. Twenty-five metaphases from a normal male were examined for fluorescent signal. All of these metaphases showed a signal on one or both chromatids of chromosome 15 in the region 15q13 (Fig. 7). There was a total of 2 nonspecific background dots observed in these 25 metaphases. A similar result was obtained from hybridization of the probe to 15 metaphases from a second normal male (data not shown). Radiation hybrid analysis indicated that KCC3 is most closely associated with the chromosome 15 marker SHGC-33497 with a LOD score of 1000. Assessment of flanking markers D15S1010 and D15S1040, using the integrated gene maps available at NCBI, gave a result consistent with the localization of KCC3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. We describe here the cloning of a new member of the CCC family that is structurally closely related to the potassium chloride cotransporter KCC1 and that we therefore have named KCC3. The amino acid sequence shows significant homology to other KCC family members with overall amino acid identity between KCC1 and KCC3 being 77%. There is a large predicted extracellular domain between the 5th and 6th putative membrane-spanning regions that is common to the KCC family but not observed in the NKCC family. Considerable diversity is observed in the N-terminal portion and in the extracellular domains between the 3rd and 4th and 5th and 6th putative membrane-spanning segments (Fig. 3). It is also notable that there are four deletions in the C-terminal region common to KCC1 and KCC3 that are not present in KCC2 (Fig. 3). The C-terminal conserved portion appears important in its function as addition of a FLAG epitope to the C terminus of KCC3 abolished the uptake of 86Rb in our assay (data not shown). Furthermore, Harling et al. (8Harling H. Czaja I. Shell J. Walden R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5855-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) find that the C-terminal fragment of AXI 4, a plant CCC, is sufficient for establishing auxin-independent growth of tobacco protoplast growth. Overexpression of KCC3 in HEK293 cells allowed functional analysis and demonstrated that KCC3 exhibits characteristics expected of a KCC.86Rb flux was significantly increased in KCC3 transfectants. This increase was independent of extracellular Na+ but dependent on extracellular Cl−. This and the fact that the 86Rb flux was measured in the presence of the SH-reactive reagent N-ethylmaleimide (22Kramhoft B. Lambert I.H. Hoffman E.K. Jorgensen F. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C369-C379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibits NKCC1 but activates KCC (4Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggest that NKCC1 is not a major contributor in our assay. It is also considered unlikely that KCC1 is responsible for all the 86Rb uptake observed in the transfectants, because increased uptake was only seen in clones expressing high levels of KCC3. Furthermore, in both KCC3-expressing transfectants and control transfectants, the mRNA levels of KCC1 were equivalent (data not shown). Analysis of multiple tissue blot Northern filters probed with a KCC3-specific probe showed a tissue-specific expression pattern with highest levels observed in kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. This contrasted with the expression of KCC1, which is ubiquitous (4Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and KCC2, which is restricted to brain (5Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Although the reason for the selective tissue distribution is unknown, it suggests that KCC3 does not serve a general housekeeping function such as cell volume regulation as has been proposed for KCC1 (4Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the lack of detectable regulation of KCC3 activity in response to alterations in osmolarity (data not shown). At present we do not know the role of KCC3 in endothelial cells. However, the responsiveness of this gene in HUVECs to VEGF suggests an involvement in angiogenesis. It is tempting to speculate that the up-regulation of KCC3 mRNA levels mediated by VEGF may be through modulation of the cytoskeleton, which results in changes in cell shape (23Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such changes have been reported to be one of the initial events upon angiogenic stimulation (24Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and changes of this type can also affect the expression of the CCC members (7Lauf P.K. Bauer J. Adragna N.C. Fujise H. Zade-Oppen A.M.M. Ryu K.H. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C917-C932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Edwards et al. (25Edwards G. Dora K.A. Gardener M.J. Garland C.J. Weston A.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) reported that K+ released from endothelial cells in response to acetylcholine stimulation caused hyperpolarization and relaxation of smooth muscle cells through activation of the Na-K-ATPase and Ba2+-sensitive K+ channel. Thus K+ may also be important in the control of blood pressure. Because the Na-K-ATPase generates the chemical gradient that drives CCCs, it also implies that KCC3 may be involved in modulating the local K+ concentration. We also observed a down-regulation of the KCC3 mRNA level in response to TNFα. Because NKCC1 is up-regulated by TNFα (14Topper J.N. Wasserman S.M. Anderson K.R. Cai J. Falb D. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2941-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), our results suggest that KCC3 may be a functional counterpart of NKCC1. Certainly KCC1 mRNA levels showed no change in response to TNFα, supporting the idea that KCC3 and NKCC1 are coregulated in response to TNFα. NKCC1 has been reported to play a role downstream of the growth hormone auxin in tobacco protoplasts (8Harling H. Czaja I. Shell J. Walden R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5855-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), where it is involved in cell cycle progression; therefore we speculate that KCC3 may also be involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, the tissue-specific expression pattern of KCC3 resembles that of cyclin G1(26Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6050-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a cyclin involved in cell cycle arrest. KCC3 has been localized to 15q13 and between the genetic markers D15S1010 and D15S1040. This region has recently been linked to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (17Elslie F.V. Rees M. Williamson M.P. Kerr M. Kjeldsen M.J. Pang K.A. Sundqvist A. Mögens L.F. Chadwick D. Richens A. Covanis A. Santos M. Arzimanoglou A. Panayiotopoulos C.P. Curtis D. Whitehouse W.P. Gardiner R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that KCC3 is a candidate gene for this disease. Payne (21Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has postulated that KCC2, a brain-restricted KCC, acts as a neuronal Cl− pump, complementing other systems in regulating K+ homeostasis. The concept is now emerging that the idiopathic epilepsies may represent ion channel disorders (27Steinlein O.K. Clin. Genet. 1998; 54: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) based on certain inherited forms of epilepsy in mice (28Flethcer C.F. Lutz C.M. O'Sullivan T.N. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Hawkes R.

Here, we demonstrated the intracellular formation of ceramide, a lipid signal mediator, in SNP-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells and investigated the mechanisms of ceramide generation. The levels of intracellular ceramide increased to, at most, 160% of the control level in a time- and dose-dependent manner when the cells were treated with 1 mm SNP. SNP also decreased the sphingomyelin level to ∼70% of the control level and increased magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity to 160% of the control activity 2 h after treatment. Neither acid SMase nor magnesium-independent N-SMase was affected by SNP. Caspases are thought to be key enzymes in apoptotic cell death. Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, a synthetic tetrapeptide inhibitor of caspases, inhibited magnesiumdependent N-SMase, ceramide generation, and apoptosis. Moreover, recombinant purified caspase-3 increased magnesium-dependent N-SMase in a cell-free system. These results suggest that the findings that SNP increased ceramide generation and magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity via caspase-3 are interesting to future study to determine the relation between caspases and sphingolipid metabolites in NO-mediated signaling.

NO is involved in several signaling pathways related to a diverse array of cell functions. Low levels of NO constitutively produced by an endothelial nitric-oxide synthase play a physiological role such as in regulation of vasodilatation (1Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 399-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and platelet aggregation (2Hawkins D.J. Meyrick B.O. Murray J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high levels of NO produced by an inducible NO synthase mainly in macrophages and neutrophils mediate cytotoxicity as the first line of self-defense against invading microorganisms (3Adams L.B. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Krahenbuhl J.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2725-2729PubMed Google Scholar) or tumor cells (4Stuehr D.J. Nathan C.F. J. Exp.

Although the mechanisms of NO-mediated cytotoxicity are still controversial, several possible systems described as follows have been proposed; 1) formation of iron-nitrosyl complexes with FeS-containing critical enzymes, which would cause an impairment of mitochondrial function and an energy depletion (12Stadler J. Curran R.D. Ochoa J.B. Harbrecht B.G. Hoffman R.A. Arch.

These results may indicate the activation of caspases both upstream and downstream of ceramide production, but the precise relation between the caspase cascade and ceramide generation in apoptosis remains to be clarified. NO was also reported to increase caspase-3 to induce apoptosis (33Brockhaus F. Bröne B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, the relation between ceramide generation and caspase-3 in apoptosis induced by NO in HL-60 cells has been investigated. We demonstrated that SNP (a NO donor) increased ceramide generation via activation of magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), but not via magnesium-independent and acid SMases. The ceramide generation seemed to be mediated upstream of NO-activated caspase because the inhibition of caspase by acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) prevented NO-induced apoptosis, activation of magnesium-dependent N-SMase, and ceramide formation. Moreover, recombinant purified caspase-3 could increase N-SMase activity in a cell-free system. As far as we know, this is the first report suggesting the effect of caspase-3 on magnesium-dependent N-SMase. Human leukemia HL-60 cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. Saito (National Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan). C2-ceramide was purchased from Matreya, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Hannun (Duke University). Sodium nitroprusside was purchased from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-α-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) (DEVD-MCA) and DEVD-CHO were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), dissolved at 10 mm in Me2SO, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant purified caspase-3 and -6 were prepared as described (34Takahashi A. Hirata H. Yonehara S. Imai Y. Lee K.K. Moyer R.W. Turner P.C. Mesner P.W. Okazaki T. Sawai H. Kishi S. Yamamoto K. Okuma M. Sasada M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2741-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Other chemicals, if not mentioned, were obtained from Sigma. Human myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. HL-60 cells in exponentially growing phase were washed in RPMI 1640 medium, resuspended in 2% serum-containing medium at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml overnight, and then treated, if not described otherwise below. Viable cell numbers were assessed by the 0.025% trypan blue dye exclusion method under microscopic observation. Cell numbers and survival rates were also measured by the WST-1 assay (cell counting kit, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) using a 96-well microplate reader. Reagents were applied 30 min before adding SNP in the culture medium, if not described otherwise below. DNA was isolated using a GENOME kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA), electrophoresed through a 3% NuSieve agarose minigel (FMC Corp. BioProducts) in 40 mmTris acetate and 1 mm EDTA at 50 V for 3 h, and visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. Flow cytometric DNA analysis was performed for quantification of cell death by apoptosis. Due to DNA degeneration and subsequent leakage from cells (35Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar), apoptotic cells can be detected by diminished staining with DNA-specific fluorochromes. In brief, 2 × 106 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% saponin for fixation of cells (36Yoneda T. Omori K. Ishida A. Uchida S. Mori T. Kannagi R. Jpn. J. Med. Tech. 1994; 43: 1045-1051Google Scholar). The cells were then washed and resuspended in fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml RNase (Bachem California, Torrance, CA)). Red fluorescence was measured with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Advance Cellular Biology, San Jose, CA). We could assess the number of hypodiploid cells (apoptotic cells) and cells with more than diploid DNA content (non-apoptotic cells). Extraction of cellular lipids by the Bligh-Dyer method (54Bligh E.A. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and ceramide measurement using DAG kinase were performed as described (37Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solvent system used to separate ceramide phosphate was chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (10:4:3:2:1). We confirmed that DAG kinase activity was not increased by SNP because C2-ceramide did not change as an internal standard during the procedure, and the amounts of phospholipid phosphate corresponded to the viable cell numbers (data not shown). NO undergoes a series of reactions with several molecules present in biological fluids. The final products of NO in vivo are nitrite and nitrate. The sum of nitrite and nitrate can be the index of total NO production. Nitrite, a stable NO oxidation product, was determined using the Griess reaction (nitrate/nitrite assay kit, Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Phenol red-free Dulbeccos' modified Eagle's medium was harvested after treatment. First, nitrate was converted to nitrite utilizing nitrate reductase, and then Griess reagents were added to convert nitrite into a deep-purple azo compound. The absorbance of the azo chromophore was measured to determine the nitrite concentration at 540 nm using the plate reader. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, and labeled with [14C]choline chloride (0.1 μCi/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 36 h. The labeled cells were treated with 1 mm SNP for the indicated times. After harvesting the cells, the lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (54Bligh E.A. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and applied to a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Whatman). Inorganic phosphate in the extract was measured to calculate phospholipid content. The TLC plate was developed in solvent containing chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:30:8:5), and the bands corresponding to SM were detected with a Fuji BAS system. HL-60 cells (1 × 107) were harvested; washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; and homogenized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris- HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 after each treatment. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as an enzyme source. The assay mixture for the measurement of magnesium-dependent N-SMase contained 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 nmol of [methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (specific activity = 1.74 GBq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50–300 μg of enzyme in a final volume of 0.1 ml. For magnesium-independent N-SMase, MgCl2 was removed from the reaction mixture. For acid SMase, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was used instead of Tris-HCl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Then, 0.2 ml of double-distilled water was added to the tubes and vortexed. The tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to separate the two phases. The clear upper phase (0.4 ml) was removed, placed in a glass scintillation vial, and counted with a scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. After each treatment, the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as an enzyme source and added to the reaction mixture (10% sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 μm DEVD-MCA), followed by incubation at 25 °C for 60 min. Fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader (MTP-100F, Corona Electric, Tokyo, Japan) using 360-nm excitation and 450-nm emission filters. Concentrations of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin liberated as a result of cleavage were calculated comparing with standard 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin solutions. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin; left on ice for 20 min; passed through a 27-gauge needle; and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad assay. SNP showed a time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells (Fig.1, A and B). Three h after treatment with 1 mm SNP, HL-60 cells showed morphological changes (blebbing, shrinkage, and chromatin condensation) and DNA fragmentation characteristic for apoptosis (Fig.1 C). The percentage of apoptotic cells measured by flow cytometric analysis increased from 8.6 to 30.5% 4 h after treatment with 1 mm SNP. At higher concentrations, the number of apoptotic cells did not show any more increase, and necrosis was observed judging from trypan blue dye staining. After 24 h, the cell numbers decreased to ∼20% of the control level (data not shown). Potassium hexacyanoferrate, which is structurally similar to SNP except for the absence of a nitroso group, did not affect cell growth at the same concentration as SNP (data not shown), suggesting that the effects of SNP on cell growth and apoptosis were due to NO generation, but not to cyanoid effects. To date, our studies (37Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (17Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ceramide, a lipid second messenger, plays an important role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and death. To investigate the interrelation between NO and ceramide generation, we measured nitrite concentration in the culture medium after addition of C2-ceramide. We could not detect any change within 6 h, whereas SNP increased nitrite production in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2). Although ceramide was reported to enhance the expression of inducible NO synthase in rat astrocytes (39Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it may be that ceramide does not increase NO generation in HL-60 cells. To examine the possible involvement of the ceramide signaling pathway in NO-induced cell stress, we measured intracellular ceramide levels after addition of SNP. Ceramide generation measured by the DAG kinase assay method began to increase at 90 min after addition of 1 mm SNP and reached a maximum level, which was ∼160% of the control level, 4 h after treatment (Fig.3 A). To justify ceramide measurement by the DAG kinase assay, we confirmed that the DAG kinase and phospholipid phosphate activities of the same numbers of cells did not change during treatment with SNP, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Concentrations higher than 1 mm SNP did not increase ceramide levels more than 1 mm SNP, probably due to the induction of necrosis (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Ceramide generation, decrease in sphingomyelin, and increase in magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity induced by SNP.

The error bars indicate 1 S.D. B, dose-dependent increase in ceramide induced by SNP. The cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of SNP for 4 h. The results were obtained from at least three different experiments. The error bars indicate 1 S.D. C, decrease in sphingomyelin induced by SNP. The cells prelabeled with [14C]choline chloride were treated with 1 mmSNP for the indicated times.

The cells were treated with 1 mm SNP for the indicated times, and the activities of SMases were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results were obtained from three different experiments. Theerror bars indicate 1 S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since there are several possible metabolic pathways as a mechanism of ceramide generation, we, first of all, measured changes in labeled SM contents caused by SNP to examine the possible involvement of SMase. SM levels decreased to 70% of the control level 2 h after treatment with 1 mm SNP and then returned to the control level by 6 h (Fig. 3 C). We examined the activities of three different types of SMases, which have been reported to be involved in SM hydrolysis (37Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 D, magnesium-dependent N-SMase (basal specific activity = 1.08 nmol/mg of protein/h) increased to 156 ± 18% of the control level 2 h after treatment with SNP and returned to the control level by 6 h. The activity of magnesium-independent N-SMase (basal specific activity = 0.65 nmol/mg of protein/h) did not change following treatment with SNP up to 6 h. The activity of acid SMase (basal specific activity = 9.72 nmol/mg of protein/h) slightly decreased, but did not increase after treatment with SNP. The biological meaning of this decrease is unclear at present. These results suggest that ceramide generation induced by SNP results from SM hydrolysis via the increase in magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity. Since many stresses are reported to activate caspase-3 as an executioner of apoptosis, we investigated whether SNP-generated NO activates caspase-3. The activity of caspase-3 was assessed by measuring the proteolytic cleavage of DEVD-MCA, a fluorogenic substrate of caspase-3, and it increased after treatment with SNP (Fig. 4 A). The activities 4 h after treatment with 0.5 and 1 mm SNP were 88 and 134 pmol/mg of protein/min, respectively, compared with the control level of 30 pmol/mg of protein/min. SNP increased the caspase-3 activities in a time-dependent manner. DEVD-CHO (200 μm), an inhibitor of caspase-3, completely inhibited the increase in DEVD-MCA cleavage activity induced by SNP (Fig.4 B). Moreover, SNP-induced apoptotic cells markedly decreased from 31 to 11% upon addition of DEVD-CHO (Fig.4 C). These results suggest that the activation of caspase-3 is required to induce HL-60 cell apoptosis by SNP. We investigated whether ceramide generation by magnesium-dependent N-SMase was upstream or downstream of caspase-3 in SNP-induced apoptosis. We examined the effects of DEVD-CHO on ceramide generation and the increase in magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity induced by SNP. The SNP-induced increase in intracellular ceramide, which showed the maximum 4 h after treatment, was completely inhibited by preincubation with 200 μm DEVD-CHO, as shown in Fig.5 A. By the same procedure, the activation of magnesium-dependent N-SMase (146 ± 16% of the control level 4 h after treatment with SNP) was also completely inhibited (Fig. 5 B). These results show that the protease including DEVDase is activated upstream of ceramide generation by magnesium-dependent N-SMase for NO-induced apoptosis. It became clear that the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO inhibits ceramide generation and magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity in the process of NO-induced apoptosis. Although it is the nature of things that SMase can generate ceramide through hydrolysis of SM, there was no direct evidence that caspase-3 could increase the activity of magnesium-dependent N-SMase. Therefore, we used recombinant purified caspase-3 from Escherichia coli transfected with caspase-3 cDNA, which did not have any types of SMase activity in itself (data not shown), but which could increase magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity with the cell extracts. Addition of recombinant purified caspase-3 (600 ng) to the cell extracts (250 μg) induced a 3-fold increase in magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity (Fig.6). Since we previously showed that caspase-3 activates caspase-6 in Fas-induced apoptosis (40Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), we examined whether caspase-6 increased magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity, but this activity did not increase even in the presence of the cell extracts (data not shown). Our results suggest the direct role of caspase-3 in activating magnesiumdependent N-SMase and ceramide generation in NO-induced apoptosis. The sphingomyelin cycle and ceramide generation were first discovered in cell differentiation of HL-60 cells in response to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (37Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that many cell types respond to diverse stresses with ceramide generation (17Hannun Y.A. J.

Recently, NO has been reported to be related to induction of apoptosis in various cell lines, including human leukemia HL-60 cells (5Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sarih M. Souvannavong V. Adam A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 7Ankarcrona M.

Immunol. 1997; 176: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated whether and how NO is related to ceramide generation in the caspase/apoptotic death pathway in HL-60 cells. First of all, we showed that SNP induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). We investigated whether ceramide increased NO generation and vice versa. We found that ceramide had no effect on NO generation in HL-60 cells by measuring nitrite in the culture medium (Fig. 2). This result agreed with previous reports showing that ceramide itself does not affect NO synthase in isolated pancreatic islets and astrocytes, even though ceramide enhances lipopolysaccharide-induced NO synthase activation (39Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 41Kwon G. Bohrer A. Han X. Corbett J.A. Ma Z. Gross R.W. McDaniel M.L. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1210: 308-316Google Scholar). When apoptosis was induced by NO, intracellular levels of ceramide increased to ∼160% of the control level 4 h after treatment. Since there were several possible mechanisms to generate ceramide metabolically, the changes in SM levels and three different types of SMase were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 C, SM levels decreased 2–4 h after treatment with SNP and then returned to the control level, corresponding reciprocally to the time course of ceramide generation. Although acid SMase was reported to be involved in tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (42Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Carbo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), the activities of acid SMase and magnesium-independent N-SMase did not increase in NO-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 D). These findings show that NO increases ceramide generation by activating magnesium-dependent N-SMase. Although well characterized downstream signals of NO are guanylate cyclase (43Schmidt H.H.H.W. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), adenyl cyclase (44Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E.-J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5959-5965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (46Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27180-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is controversial whether protein kinases G, A, and C are closely involved in NO-induced apoptosis (47Loweth A.C. Williams G.T. Scarpello J.H.B. Morgan N.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Nishio E. Fukushima K. Shiozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 49Messmer U.K. Lapetina E.G. Bröne B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 757-765PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of several kinases, such as protein kinase A, G, or C, on NO-induced ceramide generation by using activators and inhibitors of these kinases. The results demonstrated that neither activators nor inhibitors of protein kinases G, A, and C had any significant effect on ceramide generation (data not shown), suggesting that NO induced ceramide generation, independently of protein kinase A-, G-, or C-related signaling. In this work, we suggested that ceramide might be a mediator in the NO signaling pathway and is generated from SM hydrolysis through the activation of magnesium-dependent N-SMase. The membrane-associated, magnesium-dependent neutral SMase was purified and characterized very recently (50Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, N-SMase was activated by caspase-3 because DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3 inhibitor, blocked both SNP-induced SMase activation and ceramide generation (Figs. 4 and 5). To confirm the more direct effect of caspase-3 on SMase, recombinant purified caspase-3 was added to the cell extracts. In this cell-free system, we could detect the increase in magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity in the presence of recombinant caspase-3 (Fig. 6), whereas recombinant caspase-6 could not increase SMase activity (data not shown). Judging from the present data, the NO-generated ceramide signal is the downstream target of caspase-3. However, at present, in terms of the mode of action of caspases on SMase, it is unknown whether caspase-3 cleaved plausible pro-SMase, cleaved and inactivated the SMase inhibitor, or activated the SMase activator. As far as we know, this is the first evidence showing the activation of magnesium-dependent N-SMase via caspase-3, whereas activation of acid SMase activity has been shown to occur in response to caspases (51Schwander R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Kröncke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In terms of the relation of the caspase cascade and ceramide in induction of apoptosis, many previous reports suggest that ceramide is upstream of the caspase cascade (26Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our data and others related to REAPER in Drosophila (29Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which showed that caspase could enhance ceramide generation in vivo, may suggest a new function of ceramide as a modulator of the caspase cascade. At present, unfortunately neither this idea nor the indispensability of caspase-generated ceramide in NO-induced apoptosis can be demonstrated because we do not have any biochemical tool to inhibit directly the activity of N-SMase to generate ceramide. In contrast to our data, exposure to NO donors such asS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and SNP or activation of NO synthase was reported to inhibit apoptosis in T lymphocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (52Mannick J.B. Miao X.Q. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24125-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 53Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) because NO induced cGMP-dependent or direct inhibition of caspase-3 through protein S-nitrosylation. These data seem inconsistent with our data showing that NO could induce apoptosis by increasing ceramide generation through caspase-3 activation. The discrepancy in the NO effect on apoptosis may be due to differences in intensity and duration of NO exposure and kinds of cells. Indeed, we observed that low concentrations of SNP <100 μm showed a protective effect against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Induction of apoptosis and an increase in intracellular ceramide were generally observed upon treatment with >250 μm SNP. Caspase-3 activity measured by cleavage of DEVD-MCA was also enhanced at higher (but not lower) concentrations of SNP. 2Y. Takeda and T. Okazaki, unpublished data. NO could generate peroxynitrite by reacting with superoxide anion. NO could also modulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutases (15Dobashi K. Pahan K. Chahal A. Singh I. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1896-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Since intracellular ceramide was reported to be increased by hydrogen peroxide (22Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), changing of redox status may be another one of the mechanisms regulating apoptotic signals between NO and ceramide generation.

https://openalex.org/W2062455027,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) acts as both a growth and survival factor for many hemopoietic cells. IL-3 treatment of responsive cells leads to the rapid and transient activation of Class IA phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and phosphorylation of BAD. Each of these molecules has been implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling in a wide range of cells. Using regulated expression of dominant-negative p85 (Deltap85) in stably transfected IL-3-dependent BaF/3 cells, we have specifically investigated the role of class IA PI3K in IL-3 signaling. The major functional consequence of Deltap85 expression in these cells is a highly reproducible, dramatic reduction in IL-3-induced proliferation. Expression of Deltap85 reduces IL-3-induced PKB phosphorylation and activation and phosphorylation of BAD dramatically, to levels seen in unstimulated cells. Despite these reductions, the levels of apoptosis observed in the same cells are very low and do not account for the reduction in IL-3-dependent proliferation we observe. These results show that Deltap85 inhibits both PKB activity and BAD phosphorylation without significantly affecting levels of apoptosis, suggesting that there are targets other than PKB and BAD that can transmit survival signals in these cells. Our data indicate that the prime target for PI3K action in IL-3 signaling is at the level of regulation of proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2161071101,"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins play a crucial role as signaling molecules in insulin action. Serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins has been hypothesized as a cause of attenuating insulin signaling. The current study investigated serine kinase activity toward IRS-1 in several models of insulin resistance. An in vitro kinase assay was developed that used partially purified cell lysates as a kinase and glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins that contained various of IRS-1 fragments as substrates. Elevated serine kinase activity was detected in Chinese hamster ovary/insulin receptor (IR)/IRS-1 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes chronically treated with insulin, and in liver and muscle of obese JCR:LA-cp rats. It phosphorylated the 526-859 amino acid region of IRS-1, whereas phosphorylation of the 2-516 and 900-1235 amino acid regions was not altered. Phosphopeptide mapping of the 526-859 region of IRS-1 showed three major phosphopeptides (P1, P2, and P3) with different patterns of phosphorylation depending on the source of serine kinase activity. P1 and P2 were strongly phosphorylated when the kinase activity was prepared from insulin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary/IR/IRS-1 cells, weakly phosphorylated by the kinase activity from insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and barely phosphorylated when the extract was derived from insulin-resistant liver. In contrast, P3 was phosphorylated by the serine kinase activity prepared from all insulin-resistant cells and tissues of animals. P1 and P2 phosphorylation can be explained by mitogen-activated protein kinase activity based on the phosphopeptide map generated by recombinant ERK2. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinase failed to phosphorylate the P3 peptide, suggesting that another serine kinase regulates this modification of IRS-1 in insulin-resistant state."

Leptin expression can also be induced by inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial endotoxin and cytokines3,4, which could result in loss of body weight.

https://openalex.org/W1965031549,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is essential for the development and survival of sympathetic and sensory neurons. NGF binds to TrkA, activates the intrinsic kinase activity of TrkA, and promotes the differentiation of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells into sympathetic-like neurons. Several signaling molecules and pathways are known to be activated by NGF, including phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. However, the mechanism of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we examined whether SH2-Bβ, a recently identified pleckstrin homology and SH2 domain-containing signaling protein, is a critical signaling protein for NGF. TrkA bound to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing SH2-Bβ, and NGF stimulation dramatically increased that binding. In contrast, NGF was unable to stimulate the association of TrkA with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing a mutant SH2-Bβ(R555E) with a defective SH2 domain. When overexpressed in PC12 cells, SH2-Bβ co-immunoprecipitated with TrkA in response to NGF.

ERK1/2 can be activated by both NGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF), but the biological responses to NGF and EGF are opposite: NGF promotes differentiation, whereas EGF stimulates proliferation of PC12 cells (11Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar). It was thought that sustained activation of ERK1/2 by NGF compared with transient activation by EGF contributes to the specificity of the NGF differentiation signal (11Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar). Prolonged activation of ERK1/2 by NGF has been shown to be mediated by Rap1 and required for the expression of neuronal specific genes (12York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar).

SH2-Bβ, a predicted adapter protein with multiple potential protein-protein interaction domains/motifs (e.g. pleckstrin homology, SH2, and proline-rich), has recently been shown to be regulated by a variety of ligands that activate receptor tyrosine kinases or receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (13Rui L.

No cellular function had been ascribed to any of these isoforms. In this study, we show that NGF stimulates association of SH2-Bβ with TrkA via the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ and tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. The mutation of the conserved Arg to Glu within the FLVR motif within the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ abolishes the association of the mutant SH2-Bβ with TrkA and tyrosyl phosphorylation of the mutant SH2-Bβ in response to NGF. Furthermore, this mutant SH2-Bβ acts as a dominant negative SH2-Bβ to block NGF-induced neurite outgrowth when overexpressed in PC12 cells. These results suggest that SH2-Bβ is an essential component of a signaling pathway(s) that is vital for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Murine NGF and EGF were from Collaborative Biomedical Products.

Arg-555 in SH2-Bβ was mutated to Glu, using QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primer 5′-GTCTTCTTGGTAGAACAGAGTGAGACAAGA-3′. PC12 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 encoding GFP, GFP-SH2-Bβ, or GFP-SH2-Bβ (R555E), using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum), the transfectants were cultured for 40 additional days in medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. The G418-resistant transfectants were pooled, and the top 2% of cells in terms of expression of GFP fusion proteins were selected by flow cytometry (Elite, ESP). Precedures for preparing cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were described previously (13Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). αPLCγ was used at 1:2000, and αactive-MAPK was used at 1:20,000 for immunoblotting. αTrkA and αShc were used at 1:100 for immunoprecipitation. Cells were plated at a density of 0.2 × 105 and cultured in standard medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 on 60-mm collagen-coated culture dishes (Collaborative Biomedical Products). The next day, NGF was added directly to the medium at the indicated concentrations. Neurite outgrowths were monitored and photographed every 12 h using phase contrast microscopy. NGF was added every 2 days without changing the culture medium. SH2-B in PC12 cells is thought to be the β isoform because after dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase, it comigrates with dephosphorylated SH2-Bβ expressed ectopically in COS cells (data not shown). To determine whether SH2-Bβ plays a role in NGF signaling, we first examined whether SH2-Bβ interacts with TrkA. Wild type or mutant SH2-Bβ was fused to GST. PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA (19Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15125-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were treated with NGF, and the cell extracts were incubated with the indicated GST fusion proteins immobilized on agarose beads. GST fusion proteins containing either wild type (GST-WT) or the C-terminal 20% of SH2-Bβ with the entire SH2 domain (GST-SH2) bound weakly to TrkA from control cells (Fig.1 a). NGF treatment dramatically increased the binding of TrkA to both GST-SH2-Bβ and GST-SH2 (Fig. 1 a). Densitometric analysis revealed that NGF stimulated the association of TrkA with GST-SH2-Bβ by more than 5-fold (n = 3) and with GST-SH2 by more than 4.5-fold (n = 3). In contrast, only a residual amount of TrkA bound to GST fusion proteins containing mutant SH2-Bβ(R555E) in which Glu replaced the critical Arg within the FLVR motif of the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ (GST-RE) (Fig. 1 a). NGF treatment did not increase the binding of TrkA to GST-RE (Fig. 1 a). GST alone did not bind to TrkA, even when cells had been treated with NGF (Fig.1 a). These results suggest that the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ is sufficient and necessary for NGF-promoted association of TrkA with SH2-Bβ. In addition, the weak binding of GST-WT or GST-SH2 to TrkA from control cells suggests that the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ may have a low affinity for nontyrosyl phosphorylated, inactive TrkA. Alternatively, there may be other binding site(s) in the C-terminal portion of SH2-Bβ that bind with a low affinity to nontyrosyl phosphorylated TrkA. To determine whether SH2-Bβ associates with TrkA in cells in response to NGF, PC12 cells overexpressing GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ were treated with NGF, and proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αTrkA. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with either αSH2-B or αGFP (Fig. 1 b). NGF significantly promoted the association of TrkA with GFP-SH2-Bβ (Fig. 1 b). When normalized to the level of TrkA, NGF stimulated the binding of TrkA to GFP-SH2-Bβ by 4-fold. In contrast, NGF did not stimulate the interaction of TrkA with GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) that has a defective SH2 domain (data not shown). Consistent with activated TrkA binding to SH2-Bβ, endogenous SH2-Bβ from NGF-treated cells co-immunoprecipitated with a tyrosyl phosphorylated protein of a size appropriate for TrkA (Fig. 2 b,upper panel). Taken together, our results suggest that NGF stimulates the binding of SH2-Bβ to TrkA via the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ. To examine whether NGF stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ, PC12 cells overexpressing either TrkA (Fig. 2 b) or SH2-Bβ tagged with GFP (Fig.3 b) were stimulated with NGF. Proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B and immunoblotted with αPY. NGF stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of both endogenous SH2-Bβ (Fig. 2 b, upper panel) and GFP-SH2-Bβ (Fig. 3 b, upper panel). In addition, when normal PC12 cells were pretreated for 60 min with 100 μm sodium vanadate (a phosphatase inhibitor) prior to NGF stimulation, significant NGF-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was detected (Fig. 2 a, upper panel). NGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was difficult to detect in normal PC12 cells without pretreatment with phosphatase inhibitor (data not shown), suggesting that NGF induces phosphorylation of tyrosines within SH2-Bβ that then undergo rapid dephosphorylation. NGF also stimulated a significant shift in the mobility of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 2 a, lower panel), which is largely due to NGF-promoted phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ on serines/threonines. 3Rui, L, J. Herrington and C. Carter-Su, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, 1 min of NGF stimulation of PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA caused significant tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ without a dramatic change in the mobility of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 2 b,lower panel). This is in contrast to the large mobility change observed in endogenous SH2-Bβ in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 10 min (Fig. 2 a, lower panel). This difference in mobility shift in the two figures is likely due to the different times of incubation with NGF, because a large mobility change of SH2-Bβ was observed when PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA were treated with NGF for 10 min (data not shown). These data support the hypothesis that the shift in the mobility of SH2-Bβ is caused by phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ on serines/threonines rather than on tyrosines. The results also suggest that NGF-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ may precede serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. In contrast to NGF, EGF did not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ in PC12 cells even in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 2 c). Because EGF stimulates proliferation while NGF promotes neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, this differential response of SH2-Bβ to these two growth factors might contribute to the specificity of biological response following the activation of receptors for these two growth factors. Taken together, the results raise the possibility that NGF-stimulated association of SH2-Bβ with TrkA and/or the subsequent tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ initiates one or more novel signaling pathways that may be specific for NGF and required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. To examine the function of SH2-Bβ in cellular responses to NGF, we generated PC12 cells that stably overexpress GFP, GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ, or GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) that lacks a functional SH2 domain. To eliminate differences due to clonal variation of PC12 cells, we pooled all G418-resistant clones. The GFP tag enabled us to use flow cytometry to isolate cells expressing high levels of SH2-Bβ. GFP-SH2-Bβ and GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) are present at ∼60 and 20 times, respectively, the level of endogenous SH2-Bβ (Fig. 3 a). We first examined whether GFP-SH2-Bβ, like endogenous SH2-Bβ, is tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to NGF. PC12 cells overexpressing GFP-SH2-Bβ (designated as GFP-WT) were stimulated with NGF. Proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B and then immunoblotted with αPY. Significant tyrosyl phosphorylation of GFP-SH2-Bβ was detected (Fig. 3 b, upper panel). Reprobing the same blot with αSH2-B showed that NGF also stimulated a shift in the mobility of GFP-SH2-Bβ (Fig. 3 b, lower panel). 4The apparent difference in the amount of GFP-SH2-Bβ in control and NGF-treated cells in Fig. 3 b(lower panel) is an artifact of this mobility shift and the large amount of GFP-SH2-Bβ. Experiments in which a smaller amount of GFP-SH2-Bβ was electrophoresed revealed similar amounts of GFP-SH2-Bβ from control and NGF-stimulated cells. In contrast, NGF did not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) (Fig. 3 b, upper panel) as anticipated. These results suggest that like endogenous SH2-Bβ, GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ binds to activated and tyrosyl phosphorylated TrkA and is tyrosyl phosphorylated by TrkA in response to NGF. To study the role of SH2-Bβ in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, we examined whether SH2-Bβ is required for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, a hallmark of neuronal differentiation. In the presence of NGF, cells overexpressing GFP alone developed neurite outgrowths in a manner similar to parental PC12 cells (Fig.4, a and b, and data not shown). Strikingly, overexpression of GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) blocked neurite outgrowth induced by NGF (Fig. 4, c andd). Even treatment of cells with a supramaximal concentration of NGF (100 ng/ml) for 8 days or longer did not induce neurite outgrowth (data not shown). This observation suggests that SH2-Bβ is required for NGF-induced morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. Consistent with SH2-Bβ playing an essential role in NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells, overexpression of GFP-SH2-Bβ enhanced NGF-induced neurite outgrowth when NGF was tested at a submaximal concentration. For example, 25 ng/ml NGF for 4 days promoted differentiation of the majority of cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ, whereas only a very few of the cells expressing GFP alone differentiated in response to NGF (Fig. 4, e–h). Neurite outgrowth (twice cell diameter) was observed in about 60% of cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ after 2 days of incubation with 15 ng/ml NGF, whereas fewer than 1% of the cells expressing GFP had neurites. By day 5, approximately 95% of the cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ had neurite outgrowth, whereas only about 40% of cells expressing GFP had neurite outgrowth. In the absence of NGF, overexpression of GFP-SH2-Bβ did not induce neuronal differentiation (Fig. 4 g), suggesting that SH2-Bβ must be activated in some way by NGF, presumably by being phosphorylated, to mediate neurite outgrowth. To explore the mechanism of action of SH2-Bβ, we asked whether overexpression of SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ(R555E) affects tyrosyl phosphorylation of TrkA, Shc, or PLCγ, all of which are known to play important roles in NGF signaling (20Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Cells stably overexpressing GFP, GFP-SH2-Bβ, or GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) were treated with NGF, and proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against TrkA, Shc, or PLCγ and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. NGF induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of TrkA (Fig. 5 a), PLCγ (Fig.5 c), and all three isoforms of Shc (Fig. 5 b). Levels of induction were unchanged in cells overexpressing SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ(R555E) (Fig. 5), suggesting that TrkA activation and signaling events immediately downstream of TrkA are not compromised by overexpression of SH2-Bβ(R555E). Because the kinetics of the activation of ERK1/2 have been hypothesized to play an important role in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, we examined the time course of activation of ERK1/2 by NGF by immunoblotting cell lysates with antibody recognizing only activated ERK1/2 that is phosphorylated on both tyrosine and threonine. Neither the extent nor the duration of activation of ERK1/2 by NGF was affected by overexpression of SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ(R555E) (Fig.6), consistent with the previous observation that sustained activation of ERK1/2 induced by NGF is not sufficient for neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (21Peng X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that NGF promotes the association of SH2-Bβ with activated TrkA and stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. Mutating the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ abolishes its ability to bind activated TrkA and to be phosphorylated in response to NGF, suggesting that SH2-Bβ binds via its SH2 domain to tyrosyl phosphorylated TrkA and that this interaction is required for subsequent phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. Overexpression of a GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ(R555E) lacking a functional SH2 domain blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, whereas overexpression of GFP-tagged wild type SH2-Bβ enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. SH2-Bβ represents only the second signaling molecule, the first being Shc, known to bind to activated TrkA, to be phosphorylated, and to be required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. SH2-Bβ has been shown to associate with receptors for insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (14Wang J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3136-3139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor (15Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21239-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and EGF (data not shown), in addition to TrkA. Of the hormones and growth factors that bind to these receptors, only NGF and platelet-derived growth factor have been shown to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ (14Wang J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3136-3139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21239-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, both NGF and platelet-derived growth factor (23Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) promote neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. In contrast, EGF, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulate cell proliferation (11Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar, 24Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This correlation raises the possibility that ligand-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ plays a critical role in promoting neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Consistent with this idea, NGF stimulates robust tyrosyl phosphorylation of GFP-SH2-Bβ (Fig. 3 b), whose expression enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. However, NGF is unable to stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) (Fig. 3 b), which acts as a dominant negative SH2-Bβ to block NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Because SH2-Bβ but not SH2-Bβ(R555E) binds to TrkA (Fig. 1 a), it is likely that binding of SH2-Bβ to TrkA is required for its phosphorylation and that SH2-Bβ is tyrosyl phosphorylated directly by activated TrkA. SH2-Bβ(R555E) neither binds to TrkA nor interferes with phosphorylation of endogenous SH2-Bβ (data not shown) in response to NGF. Therefore, it seems likely that SH2-Bβ(R555E) functions as a dominant negative mutant to interfere with the action of endogenous SH2-Bβ by competing with endogenous SH2-Bβ for downstream effector(s) and sequestering these putative effector(s) in an inactive state. Phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ does not appear to be required for sequestration of effectors, because GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) is not significantly phosphorylated in response to NGF (Fig. 2 b). However, phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ may be important for activation of downstream effector(s). Alternatively, the downstream effectors of SH2-Bβ may be activated when recruited to TrkA-containing complexes by the interaction of SH2-Bβ with TrkA. Interestingly, overexpression of neither GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) nor GFP-SH2-Bβ affect NGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of TrkA, PLCγ, three isoforms of Shc and activation of ERK1/2, indicating that the signaling events immediately downstream of TrkA and the Shc/Ras/MEK/ERKs cascade are not compromised by overexpression of wild type or dominant negative mutant SH2-Bβ. This observation demonstrates that the dominant negative effect of SH2-Bβ(R555E) on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is not secondary to a defect in the activation of TrkA, the ability of TrkA to tyrosyl phosphorylate its substrates, or the activation of the Shc/Ras/MEK/ERK cascade by NGF. Thus, SH2-Bβ is likely to initiate a novel pathway required for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. In conclusion, we show that the putative adapter protein SH2-Bβ binds via its SH2 domain to activated TrkA and is tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to NGF. We also demonstrate that overexpression of SH2-Bβ enhances NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative SH2-Bβ blocks that differentiation. These findings provide the first insight into the cellular function of SH2-B. They also suggest that SH2-Bβ may be one of the hypothesized “missing links” parallel to or downstream of ERKs that are thought to be required for NGF-induced differentiation. We thank Dr. Louis F.

https://openalex.org/W1524947972,"Arachidonic acid modulates both electrical and biochemical properties of membrane proteins involved in cellular signaling. In Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT4, physiologically relevant concentrations of arachidonic acid increase the amplitude of the substrate-activated current by roughly twofold at -60 mV. This stimulation is not attributable to the modulation of either substrate/ion cotransport or the ligand-gated chloride current, the major conductance associated with this carrier. Ion-substitution experiments reveal that arachidonic acid stimulates a proton-selective conductance. The effect does not require metabolism of arachidonic acid and is not blocked by inhibitors of endogenous oocyte ion-exchangers. This proton conductance expands the complex repertoire of the ligand-gated channel properties associated with EAAT4."

Prostaglandin E2 and other agents that induce cAMP production enhance IGF-I gene transcription in cultured rat osteoblasts through a DNA element termed HS3D, located in the proximal part of the major rat IGF-I promoter. We previously determined that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) is the key cAMP-stimulated regulator of IGF-I transcription in these cells and showed that it transactivates the rat IGF-I promoter through the HS3D site. We now have defined the physical-chemical properties and functional consequences of the interactions between C/EBPδ and HS3D. C/EBPδ, expressed in COS-7 cells or purified as a recombinant protein from Escherichia coli, bound to HS3D with an affinity at least equivalent to that of the albumin D-site, a known high affinity C/EBP binding sequence, and both DNA elements competed equally for C/EBPδ. C/EBPδ bound to HS3D as a dimer, with protein-DNA contact points located on guanine residues on both DNA strands within and just adjacent to the core C/EBP half-site, GCAAT, as determined by methylation interference footprinting. C/EBPδ also formed protein-protein dimers in the absence of interactions with its DNA binding site, as indicated by results of glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies. As established by competition gel-mobility shift experiments, the conserved HS3D sequence from rat, human, and chicken also bound C/EBPδ with similar affinity.

Bacterial expression plasmids for full-length and internally truncated C/EBPδ were constructed as follows.

In recombinant protein C/EBPδ-ΔSacII, amino acids 23 through 152 of C/EBPδ have been eliminated, whereas in C/EBPδ-ΔNcoI, residues 2 through 68 have been deleted.

Cells then were rinsed with serum-free medium and treated for 6 h with vehicle (ethanol diluted 1:1000 in serum-free medium) or 1 μmPGE2 (in serum-free medium). After incubation, the medium was aspirated and cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and luciferase activity was measured as described (13McCarthy T.L.

Cells then were rinsed with serum-free medium and incubated with vehicle (ethanol diluted 1:1000) or 1 μm PGE2 for up to 4 h. Medium was aspirated, and cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and gently pelleted, and the pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Lee et al.(31Lee K.A.W.

Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) with 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.4 μm microcystin CL), and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and the phosphatase and protease inhibitors indicated above. Soluble proteins released by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C were collected by centrifugation at 12000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against 2000 volumes of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20% glycerol) containing the protease inhibitors listed above. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ were expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (17Umayahara Y. Ji C. Centrella M. Rotwein P.

Cells were grown in 150-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes and were transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation using 20 μg of the expression plasmid pcDNA3-C/EBPδ. Twenty-four h later, the medium was changed, and after an additional 24 h, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Polyclonal antibodies to C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ were prepared in chickens (Gallina Biotech, Alberta, CA) using purified S-tagged fusion proteins as antigens. IgY fractions were isolated from eggs by precipitation with polyethylene glycol followed by affinity purification using bacterial-derived antigen immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western immunoblotting was performed after transfer of electrophoresed proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer consisting of 5% nonfat dry milk and 2% fetal bovine serum in TBS-T (20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at 25 °C. Affinity-purified antibody prepared against full-length bacterially expressed C/EBPδ or C/EBPβ (diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer) was then added for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing the membranes in TBS-T, secondary antibody (rabbit anti-chicken IgY diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer) was added for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequent steps were performed as described previously (17Umayahara Y. Ji C. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol.

Recombinant proteins were generated in bacteria as follows. Plasmids pET29a-C/EBPδ, pET29a-C/EBPδ-ΔSacII, pET29a-C/EBPδ-ΔNcoI, and pET29a-C/EBPβ were transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. Bacterial cultures were grown to an A 600 of 0.6 in 50 ml of Circlegrow (Bio101, Vista, CA) containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and then were induced to express recombinant proteins by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mm for 3 h. Bacterial pellets were harvested by centrifugation, then were resuspended into 5 ml of binding/wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 6 m urea. Cells were lysed by one cycle of freezing and thawing followed by sonication. Bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation. The S-tagged proteins were purified using S-agarose (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified proteins were eluted in binding/wash buffer supplemented with 2 m guanidine thiocyanate and 2 m urea, followed by dialysis against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 4 °C. The S tag was cleaved using biotinylated thrombin as described by the supplier (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. Two μg of truncated recombinant C/EBPδ protein (C/EBPδ-ΔNcoI) was incubated with or without 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Gel mobility shift experiments followed previously published methods (16Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y.

Radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probes were synthesized by annealing complementary oligonucleotides followed by fill-in of single-stranded overhangs with dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Nuclear protein extracts or recombinant proteins were preincubated for 30 min on ice with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) without or with unlabeled specific or nonspecific DNA competitors in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin. After the addition of 5 × 104cpm of DNA probe for 30 min on ice, samples were applied to 4–12 and 4–20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) or a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.

After electrophoresis, gels were dried, and the radioactivity in bands representing protein-bound DNA and free probe was measured by phosphoimager (Molecular Imager System, Bio-Rad). The dissociation constant (K d) was calculated from these data as the negative reciprocal of the slope after results were graphed by Scatchard plot analysis.

Graded amounts of recombinant bacterial C/EBPδ protein were preincubated for 15 min with poly(dI-dC) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, followed by the addition of labeled probe (4.0 × 105 cpm/sample) and incubation for 60 min on ice. The reaction mixture was then treated with DNase I (final concentration 0.23 μg/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) in 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 mmCaCl2 for 1 min at 25 °C. Nuclease treatment was terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA, 200 mmNaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 10 μg of yeast transfer RNA, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were analyzed after electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel and autoradiography for 16 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Methylation interference assays were performed by published methods (34Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 35Treisman R.

The Hb was shown to be composed of six major subunit chain species (designated as DHbA to DHbF). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of DHbA, DHbB, DHbC, and DHbF are different from one another, indicating that at least four Hb genes are present in D. magna. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of DHbD and DHbE are the same as those of DHbA and DHbB, respectively. The six Hb chains were also found in the animal reared under normoxia in small amounts and with altered composition; the extent of decrease under normoxia was higher in the amounts of DHbC, DHbD, and DHbF than those of others. These results indicate that the Hb genes are differentially regulated by the ambient oxygen concentration. Four Hb genes constituting a cluster in the order,dhb4, dhb3, dhb1, anddhb2, were found on the chromosome of D. magna. The complete nucleotide sequences of the dhb1,dhb2, and dhb3 genes and their cDNAs showed that the genes have a seven-exon, six-intron structure. The structure consists of an intron separating an exon encoding a secretory signal sequence, two large repeated regions of a three-exon, two-intron structure that encode each a domain containing a heme-binding site, and an intron bridging the two repeated regions. The deduced amino acid sequences of the gene products showed higher than 79% identity to one another and showed unique features conserved in D. magna Hb chains. The analysis also suggested that DHbB (or DHbE), DHbF, and DHbC are encoded by the dhb1, dhb2, anddhb3 genes, respectively.

Comparative Animal Biochemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 249-287Google Scholar). Their amino acid sequences reveal that the globin fold has been conserved throughout evolution. Vertebrates have intracellular tetrameric Hb of very similar structures. Invertebrate Hb are more diverse in quaternary structure and oxygen binding properties. They are mostly large extracellular proteins classifiable by the number of chains and that of globin domains in each chain. They include single-domain chains organized as single or multiple subunits, two-domain chains arranged as multiple subunits, and multidomain chains, also organized as multiple subunits (2Bunn H.F.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have been isolated and their nucleotide sequences determined. The amino acid sequence of the two-domain extracellular Hb chain of nematode Ascaris suum has been determined by protein chemistry (8Baere D.E. Liu L. Moens L. Beeumen J.V. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The nematode Hb are very unusual: they show the affinity for oxygen 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other Hb. Clam two-domain Hb are also unusual and have disadvantageous properties as oxygen carrier protein: their two oxygen-binding sites can bind oxygen but the resulting oxyhemoglobins undergo very rapid autoxidation and tend to precipitate (9Suzuki T. Shiba M. Furukohri T. Kobayashi M. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 269-281Google Scholar). Physiological roles of these unusual Hb are not clear. Extracellular Hb composed of multiple two-domain chains with relatively normal oxygen binding activity playing important roles in oxygen transport are found in hemolymph of Cladocera, such as water fleasDaphnia magna and Moina macrocopa (10Sugano H. Hoshi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 229: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These animals show a drastic increase in Hb synthesis in response to a decrease in the ambient oxygen concentration, which results in a change in the body color from colorless to red (11Kobayashi M. Nezu T. Tanaka Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1990; 97: 513-517Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), providing an excellent model system for studying the environmental control of gene expression. Although the physiological roles, oxygen binding properties, and quaternary structures of cladoceran Hb have been extensively investigated (11Kobayashi M. Nezu T. Tanaka Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1990; 97: 513-517Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Ilan E. Weisselberg E. Daniel E. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi M. Hoshi T. Zool. Sci. 1984; 1: 523-532Google Scholar), information on their amino acid sequences has been scarce. Only the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the second domain of the M. macrocopa Hb chain has been reported (9Suzuki T. Shiba M. Furukohri T. Kobayashi M. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 269-281Google Scholar). No information about the cladoceran Hb gene was available until recently, when we cloned and analyzed a cDNA encoding a two-domain Hb chain of D. magna (14Tokishita S. Shiga Y. Kimura S. Ohta T. Kobayashi M. Hanazato T. Yamagata H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). D. magna Hb was reported to be composed of 16 polypeptide chains each carrying two heme-binding domains (12Ilan E. Weisselberg E. Daniel E. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the purified Hb was separated into at least six multimeric species on nondenatured isoelectric focusing (15Kobayashi M. Fujiki M. Suzuki T. Physiol. Zool. 1988; 61: 415-419Crossref Google Scholar). These results suggest that D. magna contains several Hb subunit chains giving rise to several multimeric Hb species. No chemical analysis has been done on the subunit chains. In this work, we analyzed the heterogeneity and properties of D. magna Hb chains by separating the chains with the aid of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by determining the nucleotide sequences of their genes and cDNAs. The D. magna strain isolated in Matsuyama, Japan (16Mashiko K. Ito T. Jpn. J. Limnol. 1951; 15: 88-91Crossref Google Scholar) was used. Hb-rich (red) and Hb-poor (pale)D. magna were obtained by rearing animals under hypoxia (1.2 ml of O2/liter of water) and normoxia (4.8 ml of O2/liter of water), respectively, as described previously (17Kobayashi M. Gonoi H. Physiol. Zool. 1985; 58: 190-196Crossref Google Scholar). Frozen animals were homogenized on ice in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm PMSF. After filtration through MIRACLOTH (Calbiochem), the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was bubbled with carbon monoxide gas to convert Hb into the carboxyform and then applied on a DE52 column (Whatman) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The adsorbed Hb was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and bubbled with carbon monoxide gas and then eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions with a red color containing Hb were collected and combined (Hb-containing crude extract). For the purification of Hb, the crude extract prepared from 10.7 g wet weight of red animals was subjected to gel filtration with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmCaCl2 on a column (2.5 cm diameter × 80 cm length) of Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions withA 420/A 280 values higher than 3 were collected. The collected fractions were diluted with an equal volume of water and then applied to a column (1.4 cm diameter × 21 cm length) of DE52. The adsorbed Hb was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–100 mm NaCl in 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2. The fractions eluted at about 40 mm NaCl withA 420/A 280 values higher than 4 were collected and combined. The combined fractions (30 ml) contained 0.087 mg/ml Hb with a purity higher than 95%, as judged from the profile on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. It was concentrated with the aid of a spin column, UFC3TGC00 (Nihon Millipore, Japan) and used as a sample for electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE was performed using 8% separating and 4.5% stacking gels as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described by Burnette (19Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar). For this analysis, rabbit antiserum produced against M. macrocopa Hb and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase were used for detection. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of O'Farrell (20O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 12.5 μl of the sample solution containing D. magna Hb was mixed with 15 mg of urea, 3 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and 1.5 μl each of 40% Byolyte (pH 3–10, Bio-Rad) and 2-mercaptoethanol and then loaded onto a 11-cm isoelectric focusing tube gel consisting of 8 m urea, 4% polyacrylamide, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% Biolyte (pH 3–10), and 1.6% Biolyte (pH 5–8). The bottom buffer (anode) consisted of 10 mm phosphoric acid and the top buffer (cathode) of 20 mm sodium hydroxide. Proteins were focused at 400 V for 12 h, and then at 800 V for 1 h, after which the gel was layered perpendicularly over an SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel consisting of 4.5% stacking and 8% separating gels. A crude extract prepared from red D. magna was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Total Hb content was determined by densitometric analysis of the intensity of the detected bands, using Dual Wavelength Flying Spot Scanning Densitometer CS-9300-PC (Shimadzu Corp., Japan). Hb purified from red D. magna was used as a control. The intensity was proportional to the amount of Hb within the range of amounts used. Hb chain composition was determined also by densitometric analysis of Hb chains after separation of them by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified Hb and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Content of each Hb chain in red animals was calculated from the total Hb content and the Hb chain composition thus determined. Content of each Hb chain in pale animals was calculated from the determined content in red animals and the ratio of intensity of each chain detected after Western blotting of the crude extract prepared from pale animals to that detected after Western blotting of the crude extract prepared from red animals. Hb chains separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were transferred to a PVDF membrane and then their NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined as described by Matsudaira (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a protein sequencer, Applied Biosystems model 477A-120A. For the detection of Cys residues, the pyridylethylation method described by Cavins and Friedman (22Cavins J.F. Friedman M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was used. Insulin B chain (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) containing Cys at the 7th position from its NH2 terminus was used in a control experiment. The construction of a cDNA expression library and the isolation of clones carrying cDNAs for Hb chains were described previously (14Tokishita S. Shiga Y. Kimura S. Ohta T. Kobayashi M. Hanazato T. Yamagata H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the 5′ region of the DHb2 cDNA was truncated, the sequence was extended by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). Total cDNA prepared from redD. magna and oligonucleotides, 5′-GGTTCTTTAAGGTCTTTGAT-3′ and 5′-GAGAATGCCGGTGCTTTCCT-3′, were used as a template and specific primers, respectively. Various restriction fragments obtained from the cDNA clones were subcloned into the M13 mp10, mp11, and pUC119 vectors (23Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar) and then their nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ABI-377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). The sequencing was performed for the entire lengths of both strands, and all the ends of the restriction fragments used overlapped with one another. Manipulation of DNA was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) except where otherwise noted. 4.2 g wet weight of animals frozen in liquid nitrogen was ground in a prechilled mortar with a pestle and then suspended in 15 ml of extraction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.4), 300 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). The suspension was supplemented with proteinase K (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) to 50 μg/ml and then incubated for 9 h at 50 °C (proteinase K was added at 4 h to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml). After the incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was extracted three times with an equal volume of phenol at room temperature (30 min, overnight, and 30 min, respectively), and then extracted once with a mixture of chloroform, phenol, and isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with ethanol and then dissolved in 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm EDTA and 1% SDS. The solution was supplemented with proteinase K to 100 μg/ml, incubated for 6 h at 50 °C, and then extracted with phenol and a mixture of chloroform, phenol, and isoamyl alcohol as described above. DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 2.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmEDTA, and then purified by equilibrium centrifugation in a CsCl gradient. The yield was 12 μg/g wet weight of D. magna. The genomic DNA fragments,a to e shown in Fig. 5, were amplified by PCR using a TaKaRa LA PCR Kit Version 2 (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). 250 ng of D. magna DNA was used as a template. The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-GGAAGCTTCGCCAAATTCGCT-3′ and 5′-CAAAATTTGTTTGCTACGATC-3′ (for amplification of fragment a), 5′-GGCCGG-TTTGAACGTCGTCAT-3′ and 5′-TTCGATCGCAATTCGTACG-3′ (for amplification of fragment b), 5′-GGAAGCTTCGCCAAATTCGCTAATG-3′ and 5′-CGACGCGTTCAGTTGGTTGGCCATC-3′ (for amplification of fragment c), 5′-CGCAATTCTACGGAAGAGCATC-3′ and 5′-TTTGAGTGCCACGTTTGAAT-3′ (for amplification of fragment d), and 5′-AAATTCAAACGTGGCACTCA-3′ and 5′-CCATTAGCCGAGGTTGAAAT-3′ (for amplification of fragment e). The nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments were directly determined with a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Hb was purified from D. magna reared under hypoxia (red). Total amount of Hb contained in red animals was determined to be 3 mg/g wet weight of animals by Western blotting analysis of the crude extract using the purified Hb as a standard. To determine whether D. magna contains heterogeneous Hb chains or not, the purified Hb was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Six predominant spots were found on the gel (Fig.1 A, denoted asA–F). Hb chains constituting the six spots were designated as DHbA to DHbF, respectively, and further analyzed. Although minor spots were found at the basic side of spot A, and the acidic side of spots D, E, and F, they have not been characterized. Composition of the six major Hb chains was determined by a densitometric analysis of Fig.1 A and then the content of each chain in red animals was calculated. The amounts of DHbA to DHbD were about two times higher than those of DHbE and DHbF (Table I). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the six Hb chains were determined after blotting them onto a PVDF membrane (Fig.1 B). All of the determined sequences contained unusual repeats of Thr clusters with a Val in between. The sequences of DHbA and DHbB were the same as those of DHbD and DHbE, respectively. The sequences of DHbA (or DHbD), DHbB (or DHbE), DHbC, and DHbF were different from one another, indicating that at least four Hb chain species produced from different genes are present in D. magna. The first residues of DHbB, DHbE, and DHbF could not be determined by the phenyl-isothiocyanate method of Edman (25Edman P. Acta Chem. Scand. 1956; 10: 761-768Crossref Google Scholar) employed here, suggesting that they are Cys. These NH2-terminal Cys were confirmed by comparison of the amino acid sequences with the nucleotide sequences of cDNAs, as described below.Table IHb chains contained in D. magna reared under normoxia and hypoxiaHb chainsDHbADHbBDHbCDHbDDHbEDHbFAmounts (μg)/g wet weight of animals reared under:HypoxiaaCalculated from total Hb content determined by Western blotting of the crude extract and Hb chain composition determined by densitometric analysis of Hb chains stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified Hb (see “Experimental Procedures”).570570610640330280NormoxiabCalculated from the relative intensity of each spot detected by Western blotting of Hb chains after separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the crude extract based on Hb chain contents in red animals determined as above (see “Experimental Procedures”).6011030306020Rate of inductioncHypoxia values divided by normoxia values.9.55.220215.514a Calculated from total Hb content determined by Western blotting of the crude extract and Hb chain composition determined by densitometric analysis of Hb chains stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified Hb (see “Experimental Procedures”).b Calculated from the relative intensity of each spot detected by Western blotting of Hb chains after separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the crude extract based on Hb chain contents in red animals determined as above (see “Experimental Procedures”).c Hypoxia values divided by normoxia values. Open table in a new tab Hb-containing crude extracts prepared from D. magna reared under hypoxia (red) and normoxia (pale) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and then the Hb chains separated on the gel were detected by Western blot analysis. The pattern of spots obtained with the extract prepared from red animals (Fig. 2 A) was essentially the same as that shown in Fig. 1 A. This indicates that the antiserum used in this analysis recognized all of the heterogeneousD. magna Hb chains. The efficiencies of recognition seemed to differ depending on Hb chain species. For example, the intensity of spot E seems to be nearly equal to those of spots A–D in Fig. 2 A, while its intensity was about half of the spotsA–D when the spots were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1 A). The six Hb chains were detected with altered composition when the extract prepared from pale animals was analyzed (Fig. 2 B), clearly showing that the Hb chain composition was affected by the ambient oxygen concentration. It must be noted that the extract used in the analysis shown in Fig. 2 B corresponds to seven times larger amount of animals compared with that used in the analysis shown in Fig. 2 A. Although the efficiency of detection in Western blotting analysis differs depending on Hb chain species, the amounts in pale animals of each Hb chain could be roughly calculated from the ratio of intensity of each spot compared between Fig. 2 A and B, on the basis of the amount of each chain in red animals determined by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). As shown in TableI, all Hb chains were up-regulated by hypoxia. The amounts of the three Hb chains, DHbC, DHbD, and DHbF, were relatively smaller than those of other chains under normoxia and highly increase (14–21-fold) under hypoxia, while other chains show 5–10-fold increase under hypoxia. Total amount of Hb chains in pale animals was 110 of that in red animals (0.3 mg/g wet weight of animals). We previously isolated 11 clones that carry cDNAs of about 1.2 kb length encoding D. magna Hb chains, one of which was analyzed (λ-DHb1) (14Tokishita S. Shiga Y. Kimura S. Ohta T. Kobayashi M. Hanazato T. Yamagata H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On analyzing the other 10 clones, we found two clones containing new species of Hb cDNAs. The entire nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs contained by the two clones, designated as λ-DHb2 and λ-DHb3, have been determined. The nucleotide sequences of the λ-DHb2 and λ-DHb3 cDNAs showed 79.4 and 86.6% identity, respectively, with that of λ-DHb1 cDNA. Fig. 3 compares the deduced amino acid sequences of the Hb chains, DHb1, DHb2, and DHb3, encoded by the three cDNAs. Both DHb2 and DHb3 had a signal peptide-like sequence at their NH2 terminus and a two-domain structure similar to DHb1. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the predicted mature forms of DHb1, DHb2, and DHb3 exactly matched the above described NH2-terminal sequences of DHbB (or DHbE), DHbF, and DHbC, respectively. The calculated molecular weights of the mature forms of DHb2 and DHb3 were 36,177 and 36,217, respectively, which was very close to that of DHb1 (36,228). Several key amino acids that are invariant in all or most Hb from other organisms and required for functional heme binding are conserved in each of the two domains. The identities of the amino acid sequences between DHb1 and DHb2 and DHb1 and DHb3 are 83.1 and 92.4%, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the identities of the amino acid sequences among the Hb domains of invertebrates containing two-domain Hb chains. The reported identity between the amino acid sequences of the Hb domains of invertebrates belonging to different genera is generally low (less than 21% identity), while that between the amino acid sequences of two domains of the same Hb chain is much higher (60 to 80%; Fig. 4, underlined). A unique feature conserved in D. magna Hb chains is that the identity between the amino acid sequences of the first and second domains, either in the same chain or in different chains, is exceptionally low (21–24%; Fig. 4, shadowed), while the identity between the amino acid sequences of the corresponding domains in different chains (D1/D1 or D2/D2) is high (78–92%).Figure 4Percentage identity between the amino acid sequences of various invertebrate Hb domains. The amino acid sequences corresponding to that from Ser20 to Lys175 of DHb1 shown in Fig. 3 are compared.

Five genomic fragments, a to e, were amplified. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments showed that there are four Hb genes (designated as dhb1 todhb4) on the D. magna chromosome in the same direction and in the order of dhb4, dhb3,dhb1, and dhb2, with very short intergenic regions of a few kb (Fig. 5 A).dhb1, dhb2, and dhb3 are the genes for the cDNAs carried by λ-DHb1, λ-DHb2, λ-DHb3, respectively. A fragment containing the 3′ region of the dhb4 gene was fortuitously amplified by using a 5′ primer whose sequence was conserved in the three cDNAs. Amplification of DNA fragments containing the 5′ region of the dhb4 gene was unsuccessful. The sequences of the dhb1, dhb2, anddhb3 genes, compared with their cDNAs, showed that they have a seven-exon, six-intron structure (Fig. 5 B). A similar structure was reported for the gene of a two-domain Hb chain in the clam, B. reeveana (5Naito Y. Riggs C.K. Vandergon T.L. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6672-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An intron bridging the two large repeated regions is conserved in both organisms. The organizations of the two large repeated regions encoding the two heme-binding domains are similar in both organisms, having the three-exon, two-intron structure characteristic of animal Hb genes (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Aner J. Lawn R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1980; 14: 45-178Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the first intron located in the 5′-untranslated region of theB. reeveana gene, the first intron separates an exon encoding a secretory signal sequence in D. magna Hb genes. The lengths of introns were much shorter in D. magna genes (less than 100 bp on average), which, together with the short lengths of the intergenic regions, makes the gene cluster very compact. The positions of introns were perfectly conserved in the three Hb genes. Several sequences homologous to the octameric binding motif (TACGTGCT, underlined nucleotides were forced to be conserved) for mammalian hypoxia inducible factor-1, HIF-1 (27Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), were found in each of the intergenic regions (Fig. 5 A). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of Hb purified from D. magna clearly demonstrated that the animal contains six chemically different Hb chains, while analyses of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of Hb chains and the genomic DNA sequences only confirmed the presence of four Hb genes. Analysis is in progress to determine whether each Hb chain constitutes a homomultimeric Hb or Hb chains are mixed and constitute heteromultimeric Hb. It is not clear at present whether DHbA and DHbB are the products of the same genes as those for DHbD and DHbE, respectively, showing different migration on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis due to post-translational modification, or they are the products of different genes having the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequences. D. magnamay contain more than four Hb genes, or it may contain only four Hb genes giving rise to six Hb chain species through some post-translational modification. Assuming that the latter is the case, one of the possible sites of modification is the NH2-terminal Cys of DHbB, DHbE, and DHbF. Detection of these NH2-terminal Cys after pyridylethylation of their sulfhydryl groups (22Cavins J.F. Friedman M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was unsuccessful, while Cys in the insulin B chain was clearly detected in a control experiment. The sulfhydryl groups of these Cys might have undergone some modification that blocks pyridylethylation. In our previous work (14Tokishita S. Shiga Y. Kimura S. Ohta T. Kobayashi M. Hanazato T. Yamagata H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), red D. magna was shown to contain a more than 12 times higher amount of Hb mRNA as compared with pale animals. The differential up-regulation by hypoxia of Hb chains demonstrated here is possibly a result of the transcriptional control of Hb genes. Post-translational modification of Hb chains, if any, may also be affected by hypoxia. Oxygen-responsive genes are found in a broad range of organisms, from bacteria to humans, and investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying their regulation is one of the important and rapid-growing fields in current molecular physiology (27Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The analysis of the cis-elements and trans-acting factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of Hb genes in D. magna is of particular interest. HIF-1 is a trans-acting factor playing a critical role in the hypoxic induction of several physiologically important genes in mammalian cells (27Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of HIF-1 binding motifs found in the intergenic regions of theD. magna Hb gene cluster is in progress. The amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the cloned cDNAs show unique features of D. magna Hb chains. The exceptionally low identity between the amino acid sequences of the first and second domains suggests that the duplication of a single-domain Hb gene in D. magna occurred a very long time ago and then the resulting two single-domain Hb genes fused to form a two-domain Hb gene. The multiplication of the two-domain Hb gene seems to have occurred relatively recently, because the identity of the amino acid sequences as a whole between different chains is high. Supporting this notion, phylogenetic analysis showed that the first domains and second domains of D. magna Hb chains constitute different clusters (Fig. 6). The three-exon, two-intron structure encoding the two domains is conserved in allD. magna Hb genes, further indicating the dominance of this structure among animal globin genes (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Aner J. Lawn R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1980; 14: 45-178Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Another unique feature conserved in D. magna Hb chains is the presence of an unusual NH2-terminal extension. This extension is reminiscent of the COOH-terminal extension found in the two-domain Hb chain of a parasitic nematode, A. suum, containing a repeat of the sequence, Glu-Glu-His-Lys (8Baere D.E. Liu L. Moens L. Beeumen J.V. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This extension, named the polar zipper sequence, was proposed to be joined in an eight-stranded β barrel at the center of the molecule. The repeated Thr clusters and a Val residue in between them in the NH2-terminal extension of D. magna Hb chains may also play a role in the multimerization of 16 subunit chains to yield a functional Hb molecule through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions of the side chains of Thr and Val, respectively."

These two factors together form the core of the mRNA-binding complex, designated eIF4F. Higher plants have two such complexes: eIF4F, which is homologous to the mammalian complex, and eIFiso4F, which is ∼10-fold more abundant (4Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol.

Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, despite this substantial divergence, these two factors have very similar functions (1Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Either factor alone is sufficient for cap-dependent initiation in vitro (7Lax S.R. Fritz W. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The eIF4G and eIFiso4G subunits of the mRNA-binding complexes act as a central scaffold for binding of other translation factors, proteins, co-factors, and RNAs. These include binding sites within mammalian eIF4G for eIF4E (aa 409–457) (9Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), eIF3 (aa 480–886) (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Plant eIFiso4G also binds eIFiso4E near its N terminus (aa 52–90) (12Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in a small region with sequence homology to the mammalian factor. Binding of eIF4G and eIFiso4G to RNAs, distinct from the cap recognition function of the intact complex, has been demonstrated by several laboratories and appears to play a critical role in the cap-independent initiation of viral RNAs. Sha et al. (13Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) calculated the equilibrium binding constants of recombinant wheat eIFiso4G for both capped and uncapped mRNAs. They found that the binding constants for uncapped message were comparable to those of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F for capped mRNA, clearly indicating that the large subunit also binds mRNA efficiently and that it does not discriminate between capped and uncapped messages. These findings are consistent with the role of eIF4G in the cap-independent translation of viral mRNAs, following cleavage and loss of the eIF4E binding domain by viral proteases (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar,14Ohlmann T. Rau M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In functional assays for initiation complex formation, Pestovaet al. (15Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) have shown that only eIF4A and the central third of human eIF4G (aa 457–932) are required for binding of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA to 43 S ribosomal complexes, and that this central eIF4G peptide binds, and cross-links to, the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Wheat eIF4F and eIFiso4F were also reported to bind poly(A) mRNA (16Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which implies that the cap-binding complex interacts with both the 5′ and 3′ termini of intact mRNAs, perhaps ensuring that only intact messages are translated. The binding of eIFiso4G to other proteins, in addition to translation factors, has also been reported. The N-terminal region of eIFiso4G appears to bind poly(A)-binding protein (17Le H. Tanguay R.L.

Additionally, recombinant wheat eIFiso4G binds to, and promotes the bundling of microtubules in vitro, and co-localizes with microtubules in vivo, suggesting a role for eIFiso4F in localizing the translational machinery to the cytoskeleton (18Bokros C.L.

The specific sites and structural motifs in eIFiso4G or eIF4G that mediate most of these RNA and protein interactions have not yet been identified. In this study, we have used limited proteolysis and affinity chromatography to isolate functional domains of the mRNA-binding complexes of wheat. Protease-resistant domains were fractionated by affinity chromatography on phosphocellulose (phosphate interactions), oligo(dT)-cellulose (phosphodiester or base interactions), and m7GTP-sepharose (cap recognition). Peptides eluted from the different affinity columns were purified by reverse phase HPLC, sequenced to determine their N terminus, sized by mass spectrometry, and compared with published sequences of cloned factors to localize each peptide within the primary amino acid sequence. We report here the identification of a central protease-resistant domain in eIFiso4G, which binds both nucleic acids and phosphocellulose. The specific affinities of both intact eIFiso4F and the central domain of eIFiso4G were determined for RNA homopolymers and ss- and dsDNAs. Sequencing grade trypsin and endoproteinase glu-C were from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligo(dT)-cellulose and m7GTP-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphocellulose was from Whatman. Agarose-conjugated poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), poly(U), ssDNA, and dsDNA were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, U. S. Biochemicals, Bio-Rad, or Fisher Scientific. mRNA cap-binding complexes were purified from wheat germ by a modification of the method of Laxet al. (Ref. 19Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; note that eIFiso4G is designated eIF-4B in this reference). Wheat germ (150 g) was ground with 10% each fine sand and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (20Loomis W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 555-563Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), homogenized in four volumes of iced buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 200 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 8.6, 400 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.07 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted through 70 μm nylon mesh, centrifuged 2 h at 368,000 × g, precipitated with 70% ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed against buffer B120 (buffer “B” contains 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerin, and the concentration of KCl, in mm, indicated by the suffix). Material from five or six preparations was adsorbed to a 50-ml m7GTP-Sepharose 4B column, and mRNA cap-binding complexes were eluted with 100 μm m7GTP in B120. Approximately 20 mg of protein was recovered and applied to a 30-ml phosphocellulose column. eIF4A did not bind, and eIFiso4F eluted with a linear salt gradient (B80 to B1000) at approximately 150 mm KCl. Fractions containing eIFiso4F were concentrated and desalted in Centricon-10 spin cartridges (Amicon). Preparations of cap-binding complexes at this stage contained both eIFiso4F and eIF4F, and were used to identify peptides from both complexes which bound to affinity resins (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). In replicates of these experiments and all subsequent binding specificity studies (Figs. 5 and 6 and Tables I and II), eIFiso4F was further purified by HPLC using a DEAE column (Waters AP Mini, 5 × 50 mm) eluted with a linear salt gradient (B80 to B500). At each step, fractions were analyzed for protein content by Bradford assays or spectrophotometry at 280 nm, and by SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) on 10% gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 or silver (22Blum H.

Weber K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Digestion reactions contained 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 30% glycerol, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, cap-binding complexes or purified eIFiso4F (0.6 mg/ml for trypsin or 0.9–1.5 mg/ml for endoproteinase glu-C), and either 1% trypsin or 2% endoproteinase glu-C (by mass, relative to protein sample). Trypsin cleaves on the carboxyl side of arginine and lysine residues, and endoproteinase glu-C cleaves on the carboxyl side of aspartate and glutamate residues. Incubations were at room temperature for the times indicated. Reactions were stopped by freezing in liquid nitrogen, and the cleavage products analyzed on 14% gels by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. For the results reported in Fig. 2, 300–500 μg of digested cap-binding complexes were chromatographed on 2-ml phosphocellulose, oligo(dT)-cellulose, or m7GTP-Sepharose columns, and eluted with a 12-ml linear salt gradient (B100 to B1000). All fractions were analyzed for protein composition by SDS-PAGE on 14% gels with silver staining, and by fluorescence spectroscopy at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 350 nm, respectively. Only selected fractions are shown. Binding studies with ribonucleotide homopolymer and ss and dsDNA resins were carried out in spin columns using 20–100 μg of protein and 100 μl of packed resin in microcentrifuge filter cups (MSI, Westboro, MA; 0.45-μm acetate filters). Solutions (300-μl aliquots) were spun through the resin at 500–1,000 rpm for 2–5 min; at least three washes (nine column volumes) were used at each step. Columns were equilibrated in B50 and eluted sequentially with 0.1, 1, or 4 mm NTPs or dNTPs, 200 μm oligo(dT)6 or oligo(dT)12, or with increased KCl, as indicated. All fractions were analyzed as above, but only selected fractions are shown. eIFiso4F, endoproteinase glu-C digests of eIFiso4F, and purified E31 were chromatographed on all affinity resins at least twice. Proteolytic cleavage products that bound affinity resins were further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (Waters, 3.9 × 150 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was with a linear acetonitrile gradient (0–80%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbance was monitored at 205 nm. Peaks were concentrated in a Centrivap concentrator and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The N-terminal sequence of purified peptides was determined by Edman degradation at the UCR Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility, or at the Stanford Biotechnology Facility. Peptide masses were determined by time of flight mass spectrometry by Curtis Monnig in the Department of Chemistry at UCR, or at the Harvard Biotechnology Facility. The locations of peptides within wheat eIFiso4G and eIFiso4E were determined by comparison with published sequences (Ref. 6Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

Sequence alignments were done using the BestFit program in GCG (29Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar) and refined by hand. Preparations of wheat cap-binding complexes contain eIFiso4F, a small amount of eIF4F, and a trace amount of eIF4A which is bound to eIF4F (Fig.1 left), as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). These preparations were the starting point for identifying peptides from either complex that bound to affinity resins. Purified eIFiso4F (Fig. 1, left) was used in the nucleic acid binding experiments described below. Cap-binding complexes were cleaved into protease-resistant domains by digestion with trypsin or endoproteinase glu-C under native conditions (Fig. 1). Several large peptides were reproducibly generated that withstood even prolonged digestion. After 16 h of incubation with trypsin, two main bands remained, which migrated on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of 28 and 26 kDa. Minor bands between 20 and 24 kDa were more abundant in some preparations. The breakdown pattern generated by endoproteinase glu-C was more complex; approximately 10 protease-resistant bands, with apparent molecular masses between 14 and 31 kDa, were generated in a 9-h digest. Digestion times of 12 h for trypsin and 8 h for endoproteinase glu-C were used in the experiments shown below. In order to identify and purify peptides with specific binding affinities, digests of cap-binding complexes were chromatographed in parallel on phosphocellulose, oligo(dT)-cellulose, and m7GTP-Sepharose. When trypsin digests were applied to phosphocellulose only T28, the largest stable fragment, bound and was eluted from the column in ∼150 mm KCl (Fig.2 top left, lane 4). In contrast, none of the peptides generated by trypsin digestion bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose (Fig. 2 bottom left). The second major band at ∼26 kDa was primarily undigested eIFiso4E, which was resistant to trypsin digestion for up to ∼16 h. It bound to m7GTP-Sepharose (data not shown) and had no affinity for either phosphocellulose or oligo(dT)-cellulose (Fig. 2). This binding pattern was the same as for native eIFiso4E (data not shown). Cap-binding proteins digested with endoproteinase glu-C were chromatographed as above (Fig. 2 right). Major bands with apparent masses of 31, 23, and 22 kDa were retained on phosphocellulose, and eluted in 150–200 mm KCl (Fig. 2 top right, lanes 4 and 5). The two smaller bands were also retained on m7GTP-Sepharose (data not shown), while the 31-kDa band bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose (Fig. 2, bottom) and eluted at ∼150 mm KCl. Further fractionation of the 31-kDa band by RP-HPLC revealed two peptides with very similar size and hydrophobicity, running as a barely resolved doublet on SDS-PAGE, and eluting from a C18 column at only a 1% difference in acetonitrile concentration (Fig.3). Only the larger of these two peptides, corresponding to the second RP-HPLC peak, was present in digests of purified eIFiso4F, and was designated E31. E31 binding to phosphocellulose and oligo(dT)-cellulose was due to its direct interaction with the resins, rather than to a protein:protein interaction with the second peptide, or with one of the other peptides retained on the columns. Purified E31, isolated from digests of purified eIFiso4F by phosphocellulose chromatography and DEAE-HPLC, had the same affinity and elution profile on phosphocellulose and oligo(dT)-cellulose as did E31 in digests (data not shown). Amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to identify those peptides that bound to affinity resins. Seven amino acid residues were sequenced from the N terminus of each fragment; each was sequenced twice from separate purifications, and E31 was sequenced following both phosphocellulose and oligo(dT)-cellulose purification. The C-terminal residues were calculated from the total mass and amino acid composition. T28 and E31 were found to be overlapping peptides from the central portion of eIFiso4G with 242 amino acids, from Gly202 to Glu443, in common (Table I). The additional 32 amino acids at the N terminus of E31, from Gln170 to Arg201 (Fig.4 A), are required for oligo(dT)-cellulose binding activity. This sequence thus appears to form part of a nucleic acid recognition site. The second 31-kDa peptide, present in endoproteinase glu-C digests of cap-binding complexes, originated from eIF4G. Its N-terminal sequence was KKYVVGK, which is located 20 amino acids N-terminal to the second region of homology shared by eIFiso4G and mammalian eIF4G (12Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), beginning at Lys215 in eIFiso4G (Fig. 4 A, Region 2). When the sequences of wheat eIF4G and eIFiso4G were compared in this region, the start site of the eIF4G peptide was seen to lie between those of E31 and T28, and to include only seven of the 32 additional residues present in E31 (Fig. 4 A). There is limited sequence conservation between factors and species in this region, but several short conserved sequences and amino acids are present in almost all of the factors sequenced to date (Fig.4 B). Most prominent are two small charge clusters, corresponding to KAD194 and EKDR209 in eIFiso4G, which flank conserved Trp, Ser, and Arg residues present at the N terminus of the eIF4G peptide. These elements are also present in yeast eIF4G, but are much more widely spaced (Fig. 4 B). Digestion with endoproteinase glu-C produced two peptides of ∼22–23 kDa, which were retained on phosphocellulose (Fig. 2, top right, lanes 4 and 5). These bands were identified as eIFiso4E peptides by their affinity for m7GTP-Sepharose (data not shown), their co-migration with the two main fragments generated by digestion of purified eIFiso4E (data not shown), their intense fluorescence (eIFiso4E has an unusually high tryptophan content), and by sequencing of the smaller peptide, which was designated E21. The N-terminal sequence of E21 was AKGPHKL and its mass was 20,852 Da, corresponding to Ala29–Val209 of eIFiso4E (6Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of the N-terminal 28 amino acids did not alter the affinity of E21 for the cap structure, as determined by fluorescence quenching analysis (data not shown). This finding agrees with results reported by Chavanet al. (30Chavan A.J. Rychlik W. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Watt D.S. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5521-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), who identified a trypsin-resistant core domain in human eIF4E (aa 47–182), which also retained its affinity for m7GTP. Native eIFiso4E does not bind either phosphocellulose or oligo(dT)-cellulose (data not shown), but is retained on both columns when bound to eIFiso4G. Retention of the eIFiso4E peptides on phosphocellulose could thus have resulted from their interaction with E31. This proved not to be the case, however, as purified E21 alone bound to phosphocellulose (data not shown). Apparently the loss of seven Asp and Glu residues from the N terminus leaves several unpaired positive charges, which can interact with phosphate groups. Intact eIFiso4F could not be eluted from oligo(dT)-cellulose by free dNTPs, NTPs, or NMPs, even at concentrations as high as 4 mm (data not shown), but were readily eluted by 200 μm oligo(dT)12 (Fig.5, top). As the concentration of phosphate groups in 4 mm NTP is 5-fold higher than that of the oligo solution, this interaction cannot be due simply to charge. In addition, oligo(dT)6 failed to elute eIFiso4F (Fig. 5,bottom), indicating that the minimum length of the target sequence required for eIFiso4F binding was between 7 and 12 nucleotides. The binding specificities of intact eIFiso4F and E31 were determined for RNA homopolymers and random sequence ss- and dsDNAs (TableII and Fig.6). The binding specificity of purified E31 was the same as for E31 in digests, and in each case where binding occurred, free nucleoside mono or triphosphates failed to elute eIFiso4F or E31 from the columns (Fig. 6 and data not shown). eIFiso4F and E31 bound to poly(G) with the highest affinity, and showed no interaction with poly(C). Unlike eIFiso4F, E31 showed no affinity for poly(U) and weak affinity for poly(A), being retarded on poly(A)-agarose but eluting in the wash fractions (data not shown). T28, which did not bind oligo(dT) (Fig. 2), also did not bind poly(G) (data not shown). These results indicate that the central domain of eIFiso4G mediates binding of the eIFiso4F complex to poly(G), oligo(dT), and phosphocellulose, and that this domain recognizes both single- and double-stranded sequences. The lack of interaction of E31 with poly(A) and poly(U) suggests that these lower affinity binding sites lie outside of the central domain. However, it is possible that these nucleic acids are also bound by the central domain, but that additional sequences located elsewhere in the molecule are required to stabilize their interactions. We have shown that wheat eIFiso4G contains an endoproteinase glu-C-resistant structural core, which binds nucleic acids with base specificity and poly(G) with highest affinity. This domain is centrally located in eIFiso4G, and spans four of the six small regions of homology it shares with mammalian eIF4G (Fig.7) (1Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A corresponding domain from eIF4G was also purified, and our results suggest that it has many of the same properties; it was resistant to endoproteinase glu-C digestion, bound oligo(dT)-cellulose and phosphocellulose, migrated closely with E31 on SDS gels, and had very similar hydrophobicity. The N-terminal end of the nucleic acid recognition site in eIFiso4G lies within Gln170–Arg201, because the shorter tryptic peptide (T28) lacks these 32 residues and fails to bind nucleic acids. Only the later third of this sequence is conserved among eIF4G factors, and only the last seven amino acids, corresponding to Val195–Arg201 of eIFiso4G, are also present in the eIF4G peptide (Fig. 4). This suggests that the N-terminal end of the nucleic acid binding site lies within these seven residues, which form part of an additional short block of homology centered at the N terminus of the tryptic peptide (Figs. 4 B and 7). This sequence, from Lys192 to Arg209, is ∼50% similar in eIF4G isoforms from all species, a comparable level of homology to the other six conserved regions (1Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Further studies of purified eIF4G are required to define structural and functional properties of its central domain. The central third of eIF4G is known to have several important functions. First, Pestova et al. (15Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) have shown that eIF4A and the central third of eIF4G are alone sufficient for cap-independent initiation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA, and that the eIF4G fragment cross-links to the viral IRES. The wheat eIF4G and eIFiso4G core domains identified here would be included in this larger 476-amino acid fragment, and could be involved in IRES recognition or binding. Second, it has been known for some time that chromatography of cap-binding proteins on phosphocellulose depletes the complex of eIF4A. The extent to which this occurs varies between laboratories. We have found that, for the plant factors, eIF4F is substantially depleted of eIF4A, while eIFiso4F is completely stripped of eIF4A, both on phosphocellulose (Fig. 1) and oligo(dT)-cellulose (data not shown). Why the binding of eIFiso4G to eIF4A and phosphocellulose should be mutually exclusive was not clear, given the lack of overlap in their recognition sites (Fig. 7); the eIF4A binding site on wheat eIFiso4G was mapped to the N terminus of the molecule by Metz and Browning (12Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using eIFiso4G deletion constructs expressed in a yeast two-hybrid system. In contrast, two eIF4A binding domains have now been identified in mammalian eIF4G, one in the C-terminal third of the molecule (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and a second in the central third (11Imataka H. Sonenberg H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Only the eIF4A binding site in the central third of eIF4G is conserved in eIFiso4G, and mutations in this sequence of the mammalian factor abolished eIF4A binding activity (11Imataka H. Sonenberg H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This site corresponds to the second block of homology shared by eIF4G and eIFiso4G (Fig. 4, Region 2; Fig. 7). As RNA recognition motifs are typically 50–100 amino acids long (31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), the eIF4A and nucleic acid binding sites may well overlap, with the loss of eIF4A during chromatography resulting from direct competition. This has interesting implications for the mode of action of the mRNA cap-binding complexes, which perhaps deliver eIF4A to the message, and then bind mRNA directly through the same site to stabilize the preinitiation complex. Third, Lamphear et al. (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) have shown that a ∼407-amino acid peptide from the central third of eIF4G binds to eIF3 (Fig. 7). Further proteolysis, resulting in the removal of ∼50 amino acids from the C terminus of the peptide, abolished this activity. Thus, at least part of the eIF3 recognition sequence in the mammalian factor lies carboxyl to and outside of the core domain defined here, while the nucleic acid binding site in both plant factors begins at the N-terminal boundary of this structural core. Based on these observations, it seems unlikely that these two sites overlap. Finally, one can speculate on why a translation factor involved in the binding and recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes should also bind ss- and dsDNA. Such dual specificity in RNA-binding proteins is not unusual, and may have no biological significance. However, several examples of RNA-binding proteins that recognize specific DNA sequences have now come to light (32Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Matunis M.J. Michael W.M Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cap-binding translation factors may also have multiple functions. eIF4E has been found localized to the nucleus in both mammalian (35Lejbkowicz F. Goyer C. Darveau A. Neron S. Lemieux R. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9612-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (36Lang V. Zanchin N.I. Lunsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it appears to regulate the expression of cyclin D1 at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (37Rosenwald I.B.

In simian sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (SSV-NIH 3T3 cells), a fraction of CRSBP-1 was demonstrated at the cell surface and underwent internalization/recycling as revealed by cell surface 125I labeling and its resistance/sensitivity to trypsin digestion. However, the majority of CRSBP-1 was localized in intracellular compartments as evidenced by the resistance of most of the35S-metabolically labeled CRSBP-1 to trypsin digestion, and by indirect immunofluorescent staining. CRSBP-1 appeared to form complexes with proteolytically processed forms (generated at and/or after the trans-Golgi network) of the v-sis gene product and with a ∼140-kDa proteolytically cleaved form of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-type receptor, as demonstrated by metabolic labeling and co-immunoprecipitation. CRSBP-1, like the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor, underwent rapid turnover which was blocked in the presence of 100 μm suramin. In normal and other transformed NIH 3T3 cells, CRSBP-1 was relatively stable and did not undergo rapid turnover and internalization/recycling at the cell surface. These results suggest that in SSV-NIH 3T3 cells, CRSBP-1 interacts with and forms ternary and binary complexes with the newly synthesized v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor at the trans-Golgi network and that the stable binary (CRSBP-1·v-sis gene product) complex is transported to the cell surface where it presents the v-sis gene product to unoccupied PDGF β-type receptors during internalization/recycling.

The cell surface retention of secretory proteins is hypothesized to be mediated by high-affinity cell surface-binding sites which have been recently identified by binding and cross-linking of 125I-labeled peptides containing the CRS motifs of platelet-derived growth factor-B (c-sis gene product) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (8Boensch C.

CRSBP-1 is a major binding protein for CRS peptides which is expressed in all cell types thus far examined including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (8Boensch C.

Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product appeared to facilitate its binding to the PDGF receptor at the cell surface of SSV-transformed cells (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The c-sis gene product (PDGF-B), the cellular homologue of the v-sis gene product, was subsequently shown to undergo this novel secretion process and its major structural determinant (CRS) was localized near its C terminus (2Östman A. Andersson M. Betsholtz C. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Deletion of this major CRS in the PDGF-B molecule diminished its cell surface retention and enhanced its secretion but did not affect the transforming activity of the c-sis gene product as measured by an in vitrofoci assay (6LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This strongly argued that the major CRS was not absolutely required for the transforming activity of the c-sis gene product. However, the in vitro foci assay used to determine the transforming activity of the c-sis gene product did not yield information concerning its tumorigenicity. Furthermore, the c-sis gene product may contain other minor or cryptic CRSs which contribute to partial cell surface retention even after deletion of the major CRS near its C terminus (2Östman A.

The ER and Golgi complex interactions of the PDGF β-type receptor and v-sis or c-sis gene product result in the rapid turnover of both proteins (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Keating M.T. Williams L.T. Science. 1988; 239: 914-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A fraction of the newly synthesized v-sis or c-sis gene product, which does not interact with the PDGF β-type receptor in these intracellular compartments, is secreted and retained at the cell surface (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell surface-retained v-sis or c-sis gene product is then efficiently transferred to unoccupied cell surface PDGF β-type receptors (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that CRSBP-1 is responsible for cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product, we investigated the interactions of CRSBP-1 with the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor in SSV-transformed cells. If CRSBP-1 is able to present the v-sis gene product to the PDGF β-type receptor at the cell surface and/or in intracellular compartments (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CRSBP-1 should have the potential to form complexes with the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor in SSV-transformed cells. In this article, we demonstrate that the majority of CRSBP-1 is present in intracellular compartments (endosomes/prelysosomal compartments and TGN) of SSV-NIH 3T3 cells and normal NIH 3T3 cells. CRSBP-1 forms complexes with the v-sis product in SSV-NIH 3T3 cells as demonstrated by metabolic labeling and co-immunoprecipitation. CRSBP-1 also forms complexes specifically with a ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor which represents an activated (phosphorylated) and proteolytically cleaved form of the PDGF β-type receptor as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation/immunocomplex phosphorylation analysis. Like the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor, CRSBP-1 undergoes rapid turnover which can be blocked by suramin. The cell surface CRSBP-1 exhibits ligand-dependent internalization and recycling. These results raise the possibility that CRSBP-1 may play an important role in the autocrine growth of SSV-transformed cells. The finding of a proteolytically cleaved form (identified as a ∼140-kDa phosphorylated protein) of the PDGF β-type receptor specifically complexed with CRSBP-1 suggests a novel mechanism of signal transduction in autocrine growth.DISCUSSIONCRSBP-1 is expressed in all cell types thus far examined and appears to be a major cell surface binding protein for125I-labeled CRS peptides (8Boensch C. Kuo M.D. Connolly D.T. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The intracellular and cell surface localization and broad pH ligand binding activity of CRSBP-1 allow CRSBP-1 to function as a ligand-specific transport protein trafficking between intracellular organelles (TGN) and the plasma membrane. Interestingly, in contrast to other transport proteins (low density lypoprotein receptor, transferrin receptor, and mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor) (34Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 35Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), CRSBP-1 undergoes ligand-dependent internalization and recycling at the cell surface. This ligand-dependent internalization and recycling is supported by the following evidence: 1) the internalization and recycling of CRSBP-1 occurs in cells expressing the ligand v-sis gene product (SSV-NIH 3T3 cells and SSV-NRK cells) but not in other cell types, including transformed cells, and 2) suramin, a potent inhibitor of the ligand binding activity of CRSBP-1 (8Boensch C. Kuo M.D. Connolly D.T. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), abolishes the internalization and recycling of CRSBP-1 in v-sis-transformed cells. The mechanism of this ligand-dependent internalization and recycling is not known. We hypothesize that the ligand v-sis gene product stimulates internalization and recycling of CRSBP-1 by inducing dimerization or oligomerization of CRSBP-1 through its homodimer structure. This is supported by the observation that a disulfide-linked dimer of CRSBP-1 was detected only in cells expressing the v-sis gene product but not in normal NIH 3T3 cells.Several lines of evidence suggest that the v-sis gene product interacts with CRSBP-1 in SSV-NIH 3T3 cells. These include: 1) the v-sis gene products p44 and p36, which are generated by proteolysis at and/or after TGN were co-immunoprecipitated with antiserum to CRSBP-1. This is consistent with the observation that the majority of CRSBP-1 is localized in TGN and endosomes/prelysosomal compartments. 2) CRSBP-1 only underwent rapid turnover in cells expressing the v-sis gene product, and 3) suramin, which is known to enter and accumulate in TGN and endosomes/prelysosomal compartments (37Huang S.S. Koh H.A. Huang J.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Baghdiguian S. Boudier J.L. Boudier J.A. Fantini J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 525-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar), blocked the intracellular turnover of CRSBP-1 as it blocked the intracellular turnover of the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Autocrine transformation by the v-sis gene product involves the activation of the PDGF β-type receptor by the v-sisgene product during routing of both ligand and the receptor from the ER to plasma membranes or extracellular compartment (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that CRSBP-1, which is mainly localized in TGN and endosomes/prelysosomal compartments, may form a transient ternary complex with the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor in these compartments (Fig. 8). This hypothesis is supported by the following evidence: 1) CRSBP-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the v-sis gene products proteolytically generated at and/or after TGN and the ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor in SSV-NIH 3T3 cells but not in normal and other transformed NIH 3T3 cells which do not express the v- or c-sis gene product. The ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor is an intracellular product of SSV-NIH 3T3 cells and resistant to trypsin digestion (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Boensch, C. (1998) Ph. D. Thesis, St. Louis University.Google Scholar). 2) Suramin treatment of SSV-NIH 3T3 cells blocked the co-immunoprecipitation of CRSBP-1 and the v-sis gene product or the ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor (33.Boensch, C. (1998) Ph. D. Thesis, St. Louis University.Google Scholar). Suramin has been recently shown to enter TGN and endosomes/prolysosome compartments of SSV-NIH 3T3 cells and other cell types (37Huang S.S. Koh H.A. Huang J.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Baghdiguian S. Boudier J.L. Boudier J.A. Fantini J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 525-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and 3) all three proteins (CRSBP-1, the v-sis gene product and the PDGF β-type receptor) exhibited rapid turnover in cells expressing these proteins. No turnover of the PDGF β-type receptor and CRSBP-1 was observed in cells lacking expression of the v-sis gene product (e.g. normal and other transformed NIH 3T3 cells). CRSBP-1 exhibits broad pH activity for ligand binding (8Boensch C. Kuo M.D. Connolly D.T. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). pH 6.0–6.5 (the luminal pH of TGN and exocytic vessicles) is not optimal for binding of the v-sis gene product to the PDGF β-type receptor. However, it is possible that these slightly acidic pH environments would not have significant effects on the transfer of the v-sis gene product from the occupied CRSBP-1 to the PDGF β-type receptor. CRSBP-1 may play an important role in the interaction of the v-sis gene product and the PDGF β-type receptor in the lumen of TGN and exocytic vessicles especially under non-overexpression conditions.The ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor which was co-immunoprecipitated with CRSBP-1 was previously identified by 32P-metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation using antiserum to the PDGF β-type receptor in SSV-NIH 3T3 cells (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor is a proteolytically cleaved product of the 180-kDa form (mature form) of the PDGF β-type receptor which was resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion but sensitive to endoglycosidase F digestion (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 The endoglycosidase F digestion of the ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor yielded a product of molecular weight (∼120,000) which is smaller than that (molecular mass ∼140,000) of the endoglycosidase F-digested 180-kDa PDGF β-type receptor (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 Compared with the 180- and 160-kDa PDGF β-type receptors, this ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor appeared to have a high phosphorylation activity (>10 fold) based on the estimation of the ratio of [32P]orthophosphate/[35S]methionine metabolic labeling (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor was only found in v-sis-transformed cells (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), it may play an important role in mediating the signal transduction involved in the autocrine transformation of SSV-NIH 3T3 cells.The mechanism for the production of the ∼140-kDa PDGF β-type receptor is unknown. We hypothesize that some of CRSBP-1 molecules at TGN form a transient ternary complex with the newly synthesized v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor and that some of CRSBP-1 molecules form a binary complex with the v-sisgene product (Fig. 8). The PDGF β-type receptor in the ternary complex undergoes proteolysis at its ligand-binding domain to produce the ∼140-kDa form which is identified on SDS-polyacrylamide gel following immunoprecipitation with antiserum to a C-terminal region of the PDGF β-type receptor. However, the whole molecule of the proteolytically cleaved PDGF β-type receptor is held together by noncovalent forces and associates tightly with the v-sisgene product and CRSBP-1. The proteolytically cleaved PDGF β-type receptor which possesses potent kinase activity may be stabilized at the TGN in complexes with CRSBP-1 and v-sis gene product. In contrast, the CRSBP-1·v-sis gene product binary complex is transported to the cell surface, where it presents the v-sisgene product to unoccupied PDGF β-type receptors during its cell surface internalization and recycling (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). During transport through exocytotic vesicles which have acidic luminal pH, the CRSBP-1·v-sis gene product binary complex is stable (8Boensch C. Kuo M.D. Connolly D.T. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Recently, Valgeirsdóttir et al. (30Valgeirsdóttir S. Eriksson A. Nistér M. Heldin C.H. Westermark B.

Their analysis of a panel of known PDGF β-receptor signaling molecules revealed the presence of suramin-sensitive and -insensitive pathways of PDGF receptor-mediated signaling (30Valgeirsdóttir S.
