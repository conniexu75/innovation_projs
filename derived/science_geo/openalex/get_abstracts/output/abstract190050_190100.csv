The yellow compound obtained by treating tyramine with nitroso- naphthol has been isolated. Analysis indicates it to be the product of combination of 1 mole equivalent of each with the loss of 1 mole of water. 3. This reaction has been applied to the determination of tyrosine and tyramine in tissues and to the determination of tyrosine in protein hy- drolysates. 4. New determinations of the tyrosine content of bovine serum albumin and of lysozyme are reported. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Gerngross, O., Voss, K., and Herfelt, T., Ber. chem. Ges., 66, 435 (1933). 2.

The pathophysiology of these processes is unclear. We have documented the induction of the primary cytokine responsible for osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), in T cells exposed to soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. Using a murine osteoclast precursor cell line as well as primary human osteoclast precursors, we demonstrate that pharmacologic levels of two PIs that are linked clinically to osteopenia, ritonavir and saquinavir, abrogate a physiological block to RANKL activity, interferon-γ-mediated degradation of the RANKL signaling adapter protein, TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 6) in proteasomes. In contrast, indinavir and nelfinavir, PIs that may promote or stabilize bone formation in vivo, had no impact on this system. These findings offer a molecular basis for the acceleration of bone resorption by certain PIs and provide the first example of clinically useful drugs that can interfere with the cross-talk between RANKL and interferon-γ via the proteasome. They also suggest a novel therapeutic approach to HIV osteopenia through modulation of these two molecules.

For example, in a survey of 112 homosexual HIV+ men, the relative risk for bone resorption in those receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy treatment incorporating a protease inhibitor (PI) was 2.19 (1.13–4.23, p = 0.02) (5Tebas P. Powderly W.G. Claxton S. Marin D. Tantisiriwat W. Teitelbaum S.L. Yarasheski K.E. AIDS. 2000; 14: F63-F67Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In another recent longitudinal evaluation of BMD in HIV+ individuals, there was only a weak association between BMD and PI treatment, but there were too few patients to distinguish among different type of PIs (9Mondy K.

Indeed, in one study the PIs indinavir and nelfinavir were associated with augmented or stable bone resorption, respectively (10Nolan D. Upton R. McKinnon E. John M. James I. Adler B. Roff G. Vasikaran S. Mallal S. AIDS. 2001; 15: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A satisfactory pathophysiological mechanism for HIV-linked bone resorption must be able to account for all of these findings. We focused on a T cell cytokine linked to acceleration of bone resorption in vitro and in vivo, the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) (11Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J.

Specifically, RANKL activity is modulated through interferon (IFN)-γ-coupled proteasomal degradation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (12Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). RANKL recruits TRAF6 to the cytoplasmic tail of RANK, resulting in the activation of NF-κB and certain mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (13Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Osteoclast differentiation and survival are based upon those signals. IFN-γ can inhibit RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis by proteasomal degradation of TRAF6, and exacerbation of osteoclast formation and bone destruction occurs in knockout mice lacking the IFN-γ receptor (14Huang S.

It is known that the PIs ritonavir and saquinavir can interfere with some gross proteasomal functions at suprapharmacological concentrations (17Gaedicke S. Firat-Geier E. Constantiniu O.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5230-5235PubMed Google Scholar) and that general proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 can block cross-talk between RANKL and IFN-γ (12Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). We demonstrate, in physiologically relevant systems, the role of the soluble envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 in RANKL induction and the ability of pharmacologically relevant concentrations of certain PIs to suppress interaction between IFN-γ and RANKL, recovering the normal physiological block to RANKL function. These data suggest methods to mitigate the effect of both HIV and specific PIs on bone resorption in AIDS. Reagents—Human and mouse recombinant RANKL and IFN-γ were purchased from Peprotech and osteoprotegerin (OPG)-Fc from R&D Systems. Recombinant HIV-1 gp120, monoclonal antibodies to gp120 (b12) and CD4, and HIV PIs ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program. The PIs were prepared as stock solutions of 27 μm in Me2SO, so that the final concentration of Me2SO in control (buffer) or drug-treated cultures was 0.1%. Polyclonal anti-TNF-α (R&D Systems) and anti-TRAF6 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased. Sperm whale dentine slices (ALPCO Diagnostics) and osteologic discs (BD Biosciences) were purchased. Cell Culture and Isolation and Propagation of PBMCs—RAW 264.7 murine monocytic cells were maintained in minimal essential medium plus 5% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% non-essential amino acid preparation. Human PBMCs were derived from heparinized venous blood by density gradient centrifugation using Ficol-Paque and cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% heat-inactivated FBS (20Crombie R. Silverstein R.L. MacLow C. Pearce S.F. Nachman R.L. Laurence J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Isolation of CD3+T Cells and Adherent Cells from PBMCs—Mature CD3+ T cells were obtained from PBMCs by incubation with Dynabeads M-450 CD3 at a ratio of 5 beads/target cell according to the manufacturer's directions (Dyanal, Oslo, Norway). This resulted in a CD3+ T cell population of >95% purity as evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. RANKL Protein Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—RANKL protein concentration was measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that we developed. Briefly, 100 μl/well of capture protein OPG-Fc was coated in 96-well plates at final protein concentrations of 2 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked by adding 300 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% sucrose, and 0.05% NaN3 to each well and incubating the plates at room temperature for 3 h. Plates were washed five times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4). Samples to be tested were diluted 1:1 in diluent (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for at least 2 h in final volumes of 100 μl. After washing, the plates were incubated with 100 μl of biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-human RANKL IgG, 200 ng/ml (R&D Systems) for 2 h at room temperature. To detect biotinylated antibody, streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (R&D Systems) was used. The bound horseradish peroxidase was assayed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) as substrate, and the reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4. ODs were determined at 450 nm. The detection limit was 50 pg/ml, and the mean percent recovery of RANKL, spiked at three concentrations, was 92% in culture supernatant. Intra-assay coefficients were <12%. Osteoclastogenesis Systems—RANKL induces osteoclast formation in human PBMC cultured for at least 3 days in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (21Faust J. Lacey D.L. Hunt P. Burgess T.L. Scully S. Van G. Eli A. Qian Y. Shalhoub V. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 72: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Matsuzaki K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yamaguchi K. Yasuda H. Shima N. Morinaga T. Toyama Y. Yabe Y. Higashio K. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Following this model, we cultured PBMC for 3 days in chamber slides (5 × 105 cells in 0.3 ml of medium/1-cm2 well; Nalgene Nunc) in the presence of human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, 100 ng/ml; Peprotech). Non-adherent cells were removed before conditioned medium from control or gp120-treated cell cultures was added. RAW 264.7 cells or adherent cells derived from 1.5 × 106 total PBMCs were incubated for up to 7 days with supernatants from control or gp120-treated cultures. The ratio, by volume, of the various culture media was 4.5 cell medium:4.5 culture supernatant:1 FBS. One-half of the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every 3 days. Prior to performing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assays to identify mature osteoclasts, cells were starved for 5 h in serum-free medium followed by 6 days of culture in test supernatants plus medium containing 2% FBS. To study the effect of HIV PIs and IFN-γ on osteoclast formation, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 6 days in the presence of RANKL and varying concentrations of IFN-γ and PIs. The medium was replaced every 3 days. TRAP Activity—Osteoclastogenesis was quantitatively assessed using TRAP activity as an index. p-Nitrophenol phosphate in acid phosphatase assay buffer served as a substrate. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma), and TRAP activity was measured colorimetrically at OD 405 nm. For TRAP staining, cells were placed in 10% formalin for 5 min followed by ethanol:acetone (50:50 v/v) fixation in the presence of acetate buffer (pH 4.8) containing napthol AS-MX phosphate, fast red violet LB salt, and 50 mm sodium tartarate for 10 min at room temperature, as previously described (23Chikatsu N. Takeuchi Y. Tamura Y. Fukumoto S. Yano K. Tsuda E. Ogata E. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Bone Resorption Assays—5 × 103 RAW 264.7 murine cells or adherent cells derived from 1.5 × 106 human PBMCs were seeded onto calcium phosphate-coated osteologic discs (BD Biosciences), placed in wells of 24-well tissue culture plates, and exposed to cell supernatants for from 7 to 15 days. The culture medium was changed every 3–4 days. Discs were then treated with bleach and washed in water, and the number of resorption lacunae per disc was visualized by light microscopy as described (23Chikatsu N. Takeuchi Y. Tamura Y. Fukumoto S. Yano K. Tsuda E. Ogata E. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For pit formation in sperm whale tooth dentine slices, identical conditions were used except that the incubation time with PBMC-derived adherent cells was 21 days. The medium was then removed, and 1 m NH4OH was added to the wells for 30 min. The dentine slices were then cleaned by ultrasonication, stained with hematoxylin for 45 s, and washed with water. Resorption pits were visualized under transmitted light. Analysis of TRAF6 by Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—2.5 × 106 RAW 264.7 cells at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml were incubated for 30 min with [35S]methionine in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with dialyzed FBS. Cells were then washed and incubated for 3 h with RANKL and IFN-γ in the presence or absence of ritonavir or saquinavir. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-TRAF6 polyclonal antibody and Staphylococcus protein A, products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and results were quantified by IMAGEQUANT 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblotting, 2 × 106 RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the presence of RANKL and IFN-γ with or without anti-HIV PIs in 12-well tissue culture plates for 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, aprotinin 2 μg/ml, EDTA 5 mm, Pefabloc Sc 4 mm, pepstatin 1 μm, and leupeptin 10 μg/ml) and loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Expression of TRAF6 was evaluated by probing the transferred proteins with anti-TRAF6 antibody (1:500 dilution). Role of Soluble HIV-1 gp120 in RANKL-mediated Osteoclastogenesis—Given the small fraction of tissue-based or circulating HIV-infected cells in HIV+ patients, it is unlikely that direct HIV infection of T cells could be involved in RANKL regulation in vivo. However, exposure of CD3+ T cells derived from the PBMCs of two normal donors to levels of recombinant HIV-1 IIIB gp120 comparable with that detectable in vivo in untreated patients (100 ng/ml) resulted in marked induction of RANKL protein production (Fig. 1A). RANKL protein was up-regulated by gp120 in separate experiments utilizing PBMCs from three normal donors (Fig. 1A). We investigated the biologic activity of gp120-induced RANKL in two established model systems for RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation: the macrophage-like osteoclast precursor murine line RAW 264.7 and precursor cells derived from human PBMCs. Both cell types can differentiate into osteoclast-like cells, recognized by morphology (giant cells containing ≥5 nuclei), TRAP staining, and resorption of dentine slices. We first cultured precursor cells derived from human PBMCs and RAW 264.7 with 1:1 dilutions of conditioned medium from control PBMC or PBMC exposed to gp120 for 72 h (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in the middle panels of Fig. 2, A and B, the multinucleated cells (≥5 giant cells containing 5 nuclei) induced in both types of osteoclast precursors by supernatants from gp120-treated PBMCs supported formation of resorption pits on dentine slices. The addition of RANK-Fc inhibited the formation of osteoclasts from gp120-treated conditioned medium (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom panels). Further experiments with PBMC-derived precursor cells exposed to supernatants from gp120-treated cultures showed a marked increase in the formation of TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts (Fig. 2C). The RANKL specificity of the active factor in gp120-exposed cultures was demonstrated by RANK-Fc-mediated suppression of TRAP+ cell induction (Fig. 2C). In addition, an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2C) and a gp120-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (b12; data not shown) completely blocked the effect of gp120 on the induction of osteoclastogenic activity in gp120-exposed PBMC supernatants. A TRAP activity assay was carried out in parallel with the above experiment as a measure of osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the literature on osteoclast differentiation, the evaluation of osteoclast formation by TRAP+ multinucleated giant cell formation and by TRAP activity gave identical results (compare Fig. 2, C and D). gp120 is known to induce secretion of TNF-α by PBMCs (24Clouse K.A. Cosentino L.M. Weih K.A. Pyle S.W. Robbins P.B. Hochstein H.D. Natarajan V. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2892-2901PubMed Google Scholar), and our gp120-exposed PBMC culture supernatants contained this cytokine at 230 pg/ml. However, TNF-α alone does not promote osteoclastogenesis in murine systems (25Lam J. Takeshitan S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) or in our human precursor cell model (data not shown). In addition, although TNF-α can synergize with RANKL in induction of osteoclastogenesis, at least in a murine system (25Lam J. Takeshitan S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), TRAP+ multinucleated giant cell formation driven by gp120-stimulated culture supernatants was only partially inhibited (35%) by the addition of 10 ng/ml anti-TNF-α antibody (Fig. 2, C and D), a concentration capable of inhibiting >1 ng/ml TNF-α. Effect of IFN-γ and HIV PIs on gp120-induced, RANKL-mediated Osteoclastogenesis—At suprapharmacological concentrations (20–100 μm) the anti-HIV PIs ritonavir and saquinavir inhibit a variety of proteasomal functions (17Gaedicke S.

McBride W.H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5230-5235PubMed Google Scholar). As RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation involves signaling through TRAF6, as well as its normal physiologic control by IFN-γ-mediated degradation of TRAF6 in proteasomes (12Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), we explored whether PIs, linked to accelerated loss of BMD when used at normal pharmacological concentrations, would have an impact on this pathway. Adherent cells derived from PBMCs of HIV seronegative donors were exposed to medium from purified human CD3+ T cells that had been cultured in the presence of gp120 for 72 h. As expected based on studies of RANKL and IFN-γ in other model systems (12Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), osteoclastogenesis induced by these supernatants was inhibited by the addition of concentrations of recombinant IFN-γ normally found in HIV seronegative individuals (26Bello I. Perez A. Torres A.M. Hernandez M.V. Lopez Saura P. Biotherapy. 1998; 11: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or in HIV+ individuals with low viral loads (27Bailer R.T. Holloway A. Sun J. Margolick J.B. Martin M. Kostman J. Montaner L.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7534-7542PubMed Google Scholar, 28Reuben J.M. Lee B.N. Paul M. Kline M.W. Cron S.G. Abramson S. Lewis D. Kozinetz C.A. Shearer W.T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The addition of a therapeutically relevant concentration (5 μm) of ritonavir to cultures exposed to supernatants of gp120-treated T cells in the presence of 5 ng/ml IFN-γ resulted in a substantial recovery of osteoclast activity (Fig. 3). Saquinavir had a similar effect, whereas nelfinavir and indinavir at doses up to 10 μm had no impact on osteoclast activity (data not shown). As in our previous experiments with this system, RANK-Fc blocked the osteoclastogenesis induced by gp120-activated cell culture supernatants (data not shown). The direct addition of gp120 had no effect on PBMC-derived precursor cells with respect to osetoclasogenesis (Fig. 3). We also examined the effect of these PIs on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in the absence of basal levels of IFN-γ. In this nonphysiologic system, concentrations of nelfinavir and indinavir up to 10 μm continued to have no impact on osteoclast formation assessed by TRAP activity (data not shown). Ritonavir, at pharmacologic concentrations, also had no effect on osteoclast formation in the absence of IFN-γ (Fig. 3, A and B). Suprapharmacologic doses of ritonavir (10 and 25 μm) suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (data not shown), but this effect was related to the marked cytotoxicity induced by these concentrations during the 72 h of drug exposure in this assay. Consistent with previous reports (12Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), TRAF6 expression was markedly inhibited by IFN-γ, as shown by Western blot analysis of RAW 264.7 osteoclast differentiation driven by RANKL (Fig. 4A). The addition of ritonavir or saquinavir resulted in significantly higher levels of TRAF6 expression, whereas indinavir and nelfinavir had no effect (Fig. 4A, top panel). Ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir, in the absence of IFN-γ, had no effect on TRAF6 expression (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Metabolic labeling of RAW 264.7 cells and immunoprecipitation with anti-TRAF6 antibody showed that ritonavir and saquinavir protected TRAF6 from intracellular degradation, an effect comparable with that seen using the general proteasome inhibitor MG132 at lower concentrations (Fig. 4B). This result was confirmed in a time course experiment. TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated at 0, 3, and 6 h after ritonavir exposure. As expected, TRAF6 protein was rapidly degraded in the cells treated with RANKL (100 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (5 ng/ml). After 3 h of chase, a very low amount of labeled TRAF6 was observed, and it was undetectable by 6 h (Fig. 4C). RANKL is known to affect osteoclast differentiation through TRAF6-mediated processes involving inhibition of NF-κB and JNK1 but not JNK2 (29Srivastava S. Toraldo G. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Pacifici R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8836-8840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Consistent with an earlier report (12Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), RANKL markedly up-regulated phosphorylation of JNK1 but not JNK2 (no visible phosphorylated band), and IFN-γ completely suppressed that activation (Fig. 4D). Indinavir and nelfinavir had no impact on IFN-γ-induced suppression of JNK1 activation, whereas ritonavir and saquinvir both over-came such suppression (Fig. 4D). Certain HIV PIs Restore RANKL-mediated Osteoclast Formation and Function Inhibited by IFN-γ—To investigate whether the results seen at a molecular level translate to the level of biologically active product, we examined the effect of HIV PIs on the bone resorbing activity of RANKL-induced osteoclasts. Ritonavir was added to RAW 264.7 cells treated with RANKL alone or in the presence of IFN-γ, and osteoclastogenesis quantified by TRAP activity and TRAP+ MNC count (Fig. 5, A and B). Osteoclast differentiation promoted by RANKL was inhibited by IFN-γ, an effect overcome by ritonavir at pharmacologically relevant concentration (Fig. 5, A and B). Saquinavir also mitigated the block to osteoclast formation, but to a lesser extent (data not shown). Neither indinavir nor nelfinavir had an impact on this system (data not shown), consistent with the biochemical assays for osteoclast activity reported above. The fact that recovery of TRAP+ cells in the presence of 10 μm ritonavir was less than with 5 μm may relate to cytotoxicity with prolonged exposures at the higher concentrations (Fig. 5, C and D). Ritonavir or saquinavir treatment also led to recovery of the bone resorbing activity of multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts exposed to physiologic concentrations of IFN-γ (Fig. 5, C–E). This indicates that these PIs were able to permit all phases of osteoclastogenesis to occur in the presence of its normal physiologic block. In contrast, the addition of pharmacologic concentrations of IFN-γ, which may vary from 2 to 300 ng/ml depending on the dose and route of administration (30Chen, S. A., Izu, A. E., Baughman, R. A., Ferraiolo, B. L., Mordenti, J., Reed, B. R., Jaffe, H. S., and Green, J. D. (1990) J. Interferon Res., 10, Suppl. 1, I16-I17 (abstr.) International Society for Interferon Research, Piscataway, NJGoogle Scholar), overcame the PI block to suppression of osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 6. There was a dose-dependent decline in RANKL-driven osteoclast differentiation mediated by IFN-γ, and levels of IFN-γ >5 ng/ml abrogated the ritonavir block to control of RANKL activity seen at physiologic levels of IFN-γ (Fig. 6A). The higher concentrations of IFN-γ had no effect on the viability of these cells. The marked increase in potency of the IFN-γ effect between 5 and 10 ng/ml (Fig. 6A) directly paralleled its effect on overcoming the ritonavir block to TRAF6 degradation as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6B). Hyperactivity of the osteoclast, the principal resorptive cell of bone, relative to the bone-forming osteoblast defines the pathophysiology of most cases of osteopenia and osteoporosis (31Teitelbaum S.L.

Here, we report that the standard procedure for isolating primary adipose cells from mouse adipose tissue triggers induction of many genes encoding inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, multiple chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, acute-phase proteins, type I IL-1 receptor, and multiple transcription factors implicated in the cellular inflammatory response.

Insulin resistance is a fundamental defect that precedes the development of the cluster of abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes (1Boden G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin.

Med. 1985; 79: 12-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Initially, the reduced insulin sensitivity is compensated by an over-production of insulin from β-cells. When insulin resistance progresses and β-cells are no longer able to produce sufficient insulin, overt type 2 diabetes develops (5LeRoith D. Am. J. Med. 2002; 113: 3S-11SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, improving the overall in vivo insulin sensitivity appears to be a key factor in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies on the beneficial effects of the thiazolidinedione class of insulin-sensitizing compounds in the treatment of type 2 diabetes underscore this notion (6Olefsky J.M. Saltiel A.R.

Because obesity with or without overt hyperglycemia is associated with insulin resistance (9Ferrannini E. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 15-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Walker M. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 18-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), attention has focused on abnormalities in adipose tissue that could lead to decreased systemic insulin sensitivity. Many adipose cell-secreted factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in vivo (11Trayhurn P. Beattie J.H. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Among them, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αILinterleukinRTreverse transcriptaseNF-κBnuclear factor κBIRSinsulin receptor substratePPAR-γperoxisome proliferator activator receptor-γCEBP-αCCAAT/enhancer binding protein-αTRAFTNF-α receptor-associated factor. is of particular interest, because it is highly induced in adipose tissues of obese animals and human subjects and induces insulin resistance both in cell culture and in vivo (12Moller D.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 212-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). However, it remains largely unknown which factors and pathways trigger the expression of TNF-α in disease settings such as obesity and diabetes. In addition, other potential adipose tissue-derived autocrine/paracrine and endocrine factors, and the signaling pathways that these factors might utilize to induce insulin resistance in vivo, still remain elusive. tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin reverse transcriptase nuclear factor κB insulin receptor substrate peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α TNF-α receptor-associated factor. One attractive cell model of insulin resistance is primary adipose cells. When these cells are cultured in vitro, they gradually lose the expression of insulin-responsive GLUT4 glucose transporters but increase the synthesis and cell-surface expression of GLUT1 (13Gerrits P.M. Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 640-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These changes in gene expression contribute to the development of insulin resistance in primary adipose cells in prolonged in vitro culture and mimic the insulin-resistant phenotype in adipose tissue in vivo. Yet the signals, as well as the molecular pathways these signals might use to initiate the changes in adipose cell gene expression, are unknown. Elucidating such mechanisms will provide new insight into our current understanding of the mechanisms of insulin resistance in vivo. We have demonstrated previously (14Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) that NF-κB activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is obligatory for TNF-α-mediated repression of most adipocyte-abundant genes, as well as induction of many immune response, proinflammatory, and preadipocyte genes (14Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, whether NF-κB and its upstream activating signals play an essential role in the reprogramming of gene expression in primary adipose cells is not known. To begin to understand the mechanisms underlying the coordinate changes in gene expression in isolated primary adipose cells, we sought to identify the immediate early changes in gene expression and to determine whether TNF-α is involved in initiating these changes. Here, we report that the standard procedure for isolating primary adipose cells from mouse adipose tissue induces genes encoding a variety of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-6, multiple chemokines, and several transcription factors implicated in the induction of acute-phase cytokines. Secretion of TNF-α protein is also significantly induced during the 2-h collagenase digestion. These inflammatory responses are accompanied by dramatic changes in primary adipose cell gene expression that are characteristic of TNF-α-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Hence, we used adipose cells isolated from TNF-α–/– mice to provide a direct and definitive test for the role of TNF-α in the reprogramming of gene expression in isolated primary adipose cells. Herein we report these results. Isolation and Culture of Primary Adipose Cells—8- to 9-week-old male C57BL/6J and FVB mice were used to obtain primary adipose cells essentially as described previously (15Malide D. Ramm G. Cushman S.W. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 (Pt 23): 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the epididymal fat pads were removed, minced, and digested using collagenase at 37 °C for 2 h. The primary adipose cells were then washed extensively and incubated at 37 °C in a KRBH buffer (Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer, pH = 7.4) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Primary adipose cells and conditioned medium were taken at various times as indicated in the figure legends and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in –80 °C until use. Antibody—TNF-α neutralizing antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (catalog number AF-410-NA; Minneapolis, MN). The manufacturer selected this line of TNF-α neutralizing antibody by functional screening and assessed the specificity of the antibody by showing that it does not cross-react with other cytokines tested so far. When used at 0.02–0.05 μg/ml, this antibody caused 50% inhibition of the biological effects of TNF-α activity at a concentration of 0.25 ng/ml, as demonstrated by the mouse L-929 cytotoxicity assay (according to R&D product sheet for AF-410-NA). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Conditioned media were collected from various primary adipose cell cultures. The protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were determined using Quantikine M kits from R&D Systems. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from fresh epididymal fat pads, primary fat cells immediately after collagenase digestion, and collagen-digested primary adipose cells cultured in vitro for up to 24 h. mRNA was quantified by Taqman chemistry-based method using a ABI 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reagents for 18 S ribosomal RNA or tubulin were used as control to normalize RNA sample loading. Each standard curve was linear between 0.02 and 200 ng of total RNA, a 104-fold range that covers the concentrations of any particular mRNA transcript in all of the samples. The efficiencies of amplification were identical or similar between genes of interest and controls. Oligonucleotide Microarray Data Collection and Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from various samples as indicated above, converted to biotin-labeled cRNA targets, hybridized to MG74AV2 oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and scanned on Affymetrix scanners essentially as described previously (14Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 16Ruan H. Miles P.D.G. Ladd C.M. Ross K. Golub T.R. Olefsky J.M. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3176-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Array measurements for all samples were normalized with arrays hybridized with cRNA targets prepared from the appropriate control samples by using the median of the hybridization signals of all genes with P calls (P-call, according to Affymetrix algorithm) as a scaling factor. We compared gene expression profiles of freshly isolated primary adipose cells with cells that have been cultured in vitro for up to 24 h. We used a self-organizing feature map method (SOM) (17Kohonen T. Proc. IEEE. 1991; 78: 1464-1480Crossref Scopus (6088) Google Scholar, 18Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S.

A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar) to analyze and cluster genes that were induced or repressed in primary adipose cells as a function of time. Changes in the steady-state mRNA levels of several genes identified by oligonucleotide microarray were confirmed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR or semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Standard Procedure for Isolating Primary Adipose Cells from Adipose Tissue Induces TNF-α mRNA and Triggers TNF-α Secretion from Isolated Adipose Cells—Following a standard protocol for preparing a primary adipose cell culture, we digested freshly harvested mouse epididymal fat pads with crude collagenase at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by extensive washes using KRBH buffer supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin. Because the ectodomains of certain plasma membrane proteins including TNF-α can be readily released by proteolysis, and the resulting bioactive molecules may potentially have significant impact on adipose cell biology and function, we monitored the production of TNF-α during and after collagenase treatment by determining the concentration of TNF-α in the supernatant of the digestion mixture and subsequent cell culture. After collagenase addition to mouse adipose tissue equivalent to ∼106 adipose cells/ml, the concentration of TNF-α in the conditioned medium increased dramatically within 1 h, reaching 0.93 ng/ml (Fig. 1A, top panel). At the end of the 2-h collagenase digestion, the level of TNF-α increased to 1.9 ng/ml. Notably, when the isolated adipose cells were washed extensively after collagenase digestion and incubated in growth medium at a concentration of ∼2 × 105 cells/ml, a steady but lower release of TNF-α continued as measured by the increasing amount of TNF-α in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1A, top panel). At the end of the incubation, the concentration of TNF-α in conditioned media reached 0.17 ng/ml. In contrast, this standard isolation procedure did not affect the secretion of IL-6, as no detectable IL-6 protein was present in the supernatant of the digestion mixture throughout the 2-h collagenase treatment (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). To determine whether adipose tissue expresses the IL-6 gene, we first assessed IL-6 mRNA levels using oligonucleotide microarrays. IL-6 mRNA was barely detectable in fresh adipose tissue but was highly induced at the end of the collagenase digestion (Table I). The IL-6 transcript remained at high levels when the isolated primary adipose cells were cultured in vitro for up to 24 h (see below). Consistent with the expression kinetics of IL-6 mRNA, the protein levels of IL-6 increased significantly in the conditioned medium 2 h after in vitro culture, peaking at the end of the 24-h incubation with a concentration of 4 ng/ml (2 × 105 cells/ml; Fig. 1A, bottom panel). IL-6 is normally induced by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which is activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli such as tissue injury, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines. Because TNF-α is secreted by adipose cells during collagenase digestion (Fig. 1A, top panel), TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation is thus a potential inducer of IL-6 gene expression in the cultured primary adipose cells. The delayed kinetics of IL-6 induction in adipose cells during collagenase treatment and isolation, compared with that of TNF-α, is in accordance with this potential relationship. However, other adipose cell-secreted factors triggered by collagenase digestion and/or oxidative stress could also play a role in the induction of IL-6 mRNA and protein secretion (see below).Table IStandard procedure for isolating primary adipose cells leads to induction of multiple mRNAs encoding inflammatory mediatorsGenBank™ accession numberGene nameBefore collagenase digestionAfter collagenase digestionFold inductionChemokines J04596Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 178516766.2 X53798Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2N.D.655* U27267Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5N.D.50* M33266Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10N.D.208* L12030Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 121433502.4 AV139913Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12N.D.201* M19681Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2239349914.6 J04491Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3N.D.133* X62502Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4N.D.124* X70058Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7766288.3 U77462Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11762002.6Cytokines M14639Interleukin 1-αN.D.50* X54542Interleukin 6N.D.663*Chemokine and cytokine receptors M20658Interleukin 1 receptor, type I382516.6 Z80112Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 432672.1 AF022990Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5N.D.50*Cell Adhesion Molecules M72332Selectin, plateletN.D.519* M80778Selectin, endothelial cellN.D.127* M90551Intercellular adhesion moleculeN.D.576* X53177Integrin α-4N.D.60* U12884Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1331203.6Acute phase proteins U60438Serum amyloid A2N.D.344* X03505Serum amyloid A3N.D.1237* U77630Adrenomedullin4646010 M28845Early growth response 152829055.5 X67644Immediate early response 323621559.1 X83601Pentaxin-related geneN.D.2289*Transcription factors AF017128fos-like antigen 1N.D.218* M21065Interferon regulatory factor 1204243511.9 X61800C/EBP-δ39210652.7 M61007C/EBP-β51712782.5 U20735Jun-B oncogene36614093.8 X12761Jun oncogene1876883.7 AI837104STAT 32224462.0Control mRNAs X56123Talin3663621.0 M28729Tubulin-α1498557031.1 M28739Tubulin, β26576351.0 M12481β-Actin198112860.65 Z48745ATP-binding cassette 82692330.9 M19381Calmodulin271324340.9 M73329Phospholipase C-α5565020.9 M17516Lactate dehydrogenase A-4531748270.9 X66405Procollagen, type VI, α-1194718691.0 M18194Fibronectin4724741.0 AB0056231-Acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase3133191.0 U35312Nuclear receptor co-repressor2812881.0 Open table in a new tab In many cell types such as immune cells, TNF-α is not expressed in resting cells but is rapidly induced in response to a number of extracellular stimuli such as pathogens. The induction of TNF-α in these cells is independent of de novo protein synthesis. To determine whether TNF-α gene transcription in adipose cells is induced by the standard isolation procedure including collagenase treatment, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to measure the steady state levels of TNF-α mRNA in fresh adipose tissue, as well as in isolated adipose cells after collagenase digestion. TNF-α mRNA is readily detectable in epididymal fat pads freshly harvested from lean mice and is induced over 420-fold following a 2-h collagenase treatment. The levels of TNF-α transcript remained at this high level even 4 h after completing the collagenase digestion. Notably, although the levels of TNF-α mRNA dropped 90% when cells were incubated in growth medium for 24 h, the TNF-α transcript still remained about 40-fold higher than fresh adipose tissue (Fig. 1B). Thus, our data indicate that the standard method for isolating primary adipose cells from adipose tissue triggers TNF-α gene transcription and protein secretion and that adipose cell-derived TNF-α may potentially affect the expression of at least a set of genes, including IL-6, in isolated primary adipose cells in culture. Standard Procedure for Isolating Primary Adipose Cells from Adipose Tissue Triggers Major and Rapid Changes in Gene Expression That Are Characteristic of TNF-α-treated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To determine whether adipose cell gene transcription in general is significantly altered during standard preparation of isolated cells, we examined gene expression profiles in isolated adipose cells cultured in vitro for up to 24 h. We performed a self-organizing feature map (SOM) analysis of the data collected from oligonucleotide microarrays to identify clusters of genes with distinct patterns of expression kinetics during the 24-h period. The SOM analysis shows that this standard procedure for isolation of primary adipose cells evoked major and rapid changes in adipocyte gene expression, including down-regulation of essential adipose cell-abundant genes and up-regulation of immune response and pre-adipocyte genes. Strikingly, the isolated adipose cells exhibited distinct patterns of gene expression kinetics that are identical to those seen in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with TNF-α. Here, we focused on a subset of genes whose encoded proteins play a critical role in adipocyte function. First, we assessed the expression pattern of key adipocyte proteins that are essential for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and metabolism. As shown in Fig. 2, the steady state mRNA levels of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT-2, and c-Cbl-associated protein, whose encoded proteins are involved in transducing insulin signals in adipose cells, were down-regulated 80% or more by 24 h in culture relative to the beginning of the incubation (Fig. 2, A–D, empty squares). Similarly, the mRNA levels of many effector molecules of insulin signaling, such as GLUT4, glycogen synthase, fatty acid synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase were repressed at least 80% compared with the beginning of the incubation (Fig. 2, E–J, empty squares). In addition, the mRNA levels of two adipocyte master transcription factors, PPAR-γ and CEBP-α, were repressed 95 and 77%, respectively, in primary adipose cells after a 24-h culture in vitro (Fig. 2, K–L, empty squares). In addition to proteins involved in energy metabolism, the expression of many adipose cell-secreted factors was altered when primary adipose cells were cultured in vitro (Fig. 3, A–D, empty squares). Among them, the expression levels of leptin, resistin, and ACRP30 were all down-regulated whereas the mRNA level of IL-6 did not further increase from the already high level induced by the collagenase treatment (Table I). In contrast, other TNF-α family members such as Fas antigen and many proteins involved in TNF-α signaling including TNF-α receptor-associated proteins (TRAF-2, 3, and 4) and TNF-α receptor-2 were highly induced when adipose cells were cultured in vitro (Fig. 3, F–J, empty squares). Notably, whereas adipocyte-abundant AKT-2 (19Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar) mRNA was repressed in cultured primary adipose cells, the mRNA encoding AKT-1, a ubiquitously expressed isoform of AKT, increased steadily (Fig. 3E, empty squares). This AKT isoform switch may contribute, in part, to the loss of insulin response in cultured primary adipose cells. We have shown previously that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes NF-κB activation is obligatory for TNF-α-mediated repression of most of the adipocyte-abundant genes and induction of a subset of genes. Among the 22 genes shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the mRNA levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT-2, c-Cbl-associated protein, GLUT4, glycogen synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, PPAR-γ, and CEBP-α were all repressed by TNF-α in 3T3-L1 adipose cells in a NF-κB-dependent manner, because the expression levels of these genes were unaffected by TNF-α in 3T3-L1 adipose cells expressing a dominant inhibitor of NF-κB activation (IκBα-DN). Similarly, induction of Fas antigen by TNF-α requires NF-κB activation. 2H. Ruan and H. F. Lodish, unpublished data. TNF-α also repressed the expression of fatty acid synthase, resistin, and ACRP30 and induced TNF-R2 and TRAF-4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after multiple hours of incubation. However, TNF-α caused extensive cell death in adipose cells expressing IκBα-DN after2hof incubation, and so we could not determine whether the effects of TNF-α on the expression of these genes were dependent on NF-κB activation. The hybridization signals for the remaining six genes (IRS-2, leptin, IL-6, AKT-1, TRAF-2, and TRAF-3) were low in our previous experiments on TNF-α-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and we did not further investigate the cause for this observation, although technical limitations are likely to be involved. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the standard procedure for isolating primary adipose cells from adipose tissue triggers rapid reprogramming of adipose cell gene expression that is characteristic of TNF-α-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. TNF-α Is Not Necessary for the Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Isolated Primary Adipose Cells—Because the isolated primary adipose cells exhibited dramatic changes in gene expression that were similar to the TNF-α-induced changes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and because significant amounts of TNF-α were secreted from primary adipose cells during collagenase digestion, we hypothesized that primary adipose cell-derived TNF-α triggers the changes in global gene expression during isolation of primary adipose cells. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether the dynamics of the primary adipose cell response to the standard isolation procedures, especially the collagenase exposure, would be further altered by the addition of TNF-α. We assessed the expression patterns of key adipocyte genes in collagenase-digested primary adipose cells incubated with TNF-α (1 nmol/liter) for up to 24 h. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 (filled triangles), the expression kinetics of genes that are normally induced or repressed in primary adipose cells during in vitro incubation were not significantly affected by the presence of exogenous TNF-α, although the induction of some genes was further enhanced by TNF-α (data not shown). This suggests that the standard method for adipose cell isolation may activate the same pathways utilized by TNF-α to affect adipocyte gene expression. Alternatively, the standard isolation procedure could trigger cellular pathways in addition to those activated by TNF-α, and these different pathways could converge at the level of transcriptional machinery and result in transcriptional changes that are characteristic of TNF-α. Because primary adipose cells continue to release a significant amount of TNF-α when they are cultured in vitro, we used a TNF-α neutralizing antibody to test whether the TNF-α secreted by isolated adipose cells in culture is responsible for the changes in gene expression. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels indicates that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was down-regulated, and GLUT1 was induced in primary adipose cells following a 24-h incubation in vitro (compare lanes 1 with lanes 2 in Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with our microarray data. Addition of increasing amounts of TNF-α-neutralizing antibody (0.008–0.4 μg/ml) did not block the changes of the expression of these two representative genes (compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 2 in Fig. 4, A and B). According to the efficacy of the TNF-α neutralizing antibody, and as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the highest amount of antibody we used in this study is sufficient to fully inhibit the biological activities of TNF-α at a concentration of 0.75 ng/ml, which is about 4-fold the concentration seen at the end of the 24-h incubation period (Fig. 1A, top panel). Thus, our data suggest that TNF-α produced during incubation of adipose cells did not significantly contribute to the induction of the changes in global gene transcription in adipose cells. Because TNF-α was highly induced during collagenase digestion (Fig. 1A, top panel), it is possible that this brief exposure to high levels of TNF-α during collagenase treatment is sufficient to trigger major changes in gene expression in primary adipose cells. Thus, we used primary adipose cells isolated from TNF-α–/– mice to ascertain whether TNF-α is responsible for initiating the reprogramming of gene expression in isolated primary adipose cells. We first confirmed that TNF-α was indeed absent in primary adipose cells derived from TNF-α–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 5A"

SERCA2b displayed a 10-fold decrease in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from E1Ca2 relative to SERCA2a (i.e. SERCA2b enzyme manifests true high affinity at cytosolic Ca2+ sites) and a lower rate of dephosphorylation. These fundamental kinetic differences explain the increased apparent affinity for activation by cytosolic Ca2+ and the reduced catalytic turnover rate in SERCA2b. Relative to SERCA1a, both SERCA2 isoforms displayed a 2-fold decrease of the rate of E2 to E1Ca2 transition. Furthermore, seven DD mutants were expressed at similar levels as wild type. The expression level was 2-fold reduced for Gly23 → Glu and Ser920 → Tyr and 10-fold reduced for Gly749 → Arg. Uncoupling between Ca2+ translocation and ATP hydrolysis and/or changes in the rates of partial reactions account for lack of function for 7 of 10 mutants: Gly23 → Glu (uncoupling), Ser186 → Phe, Pro602 → Leu, and Asp702 → Asn (block of E1∼P(Ca2) to E2-P transition), Cys318 → Arg (uncoupling and 3-fold reduction of E2-P to E2 transition rate), and Thr357 → Lys and Gly769 → Arg (lack of phosphorylation). A 2-fold decrease in the E1∼P(Ca2) to E2-P transition rate is responsible for the 2-fold decrease in activity for Pro895 → Leu. Ser920 → Tyr is a unique DD mutant showing an enhanced molecular Ca2+ transport activity relative to wild-type SERCA2b.

SERCAs belong to the P-type ATPase family distinguished by the obligatory formation of an aspartyl-phosphorylated intermediate as part of their catalytic cycle. The enzyme cycles reversibly between several states (Scheme 1), of which at least E1Ca2, E1∼P(Ca2), E2-P, and E2 can be experimentally distinguished. The transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to the aspartate (Asp351) of the phosphorylation domain, leading to the ADP-sensitive high energy phosphoenzyme intermediate E1∼P(Ca2), is activated by conformational changes associated with the binding of two calcium ions in exchange for protons (E2 to E1Ca2 transition). The conversion of this intermediate to the ADP-insensitive low-energy E2-P phosphoenzyme intermediate constitutes a crucial rate-limiting step in Ca2+ translocation (1MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J.

Previous clinical and genetical investigations have established that the SERCA2 gene (ATP2A2) represents the gene defective in Darier disease (DD; OMIM 124200), a severe autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by loss of adhesion between epidermal cells (acantholysis) and by abnormal keratinization (dyskeratosis) and association with a wide range of neuropsychiatric problems, such as epilepsy and depression (19Sakuntabhai A.

Genet. 1999; 21: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that mutations in the SERCA2 gene produce a dominant DD phenotype through haploinsufficiency, i.e. mutation in one allele would result in complete or partial loss of function in the mutated pumps (19Sakuntabhai A.

We recently documented that acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf (localized disorder of keratinization affecting the distal extremities) is also caused by mutation in the SERCA2 gene, and, hence, it is allelic to DD (27Dhitavat J.

The SERCA2 gene encodes the cardiac muscle SERCA2a protein (997 amino acids) as well as the ubiquitously expressed SERCA2b (1042 amino acids), but no cardiac manifestations have been observed in DD patients. As a result of the alternative splicing, the SERCA2a-specific C terminus (AILE997) is replaced by a variant sequence of 49 amino acids in SERCA2b (Fig. 1) and by a 6-amino acid stretch (VLSSEL999) in SERCA2c, a very recently reported SERCA2 splice variant (16Gélébart P. Martin V. Enouf J. Papp B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The extended tail of the SERCA2b isoform probably contains an additional transmembrane domain (M11) as part of a SERCA2b-specific 11-helix transmembrane structure with the extreme C terminus protruding into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (28Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25678-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A tentative planar model is shown in Fig. 1, in which the indicated secondary structures correspond to the model for the atomic structure of SERCA1a in the E1Ca2 state (5Toyoshima C. Nakasato M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The divergence in the C-terminal part is responsible for the known functional differences between SERCA2a and SERCA2b: SERCA2b has a 2-fold higher apparent affinity for Ca2+ and a 2-fold lower turnover rate for Ca2+-uptake relative to SERCA2a (29Lytton J.

Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 979-984Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Upon cell stimulation, the SERCA enzymes play a critical role in restoring the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to its resting levels. SERCA2b is the major SERCA isoform in non-muscle cells, including epidermal cells, and the specific functional properties of SERCA2b have direct consequences for modulation of the frequency and amplitude of the generated Ca2+ waves (31John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 32Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Comparison of Ca2+ wave properties of oocytes overexpressing either SERCA2a or SERCA2b has demonstrated that both the width and the period of the Ca2+ waves are larger for SERCA2b than for SERCA2a, and, consistent with a higher Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2b, the wave fronts are more sharply delineated for SERCA2b (31John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Replenishment of the agonist-releasable endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores is, furthermore, required for proper translation and folding of resident and secreted proteins (33Corbett E.F. Michalak M.

A very recent study, analyzing the effect of 12 mutations associated with DD, has documented that some mutants inhibited the activity of the co-expressed wild-type through protein interactions between wild-type and mutant SERCA2b monomers (38Ahn W. Lee M.G. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20795-20801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). So far, the functional effects of DD mutations on overall and partial reactions of the catalytic cycle mediated by mutant SERCA2b proteins have not been documented in any detail. In addition, the partial reaction steps responsible for the SERCA2b-specific slow catalytic cycle (29Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

The present study addresses these issues by investigating the overall and partial reactions catalyzed by wild-type SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms as well as 10 DD SERCA2b mutants (Fig. 1). Because this represents the first detailed study of the partial reaction steps of SERCA2 isoforms, a comparison with the well characterized SERCA1a is also made. The cDNA clones used encode the human SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms (13Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2026406389,"The tyrosine kinase Src is present on the Golgi membranes. Its role, however, in the overall function and organization of the Golgi apparatus is unclear. We have found that in a cell line called SYF, which lacks the three ubiquitous Src-like kinases (Src, Yes, and Fyn), the organization of the Golgi apparatus is perturbed. The Golgi apparatus is composed of collapsed stacks and bloated cisternae in these cells. Expression of an activated form of Src relocated the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. Other Golgi-specific marker proteins were not affected under these conditions. Because of the specific effect of Src on the location of KDEL-R, we tested whether protein transport between ER and the Golgi apparatus involves Src. Transport of Pseudomonas exotoxin, which is transported to the ER by binding to the KDEL-R is accelerated by inhibition or genetic ablation of Src. Protein transport from ER to the Golgi apparatus however, is unaffected by Src deletion or inhibition. We propose that Src has an appreciable role in the organization of the Golgi apparatus, which may be linked to its involvement in protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Protein transport from ER to the Golgi apparatus however, is unaffected by Src deletion or inhibition. We propose that Src has an appreciable role in the organization of the Golgi apparatus, which may be linked to its involvement in protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. Src is activated by various cell surface receptors and phosphorylates numerous cellular proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar and 2Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A significant fraction of Src is localized to the perinuclear region and the secretory vesicles in neuronal cells (3David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Linstedt A.D. Vetter M.L. Bishop J.M. Kelly R.B. J.

Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1019-1024PubMed Google Scholar) or cellugyrin (9Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in the regulation of membrane traffic. Src and other Src family tyrosine kinases are also localized to the Golgi apparatus (3David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Bard F. Patel U. Levy J.B. Horne W.C. Jurdic P. Baron R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the Golgi apparatus, Src interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl, and Src activation leads to an increased recruitment of Cbl specifically at the Golgi. This indicates that Src-Cbl signaling might occur at this organelle (10Bard F. Patel U. Levy J.B. Horne W.C. Jurdic P. Baron R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Further support for this proposal stems from recent findings that show that Src is involved in the activation of Ras on the Golgi apparatus following mitogenic stimulation (11Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Src is also known to phosphorylate and interact with a Golgi apparatus-specific protein, Golgin 67 (12Jakymiw A. Raharjo E. Rattner J.B. Eystathioy T. Chan E.K. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4137-4144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the function of Src signaling at the Golgi remains unknown. The number of signaling molecules that associate with the Golgi membranes and regulate its function and organization is increasing and is known to include protein kinase D, which regulates Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking (13Jamora C. Takizawa P.A. Zaarour R.F. Denesvre C. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1997; 91: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (14Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and polo-like kinase, which are essential for the fragmentation of the Golgi at the onset of mitosis (15Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (16Acharya U. Mallabiabarrena A. Acharya J.K. Malhotra V.

A. 2001; 98: 9128-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is thus reasonable to propose that Src might also be involved in the structural and functional regulation of the Golgi membranes. A major issue in studies involving Src is the functional redundancy between the Src kinase family, which includes nine members (18Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Knock-out studies have revealed that the deletion of Src has relatively mild effects in mice. However, Src knock-out in combination with a deletion of Yes and Fyn, the two other members of the Src family, leads to an early embryonic death (19Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).

We found that SYF cells have an aberrant Golgi morphology with compacted stacks and bloated cisternae. Furthermore, expression of an activated form of Src induces the specific exclusion of the KDEL-R from the Golgi apparatus, suggesting an effect on retrograde trafficking. Consistently, the rate of traffic between the Golgi apparatus and the ER of the Pseudomonas exotoxin is reduced by Src expression. Deletion of Src does not appear to perturb protein transport in the anterograde pathway from the ER to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus. Reagents and Cells—The polyclonal Src2 and monoclonal B-12 anti-Src antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the KDEL-R antibody (clone KR-10) was from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-mannosidase II is a generous gift of Dr. Kelly Morgan (University of Georgia). SYF, SYFsrc, and Src+ cells were a kind gift of Drs. Klinghoffer and Soriano (Seattle, WA). Src inhibitor SU6656 was purchased from Calbiochem Novabiochem, and Pseudomonas exotoxin came from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Electron Microscopy—Monolayers of SYF and Src+ cells were washed with PBS and fixed in situ with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide containing 1.5% potassium cyanoferrate, dehydrated in gradual ethanol (70% to 100%), and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were applied onto 200 mesh copper grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before examination with a Philips CM 120 transmission electron microscope (CMEABG, Villeurbanne, France). Pseudomonas Exotoxin Transport Assay—SYF and Src+ cells were grown to near confluence in 24-well plates. 1 h prior to and then during the experiment, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, without methionine/cysteine, containing 25 mm Hepes. The cells were then incubated with 20 μg/ml Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) or in medium alone (control) for 30 min at 19 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for various periods of time in three wells for PE and three wells of control for each time point. 10 μCi of trans-35S mixture (ICN Pharmaceuticals) was added to each well for 10 min, and the wells were washed twice with PBS before cell lysis and trichloroacetic acid precipitation. After resuspension in sample buffer, the radioactivity in each sample was quantified by scintillation counter, and the average value of treated wells was normalized to the average value of control wells. As an additional control, brefeldin A was added at 5 μg/ml in three wells in the same time as was the PE. For Src drug treatment, Src+ cells were pretreated with 2 μm SU6656 for 30 min prior to the addition of PE. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-G Protein Transport Assay—GFP-VSV-G protein was transfected using LipofectAMINE® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 24 h after transfection, the cells were transferred at 40 °C for 6 h. Cycloheximide was then added at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. At this stage, which was taken as the 0 min time point, cells were transferred at 32 °C for the indicated period of time before fixation for fluorescence-based analysis. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and treated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h before incubation with primary antibodies. Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted with Cytoseal 60 (Richard-Allan Scientific, VWR International) and visualized with a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope with a Plan-APO 60X objective. Digital images were acquired with an Olympus camera. Image Analysis and Quantification—The freeware ImageJ 1.29× by Wayne Rasband was used for image quantification and analysis. To quantify the morphology of the Golgi apparatus, the immunofluorescence of mannosidase II was recorded as a digital, 8-bit gray-scale, 1280 × 1024 pixels image. The Golgi labeling image threshold was set at ∼90 on a 0–255 black to white scale (all pixels with a value under 90 are excluded from the quantification) to remove background pixels from measurement. A region of interest was defined for each cell, and the perimeter and surface of the Golgi apparatus with a minimum area of three pixels was measured. The dimensionless circularity of the Golgi apparatus was then computed according to the formula 4π(sum (areas)/(sum(perimeters))^2). To quantify the decrease of the KDEL-R immunofluorescence signal at the Golgi in Src-transfected cells, the 8-bit grayscale, non-saturated images of KDEL-R or mannosidase II (as a control) immunofluorescence were set at a threshold value of ∼90). For each cell, the number of pixels over threshold and their mean value were measured inside a region of interest covering the perinuclear area. The product of the mean intensity and the number of pixels for each cell was considered the value of immunofluorescence intensity for KDEL-R in the given perinuclear area. Each microscopic field contained one transfected cell and 3–6 control cells, and the average of labeling intensity for the control cell was used to normalize the data. For GFP-VSV-G protein transport assay quantification, we measured the ratio of the average green fluorescence intensity of pixels above background between the Golgi area and the rest of the cell. For each GFP-VSV-G protein green channel image, we used the corresponding GRASP65 (Golgi resident protein) red channel image to generate a “filter,” i.e. a binary image in which the value of each pixel below background is set to 0, and the value for each pixel above it is set to 1. Each pixel of this binary image was then multiplied by the corresponding pixel (value 0–255) from the green channel image, and the resulting image was then used to measure the average GFP fluorescence above background per pixel in the Golgi area. An inverted image of the filter (0 replaced by 1 and reciprocally) was used to measure the GFP fluorescence above background in the rest of the cell. Statistical Analysis—For statistical computation and estimation of significance, we used the online software GraphPad® (www.graphpad.com). The circularity of the Golgi apparatus in multiple cells and the normalized results of KDEL-R fluorescence at the Golgi for control and transfected cells were run through unpaired t tests. According to GraphPad® recommendations, the computed two-tailed p values were considered extremely statistically significant when p < 0.001 (noted as *** in Figs. 1G and 3D), very significant when p ranges from 0.001 to 0.01 (noted as ** in Fig. 1G), significant when 0.05 > p > 0.01, and not significant (n/s in Fig. 3H) when p > 0.05.Fig. 3The KDEL-R is redistributed following SrcE378G transfection. SYF cells were transfected with a SrcE378G expression plasmid, fixed 12 h later, and labeled with the anti-Src polyclonal antibody Src2 (A) and the anti KDEL-R monoclonal antibody (B) or the monoclonal anti phosphotyrosine PY99 (E) and the polyclonal anti-mannosidase II (F). To quantify the fluorescence at the Golgi, the digital images were set at a threshold of ∼90 (C and G), and the total number of pixels above threshold, their mean intensity, and the fluorescent intensity in the perinuclear area (circles) of each cell were computed. In panels C and G, the particular measurements for the images B and F, respectively, are shown (A denotes the number of pixels, M is the mean value of intensity, and I is fluorescent intensity, the product of A and M). Each intensity value was then normalized to the mean intensity of control cells (CON) in the same image to allow statistical analysis (D and H); 27 control cells and 7 transfected cells were analyzed for KDEL-R, and 28 control cells and 10 transfected cells were analyzed for mannosidase II.

Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Src+ is a cell line generated from littermate embryos with deletion for Yes and Fyn but with an intact allele for src. The cell line called SYFsrc was derived from the SYF cells by stable transfection of a construct expressing c-Src (19Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These three cell lines provide useful tools for analyzing the role of Src. To address its role at the Golgi apparatus, we first monitored the morphology of this organelle in SYF cells by immunostaining with an antibody for mannosidase II, which is localized primarily to the medial Golgi cisternae. The Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells is composed of 40–80 stacks that are connected to each other and concentrated in the perinuclear region. In Src+ cells (Fig 1B), the Golgi apparatus was relatively normal as compared with control cells like NIH3T3. In contrast, a large proportion of SYF cells displayed an unusually compact Golgi morphology (Fig. 1E). To evaluate the overall structure of the Golgi, we developed a statistical test based on the epifluorescence images of the Golgi apparatus. A confocal based three-dimensional reconstruction of the Golgi showed that the organelle is relatively flat in SYF, SYF-src, and Src+ cell lines in culture (data not shown); therefore a morphological analysis in the two dimensions of an epifluorescence image gives a good approximation of the three-dimensional structure of the Golgi. A dispersed, elongated morphology represents a longer perimeter (the enveloping surface in three dimensions) compared with a compact morphology for the same area (the volume in three dimensions). By factoring in the area of a structure with the square value of its perimeter and multiplying it by 4π, one obtains a dimensionless number called circularity (equal to one for a perfect circle). Because the Golgi apparatus is generally formed of several clusters of Golgi stacks, we used the same formula but with the sum of the areas of the clusters and the sum of their perimeters to calculate the “compactness” of the whole structure. Therefore, the compactness parameter computes both the fragmentation of the Golgi (a Golgi composed of two perfectly circular clusters will have a value of 0.5, with the circularity of each cluster giving a parameter independent of size). Using this method, we found that SYF cells have a statistically significant, more compact Golgi apparatus than either Src+ cells (SYF compactness is equal to 0.288 on average versus 0.046 for Src+ cells; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1G) or SYFsrc cells (compactness for SYFsrc is 0.099; p = 0.0014). The Golgi apparatus of SYFsrc cells was slightly more compact on average than Src+ cells, which is somewhat surprising because by Western blot we found that SYFsrc cells, by comparison with Src+, express higher levels of Src protein (data not shown). However, this could be explained by the high variability of Src expression levels in SYFsrc that we observed by immunofluorescence (data not shown) and by the more heterogeneous Golgi morphology in this cell line as reflected in the higher standard deviation of compactness among cells (Fig. 1G). We thus conclude that expression or deletion of Src perturbs the Golgi morphology. Other intracellular structures, such as the focal adhesion system, actin cytoskeleton, and the microtubule network, are not significantly different in SYF compared with control cells (19Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). 2F. Bard and P. Jurdic, unpublished observations. To further analyze the organization of collapsed Golgi apparatus, Src+, SYFsrc, and SYF cells were imaged by electron microscopy. ∼10 cells for each cell line and 4–5 serial sections for each cell were imaged; the most representative photographs are shown in Fig. 2. In SYF cells, the Golgi apparatus was collapsed into a compact structure in which the individual stacks could not be identified (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the individual Golgi cisternae were enlarged in SYF cells (Fig. 2A, inset) compared with their Src+ counterparts (Fig. 2B, inset). In Src+ (Fig. 2B) and SYFsrc cells (not shown), stacks appeared normal. This overall Golgi organization in SYF cells compares well with the organization of the Golgi apparatus observed at the immunofluorescence level. Src Activation Leads to the Dispersion of the KDEL Receptor from the Golgi—The effect of Src on the Golgi apparatus organization and our previous findings that Src regulates the amount of Cbl associated with the Golgi membranes (10Bard F. Patel U. Levy J.B. Horne W.C. Jurdic P. Baron R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether Src affects the distribution of Golgi-specific proteins. KDEL-R mediates recycling of ER resident proteins that have escaped to the Golgi apparatus by binding to their KDEL sequence. Although the steady state distribution of this receptor is mostly at the Golgi apparatus, it cycles continuously between the Golgi membranes and ER, and a modification of its distribution reflects an alteration in its trafficking rate (20Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We found that KDEL-R was displaced from the Golgi into a dispersed, punctate pattern following expression of an activated form of Src, SrcE378G, in SYF and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3, A–C, and data not shown). To quantify this effect, we measured the total specific fluorescence signal at the Golgi apparatus (see “Experimental Procedures”) for each cell in a given field, typically containing 1–2 transfected cells and 3–6 non-transfected cells. We then normalized the results by expressing the fluorescence signal as a percentage of the mean of control cells in the same image. Therefore, different images and different experiments can be compared, as this quantification is independent of variations in camera settings and immunofluorescence conditions. We found that KDEL-R immunofluorescence at the Golgi was reduced to 20.6% in average value compared with control cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, using the same method, we found that mannosidase II labeling was not affected in SrcE378G transfected cells (119% of the mean intensity in control cells) (Fig. 3F). Other Golgi markers, including the lectin wheat germ agglutinin, peripheral proteins such as giantin, GRASP65, GRASP55, and GM130 (data not shown) as well as a Golgi enzyme such as the β 1,4-galactosyl-transferase 1 (data not shown) were not, at the visual level, affected by the expression of activated Src. Src Expression Reduces the Rate of Golgi-to-ER Traffic of the Pseudomonas Exotoxin—The effect of Src on KDEL-R distribution suggests that Src may be involved in retrograde traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. We used the bacterial PE, which is transported after endocytosis to the ER via the Golgi apparatus (21Jackson M.E. Simpson J.C. Girod A. Pepperkok R. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PE binds to KDEL-R by its KDEL-like sequence that insures its transport to the ER. Upon reaching the ER, it is translocated to the cytosol and inhibits protein synthesis (22Sandvig K. Van Deurs B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To test the kinetics of transport of PE, we measured the delay between PE internalization and the onset of protein synthesis inhibition induced by PE. SYF, SYFsrc, or SYFsrc cells, treated with 2 μm of the Src inhibitor SU6656 (23Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), were first incubated with 20 ng/ml PE at 19 °C for 1 h. This allows for efficient binding of PE and its accumulation in the endosomal compartment. The cells were then shifted to 37 °C for various periods of time before a 10-min pulse of cysteine S35, which was immediately followed by cell lysis. Proteins in cell lysates were precipitated, and radioactivity was counted by scintillation. The reference level was measured with control cells treated identically except for the addition of PE. As a control, we checked that the effect on protein synthesis is dependent on an intact Golgi apparatus. This was carried out by treating the cells, in addition to PE, with the drug brefeldin A, which fuses the Golgi apparatus with the ER, therefore inhibiting retrograde transport. Treatment with brefeldin A inhibited the PE-mediated effects on protein synthesis (Fig 4A). To test whether Src expression perturbs the traffic of PE, the cell lines SYF and SYFsrc were compared. Maximal protein synthesis inhibition by PE was obtained after 60 min in SYF cells (Fig 4A). In SYFsrc cells, it took twice as long to reach a similar effect on protein synthesis (Fig 4A), indicating that, in the presence of Src, PE traffic to the ER is slower. Consistently, treatment of SYFsrc cells with the Src inhibitor SU6656, prior to addition of PE, reduced the kinetic of PE effect to a level similar to SYF cells (Fig 4A), indicating that Src-mediated effect on PE transport is direct. To address the possibility that this regulation could occur at the level of endocytosis or endosomal sorting, we followed the intracellular traffic of PE. We labeled PE by covalent attachment of the fluorescent dye Alexa 594® (P3-A594). SYF, Src+, and SYFsrc cells were incubated with PE-A594 at 19 °C for 30 min and then transferred to 37 °C. At 19 °C, PE-A594 accumulated in the endosomes and did not colocalize with the Golgi marker mannosidase II (Fig. 4B). However, after 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, PE began accumulating in the TGN/Golgi compartment in both SYF and SYFsrc, reaching maximum accumulation after 60 min. The amount of PE-A594 that was accumulated in the TGN/Golgi was appreciably lower than the amount detected in the endosomes, suggesting that a significant fraction was degraded in lysosomes. Nevertheless, the kinetics of accumulation of PE-594 in the TGN/Golgi was not significantly different in SYF, Src+, or SYFsrc, indicating that Src does not affect endocytosis or transport of PE from the endosomes to the TGN/Golgi apparatus. Src Is Not Involved in Transport of VSV-G Protein along the Secretory Pathway—We used the tsO45VSV-G protein as a marker for the trafficking along the secretory pathway. At 40 °C, the tsO45VSV-G protein is retained in the ER because of a folding defect. Upon shifting to 32 °C, the tsO45VSV-G protein folds correctly and exits ER in a synchronous wave as described previously (24Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). SYF, SYFsrc, and Src+ cells were transfected with a GFP-tsO45VSV-G protein-expressing plasmid and incubated at 40 °Cfor6hto allow accumulation in the ER. The cells were then shifted to 32 °C for various times. Cells were labeled for GRASP65, a Golgi-associated protein, and DNA. In all cell lines tested, VSV-G protein accumulated in the Golgi at the same rate and exited the Golgi apparatus with similar kinetics. To measure more precisely the kinetics of VSV-G protein transport, we devised a quantification scheme based on the ratio of the average GFP fluorescence in the Golgi area (F-Golgi) over the average GFP fluorescence in the rest of the cell (F-ER). Only the fluorescence above background was computed using a threshold value set above the fluorescence of neighboring, untransfected cells (see Fig. 5, C, G, or K, for examples of threshold setting). To measure F-Golgi and F-ER, we used filters generated from the corresponding Golgi-labeling, GRASP65 image (see Fig. 5, D, H, or L, for examples of the resulting images). By using this procedure, we found that the ratio of F-Golgi/F-ER is close to 1 when the cells are kept at 40 °C and the VSV-G protein is localized in the ER. This is due to the fact that the Golgi apparatus is at the center of the cell and surrounded by ER membranes. The ER membranes are spread throughout the cell, which lowers the average value of fluorescence per pixel. The area of the Golgi apparatus therefore is at an equivalent level of fluorescence as the ER. 20 min after switching to 32 °C, the GFP-VSV-G protein accumulated significantly in the Golgi area, and the ratio F-Golgi/F-ER peaked between 2.5 and 3. The difference of ratio between 0 and 20 min in one cell line was considered very statistically significant (p = 0.005), indicating that our method of quantification is relatively sensitive. The ratio then slowly decreases and again reaches a value close to 1 after 90 min, a time at which most of the VSV-G protein has exited the Golgi apparatus. No statistically significant difference in the kinetics of transport of VSV-G protein between SYF and Src+ could be detected using this procedure (Fig. 5, M). These findings indicate that genetic deletion of Src has no significant effect on the anterograde protein transport. We reported previously that Src activation causes the recruitment of ubiquitin ligase Cbl to the Golgi apparatus (10Bard F. Patel U. Levy J.B. Horne W.C. Jurdic P. Baron R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our current findings reveal that SYF cells (lacking the three kinases Src, Yes, and Fyn) have a compacted Golgi apparatus with bloated cisternae compared with their normal counterparts. This compacted morphology reverts to normal when Src is expressed exogenously in SYF cells. Src family tyrosine kinases are thus required for the maintenance of normal Golgi apparatus organization. Whether Fyn and Yes can have similar effects on the Golgi apparatus is not currently known. We found that the amount of KDEL-R in the Golgi membranes in SYF and NIH3T3 cells is decreased upon expression of an activated form of Src, SrcE378G. The effect of Src is specific for KDEL-R, because other Golgi proteins, such as the cis/medial specific mannosidase II, are not affected. Following activation of Src, KDEL-R is found in numerous punctate structures around the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that Src modifies the kinetics of KDEL-R cycle and, hence, its steady-state distribution. To test whether Src regulates retrograde traffic, we used the Pseudomonas exotoxin, which binds to KDEL-R in the Golgi apparatus for transport to the ER. In the absence of Src or following its inhibition by the drug SU6656, the retrograde traffic of PE was about twice as fast. A possible interpretation of this result is that the expression of Src reduces the availability of KDEL-R to bind PE by rapidly recruiting KDEL-R upon arrival in the Golgi apparatus. Previous studies have shown that the expression of an excess of KDEL ligand had a protective effect on cells exposed to the toxin PE (21Jackson M.E. Simpson J.C. Girod A. Pepperkok R. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, it is conceivable that Src induces a specific substrate to traffic more rapidly to the ER and, thus, decreases the availability of KDEL-R for binding to PE. However, the identity of the ligand that binds to KDEL-R upon Src activation is not known. Using the viral protein VSV-GtsO45 as a marker of anterograde traffic, we could not detect any effect on its transport along the secretory pathway upon genetic deletion (Fig. 5) or by pharmacological inhibition of Src (data not shown). This suggests that Src does not play a major role in constitutive transport of secretory protein. We also tested the kinetics of anterograde traffic of Golgi enzymes from the ER upon recovery of a brefeldin A treatment and we found no difference in SYF and SYFsrc cells.2 As Src-like kinases are not present in yeast, the Src-dependent regulation of retrograde traffic has to be specific for higher eukaryotes. How Src affects the Golgi organization and specific KDELR dynamics are the obvious challenges given the important oncogenic potential of this kinase. We are very grateful to Drs. Klinghoffer and Soriano for providing the cell lines they generated. We thank the members of Dr. Malhotra's lab for their critical reading of the manuscript."

Treatment of cultured neurons with Aβ peptide has been shown to induce apoptosis (3.Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among all the caspases, caspase-3 has been shown to play important roles in the execution phase of apoptosis (17.Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M.

Although the significance of other caspases such as caspase-2 cannot be neglected (15.Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Friedman W.J. Frappier T.F. Brown K. Shelanski M.L. J.

Sugimoto M. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that activation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) are observed in the degenerating neurons of the brains from AD patients (21.Chang R.C.C. Wong A.K. Ng H.K. Hugon J. NeuroReport. 2002; 13: 2429-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and in cultured neuronal cells challenged with Aβ peptide (22.Chang R.C.C. Suen K.C. Ma C.H. Elyaman W. Ng H.K. Hugon J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have also reported that PKR plays a crucial role in mediating Aβ peptide-induced neuronal death, because primary cortical neurons from PKR knockout mice and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with dominant negative of mutant PKR are less susceptible to Aβ peptide toxicity (22.Chang R.C.C. Suen K.C. Ma C.H. Elyaman W. Ng H.K. Hugon J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human PKR consists of 551 amino acids that form two functional domains: an N-terminal dsRNA binding regulatory domain and a C-terminal kinase catalytic domain (23.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Following virus infection, dsRNAs produced by viruses activate PKR after binding to its regulatory domain. As a result, PKR becomes autophosphorylated to further promote its activity. Increasing lines of compelling evidence have shown that PKR can be activated without the presence of dsRNA. Instead, non-dsRNA molecules including polyanions (23.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), PACT (PKR-activating protein) (24.Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and cellular stresses such as serum-deprivation and calcium depletion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (25.Gil J. Esteban M. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) can activate PKR. Activated PKR can phosphorylate eIF2α at serine 51. The phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2β by preventing the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2 so that global protein translation of mRNAs using 5′-cap initiation codon is inhibited leading to apoptosis (26.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). In addition to the translational regulation, PKR also mediates apoptosis by controlling the activation of several transcriptional factors (25.Gil J. Esteban M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 249Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), how PKR is activated by Aβ peptide in neurons is still unclear. In the present study, we aim to examine the upstream signaling pathways of PKR triggered by Aβ peptide in neurons. Our previous report (22.Chang R.C.C. Suen K.C. Ma C.H. Elyaman W. Ng H.K. Hugon J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) has shown that activation of caspase-3 occurs within a short period of time after exposure of Aβ peptide. Therefore, we further investigated whether this early activation of caspase-3 is required for the activation of PKR in Aβ peptide-induced neuronal apoptosis. We found that inhibition of caspase-3 activity attenuated phosphorylation of PKR in neurons exposed to Aβ peptide. We also provided novel information that upstream signals for caspase-3 activation including calcium release from the ER and the activation of caspase-8 could mediate Aβ peptide-triggered PKR activation. Our results suggest that early activation of caspase-3 could function as pro-apoptotic signaling machinery rather than its role as an executioner in apoptosis. Taken together, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of how PKR is activated in Aβ peptide neurotoxicity. Understanding the signaling pathway of PKR activation may help to develop therapeutic intervention against neuronal apoptosis in Aβ peptide toxicity. Primary Cell Cultures of Cortical Neurons—Cell cultures were carried out as described previously (22.Chang R.C.C. Suen K.C. Ma C.H. Elyaman W. Ng H.K. Hugon J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33.Elyaman W. Terro F. Suen K.C. Yardin C. Chang R.C.C. Hugon J. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices from 17-day-old embryos of Sprague-Dawley rats (The Laboratory Animal Unit, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong) were removed and mechanically dissociated in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with glucose (18 mm). Neurons were then seeded onto poly-l-lysine (25 μg/ml)-coated 6-well plates at 2.2 × 106 cells/well. Neurons were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), glucose (18 mm), l-glutamine (2 mm), insulin (5 μg/ml), progesterone (0.02 μm), putrescine (100 μm), selenium (30 pm), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Deoxyfluorouridine/uridine (2 μm) was added to the cultures to prevent the growth of non-neuronal cells. Neurons were cultured for 7 days prior to treatments. Treatments—Cortical neurons at 7 days in vitro were pretreated with a cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO; Calbiochem) at 100 μm for 1 h, a cell-permeable caspase-8 inhibitor (IETD-CHO; Calbiochem) at 40 μm for 1 h, or an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist Xestospongin C (XeC; Calbiochem) at 1 μm for 2 h in serum-free medium, followed by Aβ peptide 25–35 (Aβ25–35 peptide; Sigma) at 25 μm or Aβ peptide 1–42 (Aβ1–42 peptide; Biopeptide Company, San Diego, CA) at 25 μm in serum-free medium. The peptides were incubated in autoclaved Milli-Q water at 37 °C for 3 days prior to use. Western Blot Analysis—After treatments, neurons were scratched and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing Tris (10 mm, pH 7.4), NaCl (100 mm), EDTA (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm), NaF (1 mm), Na4P2O7 (20 mm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), glycerol (10%), SDS (0.1%), deoxycholate (0.5%), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Quantity of protein content in the supernatant was measured by using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and was then incubated with rabbit anti-eIF2α (polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-phosphorylated eIF2α at serine 51 (polyclonal, 1:500 dilution; BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), rabbit anti-PKR (polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling), mouse anti-PKR (monoclonal, 1:500 dilution; BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) (polyclonal, 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or mouse anti-β-actin (monoclonal, 1:5000 dilution; Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature (20–25 °C) or rabbit anti phosphorylated PKR at threonine 446 and 451 (polyclonal, 1:800 dilution; Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies used in the present study have been well characterized by the companies and our laboratories. Bands were visualized on a Biomax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Immunoprecipitation of PKR was done as described elsewhere (34.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After treatments, neurons were scratched and lysed in ice-cold E1A buffer containing HEPES (pH 7.6, 50 mm), NaCl (250 mm), Nonidet P-40 (0.1%), EDTA (5 mm), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Quantity of protein content in the supernatant was measured by using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 150 μg of cellular proteins were pre-cleared with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow; Amersham Biosciences). The unbounded proteins were then incubated with a monoclonal PKR antibody (100 μg protein/1.5 μg antibody; BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was then added and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads four times with E1A buffer, the immunoprecipitated samples were subject to Western blot analysis according to the method mentioned before. Caspase Activity Assay—After treatments, neurons were scratched and lysed in lysis buffer without protease and phosphatase inhibitors for caspase activity assays (BIOSOURCE). The lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 μg of cellular proteins from the supernatant were used for different caspase activity assays. For colorimetric activity assays, substrates for caspase-3 (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide, Ac-DEVD-pNA; Calbiochem) or caspase-8 (Ac-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-p-nitroanilide, Ac-IETD-pNA; Calbiochem) were incubated with the protein extracts for 2 h at 37 °C to yield a yellow-brown product p-nitroanilide, which was measured by a spectrophotometric reader at 405 nm. For fluorogenic activity assays, fluorogenic signals from the cleaved product of the caspase-7 substrate (MCA-Val-Asp-Gln-Val-Asp-Gly-Trp-Lys-(DNP)-NH2, MCA-VDQVDGWK-(DNP)-NH2; Calbiochem) were measured with excitation and emission wavelengths at 320 and 405 nm, respectively, after2hof incubation at 37 °C. Measurement of Intracellular Free Calcium Levels—Intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) were determined by fluorescence imaging with acetoxymethyl-fura 2 (fura 2-AM; Calbiochem) using the methods described previously (35.Yu Z. Luo H. Fu W. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 155: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Briefly, after pretreatment with XeC, cultured neurons were incubated with 5 μm fura 2-AM for 30 min at 37 °C for dye loading, followed by washing with Hanks' balanced saline supplemented with HEPES (10 mm) twice and glucose (10 mm) and a 30-min pre-incubation prior to calcium imaging. [Ca2+]i in 20–30 neuronal cell bodies per microscopic field was monitored under an inverted microscope prior to and after exposure of neurons to Aβ25–35 peptide at 25 μm. The mean of [Ca2+]i from at least four separate cultures was determined from the ratio of the fluorescence emissions using two different excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) according to the formula [Ca2+]i = Kd[(R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R)] (Fo/Fs). Statistical Analysis—Data for multiple variable comparisons were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For the comparison of significance, Tukey's test was used as an ad hoc test according to a statistical program SigmaStat® (Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). The level of significance was p < 0.05. For the comparison of significance between two groups, Student's t test was conducted at the level of significance of p < 0.05 or < 0.001 with SigmaStat® (Jandel Scientific). Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Aβ Peptide Induced Early Activation of Caspase-3—We have shown previously (22.Chang R.C.C. Suen K.C. Ma C.H. Elyaman W. Ng H.K. Hugon J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that PKR and eIF2α play significant roles in Aβ peptide-induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in degenerating neurons of the brains from AD patients (21.Chang R.C.C. Wong A.K. Ng H.K. Hugon J. NeuroReport. 2002; 13: 2429-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, how Aβ peptide activates PKR in neurons is still unclear. In the present study, we aim to examine the upstream signaling pathways leading to the activation of PKR in Aβ peptide neurotoxicity. Because we have shown that PKR is activated less than 2 h upon the treatment with Aβ peptide in primary cortical neurons (22.Chang R.C.C. Suen K.C. Ma C.H. Elyaman W. Ng H.K. Hugon J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we search for any possible candidates that may start to participate in the Aβ peptide-triggered apoptotic process in a short moment of time. A time course study of caspase-3 specific activity indicated that caspase-3 was significantly (p < 0.05) activated in neurons 1 h after the treatment with Aβ25–35 peptide at 25 μm (0.29 + 0.01 pmol/min/μg; see Fig. 1a) when compared with the corresponding control (0.23 + 0.01 pmol/min/μg; see Fig. 1a). The Aβ25–35 peptide-induced caspase-3 activity progressively augmented in a time-dependent manner from 1 to 16 h (Fig. 1a). To study the role of caspase-3 in the activation of PKR in Aβ peptide neurotoxicity, one of the possible ways is to inhibit caspase-3 by a specific caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO). We at first verified the effectiveness of this caspase-3 inhibitor in our experimental model. Caspase-3 activity induced by Aβ25–35 peptide in cultured neurons at 2 and 7 h was significantly blocked by 100 μm DEVD-CHO, which was added 1 h prior to the exposure of Aβ25–35 peptide (Fig. 1b). DEVD-CHO at 100 μm did not show any toxicity to the neurons (data not shown). In addition to the blocking effect on caspase-3, DEVD-CHO might also inhibit caspase-7. Despite the cross-inhibitory effects, our results demonstrated that caspase-7 was not significantly (p < 0.05) activated 2 and 7 h after the treatment with Aβ25–35 peptide at 25 μm (Fig. 1c). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of DEVD-CHO on caspase-7 could be neglected in our present study. Inhibition of Caspase-3 Activity Attenuated Aβ Peptide-induced Phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α—Having shown that caspase-3 was early activated by Aβ peptide, and the caspase-3 activity can be significantly inhibited by DEVD-CHO, we then study whether modulation of caspase-3 activity can mediate the activation of PKR-eIF2α pathway. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 25 μm Aβ25–35 peptide induced an increased phosphorylation of PKR at threonine 446 and 451 in neurons when compared with the corresponding controls (Fig. 2a). Pretreatment of neurons with 100 μm DEVD-CHO for 1 h markedly reduced the Aβ25–35 peptide-induced PKR phosphorylation (Fig. 2a). 100 μm DEVD-CHO per se did not induce PKR phosphorylation (Fig. 2a). There was no other band detected near the region of 38 to 48 kDa (the kinase fragment), indicating that no cleaved PKR was phosphorylated at threonine 446 and 451 (data not shown). Fig. 2b shows that 25 μm Aβ25–35 peptide induced phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 in neurons, and pretreatment of neurons with 100 μm DEVD-CHO for 1 h markedly reduced the eIF2α phosphorylation. In controls, there was also a mild expression of the phosphorylated PKR (Fig. 2a) and phosphorylated eIF2α (Fig. 2b), which was possibly because of the effects of serum deprivation during experimental treatments. Inhibition of Caspase-3 Activity Blocked Aβ Peptide-induced Cleavage of eIF2α and PKR—Previous reports have shown that PKR and eIF2α can be cleaved by caspase-3. To further demonstrate that caspase-3 is actively involved in neurons exposed to Aβ peptide, we study whether caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PKR and eIF2α occurs in our model. There is an additional form of eIF2α, migrating with a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility than the full-length eIF2α in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, a and b). This additional form of eIF2α is its cleaved form. The difference in the molecular mass between the full-length and cleaved form of eIF2α proteins shown in Fig. 3, a and b is about 2–3 kDa, which is in agreement with the previous findings (36.Saelens X. Kalai M. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41620-41628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37.Marissen W.E. Guo Y. Thomas A.A. Matts R.L. Lloyd R.E. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 342: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In controls, in addition to the appearance of the full-length form of eIF2α, the cleaved bands were also observed (Fig. 3, a and b), which is possibly related to the effects of serum deprivation during experimental treatments. This is because some proteases including caspases and calpain could be activated in cultured neurons under the serum-free condition (39.Canu N. Dus L. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Brancolini C. Rinaldi A.M. Novak M. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Kruidering M. Schouten T. Evan G.I. Vreugdenhil E. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the complete inhibition of caspase-3 activity cannot fully prevent the cleavage of eIF2α in the controls, there might be some other proteases responsible for this cleavage under the serum-free condition. Neurons exposed to Aβ25–35 peptide appeared to have the cleaved form of eIF2α only, indicating that the full-length form of the protein was totally cleaved (Fig. 3, a and b). Aβ35–25 peptide, a reverse peptide of Aβ25–35 as a negative control, did not induce cleavage of eIF2α when compared with the corresponding control (Fig. 3b). Aβ25–35 peptide-induced cleavage of eIF2α was blocked by pretreating neurons with 100 μm DEVD-CHO for 1 h (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3, c and d indicates that treatment of neurons with Aβ25–35 peptide at 25 μm also induced a cleavage of PKR. Western blot analysis using an antibody against the C-terminal kinase domain of PKR demonstrated that the molecular mass of cleaved PKR was nearly 43 kDa (Fig. 3, c and d), which is in agreement with the recent findings (36.Saelens X. Kalai M. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41620-41628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A mild expression of cleaved PKR was visualized in some controls, which might be because of the effects of serum deprivation (Fig. 3, c and d). The cleavage of PKR induced by Aβ25–35 peptide did not appear as complete cleavage as seen in eIF2α, because a large portion of the full-length form of PKR was detected (Fig. 3, c and d). Aβ35–25 peptide, a reverse peptide of Aβ25–35 as a negative control in this experiment, did not induce proteolysis of PKR when compared with the corresponding control (Fig. 3d). Inhibition of caspase-3 activity by using 50 or 100 μm DEVD-CHO blocked Aβ25–35 peptide-induced cleavage of PKR in neurons, indicating that caspase-3 is responsible for this cleavage (Fig. 3c).

A change in expression levels of the enzymes responsible for tailoring these glycoconjugates has been associated with many pathological conditions and it is therefore surprising that little information is known regarding the mechanism of action of these important catabolic enzymes. Thermotoga maritima, a thermophilic bacterium, produces a wide range of carbohydrate-processing enzymes including a 52-kDa α-l-fucosidase that has 38% sequence identity and 56% similarity to human fucosidases.

This article presents the first direct identification of the catalytic nucleophile of an α-l-fucosidase, a key step in the understanding of these important enzymes. α-l-Fucosidases (EC 3.2.1.51) are exoglycosidases unique to family 29 in the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases (1Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). 1P. M. Coutinho and B. Henrissat, Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server: afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index. They are responsible for the removal of l-fucosyl residues from the non-reducing end of glycoconjugates, the most common linkages being α1–2 to galactose and α1–3, α1–4, and α1–6 to N-acetylglucosamine residues. Inactivity of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of fucose-containing glycolipids and glycoproteins in various tissues and results in the clinical condition fucosidosis (3Michalski J.C. Klein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In humans this autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease can arise from many different mutations to the FUCA1 gene and, while rare, is a terminal degenerative condition (4Willems P.J. Seo H.C. Coucke P. Tonlorenzi R. O'Brien J.S. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

Sci. 1991; 16: 84-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in fucosylation levels have been observed in many carcinomas (9Hosono J. Narita T. Kimura N.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although many α-l-fucosidases have been identified, their detailed catalytic mechanism and the identities of key active site residues have not yet been elucidated. A complete understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of enzymes is required to enable therapeutic intervention. Recent work has demonstrated that α-l-fucosidases are retaining enzymes; the hydrolyzed hemiacetal product bears the same stereochemical configuration as the original glycoside (11Berteau O. McCort I. Goasdoue N. Tissot B. Daniel R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Cobucci-Ponzano B. Trincone A. Giordano A. Rossi M. Moracci M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14622-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of these cases this stereochemical outcome arises from a double displacement mechanism within the enzyme active site. This mechanism requires the action of two critical amino acid residues with specific roles for catalysis: one functioning as a general acid/base, the other as a nucleophile. In this class of enzymes these residues are usually found to be carboxylic acids. Glycoside hydrolysis requires the action of the general acid catalyst to assist in the departure of the aglycone oxygen. Simultaneously the other carboxylate residue acts as a nucleophile, attacking the anomeric center of the glycone, generating a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Upon diffusion of the aglycone from the active site, this glycosyl-enzyme is subsequently hydrolyzed with general base assistance from the acid/base residue. The hemiacetal thus released retains the same anomeric orientation as the original glycoside because an overall double inversion of configuration has taken place. The identification of these key residues is of fundamental importance to the understanding of the detailed molecular mechanism through which these enzymes operate. General Procedures and Synthesis—All buffer chemicals and other reagents were obtained from the Sigma unless otherwise noted. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride was synthesized by known methodology (13Korytnyk W. Valentekovic-Horvath S. Petrie C.R.I. Tetrahedron. 1982; 38: 2547-2550Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cloning, Purification, and Mutagenesis—The coding sequence of the Thermotoga maritima (TM) gene TM0306 was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang Liebl) and subcloned into the pDEST17 plasmid (Gateway, Invitrogen) introducing a 15-residue linker and a His6 tag at the N terminus. Protein expression was carried out in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain and cells were lysed by lysozyme treatment and subsequent freeze-thawing. Protein was purified by Ni2+ affinity and size exclusion chromatographies and sample purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The D224A mutant was generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), verified by DNA sequencing, but the protein expressed in the conditions described above was insoluble. The coding sequence was therefore subcloned into a derivative of the expression vector pKM596 (14Fox J.D. Routzahn K.M. Bucher M.H. Waugh D.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in which a His6 tag was introduced upstream of the coding sequence of the maltose-binding protein, allowing the expression of the mutant as a His6-MBP 2The abbreviations used are: MBPmaltose-binding proteina → aaxial → axiale → eequatorial → equatorialpNP4-nitrophenolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. fusion protein. Expression and purification were carried out as for the native enzyme. The wild type protein was also expressed and purified as a His6-MBP fusion protein for comparison.

Labeling and Proteolysis—Labeling of T. maritima α-l-fucosidase was accomplished by incubating the His6-wild type enzyme (2.43 mg ml–1 final concentration) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride (2.5 mm final concentration) in pH 5.0, 50 mm citrate/phosphate buffer (80 μl total volume) for 1 h at room temperature. After this time digestion buffer (120 μl), pH 2.0, containing pepsin (0.3 mg ml–1) was added. Proteolytic digestion was performed for 1 h and the sample was frozen prior to mass spectrometric analysis. A sample of unlabeled enzyme for comparison was also prepared in the same manner. Electrospray Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the Proteolytic Digest— Mass spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API 300 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer and a PE-Sciex API QSTAR pulsar i (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an ionspray ion source. Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a LC Packing UltiMate Micro HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. In each of the MS experiments the proteolytic digest was loaded onto a C-18 column (LC Packing, 100-Å pepMap, 1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with solvent A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water). Elution of the peptides was accomplished using a gradient (0–60%) of solvent B over 60 min followed by 85% solvent B over 20 min (solvent B: 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water). Solvents were pumped at a constant flow rate of 50 μl/min. Spectra were recorded in the single quadrupole scan mode or the tandem MS product-ion scan mode. In the single-quadrupole mode the quadrupole mass analyzer was scanned over a mass to charge ratio (m/z) range of 300–2200 Da with a step size of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 1.5 ms per step. The ion source voltage was set at 5.5 kV, and the orifice energy was 45 V. In the tandem MS daughter-ion scan mode, the spectra were obtained in a separate experiment by selectively introducing the labeled (m/z = 927.5) or unlabeled (m/z = 853) parent ion from the first quadrupole (Q1) into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the product ions in the third quadrupole (Q3). The scan range of Q3 was 50–1100; the step size was 0.5; the dwell time was 1 ms; ion source voltage was 5 kV; orifice energy was 45 V; Q0 = –10; and IQ2 = –48. Metal Ion Dependence—Aliquots (100 μl) of His6-wild type and MBP-wild type α-l-fucosidase were placed into a mini dialysis unit (Pierce) with a molecular weight cut off of 10,000. These units were then dialyzed against a buffer of pH 7.5, 15 mm HEPES containing 10 mm EDTA for 2 h to remove any contaminating divalent metal ions. The dialysis buffer solution was then changed for a fresh solution and dialysis continued for a further 12 h. The dialysis units were then dialyzed against a fresh, pH 7.5, 5 mm HEPES buffer for 2 h to remove residual EDTA. Again the buffer was changed for a fresh solution and dialysis continued for a further 12 h. Enzyme activity of these two proteins was then assayed in the manner described below both in the presence and absence of divalent metal cations. Enzyme Kinetics—All kinetic studies were performed in 50 mm buffer containing 145 mm sodium chloride and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For the pH range 3.0–6.5 a sodium citrate/sodium phosphate buffer was used. Sodium phosphate buffer was used between pH 6.5 and 8.0. Kinetic measurements using the pNP-fucoside substrate and the His6-wild type enzyme were performed at 60 °C, the enzyme showing no loss of activity after 24 h incubation at this temperature. Reactions involving the MBP were performed at the reduced temperature of 37 °C. A total reaction volume of 800 μl was used in these assays. At pH 5.5 and above a continuous spectrophotometric assay was used to monitor the release of the p-nitrophenolate anion at 400 nm. For measurements at acidic pH the p-nitrophenol product was monitored at 360 nm. Extinction coefficients were determined for each pH point at 60 °C by the method of Kempton and Withers (15Kempton J.B. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9961-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar); pH 3.55, ϵ(360 nm) = 1.66 mm–1 cm–1; pH 4.02, ϵ(360 nm) = 1.70 mm–1 cm–1; pH 4.45, ϵ(360 nm) = 1.74 mm–1 cm–1; pH 5.0, ϵ(360 nm) = 1.81 mm–1 cm–1; pH 5.51, ϵ(400 nm) = 2.13 mm–1 cm–1; pH 6.02, ϵ(400 nm) = 3.66 mm–1 cm–1; pH 6.52, ϵ(400 nm) = 7.38 mm–1 cm–1; pH 6.99, ϵ(400 nm) = 11.39 mm–1 cm–1; pH 7.45, ϵ(400 nm) = 14.22 mm–1 cm–1; pH 8.03, ϵ(400 nm) = 17.26 mm–1 cm–1. Spectroscopic measurements were performed on temperature-stabilized Cary AV-300 and Cary AV-4000 spectrophotometers. The hydrolysis of the α-l-fucosyl fluoride substrates was monitored using a 96–09 Ionplus Orion fluoride ion selective electrode to detect the release of fluoride. This instrument was coupled to a PC and the data collected using the Logger Pro™ program (Vernier Software Inc.). These assays were performed at 25 °C to minimize substrate hydrolysis and were conducted in glass vials with a total assay volume of 700 μl. For each Michaelis-Menten curve generated the initial rates of 6–8 substrate concentrations were used. Wherever possible the substrate concentration was varied from 0.2 to 5 times Km. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were calculated by fitting of the initial rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Grafit version 4.0 (16Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit 4.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1998Google Scholar). In all cases the observed rate was corrected for background substrate hydrolysis. Similar methodology was used for the analysis of methanol as a competitive nucleophile. TLC analysis of products was performed using aluminum-backed Merck Silica Gel 60 F254 plates (chloroform:methanol:water, 20:6:1). pH Dependence—Because of the low Km of pNP-fucoside, the substrate depletion method for determination of the apparent second-order rate constant kcat/Km could not be applied. The pH dependence of the His6-wild type enzyme was therefore determined by performing standard Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis at increments of 0.5 pH units. Chemical Rescue of Alanine Mutant—Assays with azide were performed at pH 6.0 in 50 mm citrate/phosphate buffer. This perturbation from the pH optimum, pH 4.5–5.0, was required because of the relatively high pKa of hydrazoic acid (pKa 4.8). An additional benefit of this pH was the increased extinction coefficient of the p-nitrophenolate anion. Sodium azide (4 m, buffered to pH 6.0) was added at varying concentrations and the rate of product release monitored. Assays with formate as rescue agent were performed at pH 5.0 in a similar fashion with substrate concentrations in the range of 400–600 μm. Assays of the D224A MBP fusion protein with pNP-fucoside were conducted at a temperature of 37 °C because of the lower thermal stability of the MBP construct. Reaction times were increased to 4–12 h to compensate for the very slow rate of reaction; the reaction was observed to be linear across this time range, indicating no loss of enzyme activity. Metal Ion Dependence—Because metal ion affinity chromatography was used in the purification of the His6-wild type enzyme, an analysis of any possible metal ion dependence of the enzyme was carried out. No loss of activity of the His6-wild type or the MBP-wild type enzymes was observed upon extensive dialysis against EDTA. Inclusion of 10 mm EDTA in the reaction mixture also did not affect the rate of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. Addition of various divalent metal cations (calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc) at 10 mm concentrations did not increase enzymatic rates; only a small decrease being observed in some cases. A small positive salt effect was noticed at high concentrations of sodium chloride, therefore subsequent assays were performed in the presence of 145 mm sodium chloride. Kinetic Analysis and pH Dependence—Kinetic parameters for the cleavage of pNP-fucoside by the His6-wild type enzyme were determined and a representative plot is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, substrate inhibition was observed at high pNP-fucoside concentrations. Fitting these data to a substrate inhibition model in Grafit 4.0, in which inhibition arises from the binding of a second substrate molecule to form an ES2 complex that is catalytically inactive (17Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman, New York1985Google Scholar), yields values of kcat = 9.4 s–1, Km = 35 μm, and Ki = 640 μm at pH 5.0. The kcat and Km values were in close agreement to those obtained when only low substrate concentrations (0–100 μm) were analyzed by best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation; kcat = 9.1 s–1, Km = 32 μm. In light of this observation the maximum concentration of pNP-fucoside employed in further experiments was 100 μm. Values of kcat and Km were determined at 60 °C for the hydrolysis of pNP-fucoside by α-l-fucosidase-His6 as a function of pH. The enzyme was found to be unstable at pH 3.0 with rapid inactivation occurring. This inactivation was assigned to enzyme denaturation because activity could not be recovered upon restoring the pH to 6.0. The pH dependence of kcat/Km shows a typical bell-shaped curve expected from the presence of two ionizable carboxylic acid residues in the enzyme active site with a pH optimum of 5.0 (Fig. 2). Fitting the data to a double titration curve to yield pKa values of these two residues in the free enzyme gave estimates of 3.8 and 6.1 (±0.1), presumably the catalytic nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, respectively. The pH dependence of kcat, which represents the ionization of the two key catalytic residues during the rate-determining step of catalysis, is also seen to be a bell-shaped curve with an optimum at pH 4.5 (Fig. 2). The pKa values in this case are similar, being 3.4 and 5.7 (±0.1), although the acidic limb of this profile is not well defined because of the limited stability of the enzyme at low pH.Fig. 2pH dependence of kcat and kcat/Km of wild type T. maritima α-l-fucosidase. The lines represent the best fit of the data to the double titration model in Grafit 4.0; •) kcat, ▪) kcat/Km. All reactions were performed at 60 °C with pNP-fucoside as substrate. The enzyme was too unstable at pH values of less than 3.5 for any kinetic parameters to be determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) α-l-Fucosyl fluoride was also investigated as a substrate, these assays being performed at 25 °C because of the significant spontaneous hydrolysis of the fucosyl fluoride at elevated temperatures (Table I). The catalytic activity (kcat) of the His6-wild type enzyme with this substrate was similar to that observed for pNP-fucoside, however, no inhibition was observed at higher substrate concentrations. The higher Km observed for fucosyl fluoride is most reasonably rationalized by the absence of an aglycone able to contribute binding interactions in the +1 subsite. That a significantly increased rate was not observed upon replacement of the aglycone with a considerably superior leaving group is highly indicative of a deglycosylation ratelimiting step for both of these substrates (pKa pNP = 7.2, pKa hydrogen fluoride = 3.2). To demonstrate that deglycosylation is in fact the rate-determining step for these substrates a nucleophilic competition experiment was performed. The addition of an uncharged exogenous nucleophile to the reaction mixture would not be expected to have any effect upon the rate of the first step of enzyme catalysis (glycosylation). Therefore, were this to be the rate-determining step, no increase in steady state rate would be expected. However, the rate of deglycosylation may be increased because of the faster cleavage of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate with the exogenous nucleophile than with water. Addition of various concentrations of methanol to the reaction mixture caused a linear increase in rate with increasing methanol concentration for both pNP-fucoside and fucosyl fluoride (Fig. 3). TLC analysis of the products formed in this reaction showed a new product (RF = 0.60) with an intermediate mobility between pNP-fucoside (RF = 0.76) and fucose (RF = 0.26). This new product was observed to co-run with an authentic sample of methyl-α-l-fucopyranoside, confirming that the expected product is indeed formed. Formation of this new product was not observed in control reactions performed in the absence of either methanol or enzyme. Deglycosylation is therefore at least partially rate-limiting for both of these substrates.Table IKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of fucoside substrates by T. maritima α-l-fucosidaseEnzymeSubstratekcatKMkcat/KMs-1μmm-1 s-1Wild typepNP-fucosideaMeasured at pH 5.0, 37 °C.5.4 ± 0.234 ± 21.6 ± 0.1 × 105MBP-wild typepNP-fucosideaMeasured at pH 5.0, 37 °C.14.3 ± 0.350 ± 32.8 ± 0.2 × 105MBP-D224ApNP-fucosideaMeasured at pH 5.0, 37 °C.NDbND, not determined.ND28 ± 1cNo saturation observed.Wild typeFucosyl fluoridedMeasured at pH 5.0, 25 °C.2.9 ± 0.1230 ± 201.3 ± 0.1 × 104MBP-wild typeFucosyl fluoridedMeasured at pH 5.0, 25 °C.7.6 ± 0.2150 ± 105.0 ± 0.4 × 104D224AFucosyl fluoridedMeasured at pH 5.0, 25 °C.<0.01eAt 500 μm fucosyl fluoride.NDNDa Measured at pH 5.0, 37 °C.b ND, not determined.c No saturation observed.d Measured at pH 5.0, 25 °C.e At 500 μm fucosyl fluoride. Open table in a new tab Approaches to Mechanism-based Inhibition—α-l-Fucosides can adopt two low energy chair conformations, 4C1 and 1C4, the 1C4 conformation being predominantly preferred in solution (Fig. 4). This latter conformation, with an axial oriented aglycone, may undergo enzymatic cleavage in a fashion similar to that of α-d-retaining enzymes; such a reaction being described as a → a (18Sinnott M.L. Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987Google Scholar). Conversely the 4C1 conformer might be processed by an e → e mechanism analogous to β-d-glycosidases. The importance of this a → a or e → e classification is not merely represented by the nomenclature imposed but rather by the different approaches that must be employed to successfully label the catalytic nucleophile. The primary method for the identification of the catalytic nucleophile in retaining glycosidases has been through the use of substrate analogs that form a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate at a rate that far exceeds that of the subsequent hydrolysis step. The consequence of this situation is the accumulation of a glycosylenzyme intermediate, and in many cases complete inactivation of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. Proteolysis can then be used to create small peptides for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer and the location of the modified carboxylate residue identified. In the case of β-retaining glycosidases, activated 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosides have proven very successful (19Withers S.G. Warren R.A. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem.

This approach has been found to be less successful with α-retaining glycosidases where these 2-fluorosugars are generally observed to be slow substrates for which the glycosylation step is rate-limiting (23Withers S.G. Rupitz K. Street I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7929-7932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24McCarter J.D. Adam M.J. Braun C. Namchuk M. Tull D. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this situation no glycosyl-enzyme intermediate accumulates. To address this problem, two other classes of mechanism-based inactivators have been developed. These are the 2,2-difluoroglycosides (25Braun C. Brayer G.D. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26778-26781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which incorporate very activated leaving groups, and the 5-fluoroglycosyl fluorides (26McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 241-242Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), both of which have been used successfully to label the catalytic nucleophiles of α-retaining glycosidases (27Mosi R.M. Withers S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 64-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The classification of both α-l-iduronidases and β-d-xylosidases to the same glycoside hydrolase family 39 attests to the occasional commonality between α-l- and β-d-glycosides. Moreover, recent work within this laboratory has conclusively demonstrated that α-l-iduronidases and β-d-xylosidases react through similar glycosyl-enzyme intermediates (28Nieman C.E. Wong A.W. He S. Clarke L. Hopwood J.J. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8054-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In that study the catalytic nucleophile of the human α-l-iduronidase was labeled using both a 5-fluoroglycosyl fluoride and a 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosyl fluoride analog of iduronic acid. Because α-l-fucosidases are alone in family 29, with no other glycosidases assigned to that family, there is some ambiguity regarding the nature of the mechanism (a → a versus e → e). Based on the success of the 2-deoxy-2-fluorosugar approach with the human α-l-iduronidase (28Nieman C.E. Wong A.W. He S. Clarke L. Hopwood J.J. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8054-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we elected to first synthesize and test the more readily accessible 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucosyl fluoride as a probe to identify the catalytic nucleophile of the T. maritima α-l-fucosidase. The synthesis of this mechanistic probe was readily achieved following known methodology (13Korytnyk W. Valentekovic-Horvath S. Petrie C.R.I. Tetrahedron. 1982; 38: 2547-2550Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reaction of α-l-Fucosidase with 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl Fluoride—Incubation of the enzyme with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride did not lead to time-dependent inhibition of activity. To determine whether this compound was instead behaving as a substrate, or merely not binding in the enzyme active site, kinetic analysis of its cleavage using a fluoride ion-selective electrode was undertaken. Monitoring the rate of fluoride release showed that 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride was indeed a slow Michaelian substrate with kcat = 0.047 ± 0.003 s–1 and Km = 2.1 ± 0.2 mm. This kcat value is very similar to those previously published for fluorosugar substrates with other α-glycosidases; 0.022 s–1 for 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride with the family 38 α-mannosidase from bovine kidney (29Numao S. He S.M. Evjen G. Howard S. Tollersrud O.K. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and 0.055 s–1 observed with 5-fluoro-α-d-glucosyl fluoride and the family 31 α-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger (30Lee S.S. He S.M. Withers S.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 381-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substantially increased Km of 2.1 mm over fucosyl fluoride (Km = 232 μm) is likely because of the loss of key binding interactions with the 2-hydroxyl group. The 2-hydroxyl group is apparently involved in key interactions necessary for both binding and catalysis because the purely electronic difference of this substitution (ΔσI = 0.25 for OH → F) is unlikely to be solely responsible for the 2300-fold difference in catalytic efficiency (31Lowry T.H. Richardson K.S. Physical Organic Chemistry. Harper Collins, New York1985Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous observations of the key role of the 2-hydroxyl in catalysis (32Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the Active Site Nucleophile—No inhibition of enzyme activity, time-dependent or competitive, was observed in the presence of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride. Whereas this might suggest that no intermediate accumulates, it is quite possible that any accumulated intermediate turns over rapidly via transglycosylation to pNP-fucoside during the activity assay. This situation has previously been observed with other glycosidases inactivated with fluorosugars (22Wicki J. Rose D.R. Withers S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 84-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, a rate-limiting deglycosylation step for 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride, which would result in accumulation of the intermediate, seemed quite probable given that such is the case for pNP-fucoside and presumably also α-l-fucosyl fluoride, given the similarities in kcat values. Unfortunately because the intact protein was not amenable to electrospray mass spectrometric analysis we could not look for such accumulation directly. It was therefore necessary to analyze the peptides formed after proteolysis. Following incubation of the enzyme with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucosyl fluoride, the enzyme was diluted into pH 2 buffer. Immediate proteolysis with pepsin was then used to generate peptide fragments of a size that could be analyzed by reverse-p"

Although KSR is a positive regulator of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, the role of KSR in Cot-mediated MAPK activation has not been identified. The serine/threonine kinase Cot (also known as Tpl2) is a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family that is known to regulate oncogenic and inflammatory pathways; however, the mechanism(s) of its regulation are not precisely known. In this report, we identify an 830-amino acid novel human KSR, designated hKSR-2, using predictions from genomic data base mining based on the structural profile of the KSR kinase domain. We show that, similar to the known human KSR, hKSR-2 co-immunoprecipitates with many signaling components of the Ras/MAPK pathway, including Ras, Raf, MEK-1, and ERK-1/2. In addition, we demonstrate that hKSR-2 co-immunoprecipitates with Cot and that co-expression of hKSR-2 with Cot significantly reduces Cot-mediated MAPK and NF-κB activation. This inhibition is specific to Cot, because Ras-induced ERK and IκB kinase-induced NF-κB activation are not significantly affected by hKSR-2 co-expression. Moreover, Cot-induced interleukin-8 production in HeLa cells is almost completely inhibited by the concurrent expression of hKSR-2, whereas transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)/TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1)-induced interleukin-8 production is not affected by hKSR-2 co-expression.

KSR was initially isolated by selection and complementation of genetic mutations in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (1Sundaram M. Han M.

Unlike Raf, KSR does not contain a consensus Ras binding domain (RBD) (3Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

Given that KSR lacks several key properties of a protein kinase, including a conserved lysine in its kinase subdomain II, the role of its kinase activity is still unsettled.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4088-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), is a serine/threonine kinase in the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family (MAP3K8) (16Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cot expression has been shown to induce ERK and JNK activation (17Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D.

Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similar to Raf, Cot is a MEK-1 kinase upstream of ERK pathway. Overexpression of Cot in CD3-activated T cells leads to IL-2 production, suggesting that Cot may play a role in T cell activation (19Ballester A. Tobena R. Lisbona C. Calvo V. Alemany S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gilks C.B. Bear S.E. Grimes H.L. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, Cot has been shown to activate members of the NF-κB family, possibly by activating the IκB kinase (IKK) complex through the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) or by inducing the degradation of the inhibitory protein p105 (21Kane L.P.

Recent studies using Cot knock-out mice point to a pivotal role of Cot in the LPS-induced production of TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (17Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4831-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Despite these various important cellular functions, the precise molecular mechanism of Cot regulation remains unsolved. Given that activation of both Cot and Raf lead to activation of downstream MAP kinase pathway components and that KSR is known to function as a regulatory scaffold protein in the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway, we have evaluated the functional interrelationship of Cot and hKSR-2. Using a structure-based data base mining approach with a conserved kinase domain module, we have identified and cloned a novel KSR family member, hKSR-2. Similar to C. elegans KSR-2, this clone appears to be lacking the CA1 domain of the KSR family and has 66% nucleotide identity and 61% amino acid identity with the known human KSR. hKSR-2 interacts with Cot when ectopically expressed in HEK-293T cells, and hKSR-2 expression attenuates Cot-mediated ERK and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, the co-expression of hKSR-2 blocks Cot-mediated IL-8 production in HeLa cells. These data suggest a novel inhibitory role for hKSR-2 in regulating Cot-mediated signal transduction. Cloning and Plasmids—Using the predicted hKSR-2 cDNA sequences (see “Results”), two partial cDNA clones (B11 and F7) were generated by Invitrogen using the human testis Marathon-Ready cDNA library. Full-length hKSR-2 was generated by combining two partial cDNA clones via PCR. The PCR product was inserted in to the Gateway entry vector pENTR/SD-TOPO and subsequently cloned into the destination vector pDEST-40. A FLAG tag was incorporated at the carboxyl terminus of each clone (FLAG primer is 5′-GACTACAAGGATGA CGACGATAAG-3′). The catalytic domain of KSR was generated by designing a PCR primer spanning the lysine residue at position 527 (5′-CACCATGGAGCAGCTGGAGATCGGCGAGCTCATT) and the FLAG tag sequence incorporated at the carboxyl terminus (3′-CTTCAGACGTCTCATGATGTTCCTACTGCTGCTATTCATCCGCGGCG). The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293T, HeLa, and RAW264.7 cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged every 2–3 days as required to maintain log phase growth for all experiments. For immunoblots and kinase assays, HEK-293T cells were transfected either with the full-length or the catalytic domain of hKSR-2 at 10 μg per 1000 μl of calcium phosphate solution (Profection mammalian transfection systems; Promega, Madison, WI). HeLa and RAW264.7 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase assays were performed with either 2.5–5 μg of DNA per well in a 24-well plate or with 5–7 μg/well in a 6-well plate. For hKSR-2 dose-dependent studies, the hKSR-2 plasmid amounts were varied from 0.5 to 4 μg in a 6-well plate, keeping the Cot plasmid concentration constant at 2 μg. For ELISA tests, HeLa cells were transfected at a FuGENE 6-to-DNA ratio of 3 to 2. 48 h post-transfection, the cell culture medium was changed from DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum to DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and then either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 5 h. During the treatments, cells were changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to 0.5% fetal bovine serum containing DMEM. The various plasmids with epitope tags used include hKSR-2-FLAG, Cot-Myc, TAK1-FLAG, and TAB1-Myc for various immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation purposes. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed on ice for 20 min in a non-ionic detergent buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors) (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, protein extracts were precleared with γ-bound Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) beads. To detect hKSR-2-associated proteins, 1 mg of precleared lysate was subjected to anti-FLAG-agarose conjugate immunoprecipitation. Bound proteins were eluted with a FLAG peptide and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins were resolved on the gel in one dimension, and the membranes were probed using a Miniblotter 20SL (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA) with at least 10 different antibodies as mentioned under “Results.” To immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged Cot and TAB1 proteins, 4 μg of Anti-myc tag antibody (clone 9E10) (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA) was added to 250 μg of precleared lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 40 μl of γ-bound Sepharose beads were added to each of the incubations for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and two times in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 containing phosphate-buffered saline, and immunoblotting was performed as described. For immunoblot analyses, proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) using standard techniques. Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% dry milk and probed with antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), Cot (M-20 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), ERK, phospho-ERK, MEK, phospho-MEK, phospho-Raf (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), and Myc epitope (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Immunoreactive bands were detected using appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Cot Kinase Assay—Cot kinase was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using anti-Cot antibody (Santa Cruz) bound to GammaBind Plus-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed in kinase buffer (see below) without ATP and then incubated at 30 °C with 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 3000 Ci/mmol) and 100 nm GST-MEK1-His6 (Upstate Biotechnology) in kinase buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH.7.2), 100 μm ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After 30 min, the kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) and boiled and separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled proteins were visualized using the Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Following immunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody, the bead bound proteins were eluted off the beads with FLAG peptide. The eluted hKSR-2 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with recombinant active Cot (expressed in a baculovirus and isolated on nickel-agarose beads) or Raf enzyme (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 100 nm GST-MEKHis6. The reactions were stopped, separated, and visualized as above and quantitated on a Bio-Rad densitometer using Quant One software. Luciferase Assay—Transfections were carried out as mentioned above. Cells were lysed for 48 h post transfection in 1 × passive lysis buffer from the Promega Dual luciferase reporter assay kit. Cells were co-transfected with NF-κB luciferase and pRL-TK, a renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, to normalize the experimental results. Briefly, 20 μl of cell lysate was transferred to a 96-well Cliniplate (Thermo Lab Systems, Franklin, MA) designed specifically for a luciferase assay. The Fluoroscan Ascent FL luminometer (Lab systems) was programmed to perform a 2-s pre measurement followed by a 10-s reading of luciferase activity. ELISA—Culture media were harvested 48 h following transfection of HeLa cells and frozen at -80 °C until further use. IL-8 concentrations in these samples were determined using the anti-human IL-8 ELISA kit from BIOSOURCE. This assay is specific for IL-8 with a minimum detectable concentration of 15.6 pg/ml. Assays were run in duplicate, and samples were read at 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Wallac 1420 Multilable Counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). IL-8 concentrations were determined by comparison to a standard with a two-parameter curve fit analysis, and the dilution factor was taken into account. Cloning of hKSR-2—The hKSR-2 cDNA was derived from genomic data base mining using the structural profiles of the catalytic domains of various kinases. To achieve this, all available x-ray crystal structures of the catalytic domains of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases were collected from the SCOP data base (http://scop.berkeley.edu). Structural alignments were performed using the ProCeryon package (www.proceryon.com). The structural alignments were presented in the form of multiple sequence alignments, which were used to search the Celera Human Genome Genscan predictions (release R25h) using the NCBI psiblast package. A predicted gene, which was homologous to the known human KSR, was identified. This predicted sequence was supported by an expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (BF948353). The expressed sequence tag-supported region was selected as a gene capture oligo for cloning, and two isolates (B11 and F7) were obtained from a human testis cDNA library (Fig. 1A). The presence of an in-frame stop codon upstream of the predicted initiator methionine argues that this cDNA contains the complete open reading frame. Based on the multiple sequence alignments of all known KSR family members, the amino terminus of the B11 and carboxyl terminus of F7 were combined by PCR to obtain the hKSR-2 cDNA, which has a 2490-bp long open reading frame that encodes an 829-aa protein kinase. hKSR-2 contains proline-rich CA2, cysteine-rich CA3, the serine/threonine repeats, the consensus MAPK phosphorylation site of CA4, and the conserved kinase catalytic domain CA5 (Fig. 1B). However, hKSR-2 lacks subdomain CA1, which is similar to the known hKSR-1 and is a domain that is unique to the KSR family (3Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A murine homolog of hKSR-2 (mKSR-2) was predicted using Genewise software, and a cDNA clone was obtained from a mouse kidney cDNA library. The 5893-bp mouse cDNA has 88.9% identity to hKSR-2 cDNA, and the predicted 830-aa protein has 96.9% identity at the amino acid level with hKSR-2. Northern blot revealed that hKSR-2 is mainly expressed in brain and kidney (data not shown). Interaction of hKSR-2 with the Members of MAPK Family—To examine whether hKSR-2 interacts with components of the MAP kinase pathway, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates of hKSR-2-transfected HEK-293T cells. Similar to the known KSR, over-expressed hKSR-2 also interacts with endogenous Raf, MEK, and ERK (Fig. 2A, right panel) (25Morrison D.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control immunoprecipitates using vector-transfected lysates did not precipitate any of these proteins (Fig. 2A, left panel). Cot is an important signaling kinase directly upstream of MEK-1 and has been shown to be a strong activator of ERK when overexpressed in cells. Therefore, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to evaluate the potential interaction of hKSR-2 with Cot. Fig. 2 shows that Cot can be co-immunoprecipitated with epitope-tagged hKSR-2 when the two proteins are co-expressed in HEK-293T cells. Both Cot and hKSR-2 were detected in immunoblots of immunoprecipitates performed with the cognate antibody or the reciprocal antibody (Fig. 2, B and C). To evaluate the specificity of the association of hKSR-2 and Cot, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with hKSR-2 and another MAP3K family member, TAK1. TAK1 is known to form an active complex with TAB1 (26Ono K. Ohtomo T. Sato S. Sugamata Y. Suzuki M. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24396-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged TAK1 is readily detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates directed against co-transfected Myc-TAB1 (Fig. 2D). However, FLAG-tagged hKSR-2 is not detected in the immune complex directed against over-expressed TAK1/TAB1 (Fig. 2D, upper panel), suggesting that hKSR-2 selectively associates with Cot and not with over-expressed TAK1/TAB1. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the presence of hKSR-2 in these samples (Fig. 2D, lower panel). The association between hKSR-2 and Cot is observed when either the ∼105-kDa full-length hKSR-2 or the 40-kDa catalytic domain of hKSR-2 is used. Similarly, a 69-aa carboxyl terminal truncation of Cot did not effect its interaction with hKSR-2, as we could co-immunoprecipitate both truncated Cot and hKSR-2 in this system (data not shown). These data suggest that the carboxy terminus of hKSR-2 is sufficient for this association. Similarly, the carboxyl terminal 69-aa region of Cot is not required for its interaction with KSR. hKSR-2 Attenuates Cot-induced ERK Activation in a Dose-dependent Fashion—To determine the significance of the association of hKSR-2 and Cot in the downstream MAP kinase signaling pathway, we probed HEK-293T cell lysates in which both hKSR-2 and Cot were over-expressed with antibodies to phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A, top and middle panels). As expected, over-expression of Cot activates ERK as demonstrated with anti-phospho ERK1/2 immunoblots. Co-transfection of hKSR-2 reduces Cot mediated ERK activation (Fig. 3A) by ∼83% (as judged by densitometry). The expression levels of total ERK, Cot, and hKSR-2 were monitored with the respective antibodies, and similar levels of expression of these proteins were detected (Fig. 3A, middle and bottom panels). The Raf-mediated ERK activation is not significantly (20% by densitometry) attenuated by the co-expression of hKSR-2 (Fig. 3B, top panel), which indicates that hKSR-2 selectively inhibits Cot-mediated ERK activation. hKSR-1 has been reported to have a positive and a negative regulator of Ras-dependent signal transduction based on its expression levels (27Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect on Cot by hKSR-2 is not due to its over-expression, we have titrated down hKSR-2 concentrations while keeping Cot levels constant. We found a dramatic decrease in the levels of Cot-induced ERK activation by hKSR expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, top panel). The expression levels of total ERK, Cot, and hKSR-2 were monitored with the respective antibodies, and similar levels of expression of these proteins were detected (Fig. 3C, middle and bottom panels). The phosphorylated ERK (P.ERK in Fig. 3) levels were scanned, normalized based on the total ERK loading in each lane, and reported with respect to the Cot alone sample. We conclude that the hKSR-2 inhibition of Cot is not an artifact of transient transfections. hKSR-2 Attenuates Cot-induced NF-κB Activation—Cot activity regulates NF-κB activation by targeting the IKK complex (possibly through the NF-κB-inducing kinase, which is an intermediate kinase) (28Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or through a mechanism that enhances the proteolysis of the NF-κB inhibitory protein p105 (21Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N. Xu Z. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5962-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, Cot can associate with and promote the degradation of p105 and thereby release Rel family members (29Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, by regulating NF-κB activation, Cot plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of inflammation. To examine whether hKSR-2 expression has an effect on the Cot-induced NF-κB activation, we used a dual luciferase reporter gene assay system to determine NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 4A, over-expression of Cot-induces a 6-fold increase in expression of the luciferase reporter gene compared with control. Over-expression of hKSR-2 alone did not activate NF-κB in this system. However, Cot-induced NF-κB activation is inhibited by the co-expression of hKSR-2 by ∼90%. The comparable expression levels of various proteins in the experiment were detected by immunoblot (Fig. 4A). Similar to anti-phosphorylated ERK levels, in a co-transfection experiment hKSR-2 reduced Cot-mediated NF-κB levels in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B), again suggesting that hKSR-2 inhibition of Cot is not an artifact of transient transfections. hKSR-2 Does Not Inhibit IKKβ-mediated NF-κB Activation—We examined whether the inhibition of Cot-induced NF-κB activation by hKSR-2 is mediated directly through Cot or through other signaling components of the pathway. To address this question, we co-transfected IKKβ and hKSR-2 and determined the effect of hKSR-2 on IKKβ-induced NF-κB activation. In contrast to our observation with Cot, co-expression of hKSR-2 did not have any effect on the IKKβ-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate the selectivity of the observed Cot inhibition by hKSR-2 and show that the inhibition is not mediated through IKKβ. hKSR-2 Regulates Kinase Activity of Cot in an in Vitro Kinase Assay—Given that the kinase activity of Cot is necessary for the activation of ERK and NF-κB, we performed in vitro kinase assays to determine whether hKSR-2 is effective at inhibiting Cot kinase activity. We utilized the recombinant Cot in the presence or absence of immunoprecipitated hKSR-2 using a kinase-inactive MEK1 as a substrate. hKSR-2 reduced Cot activity by ∼60% at a 2-μg concentration of hKSR-2 (Fig. 6, lanes 2–5), whereas Raf-mediated MEK phosphorylation was up-regulated by 70% at a 2-μg concentration of hKSR-2 (Fig. 6, lanes 6–8). This indicates that hKSR-2 selectively blocks Cot-mediated but not Raf-mediated MEK phosphorylation in this system. The percent control of MEK phosphorylation by either Cot or Raf-1 was indicated at the respective concentrations of hKSR-2 shown at the bottom of Fig. 6. hKSR-2 Attenuates Cot-mediated IL-8 Production in HeLa Cells—Cot kinase activity is upstream of NF-κB, ERK, and JNK activation and is required for the production of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 (17Dumitru C.D.

Cells plated on monoclonal antibody 281.2 initially extend a broad lamellipodium, a response accompanied by membrane ruffling at the cell margin. Membrane ruffling then becomes polarized, leading to an elongated cell morphology. Previous work demonstrated that the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain is not required for these activities, suggesting important roles for the syndecan-1 transmembrane and/or extracellular domains in the assembly of a signaling complex necessary for spreading. Work described here demonstrates that truncation of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain does not affect the initial lamellipodial extension in the Raji-S1 cells but does inhibit the active membrane ruffling that is necessary for cell polarization. Replacement of the entire syndecan-1 transmembrane domain with leucine residues completely blocks the cell spreading. These data demonstrate that the syndecan-1 transmembrane and extracellular domains have important but distinct roles in Raji-S1 cell spreading; the extracellular domain mediates an interaction that is necessary for dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements whereas an interaction of the transmembrane domain is required for the initial spreading response.

The syndecans, a family of four cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are expressed on all adherent cells with roles including growth factor signaling, lipoprotein catabolism, and cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (1Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Via their heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, the syndecans bind growth factors and their receptors, microbes, viruses, lipoproteins, proteases, and extracellular matrix proteins (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 3Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The syndecans are thought to act as matrix co-receptors with integrins to mediate cell binding and signaling on ligands that contain both heparan sulfate and integrin-binding motifs (3Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

For example, fibroblasts plated on fibronectin adhere and spread via integrins, but binding of syndecan-4 is required for focal adhesion assembly. Syndecans, however, are also able to mediate adhesion and spreading when acting as the sole adhesion receptor, suggesting that the syndecan core proteins alone are able to mediate the assembly of signaling complexes that regulate adhesion and cell spreading (5Liebersbach B.F.

Here, the respective contributions of the syndecan cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and extracellular domains in the assembly of these signaling complexes remain unclear. The prime candidate to transduce syndecan-mediated signals is the cytoplasmic domain. Two regions of the cytoplasmic domain, C1 and C2, are highly conserved across species and across the four family members. The membrane proximal C1 region has been suggested to bind members of the FERM family of adaptor molecules, shown by the binding of syndecans-1 and -2 with ezrin (9Granes F. Urena J.M. Rocamora N. Vilaro S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ezrin bridges syndecan-2 with the cytoskeleton and regulates membrane protrusive activity, suggesting one mechanism by which the syndecans may link the extracellular matrix to dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements. The C2 region consists of a C-terminal EFYA amino acid motif that interacts with type II PDZ domains in CASK, syntenin, and synectin, proteins that are proposed to link the syndecans to intracellular signaling cascades and the cytoskeleton. The C1 and C2 regions flank a central variable domain (V) that differs among the four family members. The V region of syndecan-4 plays an important role in focal adhesion formation through its binding of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and activation of protein kinase Cα (10Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The V region of syndecan-2 interacts with and is phosphorylated by EphB2 (11Ethell I.M. Irie F. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R.

Although interactions have not been described for the V regions of the cytoplasmic domains of syndecans-1 and -3, novel interactions of these regions are likely to impart specific signaling capabilities. Compared with the cytoplasmic domains, little is known about the syndecan transmembrane and extracellular domains. The transmembrane domains are highly conserved across family members, suggesting that this region may impart overlapping, if not identical, functions on each syndecan. One role, best defined for syndecan-3, may be to mediate oligomerization (12Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This depends on glycine residues within the membrane and four charged extracellular juxtamembrane residues. Another proposed role for the transmembrane domain is to target syndecan family members to lipid rafts, specialized membrane signaling structures into which syndecans-1 and -4 associate (13Fuki I.V. Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351 (Pt 3): 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Tkachenko E. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19946-19951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The syndecan extracellular domains are divergent, sharing only attachment sites for glycosaminoglycan chains, but there is emerging evidence that they have binding partners. The syndecan-1 and -4 extracellular domains, when provided as a ligand for cell adhesion, bind to fibroblast cell surfaces (15McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An example of an extracellular domain interaction that regulates cell invasion is the inhibition of myeloma cell migration into collagen gels by cell surface syndecan-1 (16Liu W. Litwack E.D.

This inhibition appears to trace to the core protein rather than the attached glycosaminoglycan chains, and syndecan-1 extracellular domain tethered to the membrane with a GPI 1The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinHBD-FNheparin-binding domain of fibronectinmAbmonoclonal antibody. anchor is sufficient for these activities. Similarly, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells bind and spread when plated on syndecan-1-specific ligand only when αVβ3 integrins are activated; this spreading can be blocked by addition of recombinant syndecan-1 extracellular domain (17Beauvais D.M. Rapraeger A.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The activities of the extracellular domain also extend to other syndecans. Colon carcinoma cells plated in serum are induced to round up and detach when treated with soluble extracellular domain of syndecan-2, presumably because the soluble ectodomain disrupts an adhesion complex at the cell surface (8Park H. Kim Y. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29730-29736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Additionally, fibroblast growth factor 2-stimulated proliferation in the developing wing bud and cultured chondrocytes is blocked by antibodies against the syndecan-3 extracellular domain, suggesting a role for this protein domain in the assembly of the fibroblast growth factor 2 signaling complex (18Dealy C.N. Seghatoleslami M.R. Ferrari D. Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Kirsch T. Koyama E. Liu M. Golub E.E. Pacifici M. J. Biol.

Raji cells are a useful system to investigate the potential signaling roles of the syndecan-1 core protein. These lymphoid cells grow in suspension and are normally devoid of syndecans but gain the ability to bind to heparan sulfate-binding extracellular matrix ligands or syndecan antibody when transfected to express syndecan-1 (20Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Upon binding syndecan ligand, Raji-S1 cells generate signals resulting in cell spreading, presumably via the assembly of a signaling complex in the plasma membrane. Raji-S1 cell spreading on mouse syndecan-1-specific mAb 281.2 is a multi-step process. Within 15–20 min of plating, cells radially extend a broad lamellipodium. This is accompanied by a high degree of membrane ruffling at the spreading margin. Active membrane ruffling polarizes over the next 1–2 h, giving rise to two or more lamellipodia that continue to extend and elongate the cells into a bi- or multi-polar shape. These steps require different signals as tyrphostin 25 blocks the initial lamellipodial extension and, by default, subsequent spreading events, whereas the polarized spreading that follows is blocked by genistein (21Lebakken C.S. McQuade K.J. Rapraeger A.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Importantly, none of the steps requires the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, suggesting that the syndecan acts through a signaling mechanism that is assembled in trans by the syndecan transmembrane and/or extracellular domains. Work described here demonstrates that sequences within the syndecan-1 transmembrane domain mediate interactions that are required for initial lamellipodial extension. In addition, sequences within the syndecan-1 extracellular domain are required for active membrane ruffling and cell polarization. Thus, the syndecan-1 transmembrane and extracellular domains play important and distinct roles in Raji cell spreading. Cell Culture and Molecular Biology—Raji lymphoid cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 4 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), and antibiotics. Raji cells expressing syndecan-1 in which the cytoplasmic domain is truncated to remove the 33 C-terminal amino acids (Raji S1Δcyto) were described previously (20Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and grown in medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin-B (Roche Applied Science). Full-length mouse syndecan-1 in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Sanderson (University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR) as were S1Δ88–252, in which all but the 87 N-terminal amino acids of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain were deleted, and S187syn/glyp, a mutant in which these 87 N-terminal amino acids were fused to the GPI linkage of rat glypican-1. 2J. K. Langford and R. D. Sanderson, unpublished data. S1FcR-S1, a chimera comprised of the extracellular domain of human IgG Fc receptor Ia (CD64) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human syndecan-1, was a generous gift of Dr. Kevin Williams (Thomas Jefferson University) (13Fuki I.V. Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351 (Pt 3): 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The coding region of S1FcR-S1 was excised from pEUK-C1 with XbaI and XhoI and subcloned into the shuttle vector LITMUS29 (Invitrogen) to generate LIT29 S1FcR-S1. LIT29 S1FcR-S1 was cut with XbaI, and the resulting overhang was filled using T4 polymerase. S1FcR-S1 was excised using XhoI, and the resulting fragment was ligated into the EcoRV and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. S1FcR-S1Δcyto, lacking the cytoplasmic domain of S1FcR-S1, was constructed by PCR mutagenesis. The coding region corresponding to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of S1FcR-S1 were amplified using a primer complementary to the cytomegalovirus promoter (5′-ATCAATGGGCGTGGATAGCG) and a primer that inserts a premature stop codon after the first arginine in the syndecan cytoplasmic domain (5′-CTCGAGTCAGCGGTACAGCATGAAACCCACCAG). A syndecan-1 mutant in which the transmembrane domain was replaced with leucine residues (S1™ →pL) was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laborotory Manual. 3rd Ed. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). First, the S1™ →pL coding region spanning the extracellular domain and two-thirds of the poly-leucine transmembrane domain was amplified using the mouse syndecan-1 cDNA in pcDNA3 as a template, the cytomegalovirus primer described above, and a mutagenic primer that changes the transmembrane domain to leucine residues (5′-GAGCAGGAGGAGCAGCAGGAGTAGTAGAAGAAGCAACAATAACAGCAATTCCTTCCTGTCCAAAAGGCTCTG). Second, the DNA spanning the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains was amplified using a mutagenic primer spanning the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (5′-CTCCTGCTGCTCCTGCTCTTGTTACTGTTGCTTTTGTTGCTGTTACGCATGAAGAAGAAGGACGAAGGC) and a primer corresponding to the pcDNA3 Sp6 promoter (5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG). The resulting products, which have overlapping extensions, were combined and amplified using the cytomegalovirus and Sp6 primers. This product was cloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 and confirmed by sequencing. Constructs were introduced into Raji parental cells by electroporation using a BTX ECM 830 square wave electroporator. Transfected cells were labeled using mAb 281.2 against mouse syndecan-1 or mAb 10.1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) against CD64 and alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) and sorted by flow cytometry. Immunoreactive cells were maintained in medium containing 1.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Spreading Assays—Cell spreading assays were performed as described previously (20Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, ligands (mAb 281.2–10 μg/ml, heparin-binding domain of fibronectin-200 μg/ml in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline) were applied to acid-etched or nitrocellulose-coated 10-well slides (Erie Scientific) and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Cells expressing S1FcR-S1 and S1FcR-S1Δcyto were plated on an antibody sandwich in which wells were first coated with goat anti-mouse antibody (200 μg/ml; Jackson Laboratories), rinsed, and then coated with mAb 10.1 (100 μg/ml). Slides were blocked with 1.0% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline for a minimum of 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed and plated in HEPES-buffered RPMI containing 0.1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin at a density of 15,000 cells per well. Cells were allowed to attach and spread for 2 h prior to live observation using an inverted microscope or fixed via the periodate-lysineparaformaldehyde method (23McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Cells processed for fluorescence microscopy were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, labeled with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and analyzed on a Nikon Microphot-FX microscope. Spread cells were scored as having a maximum cell diameter of greater than 25 μm. Approximately 50–80% of cells spread when plated on mAb 281.2, depending on the experiment. For cholesterol-depletion experiments, cells were pre-treated with 5.0 μm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) 30 min prior to plating and plated in the presence of the drug until fixation. For recovery experiments, 0.5 μm water-soluble cholesterol (Sigma) was added to cells immediately before plating. For staurosporine-induced motility assays cells were plated on mAb 281.2-coated coverslips for 1 h before the addition of 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma). The response to staurosporine was documented with time lapse microscopy using MetaVue Image analysis software. Cells that extended a lamellipodium that migrated in response to inhibitor treatment were scored as cells exhibiting a motile response. Cells that responded to staurosporine by extending short, dynamic filopodia were not counted as positive cells. Lipid Raft Isolation and Western Blotting—Lipid rafts were isolated with modifications to standard procedures (24Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Raji cells (5 × 106) were washed with and resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered RPMI containing 0.1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. mAb 281.2 was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 10 min at 37 °C. After rinsing, goat anti-rat antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was added at 5 μg/ml for an additional 10 min to cluster the syndecan. For cells expressing S1FcR-S1 or S1FcR-S1Δcyto, human IgG (5 μg/ml) (Jackson Laboratories)- and F(ab′)2-specific anti-human antibodies (10 μg/ml) (Jackson Laboratories) were used to cluster the syndecan chimera. After clustering treatments, cells were rinsed in cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in 0.5 ml of 1.0% Triton X-100 in lipid raft isolation medium (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. To disrupt lipid rafts, saponin (Sigma) was added to the extraction buffer at a concentration of 0.1%. Optiprep (Accurate Chemical) was then added to the cell lysates to a final concentration of 35%. One milliliter of this solution was added to a Beckman polyallomer centrifuge tube (13 × 51 mm) and overlaid with 2 ml of 30%, 1 ml of 25%, and 1 ml of 20% OptiPrep in lipid raft isolation medium plus detergents. Samples were centrifuged for 8 h in a SW50.1 rotor at 165,000 × g. Either ten 0.5-ml fractions or nine 0.55-ml fractions were removed from the top of the density gradients and processed for Western blotting (25Burbach B.J. Friedl A. Mundhenke C. Rapraeger A.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fractions were precipitated with cold methanol, resuspended in 50 μl of heparatinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaOAc, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2), and treated with 0.0001 units of heparatinases I and III (Seikagaku America) and 0.005 units of chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (ICN Biochemicals) for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane, and probed with mAb 281.2 or a polyclonal pan-syndecan antibody directed against the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic tail (26Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), polyclonal antibody SRC-2 against Src family kinases (Santa Cruz), or mAb H68.4 against the transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). Blots were developed with ECF detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences), scanned using a Storm Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences) into ImageQuant software for quantification, and converted to TIF format for processing in Adobe Photoshop. In some experiments, syndecan-1 and syndecan-1 mutants were clustered with Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the position of the syndecan antigen on the density gradient was determined by detecting these antibodies directly on gels. The Syndecan-1 Extracellular Domain Is Required for Bipolar Raji Cell Spreading—A panel of syndecan-1 mutants was screened to identify determinants within the syndecan-1 core protein that are required to signal spreading in the Raji cells (Fig. 1A). Populations of Raji cells expressing high levels of these syndecan-1 mutant proteins were sorted by flow cytometry and plated on a substratum comprised of mAb 281.2, which specifically engages the mouse syndecan-1 protein. As described previously (20Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Lebakken C.S. McQuade K.J. Rapraeger A.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), removal of all but the first arginine residue of the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic tail (Raji-S1Δcyto) does not impair syndecan-1 mediated spreading (Fig. 1, C and G). Raji-S1Δcyto cells bind and spread when plated on mAb 281.2, with a morphology indistinguishable from that of cells expressing full-length syndecan-1 (Fig. 1B). To test the role of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain, two syndecan-1 extracellular domain mutants, S1Δ88–252 and S187syn/glyp, were assayed for the ability to signal spreading. S1Δ88–252 is a deletion mutant in which a majority of the extracellular domain has been removed. After signal peptide cleavage, S1Δ88–252 contains the N-terminal 70 amino acids of the syndecan extracellular domain along with the syndecan-1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. These 70 N-terminal amino acids include three glycosaminoglycan attachment sites and the epitope recognized by mAb 281.2. When plated on mAb 281.2, Raji-S1Δ88–252 cells bind and extend lamellipodia, but they are unable to polarize (Fig. 1, D and G). A second mutant that was tested was the S187syn/glyp chimera that contains the same extracellular domain truncation but is anchored to the membrane by a GPI linkage of rat glypican-1. Raji-S187syn/glyp cells bind to the substratum comprised of mAb 281.2 at levels equal to that of Raji-S1 cells but are deficient in their ability to spread. When using the criterion of a spread cell having a maximum cell diameter of 25 μm (Fig. 1, E and G), Raji-S187syn/glyp cell spreading is less than 20% compared with cells expressing full-length syndecan-1, but even that 20% are cells that extend only a few short filopodia. Flow cytometry analysis confirms that expression of S187syn/glyp is equivalent to that of syndecan-1 in cells that do spread (data not shown). This suggests that the replacement of the transmembrane domain with the GPI linkage further reduces the ability of the syndecan to trigger spreading signals. As a further test of the extracellular domain, the S1FcR-S1 chimera was used in which all but the juxtamembrane glutamic acid residue of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain has been replaced with the extracellular domain of CD64, the high affinity IgG receptor. Raji cells sorted to express high levels of S1FcR-S1 also spread when plated on ligand, namely mAb 10.1 directed against the CD64 extracellular domain (Fig. 1F) or on human IgG, a natural ligand for CD64 (data not shown). Like cells expressing S1Δ88–252, Raji-S1FcR-S1 cells are stalled following the initial lamellipodial extension, demonstrating again that sequences in the syndecan-1 extracellular domain mediate association with signaling molecules that are required to trigger Raji cell polarity. The Syndecan-1 Extracellular Domain Mediates Membrane Ruffling and Staurosporine-induced Raji Cell Motility—To further examine differences between cells expressing wild-type syndecan-1 and syndecan-1 extracellular domain mutants, cells were observed using videomicroscopy. Raji-S1 cells plated on mAb 281.2 exhibit a high degree of membrane ruffling, continually extending and retracting lamellipodia and filopodia along the substratum and extending processes out of the plane of the substratum as they spread (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Material). Raji cells expressing S1Δcyto also exhibit membrane ruffling, but both Raji-S1Δ88–252 cells plated on mAb 281.2 and Raji-S1FcR-S1 cells plated on mAb 10.1 exhibit decreased membrane activity when compared with Raji-S1 cells (data not shown), indicating that the syndecan-1 extracellular domain plays an important role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. To emphasize the differences between wild-type syndecan-1 and the syndecan-1 mutants, cells were treated with staurosporine, a broad spectrum serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been shown to stimulate membrane activity (27Reed K.A. Booth T.A. Hirst B.H. Jepson M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 233-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Raji-S1 cells that are treated with 1 μm staurosporine exhibit greatly increased membrane activity. This increased activity leads to the formation of small dynamic lamellipodia at discrete locations at the margins of spread Raji cells. These lamellipodia often form at regions of the membrane that are irregular or at the ends of bipolar cells, thereby enhancing cell polarity. The lamellipodia are motile, as they migrate as far as two cell diameters away from the cell body within minutes of treatment, remaining connected by a stalk (see Fig. 2, B (arrows) and C and see Supplemental Material). Some of these motile lamellipodia split into two or more smaller lamellae that migrate from the original stalk (Fig. 2B, asterisk). In some experiments, entire cells migrate along the mAb 281.2-coated substratum in response to inhibitor treatment. This motility is mediated specifically through syndecan-1 as cells are plated on syndecan-1-specific ligand. Spreading on this ligand occurs independently of β1 integrins, the matrix-binding integrins expressed on Raji cells (21Lebakken C.S. McQuade K.J. Rapraeger A.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and mAb 13, a β-1 integrin-blocking antibody, has no effect on staurosporine-mediated motility (data not shown). Staurosporine enhances polarity and the formation of motile lamellipodia when added to Raji-S1Δcyto cells, indicating that these responses do not depend on the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2E). Raji-S1Δ88–252 cells, which exhibit minimal membrane ruffling in the absence of staurosporine, respond poorly when treated with the drug (see Fig. 2D and Supplemental Material). Some cells display a slight increase in membrane activity, but motile lamellipodia are reduced by nearly 3-fold when compared with Raji-S1 cells (Fig. 2E). Raji-S1FcR-S1 cells are completely refractory to staurosporine treatment (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that although the syndecan-1 extracellular domain is not necessary for the initial lamellipodial extension, it is required for active membrane ruffling and acquisition of cell polarity. The Syndecan-1 Transmembrane Domain Is Required To Signal Lamellipodial Extension—Truncation of neither the syndecan-1 ectodomain nor the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain inhibits lamellipodial extension of Raji cells plated on mAb 281.2, suggesting a role for the transmembrane domain in mediating signals required for spreading. To assess the role of the transmembrane domain in spreading, Raji cells were transfected to express S1FcR-S1Δcyto in which the syndecan transmembrane domain is fused to the extracellular domain of CD64. Cells sorted to express high levels of S1FcR-S1Δcyto and plated on mAb 10.1 extend lamellipodia (Fig. 3C), suggesting these sequences alone are sufficient to mediate spreading in the Raji cells. These cells fail to polarize, an expected result, as they lack the syndecan-1 ectodomain. To further examine the requirement for the syndecan-1 transmembran"

Furthermore, virus bound to transfected cells is protected significantly from degradation by trypsin (75% compared with 30% in untransfected cells). The possibility that HBV enters cells via the hepatic clearance system for serpin-enzyme complexes was investigated by analysis of the reactive site loop of SCCA1.

In no case was virus binding reduced by functional alterations or deletions within the reactive site loop. A possible role for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in binding virus was investigated. SCCA1 transfection of Huh7 cells was shown to result in up-regulation of LRP expression, reaching levels observed in total liver.

The molecular basis of this hepatotropism remains poorly understood but may be attributable to a combination of factors, including liver-specific transcription factors required by the virus for replication, and liver-specific expression of the host cell receptor utilized during the initial stages of infection (1De Meyer S.

The early stages of the HBV life cycle, virus binding and internalization, remain obscure, largely because of the lack of a permissive cell culture system. Many studies have made use of primary hepatocytes, but difficulties in obtaining these cells, and variability between and within batches, hamper the use of primary tissue. Moreover, primary hepatocytes lose susceptibility to HBV infection within days (2Gripon P. Diot C. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Virology. 1993; 192: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2001; 276: 36613-36623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and referred to by them as HBV-binding protein (HBV-BP), bears significant sequence homology to a serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1). HBV-BP was shown to interact with the pre-S1 domain of the HBV surface protein, which is now widely accepted to be the viral ligand involved in the initial interaction with the cellular receptor (4Neurath A.R. Kent S.B. Strick N. Parker K. Cell. 1986; 46: 429-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Neurath A.R. Strick N. Virology. 1994; 204: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of HBV-BP into HepG2 cells resulted in a 2-fold increase in virus binding capacity, whereas Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with HBV-BP showed a newly acquired susceptibility to virus binding, albeit at low levels. It was reported also that virus particles were internalized to a greater degree in cells expressing HBV-BP. These results have not yet been confirmed. The possibility that SCCA1, or a close homologue, functions as the receptor for HBV is exciting, particularly when considering the biology of serpins, a well conserved superfamily of over 100 proteins present in viruses, plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates (6Salzet M. Vieau D. Stefano G.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Serpins are involved in the regulation of a variety of proteinases, including those of the coagulation, complement, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory pathways (6Salzet M. Vieau D. Stefano G.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Wells M.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inhibitory serpins function via an exposed reactive site loop (RSL) of about 20 amino acids, and irreversibly inhibit proteinases through a suicide substrate inhibition mechanism. The enzyme recognizes and binds to the RSL, forming a serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) (8Worrall D.M. Blacque O.E. Barnes R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This leads to cleavage of the RSL between the reactive P1 and P1′ residues, causing a significant and irreversible conformational change with complete insertion of the RSL loop into a β-sheet. The enzyme is inactivated reversibly by the formation of an acyl ester linkage between the active site serine and a serpin side chain (7Wells M.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Worrall D.M. Blacque O.E. Barnes R.C. Biochem. Soc.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7081-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the SEC is kinetically stable, it is thermodynamically unstable, and would eventually break down releasing inactivated (cleaved) serpin, and active proteinase. Therefore, the irreversible inhibition of the proteinase requires removal of the SEC from the circulation (7Wells M.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although SCCA1 is classed as a serpin by sequence identity, functionally it is a cysteine protease inhibitor. This raises questions regarding the relevance of studies of serpins, especially those involving the RSL, to investigations of SCCA1. Serpins generally are limited to inhibiting serine proteinases, but there are at least two other serpins that inhibit cysteine proteinases (although both also inhibit serine proteinases) (10Komiyama T.

Hubbard G. Krieger T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20570-20577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SQN-5, a mouse serpin similar to SCCA1 and SCCA2, also has been shown to inhibit both chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases and papain-like cysteine proteinases, using an RSL-dependent inhibitory mechanism (12Al Khunaizi M. Luke C.J. Askew Y.S. Pak S.C. Askew D.J. Cataltepe S. Miller D. Mills D.R. Tsu C. Bromme D. Irving J.A. Whisstock J.C. Silverman G.A.

A. 1998; 95: 13465-13470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Replacement of the RSL of SCCA2 (which inhibits serine proteinases) with that of SCCA1 confers cysteine proteinase inhibitory properties on the modified SCCA2, confirming that the RSL is the only region required for cysteine proteinase inhibition (9Luke C. Schick C. Tsu C. Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bromme D. Juliano L. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7081-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Replacement of the RSL of the archetypal serpin, α1-antitrypsin, with that of SCCA1 resulted in a modified α1-antitrypsin that inhibited papain in the same way as SCCA1 and enabled characterization of the serpin-proteinase complex (14Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Dai W. Bromme D. Worrall D.M. Silverman G.A. Coetzer T.H. Dennison C. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Formation of a serpin-cysteine proteinase complex and the inhibition of that protease relied critically on RSL insertion into the body of the molecule (14Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Dai W. Bromme D. Worrall D.M. Silverman G.A. Coetzer T.H. Dennison C. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the body of a serpin molecule is capable intrinsically of supporting cysteine protease inhibition and the complex formed between the serpin and the cysteine proteinase shares architecture analogous with that observed in the inhibition of serine proteinases by serpins (14Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Dai W. Bromme D. Worrall D.M. Silverman G.A. Coetzer T.H. Dennison C. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the mechanism of action of SCCA1, there is evidence for the removal of other SECs (e.g. thrombin-antithrombin, α-proteinase inhibitor-trypsin, and α1-antichymotrypsin-cathepsin G) from circulation via a receptor-mediated clearance mechanism. SECs are removed from circulation largely by liver-enriched, or even liver-specific, pathways; clearance studies of radiolabeled SECs in animal models show localization to the liver and a specific association with hepatocytes (7Wells M.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which is highly expressed in hepatocytes, has been implicated in the hepatic clearance of SECs from the circulation (15Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The type I transmembrane proteins are an evolutionarily conserved group of cell-surface receptors that bind several unrelated ligands (16Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 273-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Bound ligands are delivered via clathrin-coated pits to endosomes for degradation through receptor-mediated endocytosis (15Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), a strategy that is often utilized by viruses to enter host cells (reviewed in Ref. 17Marsh M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LRP has been implicated in virus binding and entry, serving as the receptor for the minor group of human rhinoviruses (18Hofer F. Gruenberger M. Kowalski H. Machat H. Huettinger M. Kuechler E. Blass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). There have also been reports that other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (LRF) act as receptors for subgroup A Rous sarcoma virus (19Bates P. Young J.A. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and for members of the Flaviviridae (20Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The RSL of a serpin consists of a loop projecting from the body of the protein, comprising a hinge region and a variable reactive center loop. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to examine the role of individual residues within the RSL (9Luke C. Schick C. Tsu C. Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bromme D. Juliano L. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7081-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Schick C. Bromme D. Bartuski A.J. Uemura Y. Schechter N.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2000; 274: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mutations within the hinge region affect RSL mobility and the rate at which the RSL inserts into the body of the serpin. Mutation of the P14 residue from alanine to arginine blocks RSL insertion and abrogates inhibitory activity, although the protein still functions as a substrate, i.e. the proteinase is capable of binding to the serpin but cleavage of the RSL does not result in an SEC (13Schick C. Bromme D. Bartuski A.J. Uemura Y. Schechter N.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13465-13470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutation of the variable region has shown that the P3 residue also is critical in the interaction between cathepsin S and SCCA1. Mutation of the P3 phenylalanine to alanine results in a loss of cathepsin S inhibition (13Schick C. Bromme D. Bartuski A.J. Uemura Y. Schechter N.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13465-13470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The SCCA1-mediated binding of HBV to mammalian cells reported by De Falco et al. (3De Falco S. Ruvoletto M.G. Verdoliva A. Ruvo M. Raucci A. Marino M. Senatore S. Cassani G. Alberti A. Pontisso P. Fassina G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36613-36623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and confirmed below by ourselves, raises questions regarding the mechanism of virus binding. It has been reported that SCCA1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the skin, lungs, prostate, testis, thymus, and tonsils (detectable by RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry), but not in the liver (22Cataltepe S. Gornstein E.R. Schick C. Kamachi Y. Chatson K. Fries J. Silverman G.A. Upton M.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although this report is not supported by the fact that we and others (3De Falco S. Ruvoletto M.G. Verdoliva A. Ruvo M. Raucci A. Marino M. Senatore S. Cassani G. Alberti A. Pontisso P. Fassina G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36613-36623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been able to amplify SCCA1 cDNA from HepG2 cells, a hepatocyte-derived cell line, by nested RT-PCR, the discrepancy most likely is due either to the sensitivity of nested RT-PCR in comparison with immunohistochemistry and single round RT-PCR, or to differences between the tumor-derived HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. The reported absence of expression of SCCA1 by hepatocytes (22Cataltepe S. Gornstein E.R. Schick C. Kamachi Y. Chatson K. Fries J. Silverman G.A. Upton M.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), along with the fact that serpins are secreted, rather than expressed on the plasma membrane, suggests that the role of SCCA1 in virus entry may not be as a receptor expressed on the cell surface. An alternative hypothesis is that HBV hijacks the mechanism for hepatic clearance of SECs to enter hepatocytes. We have investigated this hypothesis using two strategies. First, we have determined whether the function of SCCA1, as a proteinase inhibitor, is required for enhanced virus-cell binding. These studies included site-directed mutagenesis of the reactive site loop, followed by virus-cell binding assays. Second, we investigated a potential role for the LRP in SCCA1-mediated virus binding and uptake utilizing competitive binding assays. Total RNA was purified from HepG2 cells using the SV Total RNA isolation system (Promega). Reverse transcription (Superscript II reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen) was primed using oligonucleotide SCCA1outer2 (5′-ctggaagaaaaagtacatttatatgtgggc-3′). The cDNA was used in a nested PCR reaction to amplify a full-length cDNA for SCCA1. First round primers were SCCA1outer1 (5′-cacaggagttccagatcacatcgag-3′) and SCCA1outer2. Second round PCR utilized primers including restriction sites to facilitate cloning, SCCA1-XhoI (5′-gcgctcgagttcaccatgaattcactcagtgaagcc-3′) and SCCA2-His (5′-cgcgttcgaacggggatgagaatctgcca-3′). PCR was performed using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene). Cycling for both reactions was performed in the PerkinElmer Geneamp PCR system 2400 as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. Sequencing was performed by Qiagen Sequencing Services, Germany. The sequence of this clone has been submitted to the GenBank™/EMBL data base (accession number AJ515706). The SCCA1 cDNA was cloned as a XhoI-BstBI fragment into the multiple cloning site pCDNA 3.1 V5 His (Invitrogen). The ligated DNA was transformed into One-Shot™ chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) and purified using the Endo-free Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). Sequencing (Qiagen) was performed to confirm that the sequence of the SCCA1 insert in pCDNA SCCA1 corresponded to the published SCCA1 sequence (accession number U19556). All restriction and modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs unless otherwise stated. The SCCA1 cDNA was subcloned from pCDNA SCCA1 into pGEX 4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) as follows: the SCCA1 cDNA was excised from pCDNA SCCA1 by XhoI and PmeI digestion followed by purification from low melting point agarose. The vector was digested with NotI, blunt-ended, and then further digested with SalI (to utilize the compatible cohesive ends resulting from SalI and XhoI digestions). The XhoI-PmeI SCCA1 insert was ligated into the vector in-frame to produce a construct encoding a GST-SCCA1 fusion construct. Restriction digests and DNA sequencing confirmed that the insertion had been successful. A single colony of E. coli BL21 cells was inoculated into L broth and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 225 rpm. This culture (500 μl) was used to inoculate 100 ml of L broth, and incubated at 37 °C, 225 rpm until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6. Cells were induced to express the fusion protein by the addition of 100 μl of 100 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet stored overnight at –20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) and lysed using sonication. The crude bacterial extract was centrifuged to pellet insoluble debris (3000 rpm, 15 min). Purification was performed using Probond resin (Invitrogen) equilibrated in binding buffer and packed into 1-ml spin columns. Columns were washed with washing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) until the A280 was less than 0.06, then proteins were eluted stepwise using 50, 200, 350, and 500 mm imidazole (Sigma) in washing buffer. Fractions were followed spectrophotometrically (A280) and screened by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The fusion protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml using Vivaspin 20-ml centrifugal concentrators (Vivascience). In certain experiments the GST tag was removed from the fusion protein using thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant GST-SCCA1 was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of 50 units/ml of thrombin before imidazole elution from the Probond resin. The proteolysis assay utilized 7-amino-4-methoxycoumarin that, upon cleavage from the substrate, undergoes a shift in fluorescence detectable using a fluorescent plate reader. Z-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methoxycoumarin·HCl, a fluorogenic substrate for papain, was obtained from Bachem. Papain was obtained from Sigma. The reaction buffer used for all assays was 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Recombinant SCCA1 (wild type or mutants) was incubated with papain (20 nm) in the reaction buffer for 30 min at 25 °C to allow formation of a serpin enzyme complex. Inhibition of papain was measured by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate (10 mm) to the reaction. The amount of 7-amino-4-methoxycoumarin liberated from the substrate was determined fluorometrically, using a Cytofluor 4000 multiwell plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. For kinetic studies, the above experiment was performed using a range of substrate concentrations (from 2.5 to 20 mm). These data were used to obtain values for V0 (the slope of the linear portion of the curve). A graph was plotted of 1/V0 against 1/[S] to determine the degree of inhibition. Huh7 and COS7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% serum equivalent (Hybaid) and 25 mm HEPES (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged by trypsinization every 3–4 days. Transient transfection of pCDNA SCCA1 and pCDNA3.1 V5 His LacZ (positive control) into COS7 cells and Huh7 cells in 24-well plates was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of SCCA1-V5-His and Lac Z-V5 His fusion proteins was confirmed by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting and detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences), and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h to allow expression. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. Virus preparations comprising 3 ml of viremic human serum diluted in 100 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (resulting in a final concentration of 1 pg/μl HBV DNA) were added to the cells (0.5 ml/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS. Total DNA was harvested by the addition of 50 μl/well of PK buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.45% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.2 mg/ml freshly added proteinase K (Sigma). For internalization studies, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and then solubilized in PK buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml freshly added proteinase K (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 56 °C for 2.5 h, followed by inactivation of the proteinase K at 100 °C for 15 min. Viral DNA was analyzed by PCR using a modification of the protocol described by Kock et al. (23Kock J. Theilmann L. Galle P. Schlicht H.J. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 405-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was performed using primers HBV1966+ (5′-tgccatttgttcagtggttcgtagggc-3′) and HBV2830– (5′-ccggcagatgagaaggcacagacgg-3′). Cycling was as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min then 72 °C for 3 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 6 min. Low cycle numbers were used to ensure amplification was limited to the exponential phase. Amplicons were separated using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes by Southern blotting, and detected using 32P-labeled HBV genomic DNA as described previously (24Ling R. Harrison T.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Comparative quantification was performed using scanning densitometry. Relative virus binding is expressed using arbitrary units, which may vary between experiments depending on background values used for normalization. Values were normalized to wild type SCCA1-transfected cells for comparison. Reactive site mutants (Table I) were constructed using three different approaches.Table IAmino acid sequences (wild type (WT) residues 329-375) of the RSL mutants created from pCDNA SCCA1 (Wt)P*1514131211109876543211′2′3′4′5′WTEGAEAAAATAVVAFGSSPTSTNP3EGAEAAAATAVVAAGSSPTSTNP14EGREAAAATAVVAFGSSPTSTNProEGAEAAAATAVVAFGPPPTSTNΔ HETAVVAFGSSPTSTNΔ VEGAEAAAANΔ 8EGAEAFGSSPTSTNΔ 20EN Open table in a new tab P3/P14 Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to create modified SCCA1 constructs in pCDNA3.1 V5 His. Mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic oligonucleotides utilized were AlaP14Arg (5′-gaggagggacgagaagctgctgctgccaccgc-3′) and PheP3Ala (5′-gaagctgctgctgccaccgctgtagtagcagccggatcatcacc-3′). Coding changes are indicated in bold and underlined. To facilitate screening, a PstI restriction site was removed in each oligonucleotide (bold) without altering the predicted amino acid sequence. Transformants were screened for successful mutagenesis by restriction enzyme digestion and by DNA sequencing. Pro-Pro Mutant—Mutation of the putative cleavage site from P1 serine P1′ serine to P1 proline P1′ proline was performed using the mutagenic oligonucleotide Pro-Pro (5′-gtagtagcattcggaccaccacctacttc-3′). This oligonucleotide encodes the putative cleavage site P1 P1′ and also encompasses a BsmI restriction site to facilitate replacement of a cassette within the wild type RSL with the Pro-Pro mutant cassette. The wild type SCCA1 construct, pCDNA SCCA1, was used as a template for mutagenic PCR using the RSL-reverse primer (Table II) and the Pro-Pro primer. Cycling was performed in the PerkinElmer Geneamp PCR system 2400 as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. Both the amplicon and the parental plasmid were digested with BstBI and BsmI, and the mutated cassette was ligated into the parental vector. Ligated DNA was transformed into One-Shot™ Chemically Competent E. coli (Invitrogen) and purified using the Endo-free Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). Sequencing was performed to confirm that the desired changes had been made.Table IIPrimers utilized for the production of RSL deletion mutantsPrimerSequenceRSL-forwardGACCGGGAGCCGCGGTCTCGRSL-reverseAGGCTTACCTTCGAACGGGΔV-forwardGAAGCTGCAGCTGCCAATGAAGAGTTCCΔV-reverseGGAACTCTTCATTGGCAGCTGCAGCTTCΔH-forwardGAGGTTACAGAGGAGACCGCTGTAGTAGCΔH-reverseGCTACTACAGCGGTCTCCTCTGTAACCTCΔ8-forwardGGAGGGAGCAGAAGCATTCGGATCATCΔ8-reverseGATGATCCGAATGCTTCTGCTCCCTCCΔ20-forwardGAGGTTACAGAGGAGAATGAAGAGTTCCΔ20-reverseGGAACTCTTCATTCTCCTCTGTAACCTC Open table in a new tab Deletion Mutants—Deletion mutants were constructed using a PCR ligation method. Essentially two primers, RSL-forward and RSL-reverse, were designed flanking the entire RSL cassette, and encompassing the KspI and BstBI restriction sites. Each deletion mutant was constructed by amplifying the area on either side of the deletion (A and B) using primers designed to incorporate regions of reverse complementarities (Table II). The two amplicons were then gel purified, diluted and mixed together, and denatured and annealed to allow the complementary regions of amplicons A and B to anneal to one another. PCR ligation was performed using the two outer primers (RSL-forward and RSL-reverse). Cycling for both reactions was performed in the PerkinElmer Geneamp PCR system 2400 as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min.

https://openalex.org/W2147070944,"Previous experiments from this Laboratory with C4-methanol demonstrated that the carbon of methanol becomes incorporated into the methyl group of choline in the rat (1). This observation has been confirmed by Arnstein (2). In a subsequent investigation carried out in this Laboratory with methanol doubly labeled in the methyl group with deuterium and C14, it was found that less than one-third of the hydrogens accompanied each carbon of the methanol when it made its appearance in the methyl group of choline (3). It was concluded that the methanol was being utilized, at least in large part, for the synthesis of a newly formed methyl group within the animal body, presumably through oxidation and subsequent reduction. The present communication describes experiments undertaken with labeled methanol to determine whether folic acid’ or its derivative, a synthetic preparation, Leucovorin (5), having Leuconostoc citrovorum factor (LCF) activity, had any effect on the utilization of methanol for methyl synthesis. The original dietary work of Bennett (6) and the recent contributions from various investigators have indicated that folic acid is in some way involved in labile methyl metabolism."
