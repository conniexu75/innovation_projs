We describe the generation of cloned pigs that express a humanized Caenorhabditis elegans gene, fat-1, encoding an n-3 fatty acid desaturase. The hfat-1 transgenic pigs produce high levels of n-3 fatty acids from n-6 analogs, and their tissues have a significantly reduced ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids (P < 0.001)."

Although the upstream events linked to signal-induced activation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm have been deciphered in considerable detail, much less is known regarding the mechanism by which β-catenin stimulates target gene transcription in the nucleus. Here, we show that β-catenin physically and functionally targets the MED12 subunit in Mediator to activate transcription. The β-catenin transactivation domain bound directly to isolated MED12 and intact Mediator both in vitro and in vivo, and Mediator was recruited to Wnt-responsive genes in a β-catenin-dependent manner. Disruption of the β-catenin/MED12 interaction through dominant-negative interference- or RNA interference-mediated MED12 suppression inhibited β-catenin transactivation in response to Wnt signaling. This study thus identifies the MED12 interface within Mediator as a new component and a potential therapeutic target in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Members of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins regulate a plethora of mammalian cell fate and behavioral decisions during embryogenesis and stem cell homeostasis (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev.

These pleiotropic effects derive from distinct signal transduction pathways, each initiated by engagement of Wnt ligands with members of the seven-pass transmembrane receptors of the Frizzled family. The first and best characterized of these pathways, the canonical Wnt pathway, culminates in programmed changes in target gene transcription through the action of a key nuclear effector called β-catenin (3Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

In the absence of Wnt signaling, the steady-state level of cytoplasmic β-catenin is suppressed by a protein complex composed of Axin, the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor protein, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, the latter of which phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for destruction by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (6Hart M.

Thus, although β-catenin has been proposed to overcome nucleosome-mediated promoter repression and/or to promote transcription preinitiation complex assembly through functional interactions with the catalytic subunit (BRG1) of the SNF/SWI chromatin remodeling complex, the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP, and the TATA box-binding protein (22Sun Y.

In this regard, recent genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have revealed that mutations in Mediator subunits MED1 (SOP-3, TRAP220), MED6, MED12 (DPY-22/SOP-1, KTO), MED13 (LET-19, SKD), and MED23 (SUR2) variously affect developmental processes regulated by Wnt signaling (27Zhang H.

However, whether these observations reflect a direct or indirect requirement for Mediator in Wnt signaling has heretofore remained unknown.Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved multiprotein interface between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II general transcription machinery (32Kornberg R.D.

In this capacity, Mediator serves to promote the assembly, activation, and regeneration of transcription complexes on core promoters during the initiation and re-initiation phases of transcription (40Wang G.

Because of its direct association with both signal-activated transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery, Mediator has been proposed to function as a general conduit and integrator of regulatory signals that converge on the promoters of protein-coding genes (50Woychik N.A. Hampsey M. Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, several Mediator subunits are functionally required for activated transcription in response to diverse cell signaling pathways. These include MED1 (TRAP220, ARC/DRIP205) for nuclear receptor, MED14 (TRAP170, ARC/DRIP/CRSP150 (cofactor required for Sp1 function)) for interferon-γ, MED23 (TRAP150β, ARC/DRIP/CRSP130, human SUR2) for Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MED15 (ARC105, PCQAP) for TGF-β signaling pathways (51Yuan C.X.

Where first introduced, however, each Mediator subunit will also be identified by its original name to facilitate recognition.The role of Mediator as an established signal transducer coupled with its genetic links to the Wnt pathway prompted us to examine the requirement for Mediator in β-catenin-driven transcription. Herein, we identify a direct physical interaction between β-catenin and the MED12 subunit in Mediator that is functionally required for activated transcription in response to Wnt signaling. Our study thus identifies MED12 as a new component in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and further implicates Mediator in a broad range of developmental and pathological processes driven by canonical Wnt signal transduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The antibodies used for immunoblotting, affinity purification, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses were as follows.

Varmus and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine growth serum and 400 ng/ml G418. T-REx HeLa cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium with 10% bovine growth serum and 5 μg/μl blasticidin (Invitrogen). Parental and Wnt3α-expressing L cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured and used for preparation of Wnt-conditioned medium as described previously (58Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For transient reporter assays, cells were seeded into 24- or 12-well cell culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. Cells (30–40% confluent) were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h post-transfection, transfected cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase (Promega Corp.) and β-galactosidase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) activity as described previously (59Tan W. Kim S. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55153-55160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For MED12 RNA interference (RNAi) experiments, cells were transfected with MED12-specific (catalog no. M-009092-00) or control (catalog no. D-001210-01-05) small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) using TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) 48 h prior to transfection of β-catenin expression and reporter plasmids using FuGENE 6 as described above. Reporter assay was performed 24 h post-transfection. Each transfection was repeated a minimum of three times in duplicate.Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Assays—Fusion proteins of GST with full-length β-catenin (referred to as GST-βcat-FL), an N-terminal β-catenin fragment spanning amino acids 1–284 (referred to as GST-βcat-N), and a C-terminal β-catenin fragment spanning amino acids 630–781 and therefore including the transactivation domain (referred to as GST-βcat-C) were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and soluble lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 by sonication. HeLa/S3 nuclear extracts were prepared as described (60Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). Recombinant Mediator subunits and fragments were expressed and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine by translation in vitro (TnT SP6/T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega Corp.).For GST pulldown assays using HeLa/S3 nuclear extract, 20 μg of each GST-β-catenin derivative was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and washed extensively. Immobilized beads were subsequently incubated with 1 mg of HeLa/S3 nuclear extract, dialyzed previously against 0.1 m KCl buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed five times with 0.15 m KCl buffer D containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer. 10% of each eluate was resolved by SDS-12% PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to ensure that equivalent amounts of GST-β-catenin fusion proteins were immobilized. The remaining 90% of each eluate was resolved by SDS-10% PAGE and processed for immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for Mediator subunits. GST pulldown assays using radiolabeled recombinant Mediator subunits were performed similarly except that bovine serum albumin was added to the binding mixture at a final concentration of 1.5 μg/μl as a blocking reagent, and 0.2 m KCl buffer D containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 was used for washes. Eluates were resolved by SDS-12% PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (GE Healthcare).For Mediator purification, a soluble nuclear extract was prepared from MED6-HA/S3, a HeLa/S3-derived clonal cell line engineered by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to express a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Mediator MED6 subunit. Nuclear extract was first fractionated by phosphocellulose chromatography, and a 0.3–0.5 M KCl step fraction was subjected to 12CA5 (anti-hemagglutinin) affinity purification. Peptide eluates were dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl buffer D and used in GST pulldown assays.Dual GST pulldown/protein cross-linking assays were performed as described previously (61Gwack Y. Baek H.J. Nakamura H. Lee S.H. Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Jung J.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized GST and GST-β-catenin derivatives were incubated with HeLa/S3 nuclear extract and washed as described above. Subsequently, beads were equilibrated and resuspended in cross-linking buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) and 100 mm KCl), followed by incubation with variable concentrations of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) to introduce reversible cross-links between directly interacting proteins. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature on a rocking platform, the cross-linking reaction was immediately quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris (pH 7.5) and subsequently terminated by the addition of quenching buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mm KCl) for 15 min at room temperature. Uncross-linked proteins were removed with urea wash buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.5) 100 mm KCl, and 6 m urea); cross-links were reversed; and proteins were retained on beads eluted in Laemmli sample buffer at 94 °C. Eluates were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot assay for the presence of Mediator subunits.ChIP Assays and Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR— ChIP assays were performed as described previously (62Odom D.T.

Briefly, 293Top cells were grown in 150 mm culture dishes and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with glycine, and soluble chromatin was obtained by sonication of isolated nuclei in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.7 mm sodium deoxycholate). Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed using 3 μg of control or specific antibody as indicated. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were captured on protein A-Sepharose, extensively washed, eluted, and incubated at 65 °C to reverse cross-links. DNA isolated with a QIAquick PCR purification kit was subsequently used in amplification reactions including primers specific for TCF-binding regions within the DKK1 (14Chamorro M.N. Schwartz D.R.

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using ABsolute™ MAX 1-STEP QRT-PCR SYBR® Green/ROX Mix (ABgene, Rochester, NY) on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).

Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 0.2 m KCl buffer D. Nuclear extracts (1 mg each) were first adjusted to 150 mm KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and subsequently subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C using 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose conjugated to either MED30-specific antibody or rabbit IgG as a negative control. Immune complexes were washed four times for 5 min with 0.15 m KCl buffer D containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and processed by SDS-11% PAGE for immunoblot analysis. For immunoprecipitation of Mediator in HeLa cells transfected with siRNA, nuclear extract was prepared as described above except that 0.1% Nonidet P-40 was used to disrupt cell membranes rather than mechanical lysis methods. Nuclear extracts (80 μg) were first adjusted to 168 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol and subjected to immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblot analysis as described above.For co-immunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous β-catenin and ectopically expressed MED12, 293 cells were transfected with 6 μg of pCMV-3xFLAG-MED12 or pCMV-3x-FLAG empty vector as a negative control using FuGENE 6. 44 h after transfection, cells were treated with 30 mm LiCl for 4 h, and whole cell extracts were subsequently prepared in 0.15 m KCl buffer D containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and supplemented with protease inhibitors. Whole cell extracts (800 μg) were adjusted to 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1.2 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and 15 μl of a protein A-Sepharose/protein G-agarose mixture. Immune complexes were washed four times with 0.15 m KCl buffer D containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min at 4"

Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) is one of the major antioxidant and redox regulators in mammals that supports p53 function and other tumor suppressor activities. However, this selenium-containing oxidoreductase is also overexpressed in many malignant cells and has been proposed as a target for cancer therapy. To further assess the role of TR1 in the malignancy process, we used RNA interference technology to decrease its expression in mouse lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells. Stable transfection of LLC1 cells with a small interfering RNA construct that specifically targets TR1 removal manifested a reversal in the morphology and anchorage-independent growth properties of these cancer cells that made them similar to those of normal cells. The expression of at least two cancer-related protein mRNAs, Hgf and Opn1, were reduced dramatically in the TR1 knockdown cells. Mice injected with the TR1 knockdown showed a dramatic reduction in tumor progression and metastasis compared with those mice injected with the corresponding control vector. In addition, tumors that arose from injected TR1 knockdown cells lost the targeting construct, suggesting that TR1 is essential for tumor growth in mice. These observations provide direct evidence that the reduction of TR1 levels in malignant cells is antitumorigenic and suggest that the enzyme is a prime target for cancer therapy.

For example, recently, a potent antitumor drug, 1,2-[bis (2-benzysoselenazolone-3(2H)-ketone)]ethane, was found to reverse the phenotype of five human carcinoma cell lines (13Zhao F. Yan J. Deng S. Lan L. He F. Kuang B. Zeng H. Cancer Lett. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Furthermore, reduction of TR1 activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by transfection with TR1 antisense RNA inhibited cell growth (14Gan L. Yang X.L. Liu Q. Xu H.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TR1 has therefore been implicated as a potential target for cancer therapy (e.g. see Refs. 7Engman L. Al-Maharik N.

On the other hand, TR1 is a selenoprotein that activates tumor suppressor p53 (16Merrill G.F. Dowell P. Pearson G.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3175-3179PubMed Google Scholar) and is specifically targeted by carcinogenic electrophiles (17Moos P.J. Edes K. Cassidy P. Massuda E. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol.

Dietary selenium also has potent cancer prevention activity (see Refs. 19Diwadkar-Navsariwala V. Diamond A.M. J.

These latter studies have implicated TR1 in tumor suppression, and thus, the overall role of TR1 in tumor progression remains unclear. To further assess the role of TR1 in tumor progression, we used RNA interference technology to knock down its expression in a mouse lung cancer cell line, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells, and have observed a reversal of the tumor phenotype. In addition, the tumorgenicity and metastatic properties of the TR1 knockdown cells were dramatically reduced further suggesting that TR1 is indeed a target for cancer therapy in malignant cell lines that overexpress this selenoprotein. Materials—All materials were commercial products of the highest grade available and are described in the supplemental data or elsewhere (21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5542-5548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Xu X.M. Mix H. Carlson B.A. Grabowski P.J. Gladyshev V.N. Berry M.J. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol.

Mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells, designated LLC1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Knockdown of TR1—The pU6-m3 vector used for generating siRNA targets was constructed using the pSilencer 2.1-U6 Hygro vector as the backbone (details of this vector and its use as a knockdown construct are given in Ref. 22Xu X.M. Mix H. Carlson B.A. Grabowski P.J. Gladyshev V.N. Berry M.J. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41568-41575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Changes were inserted into the vector as follows: 1) GC bases at positions 468 and 469 were changed to an A making the U6 promoter more homologous to the corresponding wild type gene; 2) the EcoRI site was deleted at position 4110; and 3) a XhoI site was added at position 384. Changing these two cloning sites made it possible to insert multiple siRNA target sequences into the vector. The 3′-untranslated region of mouse TR1 mRNA (accession number: NM_015762) was surveyed using diDESIGN program (Dharmacon, Inc.) to select potential targeting sites for its knockdown. Sense-antisense oligonucleotides for TR1 knockdown and its control, which had mutations in the target sequences (i.e. the targeting construct encoded gtctcactttcaagctgtctaa and the corresponding siTR1 control encoded atcgctctgacaagcttattag, where the underlined bases show mutations in the wild type targeting sequence), were annealed and inserted into the BamHI-HindIII cloning sites in pU6-m3 according to instructions detailed in the cloning manual of the pSilencer 2.1U6 Hygro vector. The sequences of the resulting constructs, designated siTR1 or pU6 control, were confirmed by sequencing. Culture of Mammalian Cells and Transfection Studies—LLC1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic solution at 37 °C as described in the product description packet from ATCC. Cells were maintained by splitting every 3 days using trypsin-EDTA. Stably transfected siTR1 (knockdown) cells and stably transfected pU6 control cells were prepared by transfecting with the corresponding constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 and then selecting cells in the presence of 500 μg/ml of hygromycin B.

Assay of TR Activity—TR enzyme activity was measured in control LLC1 cell lysates or LLC1 cell lysates from cells stably transfected with either pU6 control or siTR1 constructs as described (23Irons R. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Davis C.D. J. Nurti. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Soft Agar Assay—A total of 1000 control or TR1 knockdown cells suspended in 3 ml of 0.35% noble agar (growth medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) were spread evenly onto 60-mm plates masked with a 4-ml basal layer of 0.7% noble agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The plates were then incubated in a humidified 37 °C incubator for 14 days, adding growth medium onto the agar plate every 5 days. The colonies that developed were visualized by staining with ρ-iodonitrotetrazolium violet overnight and counted. Tumor Formation Assay—To check tumor formation capability, 2×105 of siRNA control cells (pU6 control) or TR1 knockdown cells (siTR1) that have been maintained in the growth phase were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of mice (female 5-week-old C57BL/6) and tumor formation monitored every 2 days. At 2 weeks following injection, the mice were euthanized and the tumors removed and analyzed. To assess the metastatic capability of these cell lines, 2 × 105 cells of each were injected into the tail veins of mice. After 4 weeks of intravenous injection, mice were euthanized and the lung tissues dissected and analyzed. Animal care was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health institutional guidelines under the expert direction of Dr. Kyle Stump (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Knockdown of TR1 mRNA and TR1—The siTR1 construct and the corresponding pU6 control construct were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used to transfect LLC1 cells. LLC1 cells were either stably transfected with the pU6 control construct or the siTR1 construct, or untransfected, and the levels of TR1, TR1 mRNA, and TR activity determined (Fig. 1). Each cell line was initially labeled with 75Se to examine the levels of TR1 and other selenoproteins and the ability of the siTR1 construct to knockdown TR1 expression. The relative intensities of the various 75Se-labeled bands were determined using a PhosphorImager that demonstrated that TR1 levels were most severely affected (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B), Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C), and direct assay (Fig. 1D) also demonstrated that the expression of TR1 mRNA, TR1, and TR1 activity, respectively, was efficiently knocked down by the siRNA vector. Phenotypic Changes in TR1 Knockdown Cells—Since the pU6 control construct did not appear to have any effect on TR1 expression in LLC1 cells (see Fig. 1), further studies were carried out only with the LLC1 cells transfected with pU6 and siTR1 constructs. As expected, cells transfected with the pU6 control construct grew in multilayer and loosely attached to the culture dish (Fig. 2A), which are characteristics of malignant cells. However, cells transfected with the siTR1 construct grew in monolayer and tightly attached to the culture dish, which are growth properties characteristic of normal cells. The growth rate of the siTR1-transfected cells was slightly retarded compared with pU6-transfected cells; that is, it was reduced by ∼25% at 72 h (Fig. 2B). While the inhibition of growth rates in the TR1 knockdown was noticeable, this phenotype was mild, considering that this enzyme is essential during embryonic development (4Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of many cancer cells is that they can grow unanchored in soft agar, while many normal cells do not grow under such conditions. The colonies present after 2 weeks growth in soft agar of the two cell lines transfected with either the pU6 control or siTR1 construct were photographed and the data quantitated as shown in Fig. 2, C and D, respectively. Clearly, growth of the TR1 knockdown cells in soft agar was inhibited as evidenced by colony numbers and colony size compared with the pU6-transfected cells. Changes in Cancer-related Components in TR1 Knockdown Cells—RNA extracts from LLC1 cells transfected with either the pU6 control or siTR1 construct were examined for differences in the expression of 96 cancer-related marker mRNAs (see supplemental Fig. 2). Two of the boxes, designated H for hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) mRNA and O for osteopontin (Opn1) mRNA, were reduced in RNA extracts from siTR1-transfected compared with pU6-transfected cells. Boxes corresponding to several other factors and to controls are also identified in the supplemental data. Both Hgf (24Ren Y. Cao B. Law S. Xie Y. Lee P.Y. Cheung L. Chen Y. Huang X. Chan H.M. Zhao P. Luk J. Vande Woude G. Wong J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 6190-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and Opn1 (25Rittling S.R. Chambers A.F. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 1877-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) play important roles in metastasis and tumor growth. The mRNA levels of both cancer promoting factors were quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and found to be reduced more than 2.5-fold in siTR1-transfected cells as compared with pU6-transfected cells (data not shown). The mRNA levels of both components were further examined by Northern blot analysis and also found to be substantially reduced in siTR1-transfected cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 2E). Tumorigenesis and Metastasis of siTR1 Knockdown Cells—To assess the tumorigenicity and metastasis of the pU6- and siTR1-transfected cells, mice were injected in the flank with either of the cell lines. Tumor progression was analyzed after 2 weeks by euthanizing the animals and examining the tumors. Tumors were much larger in mice injected with the pU6 control-transfected cells with an average weight of 0.341 g compared with an average tumor weight of 0.063 g in mice injected with the siTR1-transfected cells (see Fig. 3A and legend). This dramatic difference in tumor growth in mice contrasted with slight changes in growth rates due to TR1 knockdown in cell culture (compare Figs. 3A and 2B). In addition, since the constructs were retained in stably transfected cells with the counter-selecting antibiotic, hygromycin B, and the injected mice could not be treated with this drug, it was possible that tumor growth in mice injected with the siTR1-transfected cells might be due to the loss of the siTR1 targeting vector. Indeed, Western blot analysis showed that tumors developed from both siTR1- and pU6-transfected cells expressed high levels of TR1, further suggesting that low levels of TR1 did not support tumor growth and that tumors reappeared due to reversal of the TR1 knockdown (Fig. 3A′). Consistent with this observation, PCR analysis of genomic DNA from both siTR1 and pU6 tumors showed that the TR1 siRNA construct was lost from tumor cells that were injected with the knockdown vector (Fig. 3A″). Tumor metastasis was analyzed after 4 weeks by euthanizing the mice and examining the lungs. Tumors were readily apparent in the lungs of mice injected in a tail vein with the pU6 vector-expressing cells, while no tumors were visible in mice injected with cells containing the siTR1 construct (Fig. 3B). Histological analysis of lung tissue showed extensive malignancy in mice injected with the pU6 construct, but only normal tissue was found in mice injected with the siTR1 construct (Fig. 3B′). Redox-sensitive signaling factors govern multiple cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell cycle events, and numerous signaling cascades relating to proper cell function (reviewed in Refs. 26Liu H. Colavitti R. Rovira I.I. Finkel T. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar and 27Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Yang K.S. Woo H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). TR1 is an essential protein (4Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K.

Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and a central component in several redox-regulated pathways. Its main function is to keep thioredoxin in the reduced state (28Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar). In turn, thioredoxin donates electrons to disulfides in cytosolic and nuclear proteins, thus maintaining cysteine residues in these proteins in the reduced state. Among other pathways dependent on thioredoxin, TR1 is critical for the proper function of tumor suppressor p53, and inhibition of TR1 by carcinogenetic, electrophilic compounds implicated this protein in cancer prevention (17Moos P.J. Edes K. Cassidy P. Massuda E. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 745-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, TR1 contains an essential selenocysteine residue. Selenium is known as a trace element with potent cancer prevention function (19Diwadkar-Navsariwala V. Diamond A.M. J. Nutri. 2004; 134: 2899-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Rayman M.P. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2005; 64: 527-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). On the other hand, since overexpression of TR1 is consistently observed in many tumors and several antitumor drugs are known inhibitors of TR1 (29Witte A.B. Anestal K. Jerremalm E. Ehrsson H.

Birmingham A. Powis G. Anticancer Drugs. 2003; 14: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Biaglow J.E. Miller R.A. Cancer Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15966-15972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, selenium deficiency has been reported to decrease tumor incidence in some cancer models in animals (33Novoselov S.V. Calvisi D.F. Labunskyy V.M. Factor V.M. Carlson B.A. Fomenko D.E. Moustafa M.E. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 8003-8011Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the contrasting functions of TR1 in regard to tumor development and growth complicate the assessment of its role in cancer. In this study, we inhibited TR1 expression using RNA interference technology without affecting the expression of other major selenoproteins. TR1 deficiency was not lethal in cell culture and in fact only slightly reduced growth characteristics of the knockdown cells compared with the cells transfected with the control vector. In contrast, we observed dramatic changes in tumor growth and metastasis, when these cells were injected into mice. Further studies on the knockdown cells revealed that the TR1 deficiency reversed the phenotype of malignant cells rather than simply reducing cell growth. Importantly, the tumors observed in mice injected with the knockdown cells lost the targeting construct, suggesting that TR1 is essential for tumor growth but not for growth of cells in culture. It is clear that some cell types, e.g. T cells, 3M.-H. Yoo, X.-M. Xu, B. A. Carlson, V. N. Gladyshev, and D. L. Hatfield, unpublished data. and even organs, e.g. liver (34Carlson B.A. Novoselov S.V. Kumaraswamy E. Lee B.J. Anver M.R. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8011-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), can function without TR1, or for that matter, all selenoproteins, as the targeted removal of the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec gene in this cell type or organ, is not lethal. Thus, TR1 expression is not essential to all cell types as seems to also be true of LLC1 cells. Overall, our data show that down-regulating TR1 expression alters the redox homeostasis and in turn reverts the phenotype of malignant cells more in line with that of normal cells. Thus, TR1 provides an excellent molecular target for cancer therapeutic intervention. How can this apparently essential function of TR1 in cancer development be reconciled with the role of TR1 in tumor suppression and the known anticancer role of selenium? We speculate that TR1 and selenium act as cancer prevention factors by regulating cellular redox homeostasis (a balance between reductive and oxidative processes in the cell) and protecting against mutations and oxidative damage to DNA and proteins. However, in newly emerged tumors, TR1 is required to sustain tumor growth, probably because of the increased dependence on the reducing equivalents provided by thioredoxin for various biosynthetic processes. Apparently, this TR1 dichotomy requires the thioredoxin pathway, due to the many targets of this protein. This hypothesis could explain both the potent cancer prevention activity of dietary selenium (19Diwadkar-Navsariwala V. Diamond A.M. J. Nutri. 2004; 134: 2899-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Rayman M.P. Proc. Nutr.

https://openalex.org/W2147105537,"Metalloproteases are a large, diverse class of enzymes involved in many physiological and disease processes. Metalloproteases are regulated by post-translational mechanisms that diminish the effectiveness of conventional genomic and proteomic methods for their functional characterization. Chemical probes directed at active sites offer a potential way to measure metalloprotease activities in biological systems; however, large variations in structure limit the scope of any single small-molecule probe aimed at profiling this enzyme class. Here, we address this problem by creating a library of metalloprotease-directed probes that show complementary target selectivity. These probes were applied as a 'cocktail' to proteomes and their labeling profiles were analyzed collectively using an advanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform. More than 20 metalloproteases were identified, including members from nearly all of the major branches of this enzyme class. These findings suggest that chemical proteomic methods can serve as a universal strategy to profile the activity of the metalloprotease superfamily in complex biological systems."

https://openalex.org/W1980708527,"In this study we have examined the interaction of CD44 (a major hyaluronan (HA) receptor) with a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG)) in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells (HNSCC-HSC-3 cell line). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicate that CD44 and the LARG protein are expressed in HSC-3 cells and that these two proteins are physically associated as a complex. HA-CD44 binding induces LARG-specific RhoA signaling and phospholipase Cϵ (PLCϵ) activity. In particular, the activation of RhoA-PLCϵ by HA stimulates inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and the up-regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), leading to phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein, filamin. The phosphorylation of filamin reduces its interaction with filamentous actin, promoting tumor cell migration. The CD44-LARG complex also interacts with the EGF receptor (EGFR). Most importantly, the binding of HA to the CD44-LARG-EGFR complex activates the EGFR receptor kinase, which in turn promotes Ras-mediated stimulation of a downstream kinase cascade including the Raf-1 and ERK pathways leading to HNSCC cell growth. Using a recombinant fragment of LARG (the LARG-PDZ domain) and a binding assay, we have determined that the LARG-PDZ domain serves as a direct linker between CD44 and EGFR. Transfection of the HSC-3 cells with LARG-PDZcDNA significantly reduces LARG association with CD44 and EGFR. Overexpression of the LARG-PDZ domain also functions as a dominant-negative mutant (similar to the PLC/Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and EGFR/MAPK inhibitor effects) to block HA/CD44-mediated signaling events (e.g. EGFR kinase activation, Ras/RhoA co-activation, Raf-ERK signaling, PLCϵ-mediated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, CaMKII activity, filamin phosphorylation, and filamin-actin binding) and to abrogate tumor cell growth/migration. Taken together, our findings suggest that CD44 interaction with LARG and EGFR plays a pivotal role in Rho/Ras co-activation, PLCϵ-Ca2+ signaling, and Raf/ERK up-regulation required for CaMKII-mediated cytoskeleton function and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2008893285,"The development of the cartilage template that precedes endochondral bone formation requires the condensation of mesenchymal cells and their subsequent differentiation to the chondrocytic lineage. We have previously shown that inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway or actin dynamics enhances Sox9 mRNA expression, increases glycosaminoglycan production, and transforms cell shape to a spherical, chondrocyte-like morphology. However, we demonstrate here that in three-dimensional micromass cultures of mesenchymal cells, increased expression of Sox9 in response to these manipulations is not sufficient to induce the expression of established Sox9 target genes. This is illustrated by a decrease in the transcript levels of collagen II and aggrecan as well as reduced activity of a Sox9-responsive reporter gene in response to ROCK inhibition and cytochalasin D. We also demonstrate a decrease in mRNA levels of the transcriptional co-activators L-Sox5 and Sox6 upon ROCK inhibition and cytochalasin D. The decrease in Sox9 activity is likely partially due to reduced L-Sox5 and Sox6 levels but also to a delay in Sox9 phosphorylation following ROCK inhibition. In contrast, inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway and cytochalasin D treatment in monolayer culture results in the enhancement of a number of markers of chondrogenesis such as Sox9 activity and collagen II and aggrecan transcripts levels.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar. Beginning with condensations of mesenchymal cells and subsequent differentiation to the chondrocytic lineage, precisely shaped cartilage templates are formed (2Shum L. Nuckolls G. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These templates are composed of proliferating and differentiating chondrocytes as well as vast amounts of extracellular matrix produced by chondrocytes (3Horton W.A. Royce P.M. Steinman B. Extracellular Matrix and Heritable Disorder of Connective Tissue. Alan R. Liss, New York1993: 73-84Google Scholar). The commitment of cells to the chondrocytic lineage is marked by change in cell shape (from a spread, fibroblastic-like morphology to a spherical morphology), expression of the essential transcription factor Sox9 (4Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar) and the matrix markers collagen II (5Li S.W. Prockop D.J. Helminen H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although the importance of cell shape is recognized (7Brown P.D. Benya P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), molecular mechanisms controlling these processes had not been studied extensively. The RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is an excellent candidate as its role as a master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton has been well documented (8Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 9Zanetti N.C. Solursh M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Takai Y. Sasaki T.

Huang S. Moore K. Oh P. Ingber D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26323-26330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), differentiation (12Nobes C.D. Hawkings P. Stephens L.

Kaibuchi K. Kobayashi K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway by the pharmacological inhibitor Y27632 induced spherical cell morphology, increased the transcription of the chondrogenic transcription factor Sox9, and enhanced glycosaminoglycan accumulation (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that RhoA overexpression in the cell line ATDC5 had the opposite effect on these markers of chondrogenesis. Additionally, we showed that jasplakinolide and cytochalasin D, pharmacological modifiers of cytoskeletal dynamics, also played a central role in regulating Sox9 transcript levels (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the chondrocytic lineage is marked by the expression of the transcription factor, Sox9 (4Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Sox9 is required for cartilage formation (15Healy C. Uwanogho D. Sharpe P.T. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and directly activates transcription of the collagen II (16Bell D.M. Leung K.K.H. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Wing Ling K. Har Sham M. Koopman P. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) and aggrecan (17Sekiya I. Tsuji K. Koopman P. Wantanabe H. Yamada Y.

It has been more recently recognized that the transcription factors L-Sox5 and Sox6 are also required for proper cartilage formation (18Smits P. Li P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These factors are co-expressed with Sox9 (19Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and allow for maximal activity of Sox9 (20Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 69-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). L-Sox5 and Sox6 are highly homologous to each other and contain coiled-coil domains, allowing for homo- and heterodimerization (19Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of L-Sox5 to Sox6 enhances binding to target DNA and, with co-operative binding of Sox9, enhances transcription of several essential cartilage extracellular matrix components, such as collagen II (19Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and aggrecan (18Smits P. Li P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) genes. The activity of the Sox trio is also enhanced by the specific phosphorylation of Sox9 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on the serine residue, 181 (21Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although our previous results clearly demonstrated stimulation of Sox9 expression by inhibition of ROCK or actin dynamics, we had not analyzed the effects of these treatments of downstream markers of chondrogenesis (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We show that although Sox9 transcript levels are increased in micromass cultures treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or cytochalasin D, mRNA levels of the Sox9 target genes collagen II and aggrecan are reduced under the same conditions. This corresponds to reduced levels of Sox5 and Sox6 transcripts. Moreover, we show that there is a deregulation of the temporal phosphorylation patterns of Sox9 in Y27632-treated micromass cultures. Stabilization of actin by jasplakinolide increased transcription of Sox9 but did not adversely affect the activity of Sox9 in micromass cultures. Furthermore, we show that Sox9 activity is not negatively affected in other culture models, such as the ATDC5 cell line and high density monolayer culture of growth plate chondrocytes, suggesting that the effects of the RhoA/ROCK pathway on chondrogenic gene expression are context-dependent.

Primary Cell Cultures—The long bones of the axial skeleton (tibia, femur, fibula, ulna, radius, and humerus) were dissected from embryonic day 15.5 mice in culture medium (α-minimal essential medium, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% l-glutamine, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin) and left overnight in a tissue culture incubator. The following day, media were removed; bones were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then treated in trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Bones were then digested for 2 h in 3 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. The reaction was inactivated by the addition of primary cell culture medium (60% F-12, 40% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1% l-glutamine). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rpm, at room temperature, and resuspended in primary cell culture media. Cells were counted and plated at a density of 500,000 cells/well in a 6-well dish (Nunc). After 24 h in culture, medium were replaced and treated with Me2SO (vehicle), 10 μm Y27632, 1 μm cytochalasin D, or 50 nm jasplakinolide. RNA was isolated 24 h after inhibitor treatment using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RhoA Activation Assay—RhoA activity was determined from protein isolated from pcDNA3-transfected ATDC5 cells using the luminescence-based G-LISA™ RhoA activation assay biochemistry kit (Cytoskeleton) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was isolated on days 3, 6, and 9 of culture using the provided cell lysis buffer, and cells were processed rapidly on ice and snap-frozen until the time of assaying. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min. Protein concentration was determined according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cell extracts were equalized to contain protein concentrations of 2 mg/ml for the assay. Luminescence was detected as suggested by the manufacturer. Real-time RT-PCR—Relative gene expression was determined by measuring collagen II α1 (forward primer, 5′-GGCTCCCAACACCGCTAAC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GATGTTCTGGGAGCCCTCAGT-3′, and probe 6FAM-5′-CAGATGACTTTCCTCCGTC-MGB-NFQ-3′), aggrecan, L-Sox5, and Sox6 (Assays on Demand, Applied Biosystems) relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogense (GAPDH), using TaqMan one-step master mix and 40 cycles on the ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Blot Analysis—Protein was isolated from micromass cultures treated daily with Me2SO control, 10 μm Y27632, 3 μm cytochalasin D, or 50 nm jasplakinolide for 4 days with radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and then quantified and separated by size as described (14Woods A.

Protein was also isolated from days 3, 6, and 9 of culture as described above from the cell line ATDC5 treated with Me2SO vehicle or 10 μm Y27632. Blotted membranes were incubated with one μg/ml primary antibody against pS181 Sox9 (BIOSOURCE) or β-actin and incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by 5000× dilution of the secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Signal was detected using ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and visualized on the ChemiImager™ 5500 (AlphaInnotech Inc.). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Primary cells from limb mesenchyme were transiently transfected in suspension with a 1:1 ratio of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 0.5 μg of DNA of a control plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Promega) and a Sox9 reporter plasmid containing a reiterated (4 × 48) Sox9 binding sequence coupled to the mouse Col2a1 minimal promoter linked to the firefly luciferase gene (22Weston A.D. Chandraratna R.A.S. Torchia J. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were then plated in micromass culture as described above and treated with inhibitors 1 h after plating. After 3 days in culture, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (Promega) for 20 min at room temperature. Twenty microliters of lysate were used to determine relative luciferase activity of Renilla and firefly luciferase using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Data analyses were done as described previously (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Primary chondrocytes isolated from embryonic day 15.5 growth plates were isolated as described above and plated at a density of 100,000 cells/well in a 24-well dish. A suspension of 1:1 FuGENE 6 and DNA (as described above) was added to the medium for 4 h. After this time, the media were changed, and inhibitors were added. Cells were isolated in lysis buffer after 2 days in culture and assayed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data collected from the RhoA activity assay are an average of three independent experiments of samples analyzed in triplicate. The mean values were determined by averaging triplicate wells and subtracting the negative control (lysis buffer only) from all experimental values. The data were normalized to day 3 of culture. Data collected from real-time RT 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. -PCR are an average of three independent experiments of samples analyzed in triplicate and quadruplicate. Means were quantified relative to GAPDH, and then data were normalized to day 1 of control-treated RNA per trial. Data collected from the luciferase assays are an average of three independent experiments, each analyzed in triplicate. Relative light units were quantified by normalizing target luciferase (firefly) relative to the CMV control (Renilla). Statistical significance was determined by a one-way (luciferase data) or two-way (real-time RT-PCR analysis) analysis of variance with Bonferroni post test using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. RhoA Activity Decreases as Chondrogenesis Progresses—We analyzed RhoA activity during chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. Substantial RhoA activity was detected at day 3 of differentiation (Fig. 1), when expression of chondrogenic marker genes is relatively low (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After 6 days in culture, in parallel to increased expression of collagen II and aggrecan (24Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a significant reduction of RhoA activity is demonstrated that is maintained by day 9 of culture (Fig. 1). RhoA Overexpression Reduces Expression of Multiple Markers of Cartilage Development—Previously, we have shown that stimulation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in ATDC5 cells reduces transcript levels of Sox9, which can be rescued by inhibition of ROCK with the pharmacological compound Y27632 (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the effects of RhoA overexpression on the Sox9 target genes collagen II and aggrecan and the transcription factors L-Sox5 and Sox6 are all decreased with RhoA overexpression. Vector-transfected cells (which demonstrate identical behavior to wild-type control ATDC5 cells (24Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) display an increase in expression of mRNAs for all four genes over time (Fig. 2, black bars). ROCK inhibition with Y27632 induced enhanced expression of all genes (Fig. 2, white bars), whereas RhoA overexpression caused a reduction in the levels of transcripts for all four genes (Fig. 2, dark gray bars). The addition of Y27632 partially rescued the effects of RhoA overexpression (Fig. 2, light gray bars). These data demonstrate that RhoA signaling through ROCK suppressed expression of all chondrogenic marker genes in ATDC5 cells. ROCK Inhibition in Primary Micromass Cultures Results in Reduced Expression of Sox9 Target Genes—We previously also demonstrated effects of ROCK inhibition using mouse primary limb mesenchyme cultured in high density, three-dimensional micromass cultures (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). ROCK inhibition in these cells increased transcription and mRNA levels of Sox9, similar to ATDC5 cells (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We analyzed downstream targets of Sox9 as in the ATDC5 cell line. Fig. 3A shows that ROCK inhibition by Y27632 did not increase transcripts of collagen II as expected but rather caused a significant decrease after 3 and 4 days in culture (Fig. 3A). Examination of aggrecan transcripts revealed a similar decrease of transcripts in response to Y27632 (Fig. 3B). Since Sox9 is thought to be the major transcriptional regulator of these genes, our data suggest that Sox9 activity is negatively affected upon ROCK inhibition in the micromass culture system. A possible explanation for the discrepancy of the observed effects on the expression of Sox9 and its target genes is the differential regulation of L-Sox5 and Sox6. Indeed, our data show that L-Sox5 (Fig. 3C) and Sox6 (Fig. 3D) transcripts are significantly decreased in micromass cultures upon ROCK inhibition. Cytoskeletal Modifications Alters Expression of Sox9 Downstream Targets—Inhibition and promotion of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide, respectively, have been demonstrated to increase transcript levels of Sox9 in high density cultures of mouse limb mesenchyme (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that cytochalasin D treatment decreased collagen II and aggrecan transcripts (Fig. 4, A and B) similarly to Y27632 treatment in this culture system. However, jasplakinolide treatment increased both collagen II and aggrecan mRNA levels (Fig. 4, A and B). These data suggest that although cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide had a similar effect in increasing transcripts of Sox9, only inhibition of actin polymerization negatively affected downstream targets of Sox9. We also demonstrate that cytochalasin D similarly reduced and jasplakinolide significantly increased transcripts of L-Sox5 and Sox6 (Fig. 4, C and D). These data suggest that the decrease in L-Sox5 and Sox6 expression is likely contributing to the observed decrease of collagen II and aggrecan mRNA levels in response to Y27632 and cytochalasin D. Temporal Patterns of Sox9 Phosphorylation Correlate with Expression of Sox9 Target Genes in Micromass Cultures—To assess why the downstream targets of Sox9 were not increasing in response to higher levels of Sox9 transcripts upon ROCK inhibition, we examined Sox9 activity. Analysis of Sox9 protein levels with Y27632-treated primary cells showed similar levels to control cultures (data not shown). We examined Sox9 phosphorylation using an antibody directed to Sox9 phosphorylated on serine 181, one of the consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, which are known to stimulate Sox9 activity (21Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In control cultures, day 2 cells displayed maximal Sox9 phosphorylation. In Y27632-treated cultures, there is a delay in Sox9 phosphorylation, and maximal levels are not achieved until day 4 of culture (Fig. 5). We had also demonstrated that cytochalasin D treatment represses expression of downstream targets of Sox9 in the micromass culture system, whereas jasplakinolide increases their transcript levels. To determine whether the phosphorylation patterns of Sox9 correspond to these discrepancies, we assayed phosphorylation of serine 181 in these cultures. Cytochalasin D treatment resulted in a similar pattern of Sox9 phosphorylation as in control cultures, but levels appeared slightly reduced by day 2 of culture (Fig. 5). However, stabilization and promotion of actin polymerization by jasplakinolide resulted in strong Sox9 phosphorylation from day 1 of culture, thus earlier than in controls (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the decrease in expression of Sox9 target genes observed upon ROCK inhibition treatment is likely due, at least in part, to delayed and/or decreased phosphorylation of Sox9 and that early Sox9 phosphorylation is critical for maximal expression of Sox9 target genes. Sox9 Activity Is Decreased upon ROCK Inhibition—To examine whether the delay in Sox9 phosphorylation and the decreased levels of L-Sox5 and Sox6 causes a functional decrease in Sox9 activity, we analyzed the effects of ROCK inhibition of a Sox9-responsive promoter in a reporter gene assay. We observed that ROCK inhibition by Y27632 resulted in a slight but significant decrease of Sox9 activity in micromass cultures (Fig. 6). A stronger reduction was seen with cytochalasin D treatment; however, a significant increase of Sox9 activity was demonstrated upon promotion of actin polymerization by jasplakinolide (Fig. 6). These data parallel the effects observed with each inhibitor with regards to transcript levels of L-Sox5, Sox6, collagen II, and aggrecan. Primary Chondrocyte Responses to ROCK Inhibition Resemble ATDC5 Cells—Our data had shown opposing effects of Y27632 on chondrogenic gene expression in the two mouse culture models employed so far, ATDC5 cells and primary micromass culture. To examine whether these discrepancies were due to the transformed nature of the cell line or to differences in two- versus three-dimensional culture systems, we preformed additional experiments in primary chondrocytes from mouse long bones in monolayer culture. We observed that Y27632 and cytochalasin D treatments increased the expression of collagen II and aggrecan in these cultures, resembling the effects seen in ATDC5 cells (Fig. 7). Interestingly, jasplakinolide increased only collagen II transcript levels but not aggrecan expression (Fig. 7, C and D). Sox9 activity in primary chondrocytes in monolayer culture was assessed with the use of the Sox9-responsive luciferase reporter assay. Analysis of Sox9 activity revealed that ROCK inhibition significantly increased Sox9 activity in primary cells (Fig. 8). Additionally, cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide also significantly increased Sox9 activity, but again, jasplakinolide effects were relatively weak.FIGURE 8Sox9 activity in primary chondrocytes. Primary chondrocytes in monolayer culture were transiently transfected with a Sox9-responsive reporter and pRI-CMV for normalization and treated with Me2SO vehicle, 10 μm Y27632, 3 μm cytochalasin D, or 50 nm jasplakinolide. Relative luciferase activity was determined by measuring firefly activity normalized to measured Renilla activity. Data shown are the means of relative luciferase activity ± S.E. of three independent experiments, analyzed in quadruplicate; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrate that RhoA/ROCK pathway regulates chondrogenic expression in a manner that is highly dependent on the culture model employed. The cell line ATDC5 is a model of chondrogenic differentiation, and upon stimulation with insulin, markers of differentiation are up-regulated, such as collagen II (24Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have shown here that RhoA overexpression inhibits expression of collagen II, aggrecan, L-Sox5, and Sox6 in these cells. The effects of RhoA overexpression were rescued by the addition of the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, and ROCK inhibition of control cells resulted in an increase of all markers. We therefore show that the RhoA/ROCK pathway repressed chondrogenic gene expression in general, likely through down-regulation of Sox9 levels. Similar results were obtained in primary chondrocytes in monolayer culture, suggesting that this mechanism is not a unique feature of the ATDC5 cell line. However, chondrocytes in micromass cultures display the opposite behavior, displaying reduced expression of Sox9 target genes despite increased levels of Sox9 mRNA. Although Sox9 protein is not elevated by Y27632 as much as the corresponding mRNA, it appears to be at least as high as in control cells. Altered protein levels can therefore not explain reduced collagen II and aggrecan expression and reduced Sox9 activity in the reporter gene assay upon Y27632 treatment. Instead, we discovered two other mechanisms that are both likely to contribute to reduce Sox9 activity: delayed Sox9 phosphorylation and reduced expression of L-Sox5 and Sox6. Serine 181 phosphorylation by protein kinase A has been shown to increase Sox9 activity (21Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and is delayed by Y27632. It will be of interest to determine whether downstream mechanisms are mediating this effect. Although ROCK has been documented to directly phosphorylate transcription factors (25Anwar K.N. Fazal F. Malik A.B. Rahman A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), our data suggest that ROCK itself does not phosphorylate Sox9 as the phosphorylation and/or activity of Sox9 is not reduced by Y27632 in the other culture systems examined. In addition, L-Sox5 and Sox6 cooperate with Sox9 to stimulate transcription (19Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 20Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 69-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and reduced levels of these coactivators likely contribute to the lower expression of Sox9 target genes. It should be noted that Sox9 has been shown to be essential for maximal expression of L-Sox5 and Sox6 (27Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2813-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), adding further complexity to this scenario. It is also interesting to note that glycosaminoglycan production is not adversely affected by Y27632 in micromass cultures (14Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and appears to be independent of Sox9 activity and transcription of collagen II and aggrecan. Although the observed disparity in the expression of Sox9 and its target genes in Y27632-treated micromass cultures were unexpected, it is not without precedent. AP-2α is a negative regulator of chondrogenesis. Overexpression of this transcription factor maintains Sox9 expression but decreases levels of collagen II, aggrecan, L-Sox5, and Sox6 genes (28Huang Z. Xu H. Sandell L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, decreased Sox9 expression does not always correlate with decreased collagen II levels in osteoarthritic cartilage (29Aigner T. Gebhard P.M. Schmid E. Bau B. Harley V. Poschl E. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The most striking observation in the study is the difference of effects in the different models employed: ATDC5 cells and primary chondrocytes in monolayer culture on one hand and primary micromass on the other hand. In all systems, ROCK inhibition causes induction of Sox9 expression, but the effects on downstream genes are vastly different. Similar effects are observed with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. In contrast, jasplakinolide (which stabilized existing actin filaments and thus block actin dynamics) enhances expression of chondrocyte marker genes examined in all three culture models. Thus, ROCK inhibition and blockade of actin polymerization exhibit context-specific regulation of chondrogenic gene expression, whereas stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton promotes numerous aspects of chondrogenesis independent of the culture model. We suggest that two major differences in the culture system can account for the observed discrepancies: two- versus three-dimensional culture and the original cell source. RhoA signaling pathways are controlled, in part, by receptor for cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions such as integrins (30Clancy R.M. Rediske J. Tang X. Nijher N. Frenkel S. Philips M. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Takahashi I. Onodera K. Sasano Y. Mizoguchi I. Bae J.W. Mitani H. Kagayama M. Mitani H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and cadherins (32Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Delise A.M. Tuan R.S. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is feasible that differences in these interactions between monolayer and three-dimensional cultures result in differential patterns of RhoA/ROCK signaling and thus differential effects of the inhibitors. Alternatively, additional pathways that collaborate with RhoA/ROCK in the control of Sox9 activity might display differential activation in two- versus three-dimensional cultures. In addition, primary chondrocytes and ATDC5 cells are relatively pure populations of chondrogenic and prechondrogenic cells, respectively. In contrast, the embryonic limb bud cells used for micromass cultures represent a mixed population with cells able to differentiate into multiple lineages, including myogenic, endothelial, and chondrogenic cells (34Weston A.D. Sampaio A.V. Ridgeway A.G. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2885-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Seifert R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 36Shakibaei M. De Souza P. Cell Biol. Int. 1997; 21: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway is likely to affect these cells as well. It has been shown that RhoA/ROCK inhibition promotes myoblast differentiation (37Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), endothelial differentiation (38Zhao Z. Rivkees S.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and adipogenesis (39McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 6: 483-495Scopus (3416) Google Scholar), whereas RhoA action results in osteoblastogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (39McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 6: 483-495Scopus (3416) Google Scholar, 40Nuttall M.E. Gimble J.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the micromass cultures, it is thus possible that the observed effects are due to primary effects on other lineages that secondarily control chondrogenic differentiation. For example, we have described the development of a perichondrium in micromass cultures. 4L. A. Stanton and F. Beier, manuscript submitted. Since perichondrial cells are known to produce signals that control chondrocyte differentiation (41Di Nino D.L. Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 42Colnot C. Lu C. Hu D. Helms J.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), it is possible that ROCK inhibition in these cells results in altered signals from the perichondrium ultimately causing the effects observed in our studies. Experiments are under way to determine whether culture conditions, cell source, or both are responsible for the different effects of ROCK inhibition in our various model systems. Nevertheless, it is clear that the RhoA/ROCK pathway as well as actin dynamics play an important and complex role in regulation of chondrogenic differentiation and gene expression. Further elucidation of the mechanisms involved will result in both improved understanding of cartilage development and novel approaches for the management of skeletal diseases such as chondrodysplasias and osteoarthritis. We are grateful to Dr. Underhill for the gift of the Sox9 reporter plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W2026629000,"The expression of Smad interacting protein-1 (SIP1; ZEB2) and the de novo expression of vimentin are frequently involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) under both normal and pathological conditions. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of SIP1 in the regulation of vimentin during the EMT associated with breast tumor cell migration and invasion. Examining several breast tumor cell lines displaying various degrees of invasiveness, we found SIP1 and vimentin expression only in invasive cell lines. Also, using a model of cell migration with human mammary MCF10A cells, we showed that SIP1 is induced specifically in vimentin-positive migratory cells. Furthermore, transfection of SIP1 cDNA in MCF10A cells increased their vimentin expression both at the mRNA and protein levels and enhanced their migratory abilities in Boyden Chamber assays. Inversely, inhibition of SIP1 expression by RNAi strategies in BT-549 cells and MCF10A cells decreased vimentin expression. We also showed that SIP1 transfection did not activate the TOP-FLASH reporter system, suggesting that the beta-catenin/TCF pathway is not implicated in the regulation of vimentin by SIP1. Our results therefore implicate SIP1 in the regulation of vimentin observed in the EMT associated with breast tumor cell migration, a pathway that may contribute to the metastatic progression of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2047666271,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important pathogen that causes pharyngitis, sepsis, and rheumatic fever. Cell-associated streptococcal C5a peptidase (ScpA) protects S. pyogenes from phagocytosis and has been suggested to interrupt host defenses by enzymatically cleaving complement C5a, a major factor in the accumulation of neutrophils at sites of infection. How S. pyogenes recognizes and binds to C5a, however, is unclear. We detected a C5a-binding protein in 8 m urea extracts of S. pyogenes by ligand blotting using biotinylated C5a. Searching of genome databases showed that the C5a-binding protein is identical to the streptococcal plasmin receptor (Plr), also known as streptococcal surface dehydrogenase (SDH) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In the present study we identified a novel function of this multifunctional protein. Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-Plr/SDH/GAPDH showed that Plr/SDH/GAPDH is located on the bacterial surface and released into the culture supernatant. Next, we examined whether the streptococcal Plr/SDH/GAPDH inhibits the biological effects of C5a on human neutrophils. We found that soluble Plr/SDH/GAPDH inhibits C5a-activated chemotaxis and H2O2 production. Furthermore, our results suggested that soluble Plr/SDH/GAPDH captures C5a, inhibiting its chemotactic function. Also, cell-associated Plr/SDH/GAPDH and ScpA were both necessary for the cleavage of C5a on the bacterial surface.

Group A Streptococcus pyogenes is a human pathogen that causes streptococcal pharyngitis as well as more severe invasive infections, including necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The initial step of S. pyogenes infection is bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells through extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. fibronectin) (1Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J.

To cause systemic and septic infections, it is apparent that S. pyogenes must escape from detection by the host immune system and survive in plasma, after which they invade and spread into various organs via the blood stream. Recently, it was reported that infiltrating neutrophils were not observed at sites of S. pyogenes infection (9Hidalgo-Grass C. Dan-Goor M. Maly A. Eran Y. Kwinn L.A. Nizet V. Ravins M. Jaffe J.

The complement system plays an important role in the innate immune system, which acts as a protective shield in the early phases of infection as well as an effector in the acquired immune system. During activation of the complement system, complement fragments C3a, C4a, and C5a are generated, whereupon they act as anaphylatoxins. C5a is the most important anaphylatoxin because it acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages and because it integrates activation of the classical, alternative, and lectin binding pathways. Furthermore, C5a activates the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, -6, and -8 in macrophages and endothelial cells (10Kacani L.

Recently, Edwards et al. (13Edwards R.J. Taylor G.W. Ferguson M. Murray S. Rendell N. Wrigley A. Bai Z. Boyle J. Finney S.J. Jones A. Russell H.H. Turner C. Cohen J. Faulkner L. Sriskandan S. J.

Wexler and Cleary (14Wexler D.E. Cleary P.P. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 757-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that S. pyogenes expresses a C5a-specific protease on its surface that modulates the host chemotactic response. This protease, which they named streptococcal C5a peptidase of group A streptococci (ScpA), 2The abbreviations used are: ScpA, streptococcal C5a peptidase of group A streptococci; Plr, streptococcal plasmin receptor; rPlr, recombinant Plr; SDH, streptococcal surface dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: ScpA, streptococcal C5a peptidase of group A streptococci; Plr, streptococcal plasmin receptor; rPlr, recombinant Plr; SDH, streptococcal surface dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; GST, glutathione S-transferase. was isolated and sequenced by Chen and Cleary (15Chen C.C.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that C5a must be recruited to the cell surface for cleavage by cell-associated ScpA. Using genome sequencing databases and a BLAST homology search, we found that the gene encoding the C5a-binding protein is most closely related to those for the streptococcal plasmin receptor (Plr) (17Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D. Kain S.J. Schroeder B.L. Curtiss R. II I J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5204-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), streptococcal surface dehydrogenase (SDH) (18Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (19Winram S.B. Lottenberg R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2311-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recently, SDH and GAPDH were shown to be the same as Plr, and our current findings suggest that the multifunctional protein Plr/SDH/GAPDH exists as cell-associated and soluble forms that have distinct functions in inhibiting the host immune system. Bacterial Strains and Reagents—S. pyogenes strain SSI-9, isolated from a patient with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, was provided by Drs. T. Murai (Toho University, Japan) and K. Ooe and Y. Shimizu (Asahi General Hospital, Japan). The organism was grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract. Kanamycin (300 μg/ml) was added to the medium to select the isogenic mutant strain. Escherichia coli strains XL-10 Gold (Stratagene) and BL21 (DE3) pLysE (Novagen) were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (Sigma) or on Luria-Bertani agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. DNA Procedures—Extraction and purification of genomic DNA from S. pyogenes were performed using standard procedures (20Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Streptococcal chromosomal genes were mutated by electroporation as described previously (1Terao Y. Kawabata S.

N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing and Genome Sequence Analysis—C5a-binding protein was purified by diethylaminoethyl column chromatography (Bio-Rad) from 8 m urea extracts of S. pyogenes strain SSI-9 (serotype M1). The isolated protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). Protein on the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB; Fluka), after which N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by Edman degradation using an ABI protein sequencer (model 491HT; Applied Biosystems). To identify C5a-binding protein, the complete genome sequences of S. pyogenes strains SSI-1 (21Nakagawa I. Kurokawa K. Yamashita A. Nakata M. Tomiyasu Y. Okahashii N. Kawabata S. Yamazaki K. Shiba T.

Construction and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—A 1008-bp DNA fragment from the plr/sdh/gapdh gene was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA of strain SSI-9. The scpA gene of strain 90-226 (M1) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pScpA 90-226 (gift from Dr. P. P. Cleary, University of Minnesota) (23Stafslien D.K. Cleary P.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The primers used are listed in Table 1. PCR products were ligated into expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids for expression glutathione S-transferase (GST)-C5a-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and GST-EGFP fusion proteins were constructed as described previously (23Stafslien D.K. Cleary P.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The human C5a gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA of Hep-G2 cells (Riken). Recombinant proteins were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE containing the appropriate plasmids and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The purified recombinant proteins were found to contain less than 0.25 ng/ml endotoxin using a Limulus ES-II single test (Wako).TABLE 1Primers used in this studyDesignationSequence (5′ to 3′)ReferenceFor expression of recombinant protein plr/sdh/gapdh-Fw1CGGGATCCATGGTAGTTAAAGTTGGTATTAACGGThis study plr/sdh/gapdh-Rv1GGAATTCTTATAACTAATTATTTAGCAATTTTTGCGThis study plr/sdh/gapdh-Rv2GGAATTCTCTTCAGTGTAACCGAAGCTATCGTTTGThis study plr/sdh/gapdh-Rv3GGAATTCGATAGCTTTAGCAGCACCAGTTGAGThis study plr/sdh/gapdh-Rv4GGAATTCGAAGAGCTTTAGCCATAGGThis study plr/sdh/gapdh-Rv5GGAATTCGCACCGTTAGCATGTAAGTThis study scpA-Fw1CGGGATCCAATACTGTGACAGAAGACACTCCTGStafslien et al.

On days 0, 14, 28, and 42, New Zealand White rabbits (Charles River Laboratories Japan) were anesthetized with pentobarbital as previously described (24Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Terao Y. Nakagawa I. Kikuchi K. Totsuka K. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and injected with 500 μg of recombinant protein in TiterMax Gold (CytRx). Serum was collected on day 56 and stored at -80 °C until use. Anti-ScpA serum was provided by Dr. P. P. Cleary (University of Minnesota) (23Stafslien D.K. Cleary P.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described previously (25Kawabata S. Terao Y. Fujiwara T. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5863-5868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertional Mutagenesis Using a Targeting Plasmid—Inactivation of the scpA gene in S. pyogenes was carried out as described previously (1Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Okamoto S. Kawabata S. Terao Y. Fujitaka H. Okuno Y. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The PCR product of an internal portion of scpA was ligated into pSF151 vector (27Tao L. LeBlanc D.J. Ferretti J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 120: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The primers used for inactivation are listed in Table 1. S. pyogenes SSI-9 was transformed with the resulting plasmid, pYT1161, by electroporation, and the mutant strains were selected on kanamycin-containing agar plates. Ligand Blotting—Ligand blotting was performed as described previously (1Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, human C5a (Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) were biotinylated using an ECL protein biotinylation kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the concentrations were adjusted to 50 μg/ml. Streptococcal surface components were extracted with 8 m urea at room temperature (28Hamada S. Horikoshi T. Minami T. Kawabata S. Hiraoka J. Fujiwara T. Ooshima T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4161-4167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 10% membrane blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with biotinylated C5a for 1 h. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin at room temperature for 1 h, bands were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by exposure to x-ray film (Fuji photo film) at room temperature for 15 s. Biacore Analysis—Biacore analysis was performed as described previously (29Terao Y. Okamoto S. Kataoka K. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Human C5a, recombinant Plr (rPlr)/SDH/GAPDH, or BSA was diluted to 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0 (Biacore International AB) and immobilized on the surface of a Sensor Chip CM5 (Biacore International AB) using an Amine-coupling kit (Biacore International AB). Lyophilized rPlr/SDH/GAPDH, rScpA, or heat-inactivated rScpA was suspended in HBSP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) and adjusted to 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μm. Anti-Plr/SDH/GAPDH serum was also diluted with HBSP buffer (1:10). For binding analysis, rPlr/SDH/GAPDH was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. Relative units for C5a binding were corrected by subtraction of those for BSA binding. Isolation and Labeling of Neutrophils—Venous blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers, immediately treated with heparin, and diluted with RPMI 1640 (Sigma). Mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) (30Herwald H. Cramer H. Mörgelin M. Russell W. Sollenberg U. Norrby-Teglund A. Flodgaard H. Lindbom L. Björck L. Cell. 2004; 116: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The pellets, which contained neutrophils and erythrocytes, were treated at 4 °C for 5 min with ACK lysis buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm KHCO3, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) to lyse the erythrocytes. Neutrophils were collected by centrifugation (400 × g for 15 min at 25 °C), washed twice with RPMI 1640, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Neutrophils were shown to be 99% viable by trypan blue exclusion and 98-99% pure by staining with Giemsa. The neutrophils were labeled with 1 mm biscarboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein pentaacetoxymethylester (Dojindo) as described previously (31DeMaster E. Schnitzler N. Cheng Q. Cleary P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After 30 min the neutrophils were washed twice with RPMI 1640 and immediately used for analysis of chemotactic activity. Fluorescent-based Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotactic migration was evaluated as described previously (32Frevert C.W. Wong V.A. Goodman R.B. Goodwin R. Martin T.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 213: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in 96-well chemotaxis chambers containing polycarbonate filters (pore size 5 μm; Kurabo). The wells of the bottom plate were filled with 10 nm C5a and 0-100 nm rPlr/SDH/GAPDH and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Control wells contained 500 nm rabbit anti-human C5a IgG (Calbiochem). Fluorescein-labeled neutrophils were applied to the wells of the upper chambers, and the chambers and lower plates were combined and incubated together for 1 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The number of cells migrating from the upper chamber to the bottom plate was determined using a Wallac 1420 ArvoSXFL multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Measurement of H2O2 Production by Neutrophils—The effect of Plr/SDH/GAPDH on the oxidative function of neutrophils was evaluated by established assay (33Huber-Lang M.S. Riedeman N.C. Sarma J.V. Younkin E.M. McGuire S.R. Laudes I.J. Lu K.T. Guo R.F. Neff T.A. Padgaonkar V.A. Lambris J.D. Spruce L. Mastellos D. Zetoune F.S. Ward P.A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solutions (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mm sodium azide to inhibit endogenous peroxidase. C5a (10 nm) was mixed with 0-100 nm rPlr/SDH/GAPDH or 500 nm rabbit anti-human C5a IgG. After 2 h the solution was incubated with neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the equal volume of trichloroacetic acid, and then the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. Ferrous ammonium sulfate (1.5 mm) and potassium thiocyanate (0.25 m) were added to the supernatant, and the absorbance of the ferrithiocyanate complex was measured at 492 nm. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (2Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 993-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Terao Y. Okamoto S. Kataoka K. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Streptococcal organisms were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 10% goat serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals) containing 50 μg/ml human IgG (Calbiochem). Bacterial cells were stained with SYBR green II, and surface Plr/SDH/GAPDH was detected using a rabbit anti-Plr/SDH/GAPDH serum followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Stained bacteria were analyzed using an LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Assay of ScpA Proteolytic Activity—To examine the enzymatic activity of cell-associated Plr/SDH/GAPDH and ScpA, S. pyogenes cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm CaCl2 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% NaN3) at 1 × 108 colony forming units/ml as described previously (34Anderson E.T. Wetherell M.G. Winter L.A. Olmsted S.B. Cleary P.P. Matsuka Y.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4839-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Next, GST-C5a-EGFP was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (final concentration 1 μm). GST-EGFP served as a negative control. In some reactions, 20 nm E-64 (Calbiochem) was added to block the truncation of ScpA and GST-C5a-EGFP by streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB (34Anderson E.T. Wetherell M.G. Winter L.A. Olmsted S.B. Cleary P.P. Matsuka Y.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4839-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, the effects of cell-associated Plr/SDH/GAPDH and ScpA on the proteolysis of C5a were evaluated using rabbit anti-Plr/SDH/GAPDH IgG and anti-ScpA IgG. To examine the effect of antibodies, the bacterial suspension was incubated for 1 h with 100 nm antibodies that had been purified with an MAbTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and then mixed with the substrate. After the reaction, the mixture was separated without heating by nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. Fluorescent fusion proteins were visualized with a Typhoon 9400 system (Amersham Biosciences). Control reactions contained 100 nm rScpA. Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between the means of groups was determined using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. All tests were carried out using StatView J-5.0 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Screening for the C5a-binding Protein of S. pyogenes—To investigate the C5a binding activity of S. pyogenes, we used 8 m urea to extract surface proteins from strain SSI-9 (wild type) and its isogenic scpA-deficient mutant strain TR-9. Ligand blotting with biotinylated human C5a identified an ∼34-kDa protein on the surface of strains SSI-9 and TR-9 (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that the streptococcal C5a peptidase ScpA recognizes and binds C5a before its proteolysis. Although we confirmed that strain TR-9 lacks ScpA by Western blotting with anti-ScpA serum, it still contained a 34-kDa C5a-binding protein (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the calculated molecular mass of ScpA is >100 kDa (14Wexler D.E. Cleary P.P. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 757-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen C.C. Cleary P.P. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen C.C. Cleary P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that there is a novel C5a-binding protein on the surface of S. pyogenes. Identification of the C5a-binding Protein from S. pyogenes—The targeted protein, which was bound to biotinylated C5a, was purified by diethylaminoethyl column chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein was VXVGINGFGXIGXL, which is identical to the N terminus of the open reading frame of SPy0274 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number M95569) in the complete genome sequence of serotype M1 S. pyogenes strain SF370. We performed a BLAST search using the SPy0274 sequence and limited the results to streptococcal proteins. We found that this protein is the most similar (>98%) to Plr (17Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D. Kain S.J. Schroeder B.L. Curtiss R. II I J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5204-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SDH (18Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and GAPDH (19Winram S.B. Lottenberg R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2311-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SDH and GAPDH were recently reported to be identical to Plr. The plr/sdh/gapdh gene has a streptococcal consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAGGA) as well as -10 (AATAAT) and -35 (TTTTCA) sequences (35Stinson M.W. McLaughlin R. Choi S.H. Juarez Z.E. Barnard J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Betschel S.D. Borgia S.M. Barg N.L. Low D.E. de Azavedo J.C. Infect.

The open reading frame consists of 1008 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 336 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 36 kDa. Characterization of C5a Binding by Plr/SDH/GAPDH and Identification of the Region Necessary for C5a Binding Activity—We constructed rPlr/SDH/GAPDH by PCR amplification of the SPy0274 nucleotide sequence. The purified protein was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by ligand blotting with biotinylated C5a. We confirmed that rPlr/SDH/GAPDH bound to soluble C5a (Fig. 2A). To further analyze the binding activity of soluble rPlr/SDH/GAPDH, we immobilized C5a on a Sensor Chip CM5 and analyzed its interaction with various concentrations of rPlr/SDH/GAPDH using a Biacore X system. The Biacore profiles demonstrated that soluble rPlr/SDH/GAPDH bound to immobilized C5a with a high affinity. A global fitting procedure (BIA-evaluation software version 3.02) determined that the association (kass) and dissociation (kdiss) rate constants were 1.04 × 104 m-1 s-1 and 4.24 × 10-3 s-1, respectively. Also, the KA and KD values were calculated to be 2.44 × 106 m-1 and 4.09 × 10-7 m, respectively. BSA, which served as a negative control, did not bind to C5a. Our results suggest that both cell-associated and soluble Plr/SDH/GAPDH of S. pyogenes bind C5a. We further determined the region of Plr/SDH/GAPDH necessary for binding to C5a using a series of truncated rPlr/SDH/GAPDHs (Fig. 2B). Fragments with C termini at residue 164 or higher retained C5a binding, but fragment 1-114 did not bind C5a. Therefore, it appears that the sequence between residues 114-163 is an important element for C5a binding. A schematic diagram of Plr/SDH/GAPDH is shown in Fig. 2C. Expression and Localization of Plr/SDH/GAPDH—Originally, Plr/SDH/GAPDH was found in the 8 m urea extract, which contained the bacterial surface proteins. Because ligand blotting and Biacore analyses demonstrated that both immobilized and soluble Plr/SDH/GAPDH could function as complement-binding proteins, we postulated that Plr/SDH/GAPDH exists as cell-associated and soluble forms in vivo. We, therefore, inve"

https://openalex.org/W2036528679,"The transient receptor potential melastatin-related channel 2 (TRPM2) is a nonselective cation channel, whose prolonged activation by oxidative and nitrative agents leads to cell death. Here, we show that the drug puromycin selectively targets TRPM2-expressing cells, leading to cell death. Our data suggest that the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2 or sirtuin) family of enzymes mediates this susceptibility to cell death. Sirtuins are protein deacetylases that regulate gene expression, apoptosis, metabolism, and aging. These NAD+-dependent enzymes catalyze a reaction in which the acetyl group from substrate is transferred to the ADP-ribose portion of NAD+ to form deacetylated product, nicotinamide, and the metabolite OAADPr, whose functions remain elusive. Using cell-based assays and RNA interference, we show that puromycin-induced cell death is greatly diminished by nicotinamide (a potent sirtuin inhibitor), and by decreased expression of sirtuins SIRT2 and SIRT3. Furthermore, we demonstrate using channel current recordings and binding assays that OAADPr directly binds to the cytoplasmic domain of TRPM2 and activates the TRPM2 channel. ADP-ribose binds TRPM2 with similarly affinity, whereas NAD+ displays almost negligible binding. These studies provide the first evidence for the potential role of sirtuin-generated OAADPr in TRPM2 channel gating.

These NAD+-dependent enzymes catalyze a reaction in which the acetyl group from substrate is transferred to the ADP-ribose portion of NAD+ to form deacetylated product, nicotinamide, and the metabolite OAADPr, whose functions remain elusive. Using cell-based assays and RNA interference, we show that puromycin-induced cell death is greatly diminished by nicotinamide (a potent sirtuin inhibitor), and by decreased expression of sirtuins SIRT2 and SIRT3. Furthermore, we demonstrate using channel current recordings and binding assays that OAADPr directly binds to the cytoplasmic domain of TRPM2 and activates the TRPM2 channel. ADP-ribose binds TRPM2 with similarly affinity, whereas NAD+ displays almost negligible binding. These studies provide the first evidence for the potential role of sirtuin-generated OAADPr in TRPM2 channel gating.

Although the physiological function of TRPM2 remains unclear, several reports have demonstrated that TRPM2 expression confers susceptibility to cell death in response to oxidative (H2O2) and nitrative stress (2Hara Y.

Under these conditions, TRPM2 appears to induce cell of Na2+ death by causing an overwhelming influx and Ca2+ (2Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S.

This influx is thought to occur as a consequence of TRPM2 channel activation via ADP-ribose (ADPr) binding to the cytoplasmic, C-terminal domain of the channel. This domain, termed NudT9-H (NudT9 homology), contains an apparent Nudix enzymatic motif and shares significant homology to the mitochondrial NudT9 enzyme (4Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A.

Although it was initially thought that the ADPr hydrolase activity of TRPM2 might have a role in regulating TRPM2 gating via hydrolysis of bound ADPr, recent data have demonstrated that mutations in putative catalytic residues of NudT9-H do not affect TRPM2 channel gating, leaving the function of this activity unclear (8Perraud A.L.

The mechanism of TRPM2 activation by hydrogen peroxide may prove to be more complex, as hydrogen peroxide and ADPr have also been suggested to act cooperatively in TRPM2 channel activation (12Kolisek M. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).In this article, we have investigated the ability of TRPM2 to sensitize cells to cellular insults other than those inducing oxidative stress. Here, we demonstrate that puromycin, a well known pleiotropic cell stress agent, selectively targets TRPM2-expressing cells, leading to cell death. Our studies suggest that Sir2 enzymes play an important role in mediating this response. We found that TRPM2 has the capacity to sense OAADPr, the unique metabolite of the Sir2 protein deacetylase reaction, and induce cell death in response to puromycin. Furthermore, we report the first direct evidence that OAADPr binds to the NudT9-H domain and modulates TRPM2 channel activity. Our data have important implications for the potential physiological roles of ADPr-related molecules as secondary messengers. This report links Sir2 enzymes (sirtuins) with the TRPM2 channel through the Sir2 metabolite OAADPr. This newly discovered association provides a plausible mechanism for previously described sirtuin functions, which include control of stress response pathways and metabolic regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—HEK-293 and tetracycline (tet)-inducible HEK-293 TRPM2-expressing cells (4Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Medium used to culture tet-inducible HEK-293 cells was supplemented with blasticidin (5 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and zeocin (0.4 mg/ml; Invitrogen). To induce expression of TRPM2 in recombinant HEK-293 cells, tet was added to the medium at 1 μgml–1 (Invitrogen) 24 h prior to experiments. The CRI-G1 rat β-islet tumor cell line was obtained from EACC and cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm glutamine.Cell Viability Assays—HEK-293, tet-inducible HEK-293, and CRI-G1 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 500,000 cells per well. When cells were 50–70% confluent, puromycin (Sigma) was added to the medium at various concentrations, and the cells were incubated for 16 h (unless otherwise indicated). Cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS, after which 0.5 ml of 2 μm calcein (Molecular Probes) in PBS was added directly to the well for 10–20 min. Calcein is retained in living, but not dead cells, where it undergoes catalytic conversion into a fluorescent compound. Fluorescence in each well was measured in a microplate reader using excitation and emission filters at 485/530 nm, respectively.Calcium Depletion—When TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells were 80–90% confluent, they were rinsed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM lacking calcium chloride in the presence of 5 mm EGTA and 1 μg/ml tet. One hour after calcium removal, cells were treated with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 500 μm puromycin for 6 h. At this time cells remained adherent and were assayed for viability as described above.Detection of FLAG-TRPM2 by Western Blot Analysis—HEK-293 TRPM2-expressing cells were grown in the presence or absence of tet (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and lysed directly on the plate with 1× protein sample buffer. Whole cell extracts were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Expression of FLAG-TRPM2 was detected by standard Western blot procedure using a M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).Knockdown of SIRT2 and SIRT3 Transcription using siRNA—Tet-inducible HEK-293 cells were transfected with 100 nm control, SIRT2 or SIRT3 siRNA (Dharmacon) using Trans-IT TKO transfection reagent (Mirus). After 24 h, TRPM2 expression was induced by addition of tet to the medium. 48-h post-transfection, one set of cells was harvested and analyzed for SIRT expression as described below, and the rest were treated with puromycin for an additional 16 h and assayed for viability.Analysis of SIRT2 and SIRT3 Transcripts by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from harvested cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and AMV-RT (Promega). The RT reaction was used as a template for PCR amplification of SIRT2 or SIRT3 using primer pairs: 5′-CAGAACATAGATACCCTGGAGCGAA and 5′-AAGGTCCTCCAGCTCCTTCTTC and 5′-TGAGAGAGTGTCGGGCATCCCTG and 5′-TCATCCTATTTGTCTGGTCCATCAA, respectively. Primers 5′-GGCACCACACCTTATACAAT and 5′-ATGTCACGCACGATTTCC were used to amplify actin, which served as an internal PCR control.Detection of SIRT2 and SIRT3 Protein by Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were separated using a mitochondrial isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SIRT2 and SIRT3 protein were detected by standard Western blot protocol using chicken anti-SIRT2 antibody (13North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol.

After 60 min at 37 °C, NADase (Sigma) was added to degrade the remaining NAD+. The reaction was quenched 15 min after NADase addition with trifluoroacetic acid (1% final), and OAADPr was separated from other components in the reaction by C18 reverse-phase chromatography (Grace Vydac). Based on HPLC analysis, OAADPr was determined to be >95% pure.Channel Gating—Patch clamp electrophysiology was performed as previously described (4Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were patch clamped in the whole cell configuration at 25 °C using pipettes with resistances ranging from 2–3 MOhms. Currents were recorded on an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier with automatic capacitance compensation using a protocol generating a 50 ms voltage ramp from –100 to +100 mv every 2 s at a holding potential of 0 mv (appropriately corrected for liquid junction potential). Bath solution included 150 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Pipette solution included 135 mm cesium glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and either no EGTA (unbuffered conditions) or 10 mm EGTA (buffered conditions) as indicated. For low resolution presentation of current development over the course of the experiment, instantaneous currents at –80 mv were extracted from each ramp and plotted versus time.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the NudT9-H Domain—The DNA sequence encoding residues 1195–1503 of human TRPM2 (long isoform) was amplified by PCR using primers: 5′-AAGCATGCGTGAGGACGCTG and 5′-ACAAGCTTTCAGTAGTGAGC. The primers introduced an upstream SphI and a downstream HindIII recognition site (underlined) at the termini of the amplified DNA. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with SphI and HindIII, and cloned into pQE80 (Qiagen) downstream and in-frame with sequence encoding a His6 tag. The cloned plasmid was then sequenced to ensure no mutations were present. The plasmid was introduced into the BL21(DE3)pLys strain of Escherichia coli, and the NudT9-H protein induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm final) to the culture once A600 reached ∼0.5. After a 5 h induction at 30 °C, the bacteria were harvested, resuspended in buffer A: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by sonication. The NudT9-H protein was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-Sepharose resin, followed by cation exchange. The final protein preparation was dialyzed in 50 mm Tris-Cl 7.6, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm TCEP, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard.Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC)—Binding assays were performed on a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal) at 25 °C. ADPr, AMP, and NAD+ (Sigma) were resuspended in the same buffer used to store the NudT9-H protein: 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 0.5 mm TCEP, and the ligand concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. NudT9-H protein concentration was 30–35 μm, whereas ligand concentrations in the injection syringe were 2–4 mm. The data were fitted using the Origin software (Originlab), assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of binding.Synthesis and Purification of [32P]-N3-OAADPr—[32P]-N3-OAADPr was generated through two enzymatic steps. First, [32P]-N3-ATP (Affinity Labeling Technologies) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio, together with NMNAT (NMN adenylyl transferase). After 1 h at 37°C, the reaction was quenched in 1% trifluoroacetic acid. [32P]-N3-NAD+, the product of the reaction, was purified by C18 reverse phase chromatography. [32P]-N3-OAADPr was synthesized the same way as described under “Synthesis and Purification of OAADPr” except that [32P]-N3-NAD+ was used instead of NAD+. NAMAT was expressed from a plasmid generously provided by Dr. Mathias Ziegler (Freie Universitat Berlin).[32P]-N3-OAADPr photocross-linking—NudT9-H (2 μm) was incubated in a 300-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.25), 1 mm MgCl2, [32P]-N3-OAADPr (6.5 μm, ∼1 × 106 cpm), and varying concentrations of cold (unlabeled) OAADPr, ADPr, or NAD+. Reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. In separate control reactions, 2 μm of bovine serum albumin or heat-denatured NudT9-H (5 min, 95 °C) were used instead. Samples were then photolyzed for 8 min using a hand held UV lamp (Mineralight Model UVG-11). Any remaining reactive azido groups were quenched with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by phosphorimaging.RESULTSExpression of TRPM2 confers susceptibility to cell death in response to a variety of oxidative and nitrative agents, particularly hydrogen peroxide (2Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol.

Given the sensitivity of TRPM2-expressing cells to oxidative stress, we questioned whether other types of chemical affronts could lead to TRPM2 channel activation, and subsequent cell death. We focused our attention on pleiotropic drugs: cycloheximide and puromycin, both of which inhibit protein translation and can lead to apoptosis. We performed a series of cell survival studies following cycloheximide or puromycin treatment of stably transfected HEK-293 cells harboring a tet-inducible TRPM2 gene. As displayed in Fig. 1a, cells expressing TRPM2 did not exhibit increased sensitivity to cycloheximide compared with control cells (non-induced and parental HEK 293 cells). In contrast, tet-induced TRPM2-expressing cells displayed a profound sensitivity to puromycin-dependent cell death with as little as 5 μm puromycin (Fig. 1b). The dose response curve, displayed a strong dependence up to 50 μm puromycin. In the absence of TRPM2 expression (Fig. 1c), cells exhibited nearly complete protection against puromycin-dependent cell death (Fig. 1b). Parental HEK-293 cells showed no significant cell death following puromycin treatment (5–50 μm) in the absence (Fig. 1b) or presence of tet (data not shown). These data indicate that TRPM2 expression renders cells more susceptible to puromycin, but not cycloheximide, mediated cell death, and suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis alone is insufficient to cause cell death via activation of the TRPM2 channel.Full activation of the TRPM2 channel is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ (2Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11002-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), thus, we examined whether puromycin-induced cell death in TRPM2-expressing cells required the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Because prolonged incubation in Ca2+-free medium in itself leads to cell death over time, we assayed cell viability in Ca2+-free medium at 6 h rather than 16-h post-drug treatment, and adjusted the range of puromycin concentration accordingly to 100–600 μm. The removal of Ca2+ 1 h prior to drug treatment completely blocked puromycin-induced cell death in TRPM2-expressing cells (Fig. 1d). These results demonstrate that the observed puromycin-induced cell death is dependent on Ca2+ and, provides additional support for puromycin activation of the TRPM2 channel.The above results suggest that puromycin causes sustained TRPM2 channel activation in HEK-293 cells, by means other than protein synthesis inhibition, leading to cell death. We hypothesized that the molecular link between puromycin and TRPM2 channel gating may be activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). As a precursor to apoptosis, PARP-1 is activated in response to cellular signals and DNA damage (reviewed in Ref. 22Diefenbach J. Burkle A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This nuclear enzyme synthesizes poly-(ADP-ribose) from NAD+ and attaches the polyADP-ribosyl moiety onto multiple protein targets. Poly(ADP-ribose) can be rapidly hydrolyzed by PARG (poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase) to form ADP-ribose, which could then activate the TRPM2 channel. We investigated whether PARP inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide and nicotinamide could protect TRPM2-expressing cells from puromycin-induced cell death. Curiously, 3-aminobenzamide, a potent PARP inhibitor displaying an IC50 of ∼5 μm in vivo (23Rankin P.W. Jacobson E.L. Benjamin R.C. Moss J. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on puromycin-induced cell death even at 1.5 mm (Fig. 2a). In contrast, nicotinamide (500 μm) completely protected puromycin-induced cell death up to concentrations as high as 20 μm puromycin (Fig. 2b). Only at a much higher puromycin concentration (50 μm) could the protection afforded by nicotinamide be suppressed. In vivo, nicotinamide inhibits PARP-1 at an IC50 of 100 μm (23Rankin P.W. Jacobson E.L. Benjamin R.C. Moss J. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is therefore a considerably weaker PARP-1 inhibitor than 3-aminobenzamide. These results suggested that nicotinamide protection from puromycin-induced cell death occurs through a mechanism distinct from PARP inhibition.FIGURE 2a, PARP inhibitor 3-amino-benzamide does not block puromycin-induced cell death. TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells were exposed to 0–50 μm puromycin for 16 h in the presence (open diamond) or absence (closed diamond) of 1.5 mm 3-aminobenzamide. Cell survival was determined by measuring fluorescence of calcein in live, adherent cells. Results (with standard deviations) are representative of two or more independent experiments. b, nicotinamide blocks puromycin-induced cell death in TRPM2-expressing cells. TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells were exposed to 0–50 μm puromycin for 16 h in the presence (open diamond) or absence (closed diamond) of 500 μm nicotinamide.

We examined whether two likely candidates, cytoplasmic SIRT2 and mitochondrial SIRT3, could mediate the puromycin-induced TRPM2 channel gating. RNA interference (siRNA) was used to knockdown the endogenous mRNA and protein levels, and the resulting effect on puromycin-induced cell death was assessed (Fig. 3). In these experiments, a nonspecific siRNA control and siRNA specific for SIRT2 and SIRT3 were used. As shown in Fig. 3a, each siRNA demonstrated strict specificity, only knocking down its corresponding RNA and protein, whereas having no effect on the other. After siRNA treatment, endogenous levels of SIRT3 protein in whole cell extracts could no longer be detected. Similar knockdown was seen with SIRT2 siRNA treatment. Data shown in Fig. 3b represent averages obtained from five separate experiments (including standard deviations) with five different concentrations of puromycin. Relative to nonspecific siRNA transfection, cells transfected with either SIRT2 or SIRT3 siRNAs displayed significant resistance to puromycin-induced cell death in TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3b). At 20 μm puromycin, loss of SIRT2 or SIRT3 increased cell survival 2–3-fold, and by 50 μm puromycin, ∼30% of the original cell number was still viable, whereas survival of control siRNA-treated cells was negligible.FIGURE 3a–c, detection of SIRT2 and SIRT3 mRNA and protein levels in siRNA-treated TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells.

All Srx enzymes contain a conserved cysteine residue. To elucidate the mechanism of the Srx-catalyzed reaction, we generated various mutants of Srx and examined their interaction with PrxI, their ATPase activity, and their ability to reduce sulfinic PrxI. Our results suggest that three surface-exposed amino acid residues, corresponding to Arg50, Asp57, and Asp79 of rat Srx, are critical for substrate recognition. The presence of the sulfinic form (but not the reduced form) of PrxI induces the conserved cysteine of Srx to take the γ-phosphate of ATP and then immediately transfers the phosphate to the sulfinic moiety of PrxI to generate a sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester (Prx-Cys-S(=O)OPO32−). This ester is reductively cleaved by a thiol molecule (RSH) such as GSH, thioredoxin, and dithiothreitol to produce a disulfide-S-monoxide (Prx-Cys-S(=O)-S-R). The disulfide-S-monoxide is further reduced through the oxidation of three thiol equivalents to complete the catalytic cycle and regenerate Prx-Cys-SH.

Mammalian cells express six isoforms of Prx (PrxI to PrxVI), which are classified into three subgroups (2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys) on the basis of the number and position of cysteine residues that participate in catalysis (2Rhee S.G.

PrxI to PrxIV, which belong to the 2-Cys Prx subgroup, exist as homodimers and possess two conserved cysteine residues (Cys51 and Cys172 in PrxI). In the catalytic cycle of 2-Cys Prx enzymes, the NH2-terminal Cys-SH (Cys51 in PrxI) is first converted to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) by a peroxide. The unstable sulfenic intermediate (7Claiborne A. Mallett T.C. Yeh J.I. Luba J. Parsonage D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 215-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) then reacts with the COOH-terminal conserved Cys-SH (Cys172 in PrxI) of the other subunit in the homodimer to form a disulfide, which is subsequently reduced by a thiol-containing reducing equivalent, such as thioredoxin (Trx), to complete the catalytic cycle (2Rhee S.G.

As a result of the slow rate of its conversion to a disulfide, the sulfenic intermediate is occasionally oxidized further to cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) (8Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J.

Given that cysteine sulfinic acid is not reduced by biological reductants such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, and Trx, its formation in 2-Cys Prx isoforms results in the inactivation of peroxidase function. However, studies of the fate of such overoxidized Prx enzymes led to the unexpected finding that the formation of the sulfinic acid form is a reversible step in mammalian cells (11Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for the reduction of sulfinylated Prx was subsequently identified in yeast and named sulfiredoxin (Srx) (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Prx enzymes are thought to relieve cells from oxidative stress by removing the low levels of hydroperoxides produced as a result of normal cellular metabolism (6Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C.

However, cells also produce H2O2 for signaling purposes in response to stimulation via various cell surface receptors (15Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Yang K.S. Woo H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Given that prokaryotic Prx enzymes do not undergo oxidative inactivation and that prokaryotes do not contain Srx, the reversible overoxidation of mammalian 2-Cys Prx has been suggested to represent an adaptation of eukaryotic cells to accommodate the intracellular messenger function of H2O2 (15Rhee S.G.

Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the recent observation that, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the overoxidation of Prx represents a redox switch that regulates the function of Prx as an H2O2 sensor and a redox transducer in the activation of the transcription factor Pap1 (17Vivancos A.P.

Oxidation of cysteine to sulfinic acid is not restricted to Prx enzymes. Critical cysteine residues of many other proteins, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (19Souza J.M. Radi R.

Nevertheless, reduction by Srx appears to be a highly selective process. Among the three subtypes of Prx isoforms, only the sulfinic forms of members of the 2-Cys Prx subgroup, not those of members of the atypical 2-Cys or 1-Cys subgroups, were found to be reduced by Srx, and Srx did not act on the sulfinic forms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or DJ-1 (24Woo H.A.

Srx may thus exist solely to support the reversible sulfinic modification of specific Prx enzymes. The in vitro reduction of sulfinic acid requires harsh reaction conditions, and the reduction of sulfinic 2-Cys Prx isoforms is the first known biological example of such a reaction. We have now studied the mechanism of the Srx-catalyzed reaction. We generated Srx mutants by altering conserved amino acid residues and examined both the interaction of the mutant proteins with PrxI and their ability to reduce the sulfinic form of PrxI. In particular, examination of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Srx under various reaction conditions provided important insight into the reaction mechanism. Our results suggest that the conserved cysteine of Srx mediates the phosphorylation of the sulfinic moiety of PrxI and that the resulting sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester is reduced to Cys-SH after oxidation of four thiol equivalents. Contrary to the proposal made with yeast Srx (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), the conserved cysteine was not necessary for the reduction of Prx I sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester. Materials—NADPH, GSH, GSSG, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained from Sigma; creatine phosphate and creatine kinase were from USB Corp.; MgCl2 was from Alfa Aeser; ATP was from Calbiochem; GSH-Sepharose resin and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences; and polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layers on plastic sheets were from J. T. Baker. A site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene, and a monoclonal antibody to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human Trx1, rat Trx reductase, and human PrxI were prepared as described previously (25Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Preparation of Recombinant Srx Proteins—Escherichia coli expression plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins of human Srx (GST-hSrx) or rat Srx (GST-rSrx) were described previously (26Chang T.S.

Mutant Srx proteins were generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with cDNA clones encoding GST-hSrx or GST-rSrx as the template. E. coli BL21 cells harboring the plasmids for GST-Srx fusion proteins were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), the cultures were incubated for 3 h at 25°C, and the cells were then lysed. The GST-Srx proteins were isolated from cell lysates by chromatography on a column of GSH-Sepharose and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The GST moiety was removed from each fusion protein by digestion with thrombin for hSrx or with factor Xa for rSrx, and the released GST was separated from the Srx proteins by passage of the digest through a GSH-Sepharose column. Preparation of Sulfinic PrxI(C172S)—Human PrxI(C172S), in which Cys172 is replaced by serine, was generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and purified as described (26Chang T.S.

The purified protein was oxidized by incubation in the presence of 10 mm DTT and H2O2 (1 mm H2O2 was added three times at 30-min intervals). The sulfinic oxidation state of Cys51 of hyperoxidized PrxI was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (9Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A.

Polyethyleneimine-Cellulose TLC of Hydrolyzed Phosphate—Separation of Pi by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose was performed as previously described (29Cashel M. Lazzarini R.A. Kalbacher B. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 40: 103-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, portions (2 μl) of reaction mixture were applied 3 cm from the lower edge of the thin-layer plate, and ascending chromatography was carried out with 0.75 m potassium phosphate (pH 3.4) in a closed glass chamber for ∼90 min at room temperature. Mass Spectrometry—Axima-CFR plus mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kratos Analytical) equipped with 337 nm nitrogen was used. All mass spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode with pulsed extraction value of 2,000, and linear acceleration voltage was 25 kV. 1 μl of sample was mixed with 1 μl of the matrix solution containing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinna-mic acid in acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) including 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of mixture was loaded on the stainless plate and allowed to dry in air. External calibration was performed with a mixture of bradykinin fragment 1-7 (m/z 757.3997), angiotensin II (human, m/z 1,046.5423), P14R (synthetic peptide, m/z 1,533.8582), and ACTH fragment 18-39 (human, m/z 2,465.1989). Phosphate-Carrier Function of the Conserved Cysteine of Srx—Srx enzymes of species ranging from yeast to mammals all contain a conserved cysteine, which is Cys99 in hSrx and Cys98 in rSrx (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Substitution of serine for the conserved cysteine abolishes the reductase activity of Srx (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 26Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). On the basis of the observation that the reduction of sulfinic Prx by yeast Srx is dependent on ATP and Mg2+, Biteau et al. (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) proposed that the first step of the Srx reaction involves phosphorylation of sulfinic acid (Prx-Cys-SO2H) to yield a sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester (Prx-Cys-S(=O)OPO32−), which is reminiscent of the activation of a carboxylic group by phosphorylation in a variety of enzyme systems. In addition, on the basis of the observation that treatment of yeast cells with H2O2 results in the formation by Srx of a DTT-reducible covalent complex with Prx, they also suggested that the activated sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester might react with the conserved cysteine of Srx to produce a disulfide-S-monoxide (Prx-Cys-S(=O)-S-Cys-Srx), also known as thiosulfinate, which might then undergo reductive cleavage by biological thiols such as Trx to regenerate Prx-Cys-SH and Srx-Cys-SH (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Srx was thus proposed to be a bifunctional enzyme that acts both as a specific phosphotransferase and as a thioltransferase (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 30Jonsson T.J. Murray M.S. Johnson L.C. Poole L.B. Lowther W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8634-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We attempted to detect the proposed sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester intermediate by incubating PrxI-Cys-SO2H with both [γ-32P]ATP and purified hSrx under reducing conditions and then subjecting either the reaction mixture or PrxI immunoprecipitated from the reaction mixture to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. No 32P radioactivity associated with PrxI was detected by either approach (Fig. 1A and data not shown). We considered the possibility that the failure to detect the intermediate was due to its rapid reaction with Srx-Cys-SH to form Prx-Cys-S(=O)-S-Cys-Srx. To promote accumulation of the sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester intermediate, we therefore repeated the experiment with a Cys99 → Ser mutant of hSrx (hSrx(C99S)). Again, we failed to detect 32P-labeled PrxI (Fig. 1A). Instead, 32P radioactivity was found associated with hSrx(C99S). This phosphorylation of the Srx mutant was observed in the presence of sulfinic PrxI but not in the presence of reduced PrxI. It was also a slow process, with <1% of hSrx(C99S) having undergone phosphorylation after incubation for 4 h, at which time the reaction was still progressing (Fig. 1B). To determine whether Ser99 was the site of phosphorylation in hSrx(C99S), we subjected a Cys99 → Ala mutant of hSrx (hSrx(C99A)) to the phosphorylation reaction. Phosphorylation of hSrx(C99A) was not detected (Fig. 1C). To confirm that Ser99 was the site of phosphorylation in hSrx(C99S), we digested the 32P-labeled mutant protein with trypsin and subjected the resulting peptides to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A single peak of radioactivity was obtained (data not shown). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the 32P-labeled peptide corresponded to residues 86-101 (86GAQGGDYFYSFGGSHR101), consistent with the conclusion that Ser99 is the site of phosphorylation. While our work was in progress, Jönsson et al. (30Jonsson T.J. Murray M.S. Johnson L.C. Poole L.B. Lowther W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8634-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of hSrx complexed with ADP and, on the basis of the structure, proposed a mode of ATP binding in which the γ-phosphate oxygen interacts with the backbone nitrogen atom of Gly98. Cys99 was found to be positioned close to the γ-phosphate, but no direct interaction was apparent. These researchers thus did not propose a specific role for Cys99 in the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to sulfinic Prx (phosphotransferase reaction) and suggested that the sulfinic anion directly extracts the γ-phosphate from ATP. To determine whether the substitution of Cys99 by serine affects the interaction between ATP and hSrx, we studied the binding of ATP to hSrx by monitoring of fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 2). The extent of the decrease in fluorescence intensity induced by ATP was similar for wild-type and the C99S mutant of hSrx, and the dissociation constant (Kd) estimated from titration data were also virtually identical (∼6 μm) for both forms of hSrx. These results suggested that, as indicated by the crystal structure, the conserved cysteine of hSrx does not interact with ATP, as well as that the environment surrounding the bound ATP molecule is similar for wild-type and C99S forms of the enzyme. The x-ray structure indicates that the thiol group of Cys99 of hSrx exists predominantly as a thiolate anion as a result of its interaction with the guanidine group of Arg51 and that the nucleotide binding motif of hSrx resembles that of protein tyrosine phosphatases, in which the active site cysteine serves as the phosphate carrier (30Jonsson T.J. Murray M.S. Johnson L.C. Poole L.B. Lowther W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8634-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Guan K. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleophilicity of Ser99-OH in hSrx(C99S) is also likely increased, although not as readily as that of Cys99-SH in the wild-type protein, through interaction with Arg51. The increased nucleophilicity of Ser99-OH is probably still not sufficient, however, to extract the γ-phosphate of ATP given that phosphorylation of hSrx(C99S) required the presence of sulfinic PrxI. Although Srx binds to both reduced and sulfinic forms of PrxI (26Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), reduced PrxI was not able to support the phosphorylation of hSrx(C99S), suggesting a critical role for the sulfinic moiety. It may be necessary for the sulfinic anion to displace the Ser99-O- or Cys99-S- anions from Arg51 for hSrx to initiate a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of ATP. Given that thiolate anions are generated more readily and are more efficient nucleophiles than are oxy anions, phosphorylation of Cys99 would be expected to be faster than that of Ser99. Protein thiophosphate intermediate has previously been detected with protein tyrosine phosphatases that contain an essential cysteine, which serves as the phosphate carrier during catalysis (31Guan K. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiophosphate intermediate was apparent at the earliest time point (10 s) examined and diminished rapidly. Our failure to detect phosphorylated wild-type hSrx in Fig. 1A is probably attributable not only to the known instability of thiophosphate compounds but also to the presence of the sulfinic anion that is positioned closely to initiate nucleophilic attack on the thiophophate. Alternatively, Cys99-S- anion may not form the thiophosphate intermediate but is necessary to activate the γ-phosphate of ATP before phosphorylation of sulfinic Prx. The OH group of sulfinic acid is a poor leaving group in a reaction involving nucleophilic attack of a thiol at sulfur. Phosphorylation of the OH group changes it to a good leaving group that can be easily replaced by a thiol. This is reminiscent of the phosphorylation of OH group in various reactions involving carboxylic acid activation. ATP Hydrolysis by Srx in the Presence of Sulfinic PrxI—We next measured the Srx-dependent release of phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP in reaction mixtures also containing reduced or sulfinic PrxI either with or without GSH. 32P-labeled Pi was produced in the presence of sulfinic PrxI but not in the presence of reduced PrxI (Fig. 3A). The requirement for sulfinic PrxI likely reflects the unique role of the sulfinic moiety in transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to the sulfur atom of Cys99-SH in hSrx, as observed in the transfer of the γ-phosphate to the oxygen atom of Ser99-OH in hSrx(C99S). The sulfinic requirement also suggests that the observed ATP hydrolysis was not due to nonspecific ATP-hydrolyzing activity contaminating the preparations of hSrx or PrxI. The hydrolysis of ATP increased gradually with time in both the absence and presence of GSH (Fig. 3A). In the presence of GSH, it reached a plateau at ∼20 μm Pi; the concentration of sulfinic PrxI in the reaction mixture was also 20 μm. In the absence of GSH, the extent of ATP hydrolysis progressed further. Substitution of alanine for Cys99 in hSrx blocked ATP hydrolysis in both the absence and the presence of GSH (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the conserved cysteine is essential for the production of Pi. Other thiols were able to substitute for GSH, with replacement by Trx or DTT affecting neither the amplitude nor the rate of Pi formation (Fig. 3C). A substantial level of Pi formation was not observed in the presence of GSSG given that Srx becomes inactivated as a result of glutathionylation of its active site cysteine (data not shown), again indicating the critical role of Cys99-SH of hSrx in ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of 20 μm sulfinic PrxI, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm GSH, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was dependent on hSrx concentration (2, 5, 10 μm), but the final amount of Pi released (∼20 μm) was independent of hSrx concentration (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, in reaction mixtures containing 10, 20, or 40 μm sulfinic PrxI, the final level of Pi formed was similar to the corresponding concentration of PrxI (Fig. 3E). However, when GSH was omitted from the reaction mixture containing 20 μm sulfinic PrxI, the final extent of ATP hydrolysis was dependent on hSrx concentration and was much greater than 20 μm in the presence of 5 or 10 μm Srx (Fig. 3F). These results are consistent with the following sequence of events (see Fig. 8). The thiol of hSrx is transiently phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of sulfinic PrxI to form hSrx−Cys99−SPO32−, the high energy thiophosphate of which is then used to phosphorylate the sulfinic moiety of PrxI. Although thiophosphate is suceptible to hydrolysis, hSrx−Cys99−SPO32− is unlikely to be the direct source of the Pi measured in the experiments shown in Fig. 3 because such a pathway is not able to account for the observation that more Pi was produced in the absence of GSH than in its presence or to explain why the maximal level of Pi generated in the presence of GSH was similar to the concentration of sulfinic PrxI regardless of the amount of hSrx present. hSrx−Cys99−SPO32− appears to yield its phosphate rapidly to sulfinic PrxI, and the resulting Prx−Cys−S(=O)OPO32− is likely the direct source of the measured Pi. This mechanism is supported by the observation that the amount of Pi produced in the presence of GSH is equivalent to that of sulfinic PrxI. Prx−Cys−S(=O)OPO32− is reductively cleaved by GSH to yield Prx-Cys-S(=O)-SG and Pi. Prx-Cys-S(=O)-SG is then further reduced by GSH to Prx-Cys-SH. The production of Pi in the presence of GSH is thus limited by the amount of sulfinic PrxI. In the absence of GSH, however, Prx−Cys−S(=O)OPO32− is hydrolyzed to regenerate sulfinic Prx, resulting in a futile cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that consumes ATP continuously and explains why the amount of Pi produced is much higher than that of sulfinic PrxI present. Nevertheless, even in the absence of GSH, Pi formation did not increase linearly and was hyperbolically saturated (Fig. 3, A and F). This observation likely reflects the inactivation of hSrx as the result of disulfide formation via its active site cysteine with PrxI (see below). The thiolate anion that attacks Prx−Cys−S(=O)OPO32− has been proposed to be Cys99-S- of hSrx, not GSH (12Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 30Jonsson T.J. Murray M.S. Johnson L.C. Poole L.B. Lowther W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8634-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Srx was thus proposed to possess a thioltransferase function for which the conserved cysteine is essential. According to this mechanism, however, the amount of Pi produced in the absence of GSH should be equal to that of hSrx. Our observation (Fig. 3C) that the rate of Pi production was unchanged when GSH was replaced with a protein thiol (Trx) or a nonphysiological thiol (DTT) suggests that the sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester moiety of Prx−Cys−S(=O)OPO32− is freely accessible to any thiol in the solution and that its reductive cleavage does not require a specific thioltransferase activity associated with Srx. Nucleophilic substitution of phosphate by a thiolate anion (R-S-) produces a disulfide-S-monoxide (Prx-Cys-S(=O)-S-R). Disulfide-S-monoxide undergoes a sequential reduction reaction in t"
https://openalex.org/W2012471255,"We examined the role of angiogenesis and the need for receptor signaling using chemical inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor in the adult zebrafish tail fin. Using a small-molecule inhibitor, we were able to exert precise control over blood vessel regeneration. An angiogenic limit to tissue regeneration was determined, as avascular tissue containing skin, pigment, neuronal axons and bone precursors could regenerate up to about 1 mm. This indicates that tissues can regenerate without direct interaction with endothelial cells and at a distance from blood supply. We also investigated whether the effects of chemical inhibition could be enhanced in zebrafish vascular mutants. We found that adult zebrafish, heterozygous for a mutation in the critical receptor effector phospholipase Cgamma1, show a greater sensitivity to chemical inhibition. This study illustrates the utility of the adult zebrafish as a new model system for receptor signaling and chemical biology."
https://openalex.org/W2088846224,"EAAT2 is a high affinity, Na+-dependent glutamate transporter with predominant astroglial localization. It accounts for the clearance of the bulk of glutamate released at central nervous system synapses and therefore has a crucial role in shaping glutamatergic neurotransmission and limiting excitotoxicity. Caspase-3 activation and impairment in expression and activity of EAAT2 are two distinct molecular mechanisms occurring in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in the transgenic rodent model of the disease. Excitotoxicity caused by down-regulation of EAAT2 is thought to be a contributing factor to motor neuron death in ALS. In this study, we report the novel evidence that caspase-3 cleaves EAAT2 at a unique site located in the cytosolic C-terminal domain of the transporter, a finding that links excitotoxicity and activation of caspase-3 as converging mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS. Caspase-3 cleavage of EAAT2 leads to a drastic and selective inhibition of this transporter. Heterologous expression of mutant SOD1 proteins linked to the familial form of ALS leads to inhibition of EAAT2 through a mechanism that largely involves activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of the transporter. In addition, we found evidence in spinal cord homogenates of mutant SOD1 ALS mice of a truncated form of EAAT2, likely deriving from caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage, which appeared concurrently to the loss of EAAT2 immunoreactivity and to increased expression of activated caspase-3.

Recent studies, performed in chimeric mice that are mixtures of normal and mutSOD1-expressing cells, have demonstrated that toxicity to motor neurons in the spinal cord requires damage from mutSOD1 acting in non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes (4Clement A.M.

One of the prominent astrocyte functions is the regulation of glutamate concentration in the synaptic clefts of the central nervous system, not only to modulate the normal synaptic transmission but also to prevent the development of glutamate excitotoxicity and the consequent neuronal death. Up to 95% of the glutamate transport in the central nervous system is handled by the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 (5Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Takahashi K. Iwama H.

Several lines of evidence support a prominent role for EAAT2 impairment in the pathogenesis of ALS. Excitotoxicity caused by a consistent reduction in expression and activity of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 is among the various proposed pathogenic mechanisms implicated in playing a role in the propagation of disease (7Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). In the G93A-SOD1 transgenic mouse and rat, the expression levels of EAAT2 are reduced, often focally in the spinal cord ventral gray matter and prior to the onset of the disease (3Howland D.S. Liu J.

EAAT2 knockdown achieved by using antisense oligonucleotides in adult rats leads to hind limb paralysis with motor neuron degeneration and denervation similar to ALS (8Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M.

We have reported previously that mutSOD1 proteins, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes exposed to oxidative stress, lead to selective inhibition of EAAT2 by targeting the C-terminal domain (9Trotti D.

Moreover, experiments in which EAAT2 was genetically or pharmacologically increased have led to the conclusion that EAAT2 impairment contributes to the progression of motor neuron degeneration in ALS (10Guo H.

Several experimental observations indicate that mutSOD1 toxicity involves sequential activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 in transgenic mice and in cellular models of ALS (13Pasinelli P.

Investig. 2003; 111: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the role that caspase-3, a key proteolytic enzyme executioner of apoptosis (16Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), plays in ALS. Oxidative stress delivered to the N2a cell model of mutSOD1-linked ALS triggered caspase-3 activation (17Pasinelli P. Borchelt D.R. Houseweart M.K. Cleveland D.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Evidence for activation of caspase-3 was also reported in vivo in mutSOD1 transgenic mice, both in motor neurons and astrocytes of the spinal cord at the time of onset of ALS-like symptoms (13Pasinelli P.

In addition, modulation of caspase-3 activity by overexpression of Bcl-2 or by infusion of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk provided protective benefits in a transgenic mouse model of ALS (18Vukosavic S.

Although it is not clear whether activation of caspase-3 initiates ALS, the observations accumulated thus far strongly indicate that this mechanism contributes substantially to the progression of the disease. EAAT2 has a putative consensus site for caspase-3 cleavage located in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. In this study, we provide evidence that the C-terminal domain of EAAT2 is cleaved by caspase-3 and that this proteolytic process functionally impairs the transporter activity. Cleavage and inactivation of EAAT2 are triggered by mutSOD1 when challenged by oxidative stress in vitro. Moreover, we found evidence of a truncated EAAT2 form likely derived from caspase-3 cleavage in the spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 transgenic ALS mice, suggesting that this event also occurs in vivo. Animals—Wild type, G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice, and nontransgenic control mice were used for this study. The mouse colonies were B6SJL-TgN (G93A-SOD1)1Gur (stock number 002726; ∼30 copies of the transgene; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), and B6SJL-TgN(SOD1)2Gur (stock number 002297; ∼8 copies of the transgene) and were maintained in-house. These lines expressed approximately the same amount of human SOD1 protein as assessed on immunoblot. Genotyping and determination of transgene copies number were performed by PCR analysis. Transfections and Protein Extractions—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. EAAT2 and D505N-EAAT2 cloned in pcDNA3.1 were transiently transfected in HEK 293 cells at ∼70% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h later in buffer containing CHAPS (1%), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience), briefly sonicated, and stored at –80 °C for Western blot analysis or immediately processed for caspase cleavage reactions. In Vitro Cleavage Reactions—Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine/ketamine according to institutional guidelines. Spinal cords were collected and immediately homogenized on ice (glass-Teflon homogenizer; 1,000 rpm) in 30 volumes of hypotonic solution containing 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini™ with EDTA). The homogenates were centrifuged (39,000 × g, 15 min), supernatants removed, and the “crude” membrane pellet resuspended in extraction buffer containing SDS or CHAPS (1%), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience). Extracts were briefly sonicated, centrifuged (1,000 × g, 4 min) to remove unsolubilized material, and immediately analyzed or stored at –80 °C. The homogenates prepared with the above protocol were termed SDS or CHAPS extracts according to the extraction detergent used. For the caspase cleavage experiments, 5 μl of CHAPS extract, containing 10–25 μgof total proteins, were incubated for 1–7 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of caspase cleavage buffer containing 10% sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, the protease inhibitors mixture Complete™, in the presence or absence of purified human recombinant active caspases (BD Biosciences). We determined that the protease inhibitors of the Complete™ mixture did not prevent caspase-3-mediated cleavage in vitro of its well characterized substrate PARP (16Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-containing sample buffer, boiling for 5 min, and then analyzing by immunoblot on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus). Glutamate transporter cDNAs were translated in vitro using the TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate kit and [35S]methionine labeling (Promega, Madison, WI). Five μl of the in vitro translated reactions were used for caspase cleavage experiments. In vitro translations and autoradiography protocols were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed Mutagenesis and PCRs—D505N-EAAT2 was generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), confirmed by sequencing and cloned in pcDNA3.1 for mammalian expression or pOX for oocyte expression. Asparagine was chosen rather than the more commonly used alanine because the structural similarity of asparagine to aspartate did not alter the activity and trafficking of D505N-EAAT2 in oocytes, which was a crucial requisite to assess the impact of the caspase-3 treatment on the transporter function. The coding region of the truncated EAAT2 ((Tr)EAAT2) was generated by PCR and the cDNAs subcloned in pcDNA3.1. Antibodies—Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against peptides of the glutamate transporters EAAT1–3 were referred to by capital letters A, B, and C, respectively, followed by numbers indicating the corresponding peptide of the rat transporter sequence. For this study we used A522-541 (0.2 μg/ml, rabbit 8D0161, EAAT1 cytoplasmic C terminus), B12-26 (0.2 μg/ml, rabbit 26970, EAAT2 cytoplasmic N terminus), B493-508 (0.1 μg/ml, rabbit 84946, EAAT2 cytoplasmic C terminus), and C161-177 (0.5 mg/ml, EAAT3 extracellular loop, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Moreover, an antibody raised against the last 17 amino acids of EAAT2 C terminus was purchased from Affinity BioReagent (which we termed ABR556-573, catalogue number PA3-040; 1:1,000–10,000). These anti-glutamate transporter antibodies, although raised against the rat sequence, cross-react with mouse and human isoforms except for B518-536, which does not cross-react with the mouse isoform. Other antibodies used are anti-human SOD1 (Calbiochem) and anti-p17 fragment of caspase-3 (Cell Signaling). Protein Expression in Oocytes—Linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V Xenopus oocytes were enzymatically defolliculated, injected with cRNAs (20–50 ng/oocyte), incubated at 18 °C in L-15 solution (Specialty Media) supplemented with gentamycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) and used for experiments 1–3 days post-injection. Glutamate Uptake Measurements—Glutamate uptake current and uptake of l-[3H]glutamate were measured in oocytes as described previously (9Trotti D. Rolfs A. Danbolt N.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Hediger M.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of caspases on glutamate-evoked EAAT2 uptake current, 0.2–4 ng of active recombinant purified caspases (BD Biosciences) in 50 nl of buffer were injected into the oocytes, and the uptake current was recorded before and after the injection. Injection buffer contained (final concentration in the oocyte in mm) the following: 1 Tris-HCl, 2 NaCl, 1 imidazole, 10 KPi, pH 7.4, 0.01% CHAPS, 0.1 EDTA, 1 DTT, and 0.2% glycerol. Glutamate uptake was measured for 5 min by incubating the oocytes with 10 μm glutamate isotopically diluted with l-[3H]glutamate (specific activity 51.9 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1 ml of frog Ringer solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2·H2O, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1–7.3). The uptake reaction was stopped by rinsing the oocytes with cold sodium-free frog Ringer solution (0 Na+, 115 mm choline. The oocytes were then dissolved in 10% SDS and counted to quantify the incorporation of glutamate. Caspase Activity Assay—Ten oocytes/group were incubated for 1 h with H2O2 (150 μm). Each group was lysed in 400 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT and incubated for 5 min in an ice bath. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g (15 min at 4 °C), and 5 μl of supernatant was used to determine caspase-3 cleavage activity and kinetics (>12 h) using a fluorometric assay (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence emission was determined by a Fluo-star BMG fluorometer (excitation 380 nm and emission 420 nm). l-[3H]Glutamate uptake was measured for 5 min in oocytes treated for 1 h with 150 μm H2O2 or control as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Transporters—Biotinylation reactions were performed using the biotinylation kit from Pierce and following the manufacturer's protocol with minor adaptations for Xenopus oocytes. Briefly, 20–25 oocytes/group were used for these experiments. The high number of oocytes per group was intended to minimize intra-group variability because of unpredictable variations in the expression levels of EAAT2 molecules targeted at the cell surface of the oocyte. Caspase-3 Cleaves the Cytoplasmic C-terminal Domain of EAAT2 at Aspartate 505 —The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 has a unique putative caspase-3 cleavage motif located at aspartate 505 (human EAAT2 sequence numbering). This aspartate (Asp-505) is conserved among isoforms from different species, including rat and mouse (Fig. 1A). To test whether EAAT2 could be cleaved by caspase-3, we treated mouse spinal cord homogenates with increasing amounts of purified caspase-3 (active form of the recombinant human caspase-3, concentration range 10–100 nm), and the reaction was then probed on Western blot with three polyclonal anti-EAAT2 antibodies directed against different domains of the transporter (Fig. 1A). Caspase-3 concentrations used in this experiment are comparable with those of other studies reporting caspase-3 cleavage of different substrates, such as PARP or amyloid precursor protein (21Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The treatment led to a dose-dependent loss of EAAT2 immunoreactivity and a simultaneous dose-dependent appearance of a lower band that corresponded to the shortened form of EAAT2 (Fig. 1B, (Tr)EAAT2) when the blot was probed with the anti-EAAT2 N-terminal antibody B12-26. The same reaction probed with the antibodies B493-508 (Fig. 1B) and ABR556-573 (Fig. 1B) showed dose-dependent loss of EAAT2 immunoreactivity and no evidence for (Tr)EAAT2 accumulation, as expected if the cleavage occurred at the unique site at aspartate 505. Failure to recognize (Tr)EAAT2 by the B493-508 antibody, whose epitope sequence encompasses the putative caspase-3 consensus site in EAAT2, argues that the immunoreactivity of this antibody is mainly directed against the last amino acids of the C-terminal portion of the epitope. This is also supported by evidence that B493-508 immunoreactivity toward EAAT2 is abolished by incubating the antibody with the peptide 506–516 (100 μm, human EAAT2 sequence numbering), whereas the peptide 493–505, although it slightly decreased the affinity of the antibody for EAAT2, it did not block the antibody immunoreactivity (not shown). Treatment of rat spinal cord homogenates with increasing concentrations of active caspase-3 and probed with the B518-536 antibody led to similar dose-dependent loss of EAAT2 immunoreactivity as seen with the ABR556-573 antibody in mouse homogenates (not shown). The cleavage of EAAT2 is specific for caspase-3 as other caspases, such as caspase-1, -6, -7, and -8, were ineffective (Fig. 1C). Quantitation of the proteolytic reaction indicates that EAAT2 cleavage occurs with relevant kinetics properties (kcat/Km = 3 × 105 m–1 s–1) similar to other validated caspase-3 substrates, such as PARP or amyloid precursor protein (21Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and D). To ascertain whether the cleavage occurred at the predicted site in the EAAT2 sequence, we disrupted the putative consensus site in EAAT2 by mutating aspartate (D) at position 505 to asparagine (N). CHAPS extracts of HEK 293 cells transfected with wild type and D505N-EAAT2 mutant were then treated with caspase-3 and analyzed by immunoblot. As expected, the D505N mutation prevented the cleavage from occurring (Fig. 2A). We also tested whether other nonconventional sites could possibly be used in addition to the canonical one. In vitro translated EAAT2 labeled with [35S]methionine was incubated with caspase-3 and the reaction analyzed by autoradiography. EAAT2 has 24 methionine residues evenly scattered in the primary structure, including 2 methionines located downstream of the caspase-3 consensus motif, ensuring even labeling of all domains of the transporter. Caspase-3 cleaved EAAT2 but not D505N-EAAT2, forming two fragments at ∼55 kDa ((Tr)EAAT2) and 8 kDa (termed CTE as for the C-terminal domain of EAAT2 excised by caspase-3) (Fig. 2B). It follows that the canonical motif for caspase-3 cleavage is the only site used to cleave EAAT2. EAAT1, the other major astroglial glutamate transporter, lacks conventional cleavage sites for caspase-3 and was indeed insensitive to caspase-3 treatment (Fig. 2C and see also Fig. 4E). On the contrary, the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3 has two caspase-3 cleavage sites defined by the sequence -DXXD-, also located at the cytoplasmic C terminus. Cleavage at these sites would generate small fragments of ≤3 kDa, which is hard to detect on the gel. Moreover, these fragments do not contain methionines and therefore could not be visualized by autoradiography. Indeed, treatment of the in vitro translated EAAT3 with caspase-3 did not produce proteolytic fragments. Nevertheless, we detected a small but reproducible downward shift of the EAAT3 band, suggesting that the cleavage may have occurred (Fig. 2D and see also Fig. 4C). EAAT2 Cleavage by Caspase-3 Leads to Uptake Inhibition—Despite EAAT2 being an astroglial protein, previous studies have shown that primary astrocytes in culture do not express physiological levels of EAAT2. In vitro manipulation of astrocyte cultures with cell differentiation-inducing compounds, such as cAMP analogues or epidermal growth factor, promoted expression of EAAT2 (22Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, these manipulations resulted in expression of non-functional transporters, raising the concern that EAAT2 was not properly targeted to the plasma membrane or was incorrectly processed in this system, therefore questioning the validity of the astrocytes as an experimental model system to study the function of EAAT2 (23Swanson R.A. Liu J. Miller J.W. Rothstein J.D. Farrell K. Stein B.A. Longuemare M.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 932-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schlag B.D. Vondrasek J.R. Munir M. Kalandadze A. Zelenaia O.A. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To assess whether caspase-3 proteolytic cleavage had a functional impact on EAAT2, we therefore took advantage of the oocyte expression system and the two-electrode voltage clamp technique to measure EAAT2 uptake current. Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA for EAAT2 abundantly express a functional transporter (25Trotti D. Aoki M. Pasinelli P. Berger U.V. Danbolt N.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 576-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (156) Google Scholar). EAAT2-expressing oocytes were then injected with the active caspase-3, and EAAT2 uptake current was measured before and after the injection. At –50 mV, EAAT2 uptake current was rapidly and progressively inhibited by the injection of caspase-3 (∼45% in 20 min), whereas the uptake current of the D505N-EAAT2 mutant was unaltered, suggesting that the proteolytic cleavage at the caspase-3 consensus site in EAAT2 was responsible for the inhibition (Fig. 3, A and B). Affinity for substrate (i.e. Km for glutamate) calculated from the glutamate-evoked current of the D505N-EAAT2 mutant transporter expressed in oocytes was statistically not different from wild type EAAT2 (20.2 ± 4.5 μm for WT-EAAT2 versus 17.7 ± 5 μm for D505N-EAAT2, n = 3 oocytes; data not shown); in addition, no change in glutamate uptake velocity was also observed (23 ± 4 for WT-EAAT2 versus 25 ± 3 nmol/mg protein/15 min for D505N-EAAT2, n = 10 oocytes/group, measured at 10 μm glutamate; see “Experimental Procedures”). A similar uptake activity between wild type and D505N-EAAT2 is consistent with a lack of significant structural alterations in the mutant D505N-EAAT2. The transport of glutamate is coupled to the movements of cations across the plasma membrane (Na+, K+, and H+) that are necessary for transporter cycling and glutamate uptake, as well as chloride anions that are uncoupled to the flux of glutamate. The relative proportion of the uptake current generated by ion-coupled glutamate transport (stoichiometric current) and the glutamate-gated chloride conductance varies in intensity among EAAT isoforms (26Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In EAAT2, the stoichiometric current is predominant compared with the chloride conductance (26Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, to rule out that the caspase-3-mediated inhibition of the uptake current was because of alterations in the glutamate-gated chloride current component rather than the transport of glutamate, we measured the effect of caspase-3 on EAAT2 uptake current at the chloride equilibrium potential (–20 mV), whereby the contribution of this conductance to the total uptake current is nullified. The extent of inhibition (∼45% at 20 min at –20 mV; data not shown) was the same as at –50 mV, suggesting that the glutamate transport current was the EAAT2 uptake current component affected by the caspase-3 cleavage. EAAT2 inhibition increased at increasing amounts of injected caspase-3 (Fig. 3C). Other caspases like caspase-7 (Fig. 3A) or caspase-1 and -6 (not shown) did not affect EAAT2, an observation in accord with the lack of effect of these caspases on EAAT2 in the in vitro cleavage reaction. Despite the fact that caspase-8 did not directly cleave EAAT2 in vitro (Fig. 1C), when injected into oocytes expressing EAAT2, it caused a progressive inhibition of the transporter-mediated uptake current, although with much slower kinetics because 50% inhibition was achieved in 60 min post-injectio"
https://openalex.org/W2163387042,"Although it has been shown that mouse uroplakin (UP) Ia, a major glycoprotein of urothelial apical surface, can serve as the receptor for the FimH lectin adhesin of type 1-fimbriated Escherichia coli, the organism that causes a great majority of urinary tract infections, the glycan structure of this native receptor was unknown. Using a sensitive approach that combines in-gel glycosidase and protease digestions, permethylation of released glycans, and mass spectrometry, we have elucidated for the first time the native glycoform structures of the mouse UPIa receptor and those of its non-binding homolog, UPIb, and have determined the glycosylation site occupancy. UPIa presents a high level of terminally exposed mannose residues (located on Man6GlcNAc2 to Man9GlcNAc2) that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. We have shown that this property is conserved not only in the mouse uroplakins but also in cattle and, even more importantly, in human UPIa, thus establishing the concept that UPIa is a major urothelial receptor in humans and other mammals for the mannose-specific FimH variant. In contrast, our results indicate that most terminally exposed glycans of mouse UPIb are non-mannose residues, thus explaining the failure of FimH to bind to this UPIb. In cattle, on the other hand, complex carbohydrates constituted only about 20% of the UPIb N-linked glycans. Human UPIa contained exclusively high mannose glycans, and human UPIb contained only complex glycans. The drastically different carbohydrate processing of the UPIa and UPIb proteins, two closely related members of the tetraspanin family, may reflect differences in their folding and masking due to their interactions with their associated proteins, UPII and UPIIIa, respectively.

The essential first step in mucosal infection is for the microorganisms to latch onto the mucosal surfaces to escape being expelled by physical forces and other innate host defenses (1Hasty D.L. Wu X.-R. Dykuizen D.E. Sokurenko E.V. Nataro J.P. Cohen P.S. Mobley H.L.T. Weiser J.N. Colonization of Mucosal Surfaces. 24. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.2005: 351-377Google Scholar). Indeed, many microorganisms are equipped with sophisticated devices that allow them to adhere to and colonize a particular mucosal niche and cause organ-specific infections. The type 1-fimbria, a slender filamentous appendage made by almost all uropathogenic Escherichia coli, is such a device and is obligatory for E. coli adhesion to the urothelial surface (2Abraham S.N.

The fimbriae are made up of four protein components (FimA, -F, -G, and -H), with homo-polymeric FimA forming a long, cylindrical shaft projecting outward from the E. coli and a single FimH adhesin strategically located at the distal tip of each fimbria (5Schilling J.D.

A crystallographic study revealed that the FimH subunit consists of two distinct domains, an N-terminal lectin domain encircling a carbohydrate binding pocket and a C-terminal pilin domain (8Choudhury D.

This structural model predicts that the binding pocket of FimH is capable of accommodating a single mannose residue, a finding highly consistent with earlier in vitro studies where type 1-fimbriated E. coli can efficiently agglutinate mono-mannose-bearing latex beads as well as erythrocytes and bakers' yeast, both known to express high mannose surface glycoproteins (10O'Hanley P. Lark D. Falkow S. Schoolnik G. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, mono-mannose proteins do not exist in nature, and erythrocytes and yeast are not involved in E. coli adhesion to the urothelial surface. Critical information is lacking, therefore, regarding the detailed carbohydrate structure of the urothelial receptor that is physiologically responsible for binding the FimH lectin adhesin. The urothelial surface is almost completely occupied by 16-nm protein particles hexagonally packed into two-dimensional crystals called asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) 3The abbreviations used are: AUM, asymmetric unit membrane; UP, uroplakin; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization. 3The abbreviations used are: AUM, asymmetric unit membrane; UP, uroplakin; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization. or urothelial plaques (11Koss L.G.

Aebi U. Sun T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13716-13724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UPIa and UPIb each contain four transmembrane domains and interact with single transmembrane-domain partners, UPII and UPIIIa, respectively (15Min G. Zhou G. Schapira M. Sun T.T. Kong X.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4087-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Wu X.R. Medina J.J. Sun T.T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whereas the mature form of UPII is not glycosylated, UPIa, -Ib, and -IIIa are all modified with N-linked glycans, as evidenced by electrophoretic mobility reduction after N-glycosidase digestions (20Yu J. Lin J.H. Wu X.R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Lin J.H. Wu X.R. Kreibich G. Sun T.T. J. Biol.

The sheer abundance of the uroplakins on the urothelial surface and the fact that some of them carry N-linked glycans raised the interesting possibility that one or more of the uroplakins may serve as the urothelial receptor(s) for FimH lectin adhesin. This hypothesis has been proven correct by several independent in vitro and in vivo studies. First, type 1-fimbriated, but not P-fimbriated or non-fimbriated, E. coli bound to highly purified bovine AUM containing primarily the four uroplakins (27Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Medina J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A gel overlay assay using radiolabeled, type 1-fimbriated E. coli revealed that bovine UPIa and -Ib, both sensitive to endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment, bound to the E. coli. Neither non-glycosylated UPII nor highly glycosylated UPIIIa (sensitive only to peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment) showed any binding, strongly indicating a high degree of ligand-receptor specificity (27Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Medina J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Second, under quick-freeze, deep-etch microscopy in a mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, the tips of type 1-fimbriae were seen to make direct contact with the central depression surrounded by the inner ring within the 16-nm uroplakin particle (28Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). This study provided the first in vivo evidence indicating that the uroplakins can serve as the physiological receptors for the FimH adhesin. FimH-mediated binding to urothelial surface can also trigger urothelial cells to engulf the bacteria, thus insulating the pathogen from host defenses (29Anderson G.G. Palermo J.J. Schilling J.D. Roth R. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 30Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Third, electron microscopy-based domain mapping studies using recombinant FimH as a probe localized the FimH binding sites to the inner 6 subdomains of the 16-nm protein particles (31Min G. Stolz M. Zhou G. Liang F. Sebbel P. Stoffler D. Glockshuber R. Sun T.T. Aebi U. Kong X.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Finally, naturally occurring phenotypic variants of FimH showed different binding affinities to highly purified AUMs. Those E. coli that exhibit high affinity binding to the mono-mannose moieties and that are primarily found in urinary tract infection isolates bind to purified AUMs in much greater numbers than those binding only to the tri-mannose structures that have been identified mainly in the fecal isolates (32Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Dykhuizen D.E. Ofek I. Wu X.R. Krogfelt K.A. Struve C. Schembri M.A. Hasty D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8922-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly suggest that uroplakins play critical roles not only in mediating E. coli adhesion and internalization but also in providing a selective advantage for certain types of E. coli strains to preferentially colonize the urinary tract. Despite these advances, several critically important questions have remained unanswered. For instance, in mice, whose UPIa and -Ib can easily be resolved on SDS-PAGE, we have reported that FimH bound preferentially to UPIa, despite the fact that a significant portion of mouse UPIb is sensitive to Endo H, which is known to release “high mannose” glycans (33Zhou G. Mo W.J. Sebbel P. Min G. Neubert T.A. Glockshuber R. Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Kong X.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4095-4103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An even more important and clinically relevant question is whether human UPIa, like that of its mouse counterpart, can also serve as the receptor for FimH. In addition to these unsettling issues, the structural basis for FimH so reproducibly binding UPIa has not been determined. It seemed clear that elucidating the detailed oligosaccharide structures of both UPIa and -Ib from different species in conjunction with FimH binding studies should help resolve many of these important issues. Because of the difficulty in individually isolating the highly insoluble uroplakins and because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the carbohydrates, it has been a technical challenge to determine the oligosaccharide structures of the uroplakins to enable establishing the structure-function relationships (34Dell A. Morris H.R. Science. 2001; 291: 2351-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 35Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

In this study we utilized the sophisticated and sensitive approach of mass spectrometry combined with in-gel glycosidase digestions followed by microscale permethylation of released glycans and tandem mass spectrometry to accomplish detailed analyses of the N-linked glycans present in UPIa and -Ib of mouse and cattle. Despite the small quantities available and the great complexity typically present in biological samples, we demonstrate that this approach can quickly provide abundant structural and quantitative information. We also mapped the locations of the N-glycosylation sites that actually harbor glycans in both proteins through subsequent in-gel protease digestion of the deglycosylated proteins and mass spectral sequencing of the proteolytic peptides. Finally, we provide critical evidence that human UPIa, but not UPIb, has Endo H-sensitive (high mannose) glycans and can bind FimH. Results from these studies provide a molecular explanation as to why UPIa and UPIb bind FimH differently and shed light on the roles of different uroplakins in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections.

The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI MS) matrices 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker, Billerica, MA), the permethylation reagents dimethyl sulfoxide, sodium hydroxide, and methyl iodide as well as chloroform and other solvents (Sigma-Aldrich) were stored under dry conditions. Recombinant FimH/C complex was produced as described previously (38Vetsch M. Sebbel P. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Isolation of Urothelial Plaques—Urinary bladders from murine and bovine species were obtained within 4 h postmortem. Human urothelial cells were collected from 14–16-week-old embryonic bladders. The acquisition and use of human tissues and the donor consent form have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of NYU Medical School. Urothelial plaques were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation coupled with differential detergent washes (21Wu X.R. Manabe M. Yu J. Sun T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19170-19179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting urothelial plaque proteins were solubilized in 1% SDS and quantitated using the BCA reagent. FimH Overlay Assay—Proteins in the AUM fractions from each species were resolved on 17% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TBST (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by incubation with biotinylated FimH/C (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The biotinylated FimH/C proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Sigma) and SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Gel Electrophoresis and Protein Staining/Destaining—The purified AUM was resolved on 16% tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) using an E 19001-Xcell II Mini-Cell (Genisphere Inc., PA) at 125 V constant voltage. Proteins were visualized by GelCode Blue Stain reagent (Pierce) followed by destaining with distilled water. Individual protein bands of interest were excised from the gel. Protein Reduction and Alkylation—The excised gel bands were cut into pieces of about 1 mm3 and washed with 50 mm NH4HCO3, then 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN). After removal of the supernatant, gel segments were dried in a Savant Instruments SC 110 SpeedVac™ concentrator (Farmingdale, NY) and incubated at 56 °C for 60 min in 25 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm NH4HCO3. After cooling to room temperature and removal of the supernatant, the gel pieces were incubated at 45 °C for 45 min in the dark in 25 μl of 50 mm fresh iodoacetamide in 50 mm NH4HCO3, washed in 50 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, then 100% CH3CN, and dried using a SpeedVac to remove SDS, reducing, and alkylation reagents. In Situ Glycosidase and Protease Digestions—The dried gel pieces were sequentially treated with PNGase F (500 units/ml in 25 mm NH4HCO3) and with trypsin (20 ng/μl in 25 mm NH4HCO3). For each digestion, the volume of enzyme solution was adjusted to cover the gel pieces, more buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3) was added, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Oligosaccharides and Peptides Extraction—Glycans were extracted from the gel pieces by removing the incubation buffer, which already may have contained some sugars, and using three exchanges of 100 μl water, with sonication for 30 min each time. All supernatants were combined and dried in a SpeedVac. Similarly, peptides were extracted from the gel pieces by removing the incubation buffer, which already may have contained some peptides, and using three changes of 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile in water with sonication for 30 min each time. All extracts were combined and dried in a SpeedVac. Permethylation of Oligosaccharide—Released glycans were dissolved in Me2SO and per-O-methylated by treating with powdered sodium hydroxide with methyl iodide using the method introduced by Ciucanu and Kerek (39Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar) as modified by Ciucanu and Costello (40Ciucanu I. Costello C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Reflex IV MALDI-TOF MS equipped with a Laser Science nitrogen laser (Franklin, MA) having a 3-ns pulse width at 337 nm or an electrospray ionization (ESI) QSTAR Pulsar i quadrupole-orthogonal TOF mass spectrometer (MS and MS/MS) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). MALDI-TOF MS—Dried permethylated glycans were dissolved in acetonitrile:water (70:30, v/v). One μl of sample was then mixed with 1 μl of the MALDI matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid (50/50/0.1 v/v/v)), spotted onto the MALDI target plate, allowed to dry and analyzed in the positive reflectron mode with delayed extraction. Permethylated oligosaccharides were observed as [M+Na]+ ions. Zip-Tip™-cleaned tryptic peptides were dissolved in acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid (30:70:0.1, v/v/v). One μl of sample solution was mixed with the MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid (50/50/0.1 v/v/v)), deposited on a MALDI target, and observed as [M+H]+ in the positive ion spectra. ESI Quadrupole-orthogonal TOF MS and Collision-induced Decomposition MS/MS—ESI MS/MS has been a particularly useful tool for the analysis of oligosaccharides, because it provides composition and sequence information based on comparison of fragments (41Gillece-Castro B.L. Burlingame A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 689-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42Reinhold V.N. Reinhold B.B. Chan S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 271: 377-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Richter W.J. Muller D.R. Domon B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The solution of permethylated glycans 5 μl in 25 mm NaOH, 50% methanol (60/40, v/v) was loaded into a nanospray tip, and the sample was nanosprayed into the mass spectrometer by increasing the capillary potential slowly until a stable ion current was observed in the positive ion mode. In ESI, the permethylated oligosaccharides gave abundant [M+nNa]n+ ions, and the entire isotopic cluster was selected for the collision-induced decomposition MS/MS analysis (44Harvey D.J. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 1178-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Collision-induced decomposition MS/MS spectra were acquired at 30–60 V collision cell voltage, and the resulting spectra were examined manually. Peptides cleaned by Zip-Tip™ were eluted with acetonitrile:water:formic acid (50/50/0.5, v/v/v) and analyzed. Peaks whose observed mass suggested that they contained potential glycosylation sites were selected for MS/MS analyses. Strategies for Determining the Oligosaccharide Structures of Uroplakins Ia and Ib—Highly purified mouse urothelial plaques contain four major protein subunits, uroplakins Ia (∼27 kDa), Ib (29 kDa), II (15 kDa), and IIIa (47 kDa; Fig. 1A, lane 2). Although UPIa could be quantitatively converted to a lower Mr (deglycosylated) form by Endo H (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5), only about 30–40% of the UPIb glycans were Endo H-sensitive, and the rest of the glycoprotein required PNGase F for complete deglycosylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 10–12). Similar results were obtained with bovine uroplakins Ia and Ib, which were only partially resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 3), although they could be clearly distinguished by immunoblotting using monospecific antibodies; in this case 100% of UPIa (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) and 70–80% of the UPIb were Endo H-sensitive (lanes 7 and 8). The minimal requirement for Endo H sensitivity is the presence of Manα1–3Manα1–6Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-. This means that only high mannose and hybrid-type glycans will be released (45Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 46Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4508-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial Endo H-sensitivity of UPIb was confusing as this was not entirely consistent with the observation that recombinant FimH binds exclusively to mouse UPIa, with no detectable binding to UPIb (33Zhou G. Mo W.J. Sebbel P. Min G. Neubert T.A. Glockshuber R. Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Kong X.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4095-4103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address this problem we devised a strategy to determine the carbohydrate structures of mouse UPIa and UPIb (Fig. 1C). Uroplakins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A). Bands of interest were then excised and deglycosylated in-gel by treatment with PNGase F. The extracted glycans were subjected to permethylation and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and by ESI MS/MS. After release of the N-glycans, the deglycosylated proteins remaining in the gel were trypsin-digested. The products from the proteolysis were analyzed by MALDI MS and ESI MS/MS to identify the glycan-released peptides and locate the previously occupied glycosylation sites. Mouse Uroplakin Ia and Ib Harbor Mainly High Mannose and Complex Glycans, Respectively—When the glycans released from mouse UPIa were permethylated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, multiple peaks were observed whose m/z values were spaced at intervals of 204.1 ± 0.1 (calculated monoisotopic mass of a permethylated Hex residue, 204.100 atomic mass units), suggesting the presence of a glycan series with differing numbers of hexoses (Fig. 2A). The oligosaccharide structures of all the major monoisotopic peaks were deduced from their observed mass, and their glycosidic and cross-ring fragmentation patterns were derived from ESI MS/MS and the normal N-linked glycan structure. Fig. 3A presents a representative MS/MS spectrum that was assigned to glycoform IV, Man9GlcNAc2. Designations of fragments are based on the accepted nomenclature for oligosaccharide fragmentation introduced by Domon and Costello, shown in supplemental Fig. 1 (47Domon B. Costello C.E. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 397-409Crossref Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). The prominent fragment ions B and Y observed indicated that these glycans possess hexoses as non-reducing termini (please see supplemental Figs. 3, 5, and 6 for the interpretation of other high mannose glycans). Moreover, since the ratios of signal intensities (from individual glycans greater than 1 kDa irrespective of their structures) are known to be semiquantitative in MALDI-TOF mass spectra, we could use these data to estimate the relative abundances of the various components (48Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 49Naven T.J. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This information as well as the observed and calculated masses and the proposed compositions of various glycoforms are summarized in Table 1. Finally, the occupancy of the potential N-glycosylation site at Asn-169 was mapped by the identification by MALDI-TOF MS of a single tryptic peptide (residues 152–175) that had undergone the expected Asn-169 to Asp-169 conversion upon deglycosylation (Fig. 4A, supplemental Fig. 2). The sequence of this peptide was confirmed by ESI MS/MS (data not shown); this result was consistent with our previous investigation of mouse UPIa using 18O labeling and tandem mass spectrometry (33Zhou G. Mo W.J. Sebbel P. Min G. Neubert T.A. Glockshuber R. Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Kong X.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4095-4103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Analysis by ESI MS/MS of permethylated glycan ions at m/z 814.1 (3+)(A), corresponding to structure IV of murine UPIa, and m/z 1110.9 (3+), corresponding to structure VIII of UPIb (B). The illustrated glycan structures were derived from the MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Monoisotopic peaks are annotated, and the assignment of peaks takes into account the normal N-glycan structures.

https://openalex.org/W1964161751,"The Escherichia coli genes frmB (yaiM) and yeiG encode two uncharacterized proteins that share 54% sequence identity and contain a serine esterase motif. We demonstrated that purified FrmB and YeiG have high carboxylesterase activity against the model substrates, p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids (C2-C6) and α-naphthyl acetate. However, both proteins had the highest hydrolytic activity toward S-formylglutathione, an intermediate of the glutathione-dependent pathway of formaldehyde detoxification. With this substrate, both proteins had similar affinity (Km = 0.41-0.43 mm), but FrmB was almost 5 times more active. Alanine replacement mutagenesis of YeiG demonstrated that Ser145, Asp233, and His256 are absolutely required for activity, indicating that these residues represent a serine hydrolase catalytic triad in this protein and in other S-formylglutathione hydrolases. This was confirmed by inspecting the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S-formylglutathione hydrolase YJG8 (Protein Data Bank code 1pv1), which has 45% sequence identity to YeiG. The structure revealed a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold and a classical serine hydrolase catalytic triad (Ser161, His276, Asp241). In E. coli cells, the expression of frmB was stimulated 45-75 times by the addition of formaldehyde to the growth medium, whereas YeiG was found to be a constitutive enzyme. The simultaneous deletion of both frmB and yeiG genes was required to increase the sensitivity of the growth of E. coli cells to formaldehyde, suggesting that both FrmB and YeiG contribute to the detoxification of formaldehyde. Thus, FrmB and YeiG are S-formylglutathione hydrolases with a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad involved in the detoxification of formaldehyde in E. coli.

Formaldehyde is an extremely reactive chemical producing covalently cross-linked complexes with proteins and nucleic acids (1Bolt H.M. J. Cancer Res. Clin.

It is a common environmental contaminant found in many industrial and medical products, as well as being endogenously produced in all living organisms as a result of metabolism (methionine, histamine, methanol, and methylamine), spontaneous dissociation of 5,10-mehylene tetrahydrofolate, or oxidative demethylation of DNA and RNA (4Ma T.H.

Detoxification of formaldehyde can be carried out by enzymes like formaldehyde dismutase, methylformate synthase, or glutathione-independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (10Bystrykh L.V.

However, these enzymes have been found in only a limited number of organisms, whereas a glutathione-dependent repair system appears to be wide-spread in nature and has been found in most prokaryotes (except for archaea) and all eukaryotes (7Hanson A.D.

In this process (shown in Scheme 1), formaldehyde spontaneously reacts with GSH to produce S-hydroxymethylglutathione, which is then oxidized by formaldehyde dehydrogenase to S-formylglutathione. Finally, this compound is hydrolyzed to formate and GSH by S-formylglutathione hydrolase (FGH). 2The abbreviations used are: FGH, S-formylglutathione hydrolase; pNP, p-nitrophenyl; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square. These functionally related enzymes, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and FGH, also show genetic linkage, since their genes are adjacent in many bacterial genomes or even fused in some eukaryotes (16Stover N.A. Cavalcanti A.R. Li A.J. Richardson B.C. Landweber L.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 1539-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde dehydrogenases (class III alcohol dehydrogenases) were extensively characterized both structurally and biochemically (17Moulis J.M. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15189-15194Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas FGHs have received far less attention. Only three eukaryotic FGHs (from the human liver, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis thaliana) (21Uotila L. Koivusalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7664-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Degrassi G. Uotila L. Klima R. Venturi V. Appl. Environ.

Biophys. 2002; 399: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have been purified and partially characterized, but the homologous enzyme from bacteria has not been yet purified. The FGH enzymes from yeasts and A. thaliana are not strictly specific to S-formylglutathione and also show significant carboxylesterase activity against model substrates α-naphthyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl (pNP) acetate (22Degrassi G. Uotila L. Klima R. Venturi V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3470-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kordic S. Cummins I. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the sequence analysis suggested that FGHs are serine hydrolases, it has been proposed that FGHs are cysteinyl hydrolases, because the A. thaliana FGH was highly sensitive to the inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide and heavy metals (23Kordic S. Cummins I. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In humans, this enzyme (identical to esterase D) was highly expressed in liver and kidney, and its expression was stimulated by phenobarbital treatment (24Lee Y.-H.P. E Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6337-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Genetic polymorphism of esterase D was discovered in various human populations, and the reduced enzymatic activity of this enzyme was found to be associated with the susceptibility to several pathological conditions (toxic liver cirrhosis, retinoblastoma, obesity, and autism) (25Cowell J.K. Rutland P. Jay M. Hungerford J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 74: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Ritvo E.R. Mason-Brothers A. Menkes J.H. Sparkes R.S. Arch. Gen.

Wong M.L. Licino J. Lee C.J. Pharmacogenomics J. 2001; 1: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Much less information is available about the prokaryotic FGHs. In Paracoccus denitrificans, the gene encoding FGH (fghA) has been identified and shown to be homologous to the human esterase D (15Harms N. Ras J. Reijnders W.N. van Spanning R.J. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6296-6299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent work on Escherichia coli suggested that the three-gene operon frmR, frmA, frmB is likely to encode a complete pathway for degradation of formaldehyde (29Herring C. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The expression of frmA and frmB in E. coli cells was induced by formaldehyde 20-100-fold over the level of uninduced cells. The frmR gene is likely to encode the transcriptional repressor of this operon, whereas frmA and frmB were predicted to encode S-hydroxymethylglutathione dehydrogenase and S-formylglutathione hydrolase, respectively (29Herring C. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this work, we have purified and biochemically characterized the E. coli FrmB and its paralog, YeiG, which shares 54% amino acid sequence identity with FrmB. Both proteins were shown to be active FGHs with a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad. Our results demonstrated that YeiG is a constitutive enzyme in E. coli, whereas the expression of FrmB is greatly stimulated by formaldehyde and that both proteins are involved in formaldehyde detoxification in vivo. Chemicals and Strains—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. S-Formylglutathione was synthesized from formylthioglycolate and glutathione as described previously (30Uotila L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 424-430Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nitrosoglutathione was prepared according to Schapiro et al. (31Schapiro J.M. Libby S.J. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of FrmB and YeiG—The frmB open reading frame was PCR-amplified using chromosomal DNA of the E. coli BW25113 strain and the cloning primers frmB-Clon-F and frmB-Clon-R (supplemental Table S2). The restriction sites BamHI and NdeI were added to the primers and used to directionally clone the PCR product into pET15b (AmpR) as previously described (32Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S.

The recombinant plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain for overexpression. The YeiG overexpression plasmid was obtained from the Genobase collection (33Kitagawa M. Ara T.

The cells were grown on LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6, and the protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.7-1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were incubated with shaking at 16 °C overnight. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole), and disrupted by sonication. Purification of His6-tagged proteins was carried out using metal-chelate affinity chromatography on nickel affinity resin (Qiagen) as previously described (32Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E.

Both proteins were well expressed and purified with a high yield (2-5 mg/liter of culture) and purity (over 95% as verified by SDS gels and Coomassie staining). Purified enzymes were dialyzed against buffer Tris-HCl (20 mm), pH 8. When FrmB was dialyzed, 0.5 mm of TCEP was added to the buffer to prevent protein precipitation. Enzymatic Assays—Esterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using 2-10 μg/ml of purified enzyme at 37 °C. Carboxylesterase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl esters of various fatty acids (C2-C6) (34Vorderwülbecke T. Kieslich K. Erdmann H. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1992; 14: 631-639Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The amount of p-nitrophenol released was quantified at A400 using the extinction coefficient ϵ = 16,300 m-1 cm-1. Stock solutions of pNP-esters were prepared using acetonitrile as a solvent. Aryl esterase activity was determined by measuring the α-naphthol released from α-naphthyl acetate and α-naphthyl-butyrate at 310 nm (ϵ = 3000 m-1 cm-1). Stock solutions (100 mm) of α-naphthyl esters were prepared in acetone. Thioesterase activity was assayed using palmitoyl-CoA as previously described (35Berge R.K. Farstad M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity against the glutathione derivatives (S-formylglutathione, S-lactoylglutathione, S-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)glutathione, S-hexylglutathione, and S-(4-nitrobenzyl)glutathione) was followed continuously at 240 nm (21Uotila L. Koivusalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7664-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction rate was calculated using the following extinction coefficients: S-formylglutathione, ϵ = 3,000 m-1 cm-1; S-lactoylglutathione, ϵ = 3,100 m-1 cm-1. For determination of the Km and Vmax, the assays contained substrates at concentrations of 0.005-1.5 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear curve fitting from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Construction of frmB and yeiG Deletion Mutants—Deletion mutants were generated by the methods described by Datsenko and Wanner (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). The Km cassette was PCR-amplified from pKD4 by using specific primers for the frmB gene (frmB-KOF plus frmB-KOR) and for the yeiG gene (yeiG-KOF plus yeiG-KOR). The PCR product was purified and used to transform competent cells of the E. coli BW25113 strain containing pKD46. To induce the λRed recombination proteins, the cells were grown on LB medium containing 1 mm arabinose. The competent cells were transformed by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (pulse controller at 200 ohms, capacitance at 250 microfarads, and voltage at 25 kV). Kanamycin-resistant transformants were recovered on LB agar plates containing 25 μg/ml of kanamycin. The insertion of the recombinant cassette was confirmed by PCR using a set of primers complementary to a region upstream and downstream of each target gene. The sets of primers used were frmB-CF/frmB-CR and yeiG-CF/yeiG-CR for frmB and yeiG, respectively. Plasmid pKD46 was eliminated by growing the cells on LB plates at 37 °C. The mutagenesis process was completed by deletion of kanamycin cassette using pCP20 as described by Datsenko and Wanner (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Bacterial cells were cultured in MOPS minimal medium (37Neidhart F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.05% glucose as a carbon source with shaking at 37 °C. When the cells reached A600 = 0.3, the cultures were split into three aliquots. Individual subcultures contained the following: no inducer, 0.25 mm formaldehyde, and 250 mm methanol. Cells were collected by centrifugation 45 min later. Total RNA was subsequently isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Residual DNA present in the RNA preparations was removed by RNase-free DNase (Fermentas). cDNAs were synthesized with the superscript first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and stored at -20 °C prior to use. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on the Applied Biosystems 7300 apparatus (Applied Biosystems) using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The yeiG open reading frame cloned on pCA24N expression vector was used as a template. Primers carrying specific mutations were 41-42 nucleotides in length; the target codon was flanked by ∼20 bp each side. The amino acids selected to be mutated were all changed to alanine. The standard PCR mixture contained 50-100 ng of template DNA and 150-250 ng of each primer. The methylated plasmid was digested with DpnI (twice), and 4 μl of each reaction were used to transform competent E. coli DH5-α cells. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected from LB plates, and the specific mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed on BW25113 and affinity-purified using a nickel-chelate column as described previously (32Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Growth Experiments—Formaldehyde, methanol, and methylglyoxal resistance tests were carried out in 20-ml glass tubes with 5 ml of MOPS glucose at 37 °C and 250 rpm (37Neidhart F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth parameters were determined in 250-ml bottles with 50 ml of MOPS plus 0.2% glucose. The growth rate was calculated from the exponential phase of growth by linear regression from three independent assays. E. coli Has Two Genes Encoding Putative S-Formylglutathione Hydrolases—In E. coli, the frmB (yaiM) gene encodes a putative FGH and is part of an operon with frmR (encoding the putative transcriptional repressor for this operon) and frmA (encoding an S-hydroxymethylglutathione dehydrogenase). This operon is probably involved in the detoxification of formaldehyde (29Herring C. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The BLAST search of the E. coli genome with the FrmB sequence revealed the presence of a paralog, the YeiG protein, which has 54% sequence identity to FrmB (Fig. 1). In contrast to frmB, the yeiG gene is a single gene operon located between folE and cirA and transcribed in the opposite direction to these genes. No paralogs of FrmR or FrmA were found in the E. coli genome. YeiG is annotated as an esterase (Swiss-Prot or EcoCyc data base), because in our recent work we demonstrated that YeiG possesses esterase activity in general enzymatic screens with model substrates (pNP-butyrate and palmitoyl-CoA) (38Kuznetsova E. Proudfoot M. Sanders S.A. Reinking J. Savchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Yakunin A.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 263-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of amino acid sequences of FGHs from sequenced genomes demonstrated that this enzyme is well conserved with sequences from bacteria and eukaryotes having 44-80% identity (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the BLAST analysis of archaeal and many Gram-positive bacterial genomes revealed no presence of either FGH homolog, suggesting that these organisms use other enzymes for the detoxification of formaldehyde. This scattered phylogenetic distribution of FGHs and rather high sequence similarity among FGHs from different organisms suggest a relatively recent evolutionary origin of this enzyme, which was probably spread mainly by the lateral gene transfer (39Ochman H. Lawrence J.G. Groisman E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). Analysis of sequenced genomes revealed that besides three E. coli strains (K12, O157:H7, and O6), two FGH genes were only found in three environmental bacteria: Rhizobium (Sinorhizobium) meliloti, Shewanella oneidensis, and Photobacterium profundum. In contrast to E. coli,in R. meliloti and S. oneidensis genomes, both putative FGH genes show an operon association with genes encoding putative glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenases, suggesting that both operons might be involved in formaldehyde detoxification. Enzymatic Activity of FrmB and YeiG—Purified FrmB and YeiG were screened for catalytic activity against a panel of 15 esterase substrates (carboxyl- and thioesters). YeiG showed detectable activity (17.6 nmol/min mg protein) against palmitoyl-CoA (C-S bond hydrolysis), high activity against α-naphthyl acetate, and significant activity toward several pNP-esters of short chain fatty acids (C-O bond hydrolysis) (Fig. 2). FrmB did not hydrolyze palmitoyl-CoA and showed significant esterase activity only toward two pNP-esters (pNP-acetate and pNP-propionate) and α-naphthyl acetate (Fig. 2). With pNP-propionate as substrate, both proteins had maximal activity at pH 7.5-8.8 (data not shown). Our experiments with purified FrmB and YeiG revealed high formylglutathione hydrolase activity in both proteins. This activity involves the hydrolysis of the C-S bond, indicating that these proteins are promiscuous esterases capable of hydrolysis of two types of bonds: C-O and C-S. With S-formylglutathione as substrate, both proteins showed saturation kinetics with a sigmoidal saturation curve (Hill coefficient (nH) = 2.2 ± 0.44), indicating positive cooperativity in S-formylglutathione binding. With other substrates (Table 1), both proteins exhibited hyperbolic saturation curves. High concentrations of S-formylglutathione (>1 mm) inhibited the activity of both proteins. FrmB and YeiG showed similar affinity to S-formylglutathione, but FrmB had 4-5 times higher specific activity (Table 1). For both proteins, S-formylglutathione was the best substrate, indicating that this metabolite might be their natural substrate. The kinetic parameters of the E. coli FrmB and YeiG (Table 1) were similar to those of eukaryotic FGHs from yeast, A. thaliana, and human liver (21Uotila L. Koivusalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7664-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Degrassi G. Uotila L. Klima R. Venturi V. Appl. Environ.

Like for the A. thaliana FGH (23Kordic S. Cummins I. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the activity of both FrmB and YeiG was inhibited by the sulfhydryl inhibitors (N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetate, ZnCl2, and CuCl2 (1 mm; data not shown)), suggesting the importance of SH groups for catalysis in both proteins. In the available sequences of known and putative FGHs, there are two conserved Cys residues (Cys26 and Cys54 in YeiG; Fig. 1) that might be targeted by these sulfhydryl inhibitors.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of the E. coli FrmB and YeiG with several substratesSubstrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmmmunits/mgaUnits = μmol/mins–1m–1 s–1FrmB pNP-acetate (C2)0.29 ± 0.020.58 ± 0.020.30 ± 0.011.03 × 103 pNP-propionate (C3)0.83 ± 0.040.27 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.020.17 × 103 S-Lactoylglutathione0.60 ± 0.210.09 ± 0.020.05 ± 0.010.08 × 103 S-Formylglutathione0.41 ± 0.0355.0 ± 4.028.5 ± 2.076.90 × 104YeiG pNP-acetate (C2)0.45 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.080.26 ± 0.040.57 × 103 pNP-propionate (C3)0.48 ± 0.030.71 ± 0.010.37 ± 0.050.76 × 103 pNP-butyrate (C4)0.70 ± 0.030.70 ± 0.050.36 ± 0.030.51 × 103 pNP-caproate (C6)0.95 ± 0.010.64 ± 0.080.49 ± 0.040.52 × 103 α-Naphthyl acetate1.03 ± 0.139.79 ± 0.565.09 ± 0.294.94 × 103 S-Lactoylglutathione0.58 ± 0.181.97 ± 0.291.02 ± 0.151.75 × 103 S-Formylglutathione0.43 ± 0.0512.6 ± 1.306.51 ± 0.6715.1 × 104a Units = μmol/min Open table in a new tab YeiG also showed significant activity against lactoylglutathione (Fig. 2). With this substrate, it had 20 times higher hydrolase activity than FrmB. No hydrolase activity was found toward S-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)glutathione, S-hexylglutathione, or S-(4-nitrobenzyl)glutathione. S-Lactoylglutathione is an intermediate of the detoxification of another aldehyde, methylglyoxal. In all organisms, methylglyoxal is produced spontaneously from the glycolytic intermediates (dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) or by enzymes (methylglyoxal synthase, amino oxidases) (40Freedberg W.B. Kistler W.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 137-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Richard J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 42Cooper R.A.

Like formaldehyde, methylglyoxal is very toxic, and its elevated production results in rapid modification of proteins, nucleotides, and other substrates generating advanced glycation end products (44Shinohara M. Thornalley R.J. Giardino I. Beisswenger P. Thorpe S.R. Onorato J. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The methylglyoxal-induced modifications may regulate gene expression and produce multiple negative effects in diabetes and other pathological conditions (45Ramasamy R. Yan S.F. Schmidt A.M. Cell. 2006; 124: 258-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 46Yao D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Pestell R. Edelstein D. Giardino I. Suske G. Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Sarthy V.P. Hammes H.-P. Brownlee M. Cell. 2006; 124: 275-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Methylglyoxal can be detoxified by the glutathione-independent glyoxalase III, by the glutathione-dependent system comprising glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II, or by various aldose and ketose reductases (47Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 48Misra K. Banerjee A.B. Ray S. Ray M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 49Misra K.

Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Glyoxalase I produces S-lactoylglutathione, which is then hydrolyzed by glyoxalase II to d-lactate and glutathione (51Thornalley P.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 20: 99-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the presence of glyoxalase II (GloB) in E. coli has been reported, the biochemical characterization of this enzyme has not been published (52Ferguson G.P. Totemeyer S. MacLean M.J. Booth I.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, the affinity and activity of the E. coli YeiG toward S-lactoylglutathione are within the range of these parameters of known glyoxalases from other organisms (0.05-3.0 mm; 1.34-2007 μmol/min/mg of protein) (BRENDA data base). The glyoxalase system of Gram-negative bacteria is thought to operate in the periplasmic space (42Cooper R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2099206674,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent but poorly understood neurological complication in sepsis that negatively influences survival. Here we present clinical and experimental evidence that this brain dysfunction may be related to altered neurotransmission produced by inflammatory mediators. Compared with septic patients, SAE patients had higher interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plasma levels; interestingly, these levels decreased once the encephalopathy was resolved. A putative IL-1β effect on type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs), which mediate fast synaptic transmission in most cerebral inhibitory synapses in mammals, was investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons and in Xenopus oocytes expressing native or foreign rat brain GABAARs, respectively. Confocal images in both cell types revealed that IL-1β increases recruitment of GABAARs to the cell surface. Moreover, brief applications of IL-1β to voltage-clamped oocytes yielded a delayed potentiation of the GABA-elicited chloride currents (IGABA); this effect was suppressed by IL-1ra, the natural IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) antagonist. Western blot analysis combined with IGABA recording and confocal images of GABAA Rs in oocytes showed that IL-1β stimulates the IL-1RI-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and the consequent facilitation of phospho-Akt-mediated insertion of GABAARs into the cell surface. The interruption of this signaling pathway by specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Akt inhibitors suppresses the cytokine-mediated effects on GABAAR, whereas activation of the conditionally active form of Akt1 (myr-Akt1.ER*) with 4-hydroxytamoxifen reproduces the effects. These findings point to a previously unrecognized signaling pathway that connects IL-1β with increased “GABAergic tone.” We propose that through this mechanism IL-1β might alter synaptic strength at central GABAergic synapses and so contribute to the cognitive dysfunction observed in SAE.

Acute impairment of mental function is often the first manifestation of sepsis. This condition is best defined as “sepsis-associated encephalopathy” (SAE) 4The abbreviations used are: SAE, sepsis-associated encephalopathy; a.u., arbitrary units; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; ER, estrogen receptor; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAAR, GABA type A receptor; IL-1ra, IL-1 receptor antagonist; IL-1RI, IL-1 receptor type-I; myr-Akt1.ER*, conditionally active form of Akt1; PB, phosphate buffer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SAPS, simplified acute physiology scoring; TNFR-I + II, TNF receptor type I and II; PKC, protein kinase C; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. 4The abbreviations used are: SAE, sepsis-associated encephalopathy; a.u., arbitrary units; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; ER, estrogen receptor; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAAR, GABA type A receptor; IL-1ra, IL-1 receptor antagonist; IL-1RI, IL-1 receptor type-I; myr-Akt1.ER*, conditionally active form of Akt1; PB, phosphate buffer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SAPS, simplified acute physiology scoring; TNFR-I + II, TNF receptor type I and II; PKC, protein kinase C; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. in order to stress the absence of direct infection of the central nervous system. The syndrome is characterized by a marked decrease in cerebral activity resulting in confusion, somnolence, and disorientation and decreased consciousness (1Papadopoulos M.C. Davies D.C. Moss R.F. Tighe D. Bennett E.D. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 3019-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As in other kinds of metabolic encephalopathy, diagnosis of this condition is dependent on the exclusion of all other possible causes of brain dysfunction (2Wilson J.X. Young G.B. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 2003; 30: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The exact incidence of SAE is unknown. Sprung et al. (3Sprung C.L. Peduzzi P.N. Shatney C.H. Schein R.M. Wilson M.F. Sheagren J.N. Hinshaw L.B. Crit. Care Med. 1990; 18: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) reported that 23% of a large series of 1333 septic patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Systemic Sepsis Study developed encephalopathy. The same authors found a significantly higher mortality (49%) in the SAE group compared with the group of patients with normal mental status (26%). A direct relation between the severity of cerebral dysfunction and increased mortality in septic patients was also reported in other studies (2Wilson J.X. Young G.B. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 2003; 30: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Eidelman L.A. Putterman D. Putterman C. Sprung C.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 275: 470-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The pathophysiology of SAE remains poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. Damage to endothelial cells and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier mediated by cytokines and reactive oxygen species occur at an early stage of sepsis and can alter cerebral blood flow (5Bolton C.F. Young G.B. Zochodne D.W. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Perimicrovessel edema, disruption of astrocyte end-feet, and neuronal injury are observed in septic encephalopathic pigs with fecal peritonitis (6Davies D.C. J. Anat. 2002; 200: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), but limited data are available from human studies. An imbalance between branched chain and aromatic amino acids and reduced plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of ascorbate, probably due to excessive oxidative stress, has been reported in some patients with SAE (7Basler T. Meier-Hellmann A. Bredle D. Reinhart K. Intensive Care Med. 2002; 28: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Voigt K. Kontush A. Stuerenburg H.J. Muench-Harrach D. Hansen H.C. Kunze K. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated previously a significant association between the intensity of the inflammatory response and outcome in patients with sepsis (9Arnalich F. López J. Codoceo R. Jiménez M. Madero R. Montiel C. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Arnalich F. García-Palomero E. López J. Jiménez M. Madero R.

Capiscol C. Fernandez-Capitán C. Madero R. Montiel C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 127: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because of that observation, we hypothesized that one or more of the inflammatory mediators could play a key role in the origin of this type of encephalopathy. Our hypothesis is based on three previous observations as follows: (i) inflammatory stimuli increase the levels of mediators and their receptors in rodent brain and raise the level of circulating mediators that cross into the central nervous system (12Breder C.D. Dinarello C.A. Saper C.B. Science. 1988; 240: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 13Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. J.

Investig. 1997; 100: 2641-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar); (ii) 30–50% of melanoma and renal carcinoma patients receiving high subcutaneous IL-2 doses as a coadjuvant treatment for their cancer developed confusion and delirium (15Rosenberg S.A. Lotze M.T. Yang J.C. Linehan W.M. Seipp C. Calabro S. Karp S.E. Sherry R.M. Steinberg S. White D.E. J. Clin. Oncol. 1989; 7: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar); and (iii) the effects of intracerebral injection of IL-1β in rodents mimic the electroencephalographic changes and soporific effects of SAE (16Krueger J.M. Walter J. Dinarello C.A. Wolff S.M. Chedid L. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R994-R999PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dunn A.J. Swiergiel A.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 840: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Cerebral synaptic activity is decreased in SAE and because type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) regulate fast synaptic transmission in most cerebral inhibitory synapses in mammals, we suspected that this receptor would be a good target for inflammatory mediators. In fact, increased GABAergic neurotransmission has been reported in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (18Jones E.A. Weissenborn K. J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

In light of the strong association that we observed between the IL-1β plasma levels and neurological affectation, we designed a second experimental phase using cultured rat hippocampal neurons and Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA to study the following: 1) how cytokine affects GABAARs in these two very different cell types, and 2) the mechanism behind this putative interaction. Different experimental approaches are used in this study, including immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy, molecular biology, and pharmacological, electrophysiological, and biochemical techniques.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPatients—Over a 1-year period, a total of 75 consecutive patients admitted to our medical ward in a European university hospital with a diagnosis of sepsis were screened daily for the onset of acute mental impairment. Our institutional review board approved the study, and informed written consent was obtained from the patient and/or his/her guardian (family member). Sepsis was defined according to standardized international criteria (19Levy M.M. Fink M.P. Marshall J.C. Abraham E. Angus D. Cook D. Cohen J. Opal S.M. Vincent J.L. Ramsay G. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 31: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar), and SAE was defined as acute alteration of mental status (i.e. inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness) secondary to sepsis. Patients with SAE were included in the study if neurological symptoms had begun within 12 h of admission, and they did not meet the following exclusion criteria: 1) alcoholism or having received medications known to cause mental confusion at admission to hospital; 2) a history consistent with significant memory impairment before hospitalization, i.e. dementia, psychosis, or neurological disease; 3) metabolic encephalopathy because of renal or liver failure, complete respiratory failure (oxygen saturation of <90% on room air and arterial PCO2 ≥ 45 mm Hg), or electrolytic disturbance; and/or 4) immunosuppression because of poorly controlled diabetes or treatment with oral corticosteroids or cytotoxic drugs within the previous month. The diagnosis of SAE was established by ruling out other possible causes of encephalopathy through standard procedures, including blood examinations as well as cranial computed tomography scanning and electroencephalographic recordings (20Young G.B. Bolton C.F. Archibald Y.M. Austin T.W. Wells G.A. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1992; 9: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Twenty one patients with SAE were finally entered in the study. Encephalopathy was scored daily by two classic neuropsychological tests: the Glasgow Coma Scale (21Teasdale G. Jennet B. Lancet. 1974; 2: 81-84Abstract PubMed Scopus (9350) Google Scholar) and the Reaction Level Scale (22Starmark J.E. Stalhammar D. Holmgren E. Rosander B. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 69: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) until the neuropsychological symptoms had completely cleared. For each patient with encephalopathy and enrolled in this study, two other septic patients who had normal results on their neuropsychological tests were included as controls; both groups of patients have similar ages, duration of fever before the collection of blood samples, and severity of disease. The Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (23Folstein M.F. Folstein S.E. McHugh P.R. J. Psychiatr. Res. 1975; 12: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (70416) Google Scholar) was performed to exclude dementia in the control group (score ≥24) and to estimate base-line cognitive performance in patients after SAE had resolved. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed in patients whose encephalopathy persisted beyond the first 48 h after study enrollment to exclude a direct infection of the brain. The simplified acute physiology scoring (SAPS) II system (24Auriant I. Vinatier I. Thaler F. Tourneur M. Loirat P. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 26: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used to assess illness severity for each patient at the time of study entry and at 48 h after entering the study.A venous blood sample of 10 ml was obtained within 24 h after severe alterations in mental status had been noted (day 1), repeated 48 h later (day 3), and again on the day the encephalopathy resolved completely. Resolution was confirmed by normal performance in all neuropsychological tests. CSF samples (1 ml) were obtained from the 10 patients who remained encephalopathic 48 h after entering the study. A cell count of <5/ml and a protein level of <0.45 g/liter were considered normal. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (Medgenix Diagnostic, Fleurus, Belgium) as described elsewhere (10Arnalich F. García-Palomero E. López J. Jiménez M. Madero R. Renart J. Vázquez J.J. Montiel C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 11Arnalich F. López-Maderuelo D. Codoceo R. López J. Solís-Garrido L.M. Capiscol C. Fernandez-Capitán C. Madero R. Montiel C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 127: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Concentrations of soluble TNF receptor type I + II (TNFR I + II) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were measured using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Quantikine; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Primary Neuronal Culture—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (for immunocytochemistry experiments) or mixed cortical plus hippocampal neurons (for immunoprecipitation experiments) were prepared from the hippocampi or from the cerebral cortices of Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses at embryonic day 18. Brains were removed and freed from the meninges, and the tissues were then dissected under a binocular microscope. Neurons were mechanically dispersed and plated on poly-l-lysin and laminin-treated 12-mm glass coverslips (at a density of 30,000/cm2) in B-27-supplemented Neurobasal media. The neurons were kept in an incubator at 5% CO2 without medium change for 14 days; experimental treatments were begun after this period.Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging of Rat Hippocampal Neurons—After treatment with the cytokine, neurons were either fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.25% Triton X-100 (in PBS, 10% normal goat serum) or fixed without permeabilization. Nonspecific immunolabeling sites were blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum in PBS. The overnight incubation with either the mouse monoclonal anti-GABAAR β2/β3 subunit antibody (bd-17, 20 μg/ml) or the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the type I receptor for IL-1β, IL-1RI (1:200), at 4 °C, was followed by incubation with Oregon Green 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) or the AlexaFluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300), respectively. Neurons treated as above but not incubated with the primary antibodies were used as negative controls. The stained neurons were imaged using a Leica TCS SP2 spectral confocal laser scanning microscope. All images were captured with the Leica confocal software as reported previously (25Solís-Garrido L.M. Pintado A.J. Andrés-Mateos E. Figueroa M. Matute C. Montiel C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52414-52424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using the same adjustments of laser intensity and photomultiplier sensitivity and then processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software using identical contrast and brightness values for both control and IL-1β-treated neurons. Fluorescence intensity, expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.), was measured in a region of interest of 10 μm2 on the cell body membrane or within the soma. In other cases, fluorescence intensity was measured along the x axis of the entire cell body.For quantification of the number of GABAAR clusters in proximal neurites, hippocampal neurons were plated on coverslips and maintained in culture in the same conditions as above. After IL-1β treatment for 1 h, “live neurons” were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the primary anti-GABAAR β-chain antibody, at the same dilution as above. After rinsing, neurons were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PB (5 min) followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS and mounted in glycerol/buffer (1:1). Images were collected with a DXM1200F digital camera incorporated to a personal computer, using the ×40 objective of a Nikon TE2000-S microscope. Image files were processed using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). The number of clusters was determined along dendritic segments of an area of 10 μm2, starting >5 μm from the soma; a single mean value was obtained for each neuron after analyzing three to four different fields per cell. At least five different neurons from each culture of three independent cultures were used in this analysis.Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cortical cultures, containing a mixed population of cortical plus hippocampal neurons, were prepared and maintained in culture for 14 days as described previously. After this period, neurons were homogenized in RIPA buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm, 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm benzamide). The neuronal lysates (300 μg of protein) were then immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal anti-GABAAR β2/β3-chain antibody (2 μg) for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of a mixture of γ-bind protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and γ-bind protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. After three washings in lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing N-ethylmaleimide instead of β-mercaptoethanol and resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and immunoblotted with the phospho-Ser detection antibody set (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The efficiency of receptor immunoprecipitation was determined by reprobing the same membrane with the anti-GABAAR β2/β3-chain antibody.Preparation of mRNA—Techniques for poly(A)+ RNA isolation from tissues as well as in vitro mRNA synthesis have been described elsewhere (25Solís-Garrido L.M.

García A.G. Montiel C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 377-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was purified from mixed cortex plus hippocampus regions of brain from 3-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats using the FastTrack mRNA 2.0 kit from Invitrogen. The plasmid containing the entire coding region of the myristoylated conditionally active form of Akt1 (pcDNA3.1-myr-Akt1.ER*) was linearized with NotI and transcribed with T7 polymerase using the mCAP RNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Messenger was dissolved in RNase-free water (1 mg/ml) and aliquots stored at –80 °C until use. The myr-Akt1.ER* was constructed by fusing the c-Src myristoylation targeting sequence to a constitutively active form of Akt1 lacking the pleckstrin homology domain. Conditional activity was conferred in a manner similar to that described for other protein kinases by fusing the myr-Akt1 to a modified form of the hormone binding domain of the mouse estrogen receptor that binds 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) but is refractory to estrogen. This fusion protein is expressed in an inactive form and becomes activated in the presence of 4-HT as reported in a previous paper (28Rojo A.I. Salinas M. Martín D. Perona R. Cuadrado A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7324-7334Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As a result, myr-Akt1.ER* is rapidly activated in response to 4-HT and elicits effects that have been attributed to endogenous cellular Akt.Electrophysiology in Oocytes—Techniques for mRNA injection and electrophysiological recordings of foreign receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes are described in detail elsewhere (25Solís-Garrido L.M.

Mature female Xenopus laevis frogs obtained from a commercial supplier (Xenopus Express, Haute-Loire, France) were anesthetized with tricaine solution (0.125%) and allowed to recover after surgical removal of small pieces of ovary. Currents were recorded 3–5 days after injection of mRNA (50 ng/oocyte). The oocytes were impaled by two microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl and voltage-clamped at –60 mV using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725-B Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Pulses of GABA or IL-1β, in the absence or presence of different antagonists (IL-1ra, LY294002, SH-5, API-2), were applied using a set of 2-mm diameter glass tubes located close to the oocyte surface. Pulses and data acquisition were controlled using Digi-data 1200 Interface and CLAMPEX software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA).Immunolabeling of Brain Receptors Transplanted to Oocytes—Techniques for immunodetection of foreign proteins expressed in intact mRNA-injected oocytes have been described elsewhere (25Solís-Garrido L.M. Pintado A.J. Andrés-Mateos E. Figueroa M. Matute C. Montiel C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52414-52424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4), extensively washed with 3% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer, and permeabilized and blocked for 1 h with 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The oocytes were then immunostained with the same primary and secondary antibodies against GABAAR or IL-1RI used above for neurons following the same protocol. Injected oocytes treated as above, but not incubated with primary antibodies, were simultaneously used as negative controls. Oocytes were mounted in glycerol/buffer (70:30), under a glass coverslip on a glass dual-well slide. The slide was fastened upside down on the stage of the Leica confocal microscope and visualized with a ×20 lens. All images were captured at the same adjustments of laser intensity and photomultiplier sensitivity using Leica confocal software and were later processed with ADOBE Photoshop 6.0 software, using identical contrast and brightness values, for both control and treated oocytes.Immunoblot in Oocytes—Three days after injecting brain mRNA, oocytes were distributed in groups of 10 oocytes. Each group was exposed to the indicated treatment and processed separately. Oocytes were homogenized by vigorous vortex mixing, followed by several passes through an 18-gauge needle. A group of noninjected oocytes from the same donor was simultaneously homogenized and served as the control. Cell lysates were spun five times, at 13,000 × g for 10 min, to remove the lipid-rich upper phase and the insoluble pellet. Total protein lysates (20 μg per group) were resolved in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted according to Rojo et al. (28Rojo A.I. Salinas M. Martín D. Perona R. Cuadrado A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7324-7334Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Blots were analyzed with the polyclonal antibodies (anti-Akt1, 1:500; or anti-phospho-Akt-S473, 1:500).Experimental Sepsis and Brain Immunocytochemistry—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g), 3 months old, were used. The rats received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of 3 mg/kg body weight. According to our experience and in agreement with Klein et al. (31Klein D. Einspanier R. Bolder U. Jeschke M.G. Shock. 2003; 20: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this dose of LPS induces a severe inflammatory response with good survival. Control rats were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (saline). The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with European Community Council Directives 86/609/EEC and 2003/65/EC guidelines and sacrificed 14–20 h postinjection following deep sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. The rats were perfused through the left ventricle with saline, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB, and a graded series of cold sucrose solutions in PB. The brains were blocked in the coronal stereotaxic plane, cryo-protected by immersion in 30% sucrose until they sank, and frozen sectioned at 40 μm. Adjacent series of sections were collected and processed for GABAAR immunocytochemistry, acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, and cresyl violet staining. GABAAR immunohistochemistry was performed in two series of the control and two series of the septic rats. In order to facilitate comparison of results between the control and septic rats, tissues from both were processed simultaneously using identical solutions and incubation times. Immunocytochemistry was performed following a protocol described previously for dopamine transporter (32Sánchez-González M.A. García-Cabezas M. Rico B. Cavada C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6076-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this study, the primary antibody was the monoclonal anti-GABAAR β-chain antibody, diluted 1:100–1:200. The sections from control and septic brains were analyzed and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, using identical contrast and brightness values. Negative control sections that omitted primary antibody were run in parallel and showed no immunostaining.Chemicals—Unless otherwise indicated, all products not specified were purchased from Sigma. The anti-GABAAR and anti-IL-1RI antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The secondary antibodies Oregon Green 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and AlexaFluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The anti-Akt polyclonal antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences, and the anti-phospho-Akt-S473 was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, Ma). We obtained Neurobasal media from Invitrogen, and paraformaldehyde was from Merck. The human recombinant IL-1β and IL-1ra were purchased from PeproTech (London, UK); LY294002 was from Cayman Chemical. The Akt inhibitors (SH-5, specific inhibitor of the Akt1 isoform; API-2, an inhibitor of the three Akt isoforms) and the PKC inhibitor (Gö6850) were pur"

In this report, we have investigated, using molecular dynamics simulation and mutational studies, the problems as to why only the dimer is active and whether both of the two protomers in the dimer are active. The molecular dynamics simulations show that the monomers are always inactive, that the two protomers in the dimer are asymmetric, and that only one protomer is active at a time. The enzyme activity of the hybrid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3C-like protease of the wild-type protein and the inactive mutant proves that the dimerization is important for enzyme activity and only one active protomer in the dimer is enough for the catalysis. Our simulations also show that the right conformation for catalysis in one protomer can be induced upon dimer formation. These results suggest that the enzyme may follow the association, activation, catalysis, and dissociation mechanism for activity control.

The first two domains form a chymotrypsin fold, and the third domain is an extra helix domain that plays an important role in dimerization and enzyme activity (12Shi J. Wei Z. Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24765-24773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All of the proteins are dimeric in the crystal structures, and there exists an equilibrium between the monomer and dimer in solution. In our previous work, we have observed that the activity increases with the increase of enzyme concentration, indicating the dimer is the active form of the proteinase (13Fan K. Wei P. Feng Q.

Other groups have studied the function of the N-finger in dimerization and enzyme activity.

Contrary to this, Hsu et al. (16Hsu W.-C. Chang H.-C. Chou C.-Y. Tsai F.-J. Lin P.-I. Chang G.-G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, Chou et al. (17Chou C.-Y. Chang H.-C. Hsu W.-C. Lin T.-Z. Lin C.-H. Chang G.-G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14958-14970Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) report that the mutation of R4A, E290A, and R4A/E290A weakens the dimerization. All current experimental evidence agrees that only the dimeric form of proteinase is active. But why the monomer is inactive remains unclear. The other intriguing problem is whether the two protomers in one dimer are both active at the same time, whether only one protomer is active, or whether the two protomers are alternately active at different times. We have used molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid protein experiments to address these problems. Simulations on the dimer and two monomers were done. Our analysis confirms that the monomers are always inactive and that the two protomers in the dimer are asymmetric with probably only one protomer active at one time. We also purposely made a hybrid protein dimer of the wild-type protein and the inactive C145A mutant and measured its enzyme activity. The hybrid protein was shown to be active. This experiment strongly supports that dimerization is essential for enzyme activity and only one active protomer in the dimer is enough for the catalysis. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—The molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GROMACS software package version 3.2.1 (18Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen A.R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7254) Google Scholar, 19Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) with the OPLS/AA force field (20Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10719) Google Scholar). The initial conformations of the dimer (model 1) and monomers (models 2 and 3) all came from the x-ray crystal structure of SARS 3CLpro at pH 8.0 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1uk2; resolution 2.2 Å) (6Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Because the two protomers in the crystal structure were asymmetric (r.m.s.d. of heavy atoms was 1.38 Å), the two protomers were calculated separately (model 2 was from the protomer A of the crystal structure, also named as protomer AM in the following analysis; model 3 was from the protomer B, also named as protomer BM; accordingly, the protomers A and B in model 1 were respectively named protomers AD and BD). These three models were simulated in a TIP4P (21Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30156) Google Scholar) water environment. The model systems were rectangular periodic boxes, and the minimum distance between the protein and box boundary was >0.90 nm. To neutralize the charges and simulate a real physiological environment, some water molecules were replaced by Na+ and Cl– ions. In the final models, model 1 had 20,373 water molecules, 63 Na+ ions, and 57 Cl– ions in a 7.9 × 9.58 × 9.52 nm3 box; model 2 had 10,003 water molecules, 31 Na+ ions, and 28 Cl– ions in a 5.55 × 9.58 × 6.57 nm3 box; and model 3 had 9,858 water molecules, 31 Na+ ions and 28 Cl– ions in a 5.53 × 6.73 × 9.52 nm3 box. All simulations were under a constant pressure and temperature ensemble using the Nose-Hoover method (22Nosé S. Mol. Phys. 1984; 52: 255-268Crossref Scopus (7248) Google Scholar) for temperature control and the Parrinello-Rahman method (23Parrinello M. Rahman A. J. Appl. Phys. 1981; 52: 7182-7190Crossref Scopus (11737) Google Scholar) for pressure control. Van der Waals interactions were computed using a twin range cutoff method, and electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald method (24Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21037) Google Scholar). All bonds with hydrogen atoms were constrained by the LINCS algorithm (25Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11727) Google Scholar). Before simulation, all three systems were minimized with the steepest descent algorithm. During simulations, the time step was set to 1.0 fs, and conformations were saved every 10 ps. Thereafter, four 10-ns simulations were run for each system. Furthermore, to investigate the conformation exchange between the two protomers, we built two pseudodimers. Pseudodimer A was built with two protomers A of the crystal structure, whereas pseudodimer B was built with two protomers B. Subsequently, the four simulations were run for 5 ns for pseudodimer A and 2 ns for pseudodimer B, respectively. All simulations were performed at 310 K in 1 atmosphere, and the total of the simulation time for all trajectories was 148 ns. Calculation of Substrate Binding Energy—The model substrate was built into the trajectories, and the energies were calculated in the CHARMM19 force field (26Neria E. Fischer S. Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 1996; 105: 1902-1921Crossref Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) using the CHARMM software package (27Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13966) Google Scholar). The sequence of the model peptide was TSAVLQ, which was the N-terminal P6-P1 sequence of a reported best peptide substrate (13Fan K. Wei P. Feng Q. Chen S. Huang C. Ma L. Lai B. Pei J. Liu Y. Chen J. Lai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1637-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The initial conformation and the relative geometric position of the enzyme and the substrate were derived from the x-ray crystal structure (PDB code 1uk4; chain G). We then fixed the enzyme conformation and optimized the complex. During the conformation optimization, the distances of the following important atom-atom pairs had been harmonically constrained, namely Cys145 SG-Gln6 C, Glu166 OE1-Gln6 NE2, His163 NE2-Gln6 OE1, Glu166 O-Val4 N, and Glu166 N-Val4 N. Site-directed Mutagenesis of SARS 3CLpro—The C145A mutant of SARS 3CLpro was prepared with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pET 3CLP-21h (28Huang C. Wei P. Fan K. Liu Y. Lai L. Biochemistry,. 2004; 43: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) as a template. The mutation was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The Expression and Purification of SARS 3CLpro—The wild-type and mutational SARS 3CLpro were expressed and purified as described in our previous report (29Wei P. Fan K. Chen H. Ma L. Huang C. Tan L. Xi D. Li C. Liu Y. Cao O. Lai L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The purity was verified by SDS-PAGE to be >95%. The enzyme concentration was calculated from absorbance at 280 nm with 1.04 mg/optical density. Colorimetric Enzyme Assay for the Wild-type and the Hybrid Protein—The enzyme activity was measured by a colorimetric assay as reported previously (28Huang C. Wei P. Fan K. Liu Y. Lai L. Biochemistry,. 2004; 43: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In short, 20 μl of pNA substrate stock solution (2 mm Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA water solution) was added to 180 μl of 25 °C preheated reaction buffer (40 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3), which contained SARS 3CLpro wild-type enzyme and the C145A mutant. The concentration of wild-type enzyme was held at either 0.6 or 0.8 μm, and the concentration of C145A was changed from 2.5 to 500 μm. Colorimetric measurements of enzymatic activity were performed in 96-well microtiter plates using a multiwell ultraviolet spectrometer (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices) at 390 nm. Each assay was repeated twice. We also determined the wild-type proteinase activity at nine concentrations from 0.1 to 3 μm alone or with a high concentration of C145A mutant protein. Dynamics of the Dimer and Monomers—To find out the differences between the dimer and the monomer, molecular dynamics simulations were performed. For all trajectories, r.m.s.d. values of all heavy atoms were calculated. After 2 ns, all of the three systems were approximately in equilibrium (supplemental Fig. S1). In the following analysis, only the last 8 ns in each trajectory were checked for all of the 12 trajectories. The Conformation of Catalytic Dyad—We have shown that SARS 3CLpro underwent a general serine protease catalysis mechanism, and His41 and Cys145 comprised the catalytic dyad (28Huang C. Wei P. Fan K. Liu Y. Lai L. Biochemistry,. 2004; 43: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The number of occurrences of the right conformation for the dyad was counted in all trajectories. Here the right conformation meant that the SG atoms in Cys145 and the ND1/NE2 atom in His41 forms a hydrogen bond as recognized by HBPLUS (30McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). The results were summarized in Table 1. The dyad have chances to be in the right catalytic conformation in protomer AD, protomer BD and protomer BM, whereas no suitable conformation for catalysis was found in all four trajectories of protomer AM.TABLE 1Number of hydrogen bonds between Cys-145 SG and His-41 ND1/NE21aThe numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the four trajectories for each system.2aThe numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the four trajectories for each system.3aThe numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the four trajectories for each system.4aThe numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the four trajectories for each system.TotalProtomer AD428150303746Protomer BD4417620313436Protomer AM30003Protomer BM334334343561,157a The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the four trajectories for each system.

Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and of SARS 3CLpro (6Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S.

Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), we summarize the following key structure elements for catalysis as follows: 1) the oxyanion hole, 2) Y-X-H motif, 3) the hydrophobic packing of His163 and Phe140, and 4) conformations around Glu166. All of these features were checked in the simulations. For the crystal structure, protomer A passed all four tests, and protomer B failed in tests 1 and 4 (6Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Oxyanion Hole—The distances between the main chain oxygen atom of the Gln residue at the P1 position of the substrate and the main chain amides of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 were calculated. The coordinates of the substrate came from the modeling result in the later section. When all three distances were <4.5 Å, we defined it as a good oxyanion hole. The results were listed in supplemental Table SI. Protomers A and B behaved quite differently. Both in the dimer and in stand-alone monomer, protomer B was always bad and protomer A was always good. Tyr-Xaa-His Motif—The hydrogen bond of Tyr161 OH and His163 ND1 is listed in supplemental Table SII. The results indicated that the Y-X-H motif was much more stable in protomer A than in protomer B, both in the dimer and in the monomer. Hydrophobic Packing between His163 and Phe140—The centroid distance and the cosine of the dihedral angle between the imidazole ring of His163 and the phenyl ring of Phe140 were monitored. Here the angle was the dihedral angle between the plane that was defined by atoms CG, ND1, and NE2 in the imidazole ring of His163 and the plane that was defined by atoms CG, CE1, and CE2 in the phenyl ring of Phe140. The results were shown in supplemental Fig. S2, A and B. The hydrophobic packing between His163 and Phe140 in protomer A was much better than that in protomer B. Conformation around Glu166—The hydrogen bond of Glu166 OE1/OE2 was also monitored and listed in supplemental Table SII. In the monomers, it can form a hydrogen bond with His163 (in protomer AM) or Asn142 (in protomer BM) from the same protomer. Both interactions block the binding of substrate. Furthermore, we also monitored the hydrogen bond of the atoms around the active sites and the binding pocket along the trajectories. These atoms include Cys145 SG, His41 NE2/ND1, Gly143 O, Tyr126 OH, Asp187 OD1/OD2, and Arg4 O/N. The results were also listed in supplemental Table SII. We noticed that the hydrogen bonds of Gly143 O–Asn28 ND2 and Ser139 N–Tyr126 OH were very stable in protomer A but disappeared or were less stable in protomer B. We also noticed that, at the dimeric interface, Ser139 OG of protomer A can form a stable hydrogen bond with the main chain of Arg4 in protomer B, whereas Ser139 OG of protomer B cannot. Binding of Substrate to the Dimer and Monomers—We built the model substrate into the trajectories and calculated the binding energies. The results were summarized in Table 2. The median of the van der Waals interaction energy in the P1 pocket for the two protomers in the dimer and the two monomers were –5.04, –0.42, –1.82, and 4.17 kcal/mol, respectively. It is clear that protomer AD has much stronger binding ability than all of the others.TABLE 2Substrate binding to the dimer and the monomerVdwaThe van der Waals energy between the substrate and the enzyme.ElecbThe electrostatic energy between the substrate and the enzyme.InnercThe internal energy of the substrate.kcal/molThe full substrate DIMERProtomer AD-15.57-890.00132.64Protomer BD-4.34-860.44162.96 MONOProtomer AD-6.60-850.55134.96Protomer BD-4.45-828.80128.93P1 position of substrate DIMERProtomer AD-5.04-253.8539.87Protomer BD-0.42-217.2152.28 MONOProtomer AD-1.82-219.8340.20Protomer BD4.17-208.5841.82a The van der Waals energy between the substrate and the enzyme.b The electrostatic energy between the substrate and the enzyme.c The internal energy of the substrate. Open table in a new tab Conformation Transition between Protomers A and B—To see whether protomers A and B in the dimer can exchange conformation, two additional simulations were done. Thereafter, the r.m.s.d. values of the binding pocket between the trajectories and the protomer A of the crystal structure were calculated and summarized in Table 3. Here the binding pocket was defined by residues 41, 140, 142–145, 161, 163, 166, and 172. In pseudodimer A, we noticed that only one protomer could stay in the original conformation. For example, in trajectory 1, the average r.m.s.d. values of two protomers were 1.41 and 2.06 Å (Fig. 1A). In pseudodimer B, we observed a clear transition; in trajectory 3, the average r.m.s.d. value of one protomer was lowered to 1.47 from 1.95 Å (Fig. 1B). This means that proper conformation for catalysis can be induced by dimer formation.TABLE 3Average r.m.s.d. value (Å) of the binding pocket between trajectories and protomer A of the crystal structure1234Protomer AD1.461.431.901.61Protomer BD2.482.382.402.43Protomer AD in the pseudo dimer A1.411.851.701.93Protomer BD in the pseudo dimer A2.061.481.501.55Protomer AD in the pseudo dimer B2.822.152.042.26Protomer BD in the pseudo dimer B2.142.061.472.18 Open table in a new tab Enzymatic Activity of the Wild-type and the Hybrid SARS 3CLpro—In the previous study, we have reported that the active site mutation C145A gave an inactive enzyme (28Huang C. Wei P. Fan K. Liu Y. Lai L. Biochemistry,. 2004; 43: 4568-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The mutant did not show any visible enzyme activity at concentrations as high as 100 μm. However, when it was added into the low concentration solution of the wild-type enzyme (protein was partly in monomeric form), the resulting hybrid enzyme exhibited increased activity (Fig. 2A). Along with the concentration increase of C145A, the apparent activity of the hybrid protein reached a maximum value. As a control, no visible change in activity was observed when different concentrations of bovine serum albumin were added (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we tried to analyze the activity quantitatively. For the wild-type proteinase alone, there is an equilibrium between the monomer and dimer, and the enzyme activity comes from the dimer. Therefore, we used the following equations. Kd=[M][M]/[D]Eq. 1 [M]+2[D]=CTEq. 2 Here [M], [D], and CT were the enzyme concentrations of the monomer, the dimer, and the total concentration calculated as the monomer, and Kd was the apparent dissociation constant of the dimer. Fitting the data at different CT values using Equation 3 by Origin version 6.0 (OriginLab), the kcat was calculated to be ∼3.34 min–1, and the Kd was ∼0.81 μm (Fig. 2B). Vmax=kcat[D]=kcat=Kd+4CT−Kd2+8KdCT8Eq. 3 For the hybrid proteinase, because C145A was in excess, all of the wild-type protomers could form the hybrid dimer. As Fig. 2B shows, a perfect linear relationship was detected between the enzyme activity and the concentration of the hybrid dimer (with a correlation coefficient of 0.9995, going through the origin). After data fitting, the kcat of the hybrid dimer was calculated to be ∼ 1.58 min–1. Difference between the Dimer and Monomers in Simulations—To reveal the differences between the dimer and the monomers, the total of the molecular dynamics simulations for the dimer and monomers run under physiological conditions was 148 ns. Thereafter, key structure features necessary for catalysis were checked. Similar to the previous analysis based on the crystal structure (6Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), protomer BD was also found to be unsuited for catalysis in our simulations. Moreover, we found that some structure features required by catalysis were destroyed in protomer AM, such as 1) no suitable conformation for catalytic dyad and 2) Glu166 forming a hydrogen bond with His163 and blocking the substrate binding. By the conformation analysis of the trajectories, two binding-related hydrogen bonds, which behaved very differently between protomers A and B, were found. Furthermore, the binding energy of the model substrate with the enzyme also shows that protomer AD has much stronger binding ability than protomer BD and the two stand-alone monomers. Dimerization and Enzyme Activity—After the above analysis, we now have an overview about the dimerization and enzyme activity. In the dimer, only protomer A is active and protomer B can help protomer A maintain the correct catalytic conformation. However, exactly how protomer B makes protomer A stable in the correct conformation for catalysis is still unclear. Anand et al. (3Anand K. Palm G.J. Mesters J.R. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) ascribed it to the hydrogen bond of Glu166 OE1/OE2 and Ser1 N in the other protomer, and recently Tan et al. (10Tan J. Verschueren K.H.G. Anand Shen. J.K. Yang M. Xu Y. Rao Z. Bigalke J. Heisen B. Mesters J.R. Chen K. Shen X. Jiang H. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) ascribed it to the hydrogen bond between the N terminus of the other protomer and the main chain of Phe140. However, the mutation experiment showed that the N-3 truncated protease was also active and remained dimeric (16Hsu W.-C. Chang H.-C. Chou C.-Y. Tsai F.-J. Lin P.-I. Chang G.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22741-22748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our simulations, we noticed that, in the dimeric interface, hydrogen bond S139A OG–A4B O/N was stable, whereas S139B OG–A4A O/N did not exist. The mutation experiment also showed that the N-4 truncated protease was inactive (16Hsu W.-C. Chang H.-C. Chou C.-Y. Tsai F.-J. Lin P.-I. Chang G.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22741-22748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, this interaction was probably also very important. Furthermore, the stabilization may only depend on the dynamic behavior of the whole structure. Moreover, we measured the enzyme activity of the hybrid SARS 3CLpro. The experiments showed that the enzyme activity increased dramatically by adding the inactive mutant C145A. This proved two things. 1) C145A could form the hybrid dimer with the wild-type enzyme; otherwise the enzyme activity could not have been changed. 2) The hybrid dimer also had enzyme activity; otherwise along with the formation of the hybrid dimer, the enzyme activity would be decreased. Combining with our analysis from molecular dynamics simulations, we proposed that, in the hybrid dimer, the C145A monomer can perform the function of protomer BD and help the wild-type enzyme protomer stay in the correct conformation. In conclusion, only one active protomer is required for the activity of the SARS 3CLpro dimer. Furthermore, by the quantitative analysis under the enzyme assay condition, the apparent Kd was ∼0.81 μm, which is much less than the Kd reported before for the pure enzyme (∼14 μm) (29Wei P. Fan K. Chen H. Ma L. Huang C. Tan L. Xi D. Li C. Liu Y. Cao O. Lai L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It means that the substrate can stabilize the dimer, or in other words, the dimer has much stronger ability to bind the substrate than the monomer. The kcat of the wild-type dimer and the hybrid dimer could also been deduced. It is interesting that the hybrid dimer has about one-half of the wild-type dimer activity. However, this phenomenon does not conflict with our previous conclusion. We concluded that only one protomer in the dimer was active at one time. For the pure wild-type enzyme dimer, there is always one protomer that stays in the active conformation. While in the hybrid dimer, the wild-type protomer may stay either in the active form or in the inactive form. Thus the hybrid dimer has only about one-half of the wild-type protein activity. Conformation Transition between Protomers A and B—In the previous analysis, we found the two protomers in one dimer were asymmetric and only one protomer was active. Because the stand-alone monomer cannot maintain the active conformation, this asymmetry was because of dimerization. There are three possible mechanisms. 1) The two protomers in the dimer can exchange conformation. 2) During the association process of the two protomers, one becomes active and the other remains inactive. 3) A mixed mechanism of both items 1) and 2). In the simulations at normal body temperature, the conformational transition cannot be observed in our time scale. When we placed the two protomers both in the inactive conformation (only after 2 ns), one conformational transition was observed in four simulations. This implies that mechanism 2 was the most possible one. We have used molecular dynamics simulations and enzyme activity measurement of the hybrid protein to study why only the dimer of SARS 3CLpro is active. Analysis of the simulation trajectories showed that stand-alone monomers cannot play the enzymatic role correctly, and only one protomer in the dimer is in the right state for catalysis. The experiments on the hybrid SARS 3CLpro between the wild-type enzyme and the inactive mutant C145A revealed an increased enzyme activity. This supports that dimerization is important for the enzyme activity, and in the dimer, only one active protomer is enough for the catalysis. Furthermore, we studied the mechanism for activity control in the dimer. Our simulations show that the most probable mechanism is the right conformation, as catalysis can be induced upon dimer formation. As the dimer is relatively weak, the enzyme may follow the association, activation, catalysis, dissociation mechanism for activity control, and no conformational exchange is necessary within one dimer. Much more needs to be studied about why dimerization can induce and maintain the right conformation for catalysis. Our simulations and experiments confirm that dimerization was the essential requirement for enzyme activity and only one monomer is active in the dimer."

We recently demonstrated that the LS174T colon carcinoma cell line expresses the CD44 glycoform known as hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand (HCELL), which functions as a high affinity E- and L-selectin ligand on these cells. To define the contribution of HCELL to selectin-mediated adhesion on intact tumor cells, we measured the binding of LS174T cells transduced with CD44 short interfering RNA (siRNA) or with vector alone to 6-h interleukin-1β-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) under physiological flow conditions. LS174T cell attachment to HUVEC was entirely E-selectin-dependent, and PBMC tethering to tumor cell monolayers was completely L-selectin-dependent. At physiological shear stress, CD44 siRNA transduction led to an ∼50% decrease in the number of LS174T cells binding to stimulated HUVEC relative to vector alone-transduced cells. CD44 siRNA-transduced cells also rolled significantly faster than vector-transduced cells on HUVEC, indicating prominent HCELL participation in stabilizing tumor cell-endothelial adhesive interactions against fluid shear. Furthermore, HCELL was identified as the principal L-selectin ligand on LS174T cells, as PBMC binding to CD44 siRNA-transduced tumor cells was reduced ∼80% relative to vector-transduced cells. These data indicate that expression of HCELL confers robust and predominant tumor cell binding to E- and L-selectin, highlighting a central role for HCELL in promoting shear-resistant adhesive interactions essential for hematogenous cancer dissemination.

However, when disseminated from primary sites (metastatic), survival drops precipitously to 8%. These dramatic survival statistics underscore the need to define the pathobiology of the metastatic process to devise novel interventions to prevent or inhibit colon cancer spread. Hematogenous metastasis occurs as a highly regulated cascade of events, initiated by the escape of tumor cells from the primary site into the blood stream and culminating in the formation of secondary colonies in distant organs. This process critically involves the binding of circulating colon cancer cells to the endothelium of target tissue(s) under fluid shear conditions, as well as the dynamic formation of leukocyte/cancer cell emboli, each of which are directed by selectin-selectin ligand interactions.The selectin family of adhesion molecules, E-, P-, and L-selectin, are Ca2+-dependent lectins that bind sialofucosylated carbohydrate structures, the prototypes of which are sialyl Lewis X (sLex) and sialyl Lewis A (sLea) (1Foxall C.

E- and P-selectin are typically inducible endothelial molecules (P-selectin is also expressed on activated platelets), and L-selectin expression is restricted to leukocytes (3Sackstein R. Curr. Opin.

Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2193-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), presumably mediated by the physical association of leukocytes with tumor cells resulting in leukocyte-colon cancer cell emboli (15Jadhav S.

Although expression of E-selectin ligand(s) on tumor cells itself promotes metastasis, one model holds that selectins work cooperatively to promote the spread of cancer; leukocyte L-selectin engagement of relevant tumor ligand(s) mediates the formation of leukocyte-tumor aggregates, which possess heightened binding capacity to endothelium in an E-selectin-dependent manner (16Borsig L. News Physiol. Sci. 2004; 19: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar).Colon carcinoma cells express selectin ligands, and there is abundant evidence that selectin-dependent adhesive events are central to the metastatic process (4Bresalier R.S.

However, these selectin ligands have yet to be fully characterized or identified other than by general classifications (e.g. mucins). We recently identified the sialofucosylated hematopoietic cell E- and L-selectin ligand (HCELL) glycoform of CD44 on the LS174T colon carcinoma cell line and demonstrated its function as a high affinity E- and L-selectin ligand using the blot rolling assay (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M. Schnaar R.L. Sackstein R. Konstantopoulos K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not specifically address the relative contribution(s) of HCELL to the observed potent E- and L-selectin ligand activity of intact LS174T cells. In the present study, using short interfering RNA (siRNA) to specifically inhibit CD44 (i.e. HCELL) expression in LS174T cells, we directly assessed how HCELL expression mediates binding to E- and L-selectin under physiologic flow conditions. We observed that CD44 siRNA treatment resulted in an ∼50% decrease in E-selectin ligand activity accompanied by a significant increase in rolling velocity (loss in binding strength) and a nearly complete (>80%) loss in L-selectin ligand activity over a physiologically relevant shear stress range. These findings provide compelling evidence that HCELL is the predominant E- and L-selectin glycoprotein ligand expressed on LS174T colon carcinoma cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies to inhibit HCELL expression/function on cancer cells bearing this CD44 glycoform may be beneficial in the prevention of metastasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Antibodies, and Reagents—LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in the recommended medium (minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% sodium-pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). HUVEC were obtained from the tissue culture core facility at the Pathology Department of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and were maintained in M199 supplemented with 15% FBS, 5 units/ml heparin, 50 μg/ml endothelial growth factor, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For adhesion assays, the HUVEC were cultured at the center of 100-mm tissue culture dishes coated with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Sigma). All experiments were performed with confluent HUVEC monolayers. To stimulate expression of vascular adhesion molecules, HUVEC were treated with 1 ng/ml of recombinant human IL-1β (endotoxin < 0.1 ng/μg IL-1β; Research Diagnostics, Inc., Concord, MA) for 6 h prior to use in the adhesion studies. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with full-length E-selectin (CHO-E) or mock-transfected CHO (CHO-mock) cells, provided by Dr. Robert Fuhlbrigge (BWH, Boston, MA), were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% sodium-pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from whole blood as described previously (19Oxley S.M. Sackstein R. Blood. 1994; 84: 3299-3306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 2C5 and A3D8 were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and Sigma, respectively, whereas Hermes-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Brenda Sandmaier (Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Anti-human CD29 (mAb 13), function-blocking anti-human E-selectin (68–5H11), and isotype control mAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Blocking anti-human L-selectin mAb (LAM1-116) was kindly donated by Dr. Thomas F. Tedder (Duke University, Durham, NC). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL).Lentiviral CD44 siRNA Construct Design—The pLKO.1 puro vector was sequentially digested with AgeI and EcoRI and ligated with a 59-mer oligonucleotide containing (i) a 21-nucleotide sense strand and a 21-nucleotide antisense strand separated by a six-nucleotide loop (CTCGAG), (ii) a 5′ end containing an AgeI restriction site (ACCGGT) and a 3′ end containing an EcoRI site (GAATTC), and (iii) a stretch of five adenines (TTTTT) as a template for the Pol III promoter termination signal (20Stewart S.A. Dykxhoorn D.M. Palliser D. Mizuno H. Yu E.Y. An D.S. Sabatini D.M. Chen I.S. Hahn W.C. Sharp P.A. Weinberg R.A. Novina C.D. RNA (N.Y.). 2003; 9: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used (sense and antisense strands in bold, loop in underlined letters, restriction enzyme sites in italics, and the Pol III termination signal in lowercase letters): CD44–3S (5′-ACCGGTATGCAATGTGCTACTGATTGTCTCGAGACAATCAGTAGCACATTGCATtttttG-3′) and CD44–3AS (5′-GAATTCaaaaaATGCAATGTGCTACTGATTGTCTCGAGACAATCAGTA GCACATTGCATA-3′).Lentiviral Production, Transduction, and Analysis of CD44 siRNA—The recombinant lentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with a mixture of pLKO.1-CD44 siRNA (or pLKO.1 puro), pCMV-VSVG, and pHR′CMV8.2ΔR at a ratio of 10:1:9 using FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science). Infectious lentiviruses were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, and a final concentration of 10 mm HEPES was added to the viral supernatant. The harvested viral supernatant was filtered through a syringe-driven 0.45-μm pore membrane filter (Millipore).Transductions of LS174T cells with recombinant lentiviruses were conducted in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene for 6 h. Following lentiviral infection, the cells were selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. CD44 expression in untreated, vector alone-transduced, and CD44 siRNA-transduced cells was routinely verified by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis and was found to be unchanged within each of the cell treatment groups through serial cell passages.Flow Cytometry—Surface molecule expression on LS174T cells was assessed using indirect single-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Cell suspensions (107 cells/ml) were incubated with primary mAb anti-CD44 (2C5 or A3D8), anti-CD29, or the appropriately matched isotype control antibodies for 30 min on ice, washed twice, and incubated with relevant fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were washed twice, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed using the Cytomics FC 500 MPL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL)SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—LS174T cell lysates were prepared by incubation with 2% Nonidet P-40. The cell lysates were diluted with Laemmli reducing sample buffer and separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Resolved membrane proteins were transferred to Sequi-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 100% FBS for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoblots were stained with anti-CD44 mAb (2C5) and then washed with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20. Duplicate immunoblots were stained in parallel with relevant isotype control primary antibodies to assess nonspecific binding to protein bands. Subsequently, blots were incubated with appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Western Blue alkaline phosphatase substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the developing reagent.Hyaluronic Acid Binding Assay—To assess the effect of siRNA transduction on CD44 function, binding to hyaluronic acid (HA) was measured. Adhesion of LS174T cells to immobilized hyaluronic acid (from rooster comb; Sigma) was performed in multiwell plates as described previously (21Milinkovic M. Antin J.H. Hergrueter C.A. Underhill C.B. Sackstein R. Blood. 2004; 103: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, tumor cells (106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm sodiumpyruvate) were centrifuged to contact the HA-coated substrate (previously incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin/RPMI 1640 medium to block nonspecific interactions), and binding was performed under shear conditions on a rocker platform (5 cycles/min). Nonadherent cells were removed by vigorous washing with assay medium. Bound cells were quantified by light microscopy. Controls consisted of pretreatment of input LS174T cells with Hermes-1 mAb (10 μg/ml), treatment of HA-coated wells with Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (20 units/ml, Sigma), and omission of HA in the wells.Parallel Plate Flow Chamber Adhesion Assays—Dynamic flow adhesion assays were performed using a parallel plate flow chamber (250 μm channel depth × 5.0 mm channel width) and visualized in real time using videomicroscopy. For LS174T cell interactions with HUVEC, attachment assays were performed by perfusing cells (106/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2 (H/H/Ca2+), and 5% FBS) at the appropriate flow rates to obtain wall shear stresses of 1.0–2.0 dynes/cm2, thereby mimicking the fluid mechanical environment of the post-capillary venules (22Jones D.A. Smith C.W. McIntire L.V. Biomaterials. 1996; 17: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The total number of interacting cells in a single 4× field of view (fixed in the middle of the flow channel, 1.4 mm2) during the 5-min perfusion period was evaluated. Interacting cells were defined as those that bound to HUVEC (both cells initially tethering in the field of view and cells that rolled into the field of view after tethering upstream) and then remained in contact with the monolayer for at least 2 s. To assess binding strength between molecules mediating adhesion between cells in flow and monolayer cells, wall shear stress was increased stepwise every 30 s after the initial attachment period. Average rolling velocity, a quantitative measure of binding strength, was computed as the displacement by the centroid of the cell divided by the time interval of observation, 5 s (13Burdick M.M. McCaffery J.M. Kim Y.S. Bochner B.S. Konstantopoulos K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C977-C987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).To analyze L-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions between PBMC and LS174T cells under flow conditions, 5 × 106 LS174T cells were centrifuged per well of a 6-well plate (Costar) and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde as previously described (23Dimitroff C.J.

Reactive aldehyde groups were blocked with 0.2 m lysine before final equilibration of wells with H/H/Ca2+. PBMC in 5% FBS/H/H/Ca2+ were perfused at 2 × 106/ml at shear stresses from 0.2 to 2.0 dynes/cm2, and the number of PBMC interacting with LS174T monolayers in four independent fields of view after a 2-min attachment period was evaluated.For some experiments, perfused cells (107/ml) were pretreated for 30 min on ice with function-blocking mAbs (10 μg/ml) prior to use in adhesion assays. For other experiments, HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with function-blocking anti-E-selectin mAb (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The addition of 5 mm EDTA in the flow medium was used to assess the role of divalent cations in cell binding.Blot Rolling Assay—The blot rolling assay has been previously described and utilized to detect the selectin binding activity of cell lysates resolved by SDS-PAGE (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Western blots of LS174T lysates representing 3 × 106 cells were stained with anti-CD44 mAb (2C5) and rendered translucent by immersion in H/H/Ca2+ with 10% glycerol. CHO-E cells were resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in H/H/Ca2+ and 10% glycerol. The blots were placed within a parallel plate flow chamber, and CHO-E cells were perfused at a physiologically relevant shear stress of 1.0 dyne/cm2. An adjustment in the volumetric flow rate was made to account for the increase in viscosity because of the presence of 10% glycerol in the flow medium (17Hanley W.D. Burdick M.M. Konstantopoulos K. Sackstein R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5645-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Molecular weight markers were used as guides to aid the placement of the flow chamber over stained bands of interest. The number of interacting cells/mm2 was tabulated as a function of the molecular weight region and compiled into an adhesion histogram. Nonspecific adhesion was assessed by perfusing CHO-E cell suspensions containing function-blocking anti-E-selectin mAb, using 5 mm EDTA in the flow medium or by perfusing mock transfectants (CHO-mock).RESULTSTransduction of LS174T Cells with CD44 siRNA Leads to Specific Reduction of CD44 Expression and Abrogation of Adhesion to Hyaluronic Acid—The HCELL glycoform of CD44 mediates adhesive interactions with three structures: E-selectin, L-selectin, and HA. More generally, CD44 is recognized for its role as an HA ligand. Accordingly, we measured binding to HA in combination with flow cytometry as indicators of the level of CD44 expression following targeted silencing using siRNA. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, and Table 1, CD44 siRNA transduction of LS174T cells led to a significant reduction (∼90% decrease in mean fluorescence intensity) in surface expression of CD44 relative to vector alone-transduced cells or untreated cells, as detected by flow cytometry using anti-CD44 mAb 2C5. Similar results were obtained with another anti-CD44 mAb, A3D8 (data not shown). CD44 siRNA treatment was specific, as expression of another cell surface molecule CD29, which mediates adhesion to extracellular matrix elements and not E-selectin, was unchanged after all manipulations (Fig. 1, D–F, and Table 1). Moreover, LS174T cell CD44 silencing did not preferentially target sCD44 or vCD44 isoforms but instead resulted in overall loss of CD44 expression, as shown in a representative Western blot of SDS-PAGE-resolved cell lysates stained with anti-CD44 mAb (Fig. 1G). For both untreated and vector-transduced cell lysates, an intense band developed at ∼150 kDa, indicating the presence of vCD44 isoforms, whereas a lighter band at ∼100 kDa confirmed the presence of a lesser amount of sCD44. No staining was observed on CD44 siRNA-transduced cell lysate, confirming the silencing of all forms of CD44 by siRNA. The growth rate of LS174T cells under normal culture conditions was not affected by siRNA or vector transduction (data not shown) in agreement with a prior study using antisense to target CD44 expression (26Harada N. Mizoi T. Kinouchi M. Hoshi K. Ishii S. Shiiba K. Sasaki I. Matsuno S. Int. J.

Open table in a new tab In the HA binding assay, untreated LS174T cells bound successfully to substrate (Fig. 2A). Binding was HA-specific, because cells failed to adhere to hyaluronidase-digested HA (data not shown) or non-HA-coated substrate (data not shown). All LS174T cell adhesion to HA was inhibited in the presence of function-blocking anti-CD44 mAb Hermes-1 (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these findings, vector-transduced cells bound to HA in the same manner as did untreated control cells (Fig. 2C), whereas CD44 siRNA-transduced cells were incapable of adherence to HA (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these data indicate that loss of CD44 expression on LS174T cells by siRNA silencing results in a decrease in functional activity (HA binding).FIGURE 2Micrographs of LS174T-HA binding assay. Untreated (A) or vector-transduced LS174T (C) cells adhered to HA, but adhesion was abrogated in the presence of function-blocking anti-CD44 mAb (B) (Hermes-1, with untreated cells) or with transduction with CD44 siRNA (D).

In agreement with a prior investigation (13Burdick M.M. McCaffery J.M. Kim Y.S. Bochner B.S. Konstantopoulos K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C977-C987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), LS174T binding to HUVEC was shear stress-dependent (Fig. 3A), with essentially no initial cell attachment occurring outside typical post-capillary venular shear stress levels (>2 dynes/cm2). Cell binding was entirely E-selectin-dependent, as treatment of the HUVEC monolayer with anti-E-selectin function-blocking mAb abrogated tumor cell attachment (n = 3), and unstimulated HUVEC (not expressing E-selectin) failed to support tumor cell binding. LS174T cells also failed to attach to HUVEC in the presence of the divalent cation-chelating agent EDTA, consistent with the requirement for Ca2+ in selectin-dependent adhesion. Interestingly, the LS174T cell tethering to E-selectin on HUVEC was mediated by CD44, or more specifically HCELL, in a shear stress-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Relative to untreated and vector control cells, CD44 siRNA-transduced LS174T cells attached to HUVEC at similar levels as to untreated and vector alone-transduced cells at low shear (1.0 dyne/cm2) but bound significantly less (∼50% reduction) at physiologic shear stress levels (>1.0 dyne/cm2, Fig. 3B). Furthermore, HCELL is specialized to participate in E-selectin-dependent rolling interactions; siRNA-transduced LS174T cells rolled significantly faster than vector-transduced or untreated cells on stimulated HUVEC when first allowed to attach at shear stress <2.0 dynes/cm2 and then subjected to shear stresses of 2–4 dynes/cm2 (Table 2). This shift in rolling velocity indicates a dramatic reduction in the capacity of cells to engage E-selectin under physiologic shear stress levels.FIGURE 3LS174T cells transduced with CD44 siRNA bind less efficiently to stimula"

In this study, AspIII:08 (Asp113), the anchor point for monoamine binding in TM-III, was used as the starting point to engineer activating metal ion sites between the extracellular segments of theβ2-adrenergic receptor. Cu(II) and Zn(II) alone and in complex with aromatic chelators acted as potent (EC50 decreased to 0.5 μm) and efficacious agonists in sites constructed between positions III:08 (Asp or His), VI:16 (preferentially Cys), and/or VII:06 (preferentially Cys). In molecular models built over the backbone conformation of the inactive rhodopsin structure, the heavy atoms that coordinate the metal ion were located too far away from each other to form high affinity metal ion sites in both the bidentate and potential tridentate settings. This indicates that the residues involved in the main ligand-binding pocket will have to move closer to each other during receptor activation. On the basis of the distance constraints from these activating metal ion sites, we propose a global toggle switch mechanism for 7TM receptor activation in which inward movement of the extracellular segments of especially TM-VI and, to some extent, TM-VII is coupled to the well established outward movement of the intracellular segments of these helices. We suggest that the pivots for these vertical seesaw movements are the highly conserved proline bends of the involved helices.

Seven-transmembrane (7TM) 2The abbreviations used are: 7TM, seven-transmembrane; TMs, transmembrane helices; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. receptors, which couple through G proteins but also through a number of G protein-independent signaling pathways such as arrestin-mediated kinase activation, constitute the largest family of proteins in the human genome (1Bockaert J.

These receptors are activated by basically all kinds of chemical messengers in the body, and they act as chemosensors for a multitude of external chemical signals. 7TM receptors are also the target for the majority of drugs, which, however, address only a small fraction of the receptor repertoire (4Russ A.P. Lampel S. Drug Discovery Today. 2005; 10: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because they are involved as regulators of key physiological functions throughout the body, 7TM receptors are one of the major focus areas of the pharmaceutical industry (4Russ A.P. Lampel S. Drug Discovery Today. 2005; 10: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Klabunde T. Hessler G. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 928-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). 7TM receptors are activated by agonists that span a chemical diversity range from large glycoprotein hormones over neuropeptides, lipid messengers, and nucleotides to small monoamines, amino acids, and even metal ions such as calcium (1Bockaert J.

Notably, although there apparently is no common “lock” for all these chemically highly diverse “keys” (6Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is nevertheless expected that there is a common molecular activation mechanism for 7TM receptors as such. The conformational changes that accompany receptor activation have been characterized in rather great detail for the intracellular segments of the seven-helix bundle (7Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K.

This has been achieved through a number of different biochemical and biophysical approaches, including systematic EPR spectroscopic analysis of all intracellular segments of the transmembrane helices (TMs) as well as the intracellular loops and tail of rhodopsin by site-directed spin labeling (8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 10Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L.

In brief, these studies show that, during receptor activation, the TMs (especially TM-VI) move apart and thereby disclose receptor epitopes, which are believed to be recognized by the intracellular signaling molecules, G proteins, arrestin, etc. (14Hubbell W.L.

However, our knowledge about the structural changes that occur in the extracellular parts of 7TM receptors during activation is very limited, as systematic site-directed EPR analysis has not yet been performed in this area. Moreover, although several x-ray structures of rhodopsin are available, all of these represent only the inactive state of the protein molecule (17Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar, 18Li J. Edwards P.C. Burghammer M.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To try to understand the activation mechanism for 7TM receptors, in this study, we have taken an alternative, biochemical approach by making the smallest and best understood ligand (a metal ion) act as an agonist. Because the coordination of metal ions in proteins is understood in great detail from a large number of especially x-ray structures, it is expected that reliable distance constraints concerning residues (and thereby the TMs) can be obtained from activating metal ion sites systematically built into the main ligand-binding pocket in the extracellular part of the receptors. Previously, we constructed an activating metal ion site between TM-III and TM-VII in the β2-adrenergic receptor and transferred this site to the NK1 substance P receptor (21Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, because a high resolution structure of a 7TM receptor was not available at that time, it was not possible to use this distance constraint to propose specific models for receptor activation. Nevertheless, we suggested that the reason why only ∼25% signaling efficacy was achieved in the III:08/VII:06 site was due to lack of proper interactions with the important TM-VI (22Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, on the basis of the III:08/VII:06 site, in this study, we have made a number of constructs with metal-binding residues in these two positions as well as in different positions in TM-VI (see Fig. 1). Molecular modeling based on the distance constraints imposed by the activating metal ion sites combined with the knowledge from the x-ray structure of the inactive form of rhodopsin indicate that the extracellular parts of the helices will have to move toward each other during 7TM receptor activation to coordinate the activating metal ion. In view of the fact that there is ample evidence indicating that the intracellular parts of these helices move in the opposite direction (i.e. away from each other) during receptor activation, we consequently propose a “global toggle switch model” for the activation of 7TM receptors in which these helical movements are conjoined in vertical seesaw movements involving especially TM-VI. Pindolol, 1,10-phenanthroline, and 2,2′-bipyridine were obtained from Sigma. The point mutations were constructed using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and recombinant PCR (21Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding wildtype and mutant receptors were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTEJ-8; all mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing. Cloned receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells transfected 2 days before analysis. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. COS-7 cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes 1 day after transfection at a density of 400,000 cells/well and supplemented with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (Amersham Biosciences). Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline (25 mm HEPES, 0.75 mm NaH2PO4, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and incubated in HEPES-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Pindolol, free metal ion, or metal ion complex was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The assay was terminated by aspirating the buffer, followed by addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1 mm unlabeled cAMP and ATP. cAMP was isolated by applying the supernatant to AG 50W-X4 resin (Bio-Rad), followed by alumina resin (catalog no. A9003, Sigma). Determinations were made in duplicate. Because COS-7 cells express endogenous catecholamine receptors, which are stimulated by isoproterenol, giving a cAMP accumulation of up to 96 fmol/105 cells, but not by pindolol, this compound was used as agonist for the β2-adrenergic constructs in this study. The cAMP curves were analyzed, and EC50 values were determined by computerized nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism. Analysis of Metal Ion Site Distances—The homology modeling of the β2-adrenergic receptor utilized the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1F88; solved to 2.8-Å resolution) as a structural template (17Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8177) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the β2-adrenergic receptor and bovine rhodopsin was performed on the basis of conserved fingerprint residues and motifs in the seven TMs (24Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Two models of mutant forms of the β2-adrenergic receptor were produced: 1) the CysVI:16/CysVII:06 double mutant with the wild-type AspIII:08 metal ion-binding residue in TM-III constituting part of the proposed tridentate metal ion-binding site and 2) the HisIII:08/CysVI:16/CysVII:06 triple mutant. The software MODELLER was configured to produce 25 three-dimensional comparative homology models of each of the two mutant forms of the β2-adrenergic receptor (25Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar, 26Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10552) Google Scholar, 27Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). For each receptor construct, the 7TM domains of the 25 resulting models were superimposed on the 7TM domain of bovine rhodopsin, considering heavy backbone atoms only. The calculated backbone root mean square deviations were between 0.06 and 0.28 Å. The resulting models were evaluated based on manual visualization and the MODELLER fitness score. Inspection of the individual structures showed that a number of residues, especially in the extracellular part of the 7TM segments, in the main ligand-binding pocket had several possible side chain conformations. The different side chain conformations could be mapped in general to different discrete rotamer states with χ1/χ2 angles within a 30° window from corresponding side chain rotamers as listed in the Lovel rotamer library. Considering the packing environment for the different side chains, all possible combinatorial accessible rotamer states for the residue positions composing the two introduced metal ion-binding sites (AspIII:08/CysVI:16/CysVII:06 and HisIII:08/CysVI:16/CysVII:06) were produced in SYBYL and the biopolymer module using the Lovel rotamer library (SYBYL® 7.0, Tripos, Inc., Louis, MI). The heavy atom distance distributions between either of the two acidic oxygens of AspIII:08 and the sulfur of CysVI:16 and CysVII:06 in the AspIII:08/CysVI:16/Cys-VII:06 construct and the ϵ- or δ-nitrogen in the imidazole ring of HisIII:08 and the sulfurs of CysVI:16 and CysVII:06 in the HisIII:08/CysVI:16/CysVII:06 receptor construct were calculated using customized scripts. Searches in Relibase (available at relibase.rutgers.edu), which is a data base of protein-ligand complexes (28Hendlich M. Bergner A. Gunther J. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), for metal ion complexes in which Zn(II) simultaneously interacts with a nitrogen atom of a His residue and the sulfur atom of a Cys residue showed that, among 2862 sites, the most frequently observed interaction distance between Zn(II) and sulfur is 2.2 Å and that between Zn(II) and the imidazole ϵ-nitrogen is 1.8-2 Å and that the most populated angles between imidazole nitrogen, Zn(II), and sulfur are 90-120°. Thus, in a Zn(II) metal ion-binding site, the distance between the imidazole ϵ-nitrogen and the sulfur of a Cys residue is typically between 3.35 and 3.5 Å and can be up to 4.06 Å, which, however, is observed in only ∼1% of the complexes. Generation of an “Active” Receptor Conformation—The helical bundle of an inactive model of the β2-adrenergic receptor was used as a template to produce a model of the active conformation. A tridentate construct was used for convenience because it is envisioned that, during activation, movements of both TM-VI and TM-VII will occur and because the two bidentate sites converge on position III:08. The active receptor conformation was produced by Monte Carlo simulated annealing protocols (29Li Z. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) using distance constraints applied by the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) functionality of CHARMM corresponding to 1) the metal ion site, a 2-Å distance constraint between Zn(II) and the heavy atom of the three involved residues and a 3.2-4.0-Å constraint between the sulfur of the Cys residues and the nitrogens of the His residues; 2) the intracellular segment of TM-VI, a 16-Å NOE constraint for the backbone Cα-Cα distance between ArgIII:26 and LysVI:04 consistent with an outward movement of 6 Å plus a 9-Å constraint for the backbone Cα-Cα distance between TyrV:24 and LysVI:04 to ensure a close spatial relationship between the intracellular ends of TM-V and TM-VI (14Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); 3) movement of the intracellular segment of TM-VII, a Cα-Cα distance constraint of 19 Å between ArgIII:26 and TyrVII:20 consistent with an outward movement of 3 Å (14Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); and 4) the conserved hydrogen bond network between TM-I, -II, and -VII (17Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar, 30Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), a 2.8-3.5-Å heavy atom distance constraint between the side chain nitrogen of AsnI:18 and the free backbone carbonyl of SerVII:13 and between the side chain carboxylate oxygen of AspII:10 and the nitrogen of AsnVII:16. To allow TM-VI to possibly straighten out, the ϕ/Ψ backbone torsion angles of TrpVI:13, which are responsible for the pronounced kink in this helix, were allowed to be perturbed to obtain energetically favorable conformations to stabilize the helix locally. Similarly, to allow TM-VII to possibly straighten out, the backbone ϕ/Ψ torsion angles of ValVII:11 to AsnVII:16 were allowed to be perturbed. To allow TM-VII to straighten out, distance constraints were in some simulations added to optimize the backbone hydrogen bonds toward a more regular α-helix. An NOE distance constraint of 2.8-3.5 Å between the amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of the i and i-4 positions was applied to LeuVII:18 and GlyVII:14, Asn-VII:16 and AsnVII:12, PheVII:15 and ValVII:11, GlyVII:14 and TyrVII: 10, and SerVII:13 and GlyVII:09. An initial temperature of 1000 K was used. In the temperature interval of 1000 to 100 K, the temperature was lowered in steps of 100 K. In the interval of 100 to 0 K, the temperature was lowered in steps of 10 K. For each temperature, the system was optimized in 1000 Monte Carlo steps, i.e. a total of 20,000 Monte Carlo steps were applied in the simulation. The coordinates were saved every 200 steps. The Monte Carlo command (MOVE ADD) in CHARMM was used to construct the move sets (32Dinner A.R. Verosub E. Karplus M. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). During the simulation protocol, perturbations were applied to translations, rotations, and torsional degrees of freedom for the defined move sets. For simplicity, the backbones of TM-I-V were fixed throughout the entire simulation. We used the defined CHARMM move types for rigid translations (RTRN) along a random uniformly distributed vector for the two move sets comprising all atoms in TM-VI and TM-VII, respectively. Similarly, rigid rotations (RROT) were applied to the same two move sets. The origin of the uniformly distributed rotation vector was located at the geometric center for TM-VI and TM-VII, respectively. Concerted perturbations of individual backbone torsions (CROT) were applied to perturb the central region of TM-VI and TM-VII, respectively, to locally allow modifications of the helical kinks induced by ProVI:15 and ProVII:17. Torsional perturbations were applied to all χ torsions of the side chains in the main ligand-binding crevice, consistent with the template retinal-binding site in rhodopsin defined as all atoms (selected by residue) within a 6-Å radius from any retinal atom. The following move criteria were applied to the different move sets. A Dmax of 0.1 Å was used for rigid translation. For rigid rotations, a Dmax of 5° was applied, whereas the Dmax for χ torsions of side chains in the binding was 180° to explore alternative rotamer states and side chain packings. The CROT main chain perturbation step was subsequently followed by 10 steps of conjugated gradient minimization, i.e. in addition to a main chain perturbation, all atoms in the binding site region were minimized before the Metropolis acceptance criteria were applied. Each Monte Carlo step consisted of 1) randomly picking a group of move instances (a subset of the protein side chain atoms, the chelator functional group, the metal ion, or the helical segments), 2) performing the “MOVE” (i.e. perturb Cartesian Coordinates of that group; each move was subsequently minimized for 10 steps of steepest decent prior to the Metropolis acceptance criterion) (29Li Z. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar); 3) calculating the energetic contribution in the new configuration; and 4) accepting or rejecting the new position with the probability Exp(ΔVλ-MC/kT). Connecting the III:08/VII:06 Activating Metal Ion Site with TM-VI— Originally, a bidentate activating metal ion site was constructed in the β2-adrenergic receptor between position III:08, with either the naturally occurring amine-binding Asp residue or a His residue introduced at this position, and a Cys residue introduced at position VII:06 (Fig. 1) (21Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As movement of TM-VI has been strongly implicated in the activation mechanism for 7TM receptors, we used the III:08/VII:06 bidentate site as the starting point to probe the inner face of TM-VI for potential additional metal ion attachment sites. His or Cys residues were systematically introduced at positions VI:16, VI:19, and VI:20 in the AspIII:08/CysVII:06 background in the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 1). The mutant receptors were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells, and cAMP production was measured in response to Cu(II) or Zn(II) either alone or in complex with either bipyridine or phenanthroline and compared with the response to the partial agonist pindolol, which, in the wild-type receptor, increased cAMP accumulation from a basal level of 6.8 ± 0.7 to 45 ± 5 fmol/105 cells (Table 1). 3Pindolol was used as agonist because it does not activate endogenous adrenergic receptors that are expressed on COS-7 cells, in contrast to isoproterenol, for example.

In fact, in most of these constructs, a somewhat reduced response was observed. In the case in which a His residue was substituted for the natural Phe residue at position VI:16 in the AspIII:08/CysVII:06 background, a totally non-responsive receptor was obtained (Table 1, Part A). However, when a Cys residue was introduced at this position in the AspIII: 08/CysVII:06 background, the dose-response curve for Cu(II) in complex with bipyridine and phenanthroline with respect to stimulation of cAMP production was shifted by 5- and 10-fold, respectively, to the left compared with the background bidentate construct, reaching a potency of 0.8 μm for Cu(II)-phenanthroline in the AspIII:08/CysVI:16/Cys-VII:06 construct (Fig. 2). This potency corresponds to the metal ion affinity measured in the best tridentate-inactivating metal ion sites constructed previously, i.e. between residues located in the outer segments of TM-V and TM-VI in the NK1 or κ-opioid receptor ("

This enzyme cleaves the oligosaccharide chain on the nonreducing end of either glucuronic or iduronic acid, sharing this characteristic with a chondroitin ABC lyase. We have determined the first structure of a heparin-degrading lyase, that of heparinase II from Pedobacter heparinus (formerly Flavobacterium heparinum), in a ligand-free state at 2.15Ä resolution and in complex with a disaccharide product of heparin degradation at 2.30Ä resolution. The protein is composed of three domains: an N-terminal α-helical domain, a central two-layered β-sheet domain, and a C-terminal domain forming a two-layered β-sheet. Heparinase II shows overall structural similarities to the polysaccharide lyase family 8 (PL8) enzymes chondroitin AC lyase and hyaluronate lyase. In contrast to PL8 enzymes, however, heparinase II forms stable dimers, with the two active sites formed independently within each monomer. The structure of the N-terminal domain of heparinase II is also similar to that of alginate lyases from the PL5 family. A Zn2+ ion is bound within the central domain and plays an essential structural role in the stabilization of a loop forming one wall of the substrate-binding site. The disaccharide binds in a long, deep canyon formed at the top of the N-terminal domain and by loops extending from the central domain. Based on structural comparison with the lyases from the PL5 and PL8 families having bound substrates or products, the disaccharide found in heparinase II occupies the “+1” and “+2” subsites. The structure of the enzyme-product complex, combined with data from previously characterized mutations, allows us to propose a putative chemical mechanism of heparin and heparan-sulfate degradation.

Heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSGAG, heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan; HepII, heparinase II; SeMet, selenomethionine; PEG, polyethylene glycol.2The abbreviations used are: HSGAG, heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan; HepII, heparinase II; SeMet, selenomethionine; PEG, polyethylene glycol. are major components of the extracellular matrix and are also found at the cell surface as part of proteoglycan cell surface receptors (1Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 2Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). HSGAGs are negatively charged linear polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units of hexopyranosyluronic acid (uronic acid) and 2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranose (glucosamine, GlcNAc) (3Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are abundant on the cell surface as receptors, where 2–5 polysaccharide chains are attached via a serine residue to a core protein (4Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Heparin PGs are primarily synthesized and stored in mast cells. Consequently, short oligosaccharide sequences are released as bioactive heparin GAGs by the action of heparin hydrolase. These complex polysaccharides provide docking sites for numerous protein ligands and receptors involved in diverse biological processes, ranging from cancer (5Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L.

Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar).HSGAGs are not homogeneous in their chemical structure but are subject to extensive modification of the linear chain during biosynthesis. These modifications are catalyzed through the sequential action of several enzymes and include epimerization of β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid to α-l-idopyranosyluronic acid (l-iduronic acid, IdoA), N-deacetylation coupled with N-sulfation of the glucosamine moiety, and O-sulfation of hydroxyl groups (2-O, 3-O, or 6-O). Heparin typically contains ∼90% iduronic acid and 10% glucuronic acid, with predominant sulfation of iduronic acid at the 2-OH position. The hexosamine usually contains 3-O-sulfation and is predominantly N-sulfated (GlcNS). Occasionally, it is also present in the N-acetylated form (GlcNAc). Occurrence of a glucosamine unsubstituted at the 2-N position is rare. Heparan sulfate is a related polysaccharide with a higher percentage of GlcA and a lower percentage of 2-O- and N-sulfation within the polymer. Modification of HS is not uniform but rather is concentrated within specific regions of the polymer, giving rise to short sequence motifs responsible for the interactions between HS and a diverse repertoire of proteins leading to its multiple biological roles.Two distinct chemical mechanisms are employed by proteins in order to break down HSGAGs: hydrolysis and β-elimination. Mammalian enzymes employ solely hydrolytic mechanisms to cleave the glycosyl-oxygen (C1–On) bond. The bacterial enzymes are either hydrolases or lyases. Lyases act exclusively on the oxygen-aglycone (On–C4) bond adjacent to the uronic acid moiety at position C5 and result in a product with a C-4–C-5 double bond (Scheme 1). The mammalian enzyme heparanase, an endo-β-glucuronidase, cleaves HS utilizing a hydrolytic mechanism. It involves the addition of a water molecule to afford saturated oligosaccharide products (12Kussie P.H. Hulmes J.D. Ludwig D.L. Patel S. Navarro E.C. Seddon A.P. Giorgio N.A. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Toyoshima M. Nakajima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24153-24160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Bacterial heparinases, on the other hand, cleave their polysaccharide substrates through an elimination mechanism (5Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1986; 12: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The proposed elimination mechanism involves neutralization of the negative charge of the uronic acid acidic group, presumably by interaction with a positively charged amino acid, thereby reducing the acidity of the C-5 proton (14Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Next, a general base abstracts the proton from the C-5 position of the uronic acid, which leads to a β-elimination of the 4-O-glycosidic bond concomitant with formation of a double bond between C-4 and C-5 of the uronic acid (14Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the last step, a general acid donates a proton to the O– leaving group of a glucosamine, reconstituting the OH function at the reducing end of the cleaved bond.Heparinases have been identified in several bacterial species, with the enzymes from the soil bacterium Pedobacter heparinus (formerly Flavobacterium heparinum (15Steyn P.L. Segers P. Vancanneyt M. Sandra P. Kersters K. Joubert J.J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1998; 48: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)) being best characterized. This organism produces three heparinases differing in molecular weight, charge properties, and substrate specificities (16Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol.

Heparinase I (heparin lyase I; heparinase; EC 4.2.2.7), with a molecular mass of 43.8 kDa and a pI of 9.3, has a relatively stringent substrate specificity, acting on the heparinlike linkages of 2SIdoA(1–4)6SGlcNS (18Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Heparinase III (heparitinase I; EC 4.2.2.8), with a molecular mass of 73 kDa and a pI of 10, prefers an undersulfated GlcNS/GlcNAc(1–4)GlcA heparan-sulfate linkage (18Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Heparinase II (heparin lyase II; heparitinase II; no assigned EC number), the largest in the group with a molecular mass of 84.5 kDa and a pI of 8.9, is unique in its ability to cleave both heparin and heparan sulfate-like regions of the polysaccharide, regardless of the sulfation pattern (17Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L. Pinhal M.A. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C.T. Dietrich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16807-16813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its primary sequence, heparinase I has been assigned to the polysaccharide lyase family PL13 and heparinase III to the family PL12, whereas heparinase II (HepII) has a unique sequence and has not yet been classified (CAZy data base; available on the World Wide Web at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/PL.html). No structural information is available for any of the HSGAG lyases.HepII is a basic protein consisting of 772 residues. An N-terminal signal sequence of 25 residues is cleaved upon export to the periplasmic space to yield the mature protein with a molecular mass of 84,545 Da (20Su H. Blain F. Musil R.A. Zimmermann J.J. Gu K. Bennett D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2723-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It acts in an endolytic manner (21Rhomberg A.J. Shriver Z. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12232-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and displays broad selectivity, catalyzing the cleavage of linkages adjacent not only to IdoA and GlcA but also to the rare α-l-galacturonic acid residues present in the polymer (22Moffat C.F. McLean M.W. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Moffat C.F. McLean M.W. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The glucosamine in the substrate could be either GlcNAc or GlcNS. HepII will also degrade the rare disaccharide containing GlcNH3, provided that the uronic acid is 2-O-sulfated. Although HepII has greater affinity for heparin, its turnover rate for heparan sulfate is higher (16Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme displays preference toward degradation of glycosidic bonds containing GluA over ones containing IdoA. Heparinase II shows greater catalytic efficiency for longer rather than shorter oligosaccharide substrates (21Rhomberg A.J. Shriver Z. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12232-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggested that cysteine and histidine residues are involved in catalysis (24Shriver Z. Hu Y. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol.

We have adopted the nomenclature of Davies et al. (26Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) for the sugar binding subsites, where “+ subsites” refer to those toward the reducing end of the substrate, and “–subsites” indicate those toward the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain. Cleavage occurs between sugars occupying the “–1” and “+1” subsites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and PurificationNative HepII—Purification of HepII from P. heparinus was carried out as described previously (27Shaya D. Li Y. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, P. heparinus cells overexpressing HepII (58Shao Z. Tkalec L. Blain F. Zimmermann J. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were cultivated in FH medium (58Shao Z. Tkalec L. Blain F. Zimmermann J. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (w/v) heparin (Dongying Hi-tech Chemical Industry Co., Dongying City, China) and 0.1 mg ml–1 trimethoprim antibiotic (Sigma). The cells were harvested, cells were disrupted using a French press, the lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the protein supernatant containing HepII was collected. HepII was purified using two chromatographic steps, SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP; Bio-Rad). HepII-containing fractions were concentrated to 6.5 mg ml–1 by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep-50 concentrator (Millipore Corp.), and the buffer was exchanged to 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium formate, 5 mm dithiothreitol.Cloning and Expression of HepII in Escherichia coli—P. heparinus was obtained as a lyophilized stock from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), stock number 13125. Rehydrated stock was used to seed a 100-ml culture, which was grown aerobically at 30 °C with moderate shaking to an optical density (A600) between 1.5 and 2 in defined medium containing 0.1% (w/v) heparin as described (28Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from the bacterial culture using the Qiagen DNeasy DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions for Gram-negative bacteria based on ∼2 × 109 cells/column. Purified genomic DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml–1. The quality of genomic DNA was assessed by UV absorbance at 260/280 nm and by electrophoresis on a 0.5% agarose gel and confirmed by PCR using P. heparinus-specific oligonucleotide primers.The heparinase II gene lacking the signal sequence (residues 1–23) was directly amplified by PCR from P. heparinus genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-CAT ATG TAT TCC CAA ACC AAG GCC GAT GTG GTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTC GAG GAT CCT TAT CTC AAA AAA CGG TAG GTT CCT-3′ (NdeI and XhoI restriction sites are denoted in boldface type). Oligonucleotide primer sequences were based on the published hepB sequence annotated within the NCBI (GenBank™) data base (accession number U27585). PCR conditions included 100 ng of genomic DNA and Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) for 35 cycles using an annealing temperature of 61 °C and 3-min extensions at 68 °C. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and 3′ dA overhangs were generated using 200 μm dATP and TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 10 min at 72 °C. Modified PCR products were ligated into the TOPO/TA PCR cloning vector 4.0 (Invitrogen) and used to transform One-shot TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). Positive clones were verified by restriction enzyme analysis. The 2.2-kb HepII gene was subcloned into the T7-based expression plasmid pET28a (Novagen) as an NdeI-XhoI cassette for recombinant expression in E. coli as an amino-terminal His6 fusion protein to facilitate purification. Plasmid DNA sequencing, using both vector- and gene-specific primers, was used to confirm the final expression clones.Sequence-verified plasmid pET28a/hepIIΔNterm was subsequently transformed into BL21(DE3) for expression. One-liter cultures were grown at room temperature (∼20 °C) in LB medium supplemented with 40 μg ml–1 kanamycin, and protein expression was induced with 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside added at an A600 of 1.0. Induced cultures were allowed to grow for 15–18 h at room temperature prior to harvesting.Purification of Recombinant Heparinase II—Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 30 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). Lysis was performed by the addition of 0.1 mg ml–1 lysozyme and incubation for 20 min at room temperature followed by intermittent sonication in an ice water bath using a Misonex XL sonicator at 40–50% output. This lysate was fractionated by centrifugation (20,000 × g; 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. HepII was purified by immobilized metal-chelate chromatography using a 5-ml Hi-Trap column (GE Healthcare) precharged with 200 mm NiSO4 and subsequently equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was run at a flow rate of ∼3 ml min–1 that included a wash step with 50 mm imidazole. HepII was eluted in 5-ml fractions using imidazole elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole).HepII from the IMAC step was buffer-exchanged on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl. The His6 tag was cleaved by the addition of biotinylated thrombin at 0.5 units/mg of protein and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Thrombin was removed by binding to streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h using the thrombin capture kit (Novagen).The enzyme was further purified on a Source 15S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare). Enzyme was diluted 1:4 (v/v) with 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, and loaded onto the column, and a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl was applied over 10 column volumes. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Sypro Ruby Protein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR).Expression and Purification of Selenomethionine-labeled HepII—Selenomethionine (SeMet) labeling of HepII by methionine inhibition was performed using a modified M9 medium (29Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). An overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB supplemented with 400 mg/liter kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C. The culture was pelleted and resuspended in 8 ml of modified M9 medium supplemented with 20% (w/v) glucose, 100 μm CaCl2, and 1× BME vitamin solution (Sigma). A 1-ml volume of resuspended culture was used to inoculate each of 4× 500 ml of M9 medium, and cells were grown at 37 °C in 2-liter baffled flasks until an A600 of 0.5–0.6. Solid amino acid supplement was added as a preweighed mixture, and SeMet (Sigma) predissolved in sterile water was added at a final concentration of 50 mg/liter. Cell growth was allowed to continue for ∼30 min, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and the cells were cultured for 15 h at 30 °C. HepII was subsequently purified as described above.The efficiency of SeMet incorporation was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using saturated sinapinic acid matrix solution in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/water as a matrix. Molecular masses were calibrated using both bovine serum albumin and β-galactosidase as protein standards. The molecular mass difference between unlabeled and SeMet-labeled enzyme indicated greater than 90% incorporation.Purified SeMet-labeled protein was concentrated to 6.2 mg ml–1 by ultrafiltration using a Centricon YM-100 concentrator (Millipore Corp.) and the buffer was exchanged to 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) NaN3.Crystallization and Data CollectionNative HepII—Native HepII crystals were obtained from the protein overexpressed in P. heparinus, and diffraction data were collected as described previously (27Shaya D. Li Y. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, initial crystals were obtained from 6.5 mg ml–1 protein in buffer and a reservoir solution containing 17% (w/v) PEG 3350, 200 mm sodium phosphate pH 5. Crystals were optimized by microseeding. These crystals belong to space group P212121, with unit cell parameters a = 70.0, b = 119.3, and c = 200.7 Ä and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. For data collection, crystals were transferred briefly to a cryoprotectant solution (22.5% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.07 m sodium phosphate, pH 5, 2.17 m sodium formate) and flash cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). Diffraction data were collected at beamline X25 (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory) on a Q-315 area detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., San Diego, CA) and processed to 2.15 Ä resolution using HKL2000 (30Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab SeMet-labeled HepII—HepII overexpressed in E. coli did not yield crystals under the same conditions as for the protein produced in P. heparinus. Somewhat different conditions were found using the PEG Suite screen (Nextal Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. The protein crystallized only when it was supplemented with 3 mm low molecular weight heparin (Sigma). Cube-shaped crystals of SeMet-labeled HepII appeared in drops containing 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 200 mm magnesium chloride within 3–5 days. These crystals belong to space group P21, with unit cell parameters a = 52.0, b = 163.0, c = 95.2 Ä, β = 105.4° and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The Matthews coefficient VM is 2.28 Ä3 Da–1 (31Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7902) Google Scholar), and the solvent content is estimated to be 46%. Crystals were transferred briefly to a cryoprotectant solution (25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 200 mm magnesium chloride, 12% (v/v) glycerol) and flash cooled in the nitrogen stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems). Diffraction data extending to 2.3 Ä resolution were collected at beamline X8C (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory), using a Quantum-4 CCD area detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) at a wavelength of 0.97910 Ä, corresponding to the measured absorption inflection point, in order to optimize the f ″ component of the selenium anomalous scattering. Images were processed with the HKL2000 program package (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) (Table 1).Structure Determination and RefinementHepII Expressed in E. coli—Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing was performed using the data collected for SeMet-labeled HepII at 0.97910-Ä wavelengths. A total of 31 of 42 selenium sites were located using the program SOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The heavy atom sites were refined using the program SHARP (33Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), and 11 additional selenium sites were located in the anomalous difference map. Inclusion of all of the identified selenium sites gave phases with an overall figure-of-merit of 0.35–2.5 Ä resolution. Solvent flattening with RESOLVE (34Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) increased the figure-of-merit to 0.65 and automatically built a partial model consisting of 60% of main chain atoms and 45% of side chain atoms. The model was completed manually using the program O (35Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and refined using the program REFMAC5 (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar). Since all crystals showed some level of anisotropic diffraction, the refinement protocol included the TLS option with each of the three domains treated separately. The inclusion of TLS reduced the R-free and R-work by ∼2%, but the average B-factor for the protein was very little affected. The analysis of TLS indicates the largest libration along the direction approximately parallel to the long axis of the molecule (supplementary material). Solvent molecules were added using ARP/wARP (37Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Electron density maps showed the presence of a disaccharide within the substrate-binding site of each molecule, which was subsequently modeled as a trisulfated disaccharide"

Its inhibition has been shown to increase oxidative injury and abolish the late phase of ischemic preconditioning. However, the mechanisms by which ischemia regulates AR activity remain unclear. Herein, we report that rat hearts subjected to ischemia, in situ or ex vivo, display a 2–4-fold increase in AR activity. The AR activity was not further enhanced by reperfusion. Activation increased Vmax of the enzyme without affecting the Km and decreased the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by sorbinil. Enzyme activation could be prevented by pretreating the hearts with the radical scavenging thiol, N-(2-mercaptoproprionyl)glycine or the superoxide dismutase mimetic, Tiron, or by treating homogenates with dithiothreitol. In vitro, the recombinant enzyme was activated upon treatment with H2O2 and the activated, but not the native enzyme, formed a covalent adduct with the sulfenic acid-specific reagent dimedone. The enzyme activity in the ischemic, but not the nonischemic heart homogenates was inhibited by dimedone. Separation of proteins from hearts subjected to coronary occlusion by two-dimensional electrophoresis and subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry analysis revealed the formation of sulfenic acids at Cys-298 and Cys-303. These data indicate that reactive oxygen species formed in the ischemic heart activate AR by modifying its cysteine residues to sulfenic acids.

The enzyme also catalyzes the reduction of glutathione conjugates of unsaturated aldehydes such as acrolein, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal, and trans-2-hexenal with higher efficiency than the parent aldehyde (3Dixit B.L. Balendiran G.K. Watowich S.J. Srivastava S. Ramana K.V. Petrash J.M. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol.

Our recent studies suggest that AR participates also in the metabolism of 1-palmitoyl-2-oxovaleroyl phosphatidylcholine and related phospholipid (“core”) aldehydes (5Srivastava S. Spite M. Trent J.O.

The efficacy of AR in reducing multiple aldehydes suggests that the enzyme may be involved in cellular defense against aldehydes produced by lipid peroxidation. The notion that AR is involved in antioxidant defense is supported by evidence showing that: the AR gene is induced by oxidants such as aldehydes (6Ruef J. Liu S.Q. Bode C. Tocchi M. Srivastava S.

An antioxidant role of AR is also in accord with our observation that inhibition of the enzyme increases 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal accumulation in the ischemic heart and abolishes cardioprotection associated with the late phase of ischemic preconditioning (9Shinmura K. Bolli R. Liu S.Q. Tang X.L. Kodani E. Xuan Y.T. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, because of its ability to catalyze the reduction of glucose, AR also regulates the flux of glucose in the heart and inhibition of the enzyme has been shown to prevent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing glycolysis and preserving NADH/NAD+ levels (13Hwang Y.C.

Perhaps the role of the enzyme in the heart is context-dependent and determined in part by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms regulating its activity. Aldose reductase is a NADPH-dependent monomeric protein that belongs to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (2Srivastava S.K. Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 16Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Whereas the protein is expressed basally in many tissues, its expression is enhanced by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (6Ruef J. Liu S.Q. Bode C. Tocchi M. Srivastava S. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The AR gene is markedly induced in high ionic strength media (19Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via a NFAT-5-dependent mechanism (20Lopez-Rodriguez C. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Lin F. Novobrantseva T.I. Bronson R.T. Igarashi P. Rao A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which stimulates the osmotic response element located at the promoter site of the AR gene. AR is also subject to post-translational modifications and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme has been described (21Varma T. Liu S.Q. West M. Thongboonkerd V. Ruvolo P.P. May W.S. Bhatnagar A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether such mechanisms regulate AR activity under conditions of oxidative stress or ischemia. Several investigators have reported the presence of activated and non-activated forms of AR in normal and diabetic tissues (22Das B. Srivastava S.K.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Native AR isolated from most tissues displays biphasic kinetics that could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of activated and non-activated forms of the enzyme (22Das B. Srivastava S.K. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Grimshaw C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Grimshaw C.E. Lai C.J.

Acta. 1986; 870: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the kinetics of the activated form (high Vmax) of the enzyme is monophasic. A characteristic feature of an activated enzyme is its relative insensitivity to inhibition by drugs such as sorbinil. Whereas some kinetic features of the activated enzyme could be simulated by oxidizing its cysteine residues (27Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Das B. Srivastava S.K. Mol.

Therefore, to delineate the mechanism of AR activation, we examined changes in enzyme activity during ischemia. Our results show that ischemia activates AR by modifying its cysteine residues to sulfenic acids. Preliminary findings of this study have been published as an abstract (33Kaiserova K. Awe S.O.

Materials—Tiron, dl-glyceraldehyde, dithiothreitol (DTT), mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid, sorbitol, sorbitol dehydrogenase, dimedone, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), CHAPS, N-(2-mercaptoproprionyl)glycine (MPG), SDS, lucigenin, urea, EDTA, EGTA, NADPH, and NAD+ were obtained from Sigma. Sorbinil was a gift from Pfizer. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immobilized pH gradient strips, and Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Primary polyclonal antibodies against rat AR were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Sephadex G-25 columns, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents, and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-goat antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Global Ischemia-Reperfusion ex Vivo—Hearts excised from male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g, 3–4 months old) were cannulated and perfused in the Langendorff retrograde mode, as described (34Bhatnagar A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 35Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10893-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts were perfused at a constant perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KH buffer, pH 7.5) containing, in mm: NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 3, MgCl2 1.25, NaHCO3 25, KH2PO4 1.25, EDTA 0.5, glucose 10, and equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% of CO2 for 10 min. A latex fluid-filled balloon was placed in the left ventricle through an incision in the left atrial appendage and inflated to a pressure of 8–10 mm Hg and the perfusion flow rate was between 8 and 12 ml/min for all heart preparations. Seven groups of rats (300–350 g; 4–8 rats per group) underwent the following experimental protocols (Scheme 1). In Protocols I–III isolated rat hearts were perfused for 40 min with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer alone, (Protocol I), or KH buffer containing either 10 mm Tiron (Protocol II) or 5 mm MPG (Protocol III). In Protocols IV–VI the hearts were first perfused for 10 min either with KH buffer alone (Protocol IV), or KH buffer containing Tiron (Protocol V) or MPG (Protocol VI). In Protocol VII, the hearts were perfused with KH buffer for 10 min, subjected to global ischemia for 30 min, and reperfused for 30 min. Regional Ischemia-Reperfusion in Situ—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection containing ketamine (37 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) followed by continuous inhalation of 0.5–1.0% isofurane after endotracheal intubation. The animals were ventilated with oxygen-enriched room air using a rodent respirator (Harvard Rodent Ventilator model 683, 60–70 breaths/min). Tidal volume was set to 1.0 ml/100 g of body weight. The chest was opened via a left thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space, and the ribs were gently retracted to expose the heart. After pericardioctomy, a 6-0 proline (Ethicon, NJ) ligature was placed under the left main coronary artery, and the ends of the tie were threaded through a small plastic (PE50) tube to form a snare for reversible left coronary artery occlusion for 15 min (Protocol IX). For occlusion-reperfusion experiments (Protocol X), the ligature was removed and the hearts were subjected to 15 min of reperfusion. The border of the ischemic zone of the left ventricle was demarcated with a surgical marker during occlusion. Sham operated hearts served as controls (Protocol VIII). The hearts were excised and tissue samples were taken immediately from the ischemic (anterior wall) and non-ischemic (posterior wall) zones of the left ventricle. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Measurement of Superoxide Anions—The hearts were pulverized and homogenized in 10 volumes of perchloric acid (10%, v/v) and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g. The protein-free supernatant (0.1 ml) was incubated with 0.25 mm lucigenin at room temperature for 5 min in the dark and chemiluminescence was measured in a microtiter plate at excitation and emission wavelengths of 430 and 452 nm, respectively. Lucigenin (0.25 mm) in 10% perchloric acid was used as a reagent blank. Measurement of AR Activity—Left ventricular tissue was homogenized in 4 volumes of 0.01 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NEM, and protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, v/v). The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C and the supernatant was used for measuring AR activity. Wherever indicated the homogenate was reduced with 0.1 m DTTin0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess DTT was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) column pre-equilibrated with N2-saturated 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), containing 1 mm EDTA. Enzyme activity was measured at 25 °C in a 0.2-ml system containing 0.1 ml of tissue homogenate (1–1.5 mg of protein), 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.15 mm NADPH, and 10 mm glyceraldehyde. The reaction was monitored by the rate of oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm for 3 min. The control cuvette (blank) contained all components of the reaction mixture except glyceraldehyde. To estimate steady-state kinetic parameters, initial velocity was measured at 7–10 different concentrations of glyceraldehyde. Measurement of Myocardial Sorbitol Levels—Left ventricular tissue (0.1–0.2 g) was pulverized in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 4 volumes of 6% perchloric acid. Homogenates were centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the protein-free supernatant (1.0 ml) was mixed with 0.5 ml of glycine buffer (pH 9.4) containing 3.6 mm NAD+ and 6 units of sorbitol dehydrogenase. The sorbitol levels were measured spectrofluorometrically, as described previously (36Malone J.I. Knox G. Benford S. Tedesco T.A. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 861-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis, Western Blotting, and MALDI-TOF/MS Analyses—Left ventricular tissue (0.1–0.2 g) was homogenized in 4 volumes of the protein extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8) containing 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NEM, and protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, v/v)). Homogenates (25%) were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the supernatants were aspirated and mixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the proteins. The pellet was washed three times with acetone and resuspended in 0.2 ml of resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 6.8) containing 8 m urea and 2 mm EDTA). Samples were diluted to 0.5 mg of protein/ml with base rehydration buffer (9.8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and 100 μg of proteins were loaded onto the 11-cm immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 5–8). Proteins were focused at 35,000 volt-hours with a maximum current of 50 μA/strip. After focusing, the strips were incubated in base equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.8) containing 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 50 mm NEM) for 15 min. The strips were then equilibrated in SDS-PAGE running buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.3) containing 0.2 m glycine and 1% SDS) and placed on the top of a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, overlaid with agarose, and subjected to electrophoresis in the second dimension. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with polyclonal anti-AR antibodies (21Varma T. Liu S.Q. West M. Thongboonkerd V. Ruvolo P.P. May W.S. Bhatnagar A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Parallel gels were silver-stained. Spots corresponding to a molecular mass of 36 kDa and pI ∼ 6.28 were excised and used for MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. To extract peptides, the gel plugs were incubated for 15 min with 20 μlof 0.1 m NH4HCO3 followed by addition of 30 μl of acetonitrile. Solvents were removed and the gel plugs were dried under vacuum. Trypsin (200 ng) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added to the gel plugs and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting solution was co-crystallized with a matrix of a cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a spot on a stainless steel target plate. The TOF-Spec 2E (Micromass), which employs a nitrogen laser (337 nm), was used. Ionization was obtained by automated data acquisition using pulses at 20–505 power and raster array of 10 clusters of 10 pulses each. A standard mixture of cytochrome c, myoglobin, and trypsinogen was used for mass axis calibration. Accelerating potential was set to 20 kV with delayed extraction and data were collected at a rate of 2 GHz, by scanning from 500 to 3,000 atomic mass units in the positive ion reflector mode. Average data, represented as a centroid peak were compared with a battery of databases with 50–100 ppm resolution precision. Peptide m/z values were analyzed in silico for suspect modifications using MASCOT data base. Electrospray Ionization MS (ESI+/MS)—For ESI+/MS analysis the protein was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with N2-saturated ammonium acetate (10 mm). The desalted protein was diluted with the flow injection solvent (acetonitrile:H2O:formic acid; 50:50:1, v/v/v). The mixture was injected into a MicroMass ZMD spectrometer at a rate of 10 μl/min. The operating parameters were as follows: capillary voltage 3.1 kV; cone voltage 27 V; extractor voltage 4 V; source block temperature 100 °C, and desolvation temperature 200 °C. Spectra were acquired at the rate of 200 atomic mass units/s over the range of 20–2,000 atomic mass units. The instrument was calibrated with myoglobin (0.15 mg/ml) dissolved in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.2% (v/v) formic acid. Statistical Analysis—Individual saturation curves used to obtain steady-state kinetic parameters were fitted to a general Michaelis-Menten equation using EnzFitter (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). In all cases, best fits to the data were chosen on the basis of the standard error of the fitted parameters. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons or by Student's t test for unpaired data. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Ischemia Activates AR—Ischemia-induced changes in AR activity were determined in the tissue homogenates prepared from hearts subjected to ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion ex vivo or coronary occlusion or occlusion-reperfusion in situ (for specific protocols, see Scheme 1). As shown in Fig. 1A (inset), homogenates prepared from perfused hearts subjected to different durations of global ischemia displayed a time-dependent increase in AR activity. Maximal activation (3-fold) was observed after 30 min of ischemia (Protocol IV). The increase in AR activity in ischemic hearts was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in sorbitol content (Fig. 1A). No further change in AR activity was observed upon reperfusion (Protocol VII), although reperfusion did lead to a slight (25%) decrease in tissue sorbitol content. Left ventricular tissue obtained from the ischemic zone of hearts subjected to 15 min of coronary occlusion (Protocol IX) displayed nearly a 3-fold increase in AR activity and more than a 2-fold increase in myocardial sorbitol content, as compared with sham operated hearts (Protocol VIII, Fig. 1B). The enzyme activity remained elevated in hearts reperfused for 15 min after 15 min of coronary occlusion (Protocol X), although the total sorbitol recovered from the ischemic zone was decreased, possibly due to further metabolism or efflux. Taken together, these results indicate that both, global ischemia ex vivo, or coronary occlusion in situ increase myocardial AR activity and sorbitol accumulation. Activator/Inhibitor Sensitivity of AR from Ischemic Hearts—To examine how AR is affected by ischemia, we determined the kinetic properties and the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibitors and activators. Previous study shows that AR is highly sensitive to divalent anions, such as sulfate (16Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we found that addition of 0.4 m (NH4)2SO4 into the assay buffer led to a 2–3-fold increase in AR activity in homogenates prepared from either perfused (Protocol I) and the ischemic (Protocol IV, Fig. 2A) hearts, suggesting that ischemic activation does not affect the sensitivity of the enzyme to sulfate. To test the sensitivity of AR to inhibition we used sorbinil, which inhibits AR with a Ki of ∼1.5 μm (37Bhatnagar A. Liu S.Q. Das B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although, sorbinil also inhibits aldehyde reductase with similar affinity (37Bhatnagar A. Liu S.Q. Das B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), there is little, or no aldehyde reductase activity in the rat heart (35Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10893-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In perfused heart homogenates, AR activity was inhibited by 70% in the presence of 1 μm sorbinil, but the same concentration of sorbinil inhibited AR in homogenates of ischemic hearts by only 30%, indicating that ischemia decreases the sensitivity of AR to inhibition by sorbinil. Our previous studies show that AR becomes relatively insensitive to sorbinil when its cysteine residues are modified (2Srivastava S.K. Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 16Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined whether AR activation in the ischemic heart is due to oxidation of its cysteine residues. For this, we measured AR activity in homogenates prepared from perfused (Protocol I) and ischemic (Protocol IV) hearts that were reduced with 0.1 m DTT for 1 h at 37°C. Excess DTT was removed by gel filtration and AR activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, DTT abolished ischemia-induced activation of AR, and the reduced enzyme was inhibited to 42% by 1 μm sorbinil. The ability of DTT to reverse activation and partially restore sorbinil sensitivity of AR in ischemic heart homogenates indicates that ischemic activation of AR is due to the oxidative modification of its cysteine side chain(s). Steady-state Kinetic Parameters of AR from the Ischemic Heart—To examine the catalytic properties of activated AR, steady-state kinetic parameters were determined in the tissue homogenates of perfused (Protocol I) and ischemic (Protocol IV) hearts. As listed in Table 1, no significant differences were observed between the Km glyceraldehyde values of AR from the ischemic (71 ± 16 μm) and perfused (84 ± 19 μm) hearts. However, the Vmax values in ischemic heart homogenates were 1.5-fold higher, as compared with those obtained from the perfused hearts, indicating that ischemic activation of AR is primarily due to an increase in Vmax. Reduction of the tissue homogenates with DTT had no effect on the Km glyceraldehyde of AR in perfused and ischemic hearts, but it decreased the Vmax values in both, perfused and ischemic hearts (Table 1), suggesting that a small fraction of AR in the perfused heart may be in the activated form, and that this form of the enzyme is significantly increased in the ischemic heart.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of aldose reductase from perfused and ischemic heartKmKm + DTTVmaxVmax + DTTμmmilliunitsPaP represents the 40-min perfused heart and I represents the 30-min ischemic heart.71.0 ± 15.683.6 ± 13.51.9 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.1I83.5 ± 19.093.4 ± 16.13.0 ± 0.5bp < 0.001 versus Vmax (P).2.3 ± 0.1 (P)cp < 0.05 versus Vmax (I) (n = 3).a P represents the 40-min perfused heart and I represents the 30-min ischemic heart.b p < 0.001 versus Vmax (P).c p < 0.05 versus Vmax (I) (n = 3).

We have recently reported that a variety of lipid peroxidation products at sublethal concentrations could induce adaptive response and enhance PC12 cell tolerance, although the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly clarified. In the present study, we found that both 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-OHCh) and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) at sublethal concentrations significantly increased the cellular GSH as well as the enzyme activity of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis. Depletion of cellular GSH by buthionine sulfoximine completely abolished the adaptive response. Interestingly, treatment with 15d-PGJ2 significantly increased the gene expression of both subunits of GCL in an NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent manner, whereas neither 7-OHCh induced any considerable changes on the GCL gene expression nor did the Nrf2-small interfering RNA treatment exert any appreciable effects on the GSH elevation and subsequent adaptive response induced by 7-OHCh. These results demonstrate that the adaptive response induced by both 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 is mediated similarly through the up-regulation of GSH but via different mechanisms.

Lipid peroxidation has a Janus face. It has been implicated in a variety of pathological events such as atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine, 3rd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar), but at the same time, the lipid peroxidation products, like other ROS, now have been considered to play an important role in cellular signal transduction. It may directly damage and impair the fine structure and function of biomembranes and may also modify biologically essential lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. On the other hand, such oxidative stress may also stimulate the defense network, thereby triggering the adaptive response. Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol that are important as intermediates or end products in cholesterol excretion pathways (2Bjorkhem I. Diczfalusy U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and have been shown to be involved in various diseases such as the atherosclerotic lesions (3Rimner A. Al Makdessi S. Sweidan H. Wischhusen J. Rabenstein B. Shatat K. Mayer P. Spyridopoulos I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Among those physiologically occurring oxysterols, 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-OHCh) suggests an increase of lipid peroxidation in vivo and has been successfully detected as an in vivo oxidative stress marker (4Yoshida Y. Niki E. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins of the J series (PGJs) are cyclopentenones synthesized from arachidonic acid via enzymatic conversion by cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin D2 synthase followed by nonenzymatic dehydration from prostaglandin D2 to a series of PGJs, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) (5Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It has been widely accepted that 15d-PGJ2 can react with nucleophiles such as the free sulfydryls of GSH and cysteine residues in cellular proteins through the Michael addition reaction due to its reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functional group in the cyclopentenone ring. Thus, it has been suggested that 15-PGJ2 could act as a potential activator of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and induce the expression of phase II detoxification enzymes (6Mochizuki M. Ishii Y.

The role of GSH in the protection of cells against oxidative stress and other xenobiotic compounds has been well established (9Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The intracellular content of GSH is a function of the balance between consumption, regeneration, and synthesis. Although considerable evidence shows that GSH synthesis is regulated by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) activity, cysteine availability, and GSH feedback inhibition (10Lu S.C. Curr. Opi. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) together, it should be emphasized that in most cases, the elevation of GSH is due principally to the de novo synthesis, a consequence of the increased enzyme activity of GCL, the rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis (12Dickinson D.A. Levonen A.L. Moellering D.R. Arnold E.K. Zhang H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1152-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). GCL is a heterodimer that can be dissociated under nondenaturing conditions into a catalytic subunit (GCLC) and a modulatory subunit (GCLM) (13Yan N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1588-1593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been widely accepted that both GCLC and GCLM genes are antioxidant response elements (AREs)-derived, and they both can be transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2, a central transcription factor that interacts with the ARE to activate gene transcription constitutively or in response to an oxidative stress signal (14McWalter G.K. Higgins L.G. McLellan L.I. Henderson C.J. Song L. Thornalley P.J. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 3499S-3506SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bea F. Hudson F.N. Chait A.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the adaptive response induced by 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE), one of the end products of lipid peroxidation, was critically mediated through the induction of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) via activation of Nrf2 (21Chen Z.H. Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Sekine A. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41921-41927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We have also reported that a variety of other lipid peroxidation products could induce adaptive response and enhance PC12 cell tolerance against the subsequent oxidative stress (22Chen Z.H. Yoshida Y. Saito Y. Noguchi N. Niki E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly clarified. In the present study, we found that the adaptive response induced by 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 was similarly mediated by the elevated GSH, whereas the detailed mechanisms for the GSH elevation were different. Materials—Authentic 7α-and 7β-OHCh were obtained from Steraloids Inc., and 15d-PGJ2 was a product from Calbiochem. NAPDH, reduced GSH, and oxidized GSSG were purchased from Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was obtained from Dojindo Kumamoto, Japan. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was from Sigma. Antibodies against Nrf2 and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. Cell Culture and Determination of Cell Viability—PC12 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with l-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, and pyridoxine hydrochloride, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For determination of the cell viability, the conventional MTT reduction assay was used. The treated cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT at 37 °C for 1 h. Isopropyl alcohol containing 0.04 n HCl was added to the culture medium (3:2 by volume) and mixed with a pipette until the formazan was completely dissolved. The optical density of formazan was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Measurement of Cellular GSH Contents—Intracellular GSH contents, including both reduced and oxidized forms, were determined enzymatically by a modified 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay according to the method described elsewhere (23Piga R. Saito Y. Chen Z. Yoshida Y. Niki E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 436: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Cytosolic Fractions and Analysis of GCL Activity—The cytosolic fractions were prepared for the following GCL enzyme activity assay, as described previously (24Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Akazawa T. Takahashi K. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39428-39434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). GCL activity was determined using the method reported elsewhere (25Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with slight modification. Reaction mixture (0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, 1 ml) containing cytosolic fractions (∼150 μg of protein), 10 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm l-cysteine, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.4 mm NADH, 1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 unit of pyruvate kinase was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 5 mm. The decrease of NADH was recorded at 340 nm, and the results were normalized to protein (BCA protein assay, Pierce). Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed with a GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was conducted using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), and the PCR amplification was then detected with the SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc.). The housekeeping gene of rat GAPDH was used as an endogenous control. The primers for amplification were as follow: GAPDH,5′-GGT GGA CCT CAT GGC CTA CAT-3′ (forward), 5′-GCC TCT CTC TTG CTC TCA GTA TCC T-3′ (reverse); GCLC, 5′-GGG AAG GAA GGC GTG TTT CCT-3′ (forward), 5′-GTC GAC TTC CAT GTT TTC AAG GT-3′ (reverse). GCLM, 5′-CCA GGA GTG GGT GCC ACT GT-3′ (forward), 5′-TTT GAC TTG ATG ATT CCT CTG CTT-3′ (reverse). Western Blotting Analysis—Nuclear fractions of cells were prepared as described previously (26Chen Z.H. Hurh Y.J. Na H.K. Kim J.H. Chun Y.J. Kim D.H. Kang K.S. Cho M.H. Surh Y.J. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protein samples were solubilized with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in fresh blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% nonfat dry milk). Dilutions of primary antibodies were made in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the diluted primary antibody. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were again washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 buffer, and the transferred proteins were incubated with ECL solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and visualized on radiographic film. Transfection of siRNA—Rat Nrf2-siRNA was designed and manufactured by Invitrogen, according to the current guidelines for effective knockdown by this method. The target sequences for Nrf2-siRNA are 5′-UUA AGA CAC UGU AAC UCG GGA AUG G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA UUC CCG AFU UAC AGU GUC UUA A-3′ (reverse), the knockdown effect of which has been demonstrated previously (21Chen Z.H. Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Sekine A. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41921-41927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The siRNA was transfected into PC12 cells at a concentration of 20 pmol/105 cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) 24 h prior to further experiments. Statistics—All data of at least three independent experiments are expressed as mean ± S.D. and analyzed by the Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Adaptive Response Induced by 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 in PC12 Cells— To explore the possible adaptive response, the cytotoxicity induced by these compounds was first investigated in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, all of these three compounds, 7α-OHCh, 7β-OHCh, and 15d-PGJ2, induced significant cell death at high concentrations. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with sublethal concentrations of each compound (7-OHCh, 20 μm; 15d-PGJ2, 2.5 or 7.5 μm) significantly protected cells against the oxidative stress induced by 6-OHDA (Fig. 1B), which has been demonstrated to induce oxidative damage in neural system and implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (27Grunblatt E. Mandel S. Youdim M.B. J. Neurol. 2000; 247: 95-102Google Scholar). Effect of 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 on the Intracellular GSH Contents— This interesting adaptive phenomenon led us to explore the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Since we have recently observed the pivotal role of TR1 in 4-HNE-induced adaptive response (21Chen Z.H. Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Sekine A. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41921-41927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we then studied the possible involvement of TR1 in the adaptive response induced by 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2. However, both 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 failed to induce any significant variation on the TR1 activity (data not shown). The intracellular GSH is well known to be essential to antioxidative defense (9Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar); we therefore attempted to study the possible involvement of GSH in the adaptive response. Treatment of either 7-OHCh or 15d-PGJ2 at their sublethal concentrations for 24 h significantly increased the total cellular GSH contents (Fig. 2, A and B). These treatments did not cause any considerable changes on the ratio of oxidized GSSG/total GSH, retaining at ∼6% without much variation (data not shown). Both 7α- and 7β-OHCh at 20 μm induced ∼1.6-fold GSH increases (Fig. 2A), whereas 15d-PGJ2 at 7.5 μm dramatically enhanced the cellular GSH until ∼3-fold (Fig. 2B). We then investigated the time-dependent induction of GSH by 7α-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2. Interestingly, treatment of either 7α-OHCh (20 μm) or 15d-PGJ2 (7.5 μm) significantly reduced the cellular GSH level to ∼80 or 60%, respectively, of the basal level at early time (before 3 h), but the GSH level recovered back thereafter time-dependently, reaching to the final 1.6- or 3-fold, respectively, at 24 h (Fig. 2C). Increased GCL Activity and Subsequent GSH Elevation Were Responsible for the Adaptive Cytoprotection Induced by both 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2—The elevation of the intracellular GSH contents should owe primarily to the augmented GCL activity; we therefore investigated the possible increase in the GCL enzyme activity induced by 7α-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2. The GCL activity was rapidly increased for ∼20% by 7α-OHCh at 3 h, and it held at the same level until 24 h (Fig. 3A). 15d-PGJ2 time-dependently increased the GCL activity, finally with ∼30% elevation at 24 h (Fig. 3A). To further confirm the role of the increased GCL activity and subsequent GSH elevation in the adaptive response, we attempted to explore the effect of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific GCL inhibitor widely used in a variety of cell lines (28Levonen A.L. Dickinson D.A. Moellering D.R. Mulcahy R.T. Forman H.J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Lim S.Y. Jang J.H. Na H.K. Lu S.C. Rahman I. Surh Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46263-46270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Treatment of BSO at even 0.1 μm for 24 h significantly decreased the constitutive GSH level in PC12 cells but without any appreciable cytotoxicity until 10 μm (data not shown). Pretreatment of 0.1 or 1.0 μm BSO together with 7-OHCh or 15d-PGJ2 effectively attenuated (in the case of 0.1 μm BSO) or completely abolished (in the case of 1.0 μm BSO) the adaptive cytoprotection induced by these oxidative stimuli (Fig. 3B), suggesting a pivotal role of the increased GCL activity and subsequent GSH elevation in the adaptive response. Effect of 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 on the Expression of GCL—In most cases, the increased GCL activity must be due principally to the increased GCL gene expression and subsequent enhancement on the GCL proteins; we then investigated the mRNA expression of GCLC and GCLM by these compounds. As expected, 15d-PGJ2 at 7.5 μm induced significant gene expression of both GCL subunits, which both were induced by around 2.5-fold peaked at 6 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Although the gene expression induced by 2.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 was lesser than that by 7.5 μm, it was still significant (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, both 7α- and 7β-OHCh at 20 μm did not induce any considerable mRNA induction of both GCL genes (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting the possible different mechanisms mediated for the increased GCL activity and GSH elevation by 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2. Possible Involvement of Nrf2 in the GSH Elevation and Subsequent Adaptive Response Induced by 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2—The transcription factor Nrf2 has been implicated as the central protein that interacts with the ARE to induce the expression of a cluster of phase II enzymes, including GCL (12Dickinson D.A. Levonen A.L. Moellering D.R. Arnold E.K. Zhang H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1152-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); we therefore studied the possible involvement of Nrf2 in the GSH elevation and subsequent adaptive response induced by 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2. The nuclear Nrf2 level was rapidly accumulated by the treatment of 15d-PGJ2 but not by 7α-OHCh (Fig. 5A). In cells treated with Nrf2-siRNA, the 15d-PGJ2-induced gene expression of GCL was significantly attenuated (Fig. 5, B and C). As a consequence, the enhanced GSH induced by 15d-PGJ2 was markedly decreased by the Nrf2-siRNA treatment (Fig. 5D). However, it only slightly, but not significantly, decreased the 7-OHCh-induced GSH elevation (Fig. 5D). Moreover, in such Nrf2-siRNA-treated cells, 15d-PGJ2 at 2.5 μm failed to induce any adaptive response, whereas both 7α- and 7β-OHCh still induced significant adaptive cytoprotection, although the protective effect was smaller than that in the normal cells (Fig. 5E). 15d-PGJ2 at 7.5 μm also induced adaptive protection in the Nrf2-siRNA-treated cells, but the protective effect was significantly decreased when compared with that in normal cells (data not shown). The essential roles of low levels of H2O2 and related ROS in the cell signal transduction and immuno-defense have been widely accepted (31Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence also suggests that low levels of ROS can induce adaptive response and enhance tolerance in cultured cells (17Seo Y.J. Lee J.W. Lee E.H. Lee H.K. Kim H.W. Kim Y.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1272-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Chen Z.H. Yoshida Y. Saito Y. Niki E. Neurosci.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 909-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Likewise, such roles of some other physiological oxidative stimuli or oxidation products in modulating and participating in signal transduction have received increased attention. For instance, 4-HNE, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed by the reaction of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species with arachidonic acid in cellular membranes during oxidative stress, has now been recognized as a signaling molecule at low concentrations and considered to bridge the fields of oxidative stress and redox signaling (21Chen Z.H.

Similarly, cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which were widely known as apoptogens in a variety of cell types (36Kim I.K. Lee J.H. Sohn H.W. Kim H.S. Kim S.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Zernecke A. Erl W. Fraemohs L. Lietz M. Weber C. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1099-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), now have been reported to show protective effect at low concentrations via different mechanisms (6Mochizuki M. Ishii Y.

Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We have recently found that a variety of lipid peroxidation products induced a general adaptive response in cell cultures (22Chen Z.H. Yoshida Y. Saito Y. Noguchi N. Niki E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and we have successfully demonstrated that the 4-HNE-induced adaptive response in PC12 cells was primarily mediated through induction of TR1 via activation of Nrf2 (21Chen Z.H. Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Sekine A. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41921-41927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); however, the detailed molecular mechanisms mediated for other compounds have not been fully understood. In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that the adaptive response by both 7-OHCh and 15d-PGJ2 in PC12 cells is mediated similarly through the up-regulated GSH but via different mechanisms. Cellular GSH is found in the millimolar range in most cells and is well known to be essential to antioxidative defense, regulation of the cell cycle, and gene expression (9Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The synthesis of GSH from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine is catalyzed sequentially by two ATP-dependent enzymes, the rate-limiting GCL and GSH synthetase (10Lu S.C. Curr. Opi. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In most cases, the elevation of GSH is due principally to the de novo synthesis, and this increased de novo synthesis is owed primarily to the increased synthesis of GCL subunits through a combination of increased transcription and mRNA stability. Genetic sequence analysis and studies with reporter constructs have revealed that both GCLC and GCLM promoters contain many potential cis-acting elements, including consensus recognition sites for binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1), activator protein-2, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and the predominant ARE, with which Nrf2 reacts, thereby inducing the expression of phase II enzymes (12Dickinson D.A. Levonen A.L. Moellering D.R. Arnold E.K. Zhang H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1152-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Due to its reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functional group, 15d-PGJ2 is able to react through the Michael addition reaction with cellular DNA and proteins, including Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), the cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2. This modification of Keap1 results in the liberation and activation of Nrf2, which then translocates into the nucleus and induces the expression of detoxification enzymes. In our present work, we clearly demonstrated the involvement of Nrf2 signaling pathway in the 15d-PGJ2-induced GSH elevation and subsequent adaptive response. Nrf2 was rapidly accumulated in nucleus by the treatment of 15d-PGJ2, which bound to the ARE, thereby up-regulating the expression of detoxifying enzymes, including GCLC and GCLM. It might be noteworthy that the treatment of PC12 cells with Nrf2-siRNA only significantly attenuated, but not completely abolished, the 15d-PGJ2-induced GCL expression and subsequent GSH elevation, suggesting that other transcriptional factors such as AP-1 or NF-κB may also contribute together in regulation of the GCL gene expression in PC12 cells. The effect of BSO demonstrated the pivotal role of the increased GCL activity and GSH elevation in the adaptive response, although it could not completely rule out the role, if minor, of other antioxidants or other antioxidative enzymes. It might be interesting to note that we have recently reported that 4-HNE-induced adaptive response in PC12 cells was mediated critically through TR1 expression via activation of Nrf2 (21Chen Z.H. Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Sekine A. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41921-41927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas in the present study, we demonstrated that the 15d-PGJ2-induced adaptive response was primarily through the Nrf2-mediated GSH elevation. There are probably no fundamentally different mechanisms that 4-HNE and 15d-PGJ2 should have different pathways for inducing the adaptive tolerance in the same cell line. By activating the same Nrf2 signaling pathway, the induction of different detoxifying enzymes may be specific to the different cell types and tissues but should not be specific to the stimulations. The difference in the response pathways in our studies, TR1 for 4-HNE and GSH for 15d-PGJ2, was probably due to the different concentrations used and the different levels of Nrf2 activation. We have also analyzed the time-dependent GSH variation by 4-HNE and found that 4-HNE even at adaptive concentration (15 μm) almost completely depleted the cellular GSH at an earlier time period (data not shown). Thus, although 4-HNE induced marked GCL gene expression (data not shown), the final GSH level at 24 h was not significantly increased when compared with the basal level. On the other hand, 15d-PGJ2 at 7.5 μm did not induce as much TR1 expression as 4-HNE at 15 μm did (data not shown). These findings made it reasonable that the adaptive response induced by 15d-PGJ2 or 4-HNE was mediated through the enhanced GSH or TR1, respectively, which were both induced via activation of Nrf2. Both 7α- and 7β-OHCh did not induce any considerable expression of GCL, whereas they increased the GCL activity and subsequently enhanced the GSH level, suggesting that other possible mechanisms mediated the enzymatic activation of GCL. It has been widely accepted that, in addition to the increased GCL expression, other factors that stimulate cysteine uptake (38Tateishi N. Higashi T. Shinya S. Naruse A. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. 1974; 75: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 39Deneke S.M. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L163-L173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or attenuate the GSH feedback inhibition (40Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would also generally enhance the intracellular GSH concentrations. There is recent evidence that the GCL activity can also be modulated by phosphorylation or nitrosation (41Lu S.C. Kuhlenkamp J. Garcia-Ruiz C. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 42Sun W.M. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It might be noteworthy that cholesterol-5β,6β-epoxide, another cholesterol oxidation product that also induced adaptive response in PC12 cells (22Chen Z.H. Yoshida Y. Saito Y. Noguchi N. Niki E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), did not cause any appreciable variation on the cellular GSH level (data not shown), suggesting that the increased enzyme activity of GCL by 7-OHCh was not due to the cholesterol structure. It should be also interesting to note that, similar to the results of 7-OHCh, we have recently found that U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, also significantly increased the enzyme activity of GCL and subsequently enhanced the GSH level but without any considerable induction of GCL genes in PC12 cells as well. 3Z. Chen and E. Niki, unpublished data. At the present stage, we could not clearly clarify whether the enzymatic activation of GCL by 7-OHCh or U0126 was due to some of the above mentioned mechanisms or some other unknown ones. The further investigation of these mechanisms should provide some constructive information for increasing the GCL activity and consequently enhancing the cellular resistance against oxidative stress. In conclusion, the present study represents an effort to demonstrate that the adaptive response induced by both 15d-PGJ2 and 7-OHCh in PC12 cells was mediated similarly through the elevated GSH contents but via different molecular mechanisms. Treatment of PC12 cells with 15d-PGJ2 leads to a rapid nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which turns to up-regulate the GCL genes, thereby increasing the cellular GSH contents. On the other hand, treatment of 7-OHCh results in an increased GCL enzyme activity and also leads to the elevation of cellular GSH but with neither activation of Nrf2 nor subsequent gene expression of GCL. The adaptive response induced by these compounds eventually enhances the cell tolerance and finally protects cells against the forthcoming oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2098022329,"ERp57 is a thiol oxidoreductase of the endoplasmic reticulum that appears to be recruited to substrates indirectly through its association with the molecular chaperones calnexin and calreticulin. However, its functions in living cells have been difficult to demonstrate. During the biogenesis of class I histocompatibility molecules, ERp57 has been detected in association with free class I heavy chains and, at a later stage, with a large complex termed the peptide loading complex. This implicates ERp57 in heavy chain disulfide formation, isomerization, or reduction as well as in the loading of peptides onto class I molecules. In this study, we show that ERp57 does indeed participate in oxidative folding of the heavy chain. Depletion of ERp57 by RNA interference delayed heavy chain disulfide bond formation, slowed folding of the heavy chain α3 domain, and caused slight delays in the transport of class I molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, heavy chain-β2-microglobulin association kinetics were normal, suggesting that the interaction between heavy chain and β2 -microglobulin does not depend on an oxidized α3 domain. Likewise, the peptide loading complex assembled properly, and peptide loading appeared normal upon depletion of ERp57. These studies demonstrate that ERp57 is involved in disulfide formation in vivo but do not support a role for ERp57 in peptide loading of class I molecules. Interestingly, depletion of another thiol oxidoreductase, ERp72, had no detectable effect on class I biogenesis, consistent with a specialized role for ERp57 in this process.

However, it is distinct from other PDI family members in that it associates noncovalently with the molecular chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) (11Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These chaperones bind preferentially to nonnative glycoproteins bearing monoglucosylated Glc1Man5–9-GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides (12Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It is thought that the ternary complex of ERp57, CNX/CRT, and unfolded glycoprotein enhances the rate of disulfide formation/isomerization by keeping the enzyme in proximity to the substrate. Consistent with this view, the activity of ERp57 toward monoglucosylated glycoprotein substrates is dramatically enhanced in vitro when CNX or CRT is present (10Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERp57 forms mixed disulfide intermediates with model viral glycoproteins in vivo, and these complexes are abrogated when the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides is blocked (14Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Despite these suggestive findings, there is little evidence that ERp57 actually promotes oxidative folding of any protein in living cells. To address the functions of ERp57 in cells, we have been studying the biogenesis of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a system in which interactions with ERp57 are well established. Class I molecules bind to cytosolically derived peptide antigens and subsequently display them at the cell surface, where they are screened by cytotoxic T cells. They consist of a glycosylated transmembrane heavy chain (H chain) with three extracellular domains termed α1, α2, and α3, a soluble subunit termed β2-microglobulin (β2m), and a peptide ligand of 8–10 residues. Assembly of class I molecules begins within the ER, where the nascent H chain binds to the membrane-bound chaperone CNX and, indirectly, to ERp57 (15Paulsson K. Wang P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At this early stage, H chain disulfide bond formation takes place, although the order of formation of the two disulfides within the α2 and α3 domains remains unclear (17Ribaudo R.K. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2935-2944PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of complete disulfide formation is substantially increased upon H chain association with β2m (17Ribaudo R.K. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2935-2944PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang H. Capps G.G. Robinson B.E. Zuniga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22276-22281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Correct disulfide bond formation is crucial, since mutagenesis of cysteines comprising either disulfide results in reduced cell surface expression and defects in peptide loading (19Miyazaki J. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Warburton R.J. Matsui M. Rowland-Jones S.L. Gammon M.C. Katzenstein G.E. Wei T. Edidin M. Zweerink H.J. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Hum. Immunol. 1994; 39: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Once H chain associates with β2m, a peptide loading complex assembles that consists of the class I heterodimer, CNX, or its soluble paralog CRT, ERp57, Bap31, the TAP peptide transporter, and another protein, tapasin. The peptides that bind to class I are primarily generated in the cytosol by the proteasome and are transported into the ER by the TAP transporter. Tapasin serves as a bridge between class I and TAP (21Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Suh W.K. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Fruh K. Wang K. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), thereby placing class I molecules close to the peptide source. In addition, tapasin stabilizes the peptide loading complexes and enhances the loading of high affinity peptides into the class I binding groove (23Momburg F. Tan P. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Upon peptide binding to class I, the loading complex dissociates, thereby permitting fully assembled class I molecules to be exported from the ER to the cell surface, a process that is facilitated in the ER by Bap31 (25Paquet M.E. Cohen-Doyle M. Shore G.C. Williams D.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7548-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Relative to other members of the PDI family, ERp57 appears to enjoy a privileged position in class I biogenesis. ERp57, but not PDI, has been detected in association with both free and β2m-associated H chains and as a component of the peptide loading complex (8Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Farmery M.R. Allen S. Allen A.J. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14933-14938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Lindquist J.A. Hammerling G.J. Trowsdale J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1448-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cresswell and co-workers have demonstrated that between 15 and 80% of the total ERp57 pool can be associated with class I peptide loading complexes and that ERp57 is present exclusively in disulfide linkage to tapasin (28Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The introduction of cysteine mutants in tapasin not only abolishes the formation of the ERp57-tapasin complex but also prevents full oxidation of the class I H chain and impairs the loading of high affinity peptides (29Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Whether these phenotypes are due to the lack of ERp57 or a secondary consequence of the tapasin mutations remains to be determined. These studies have led to suggestions that ERp57 may participate in the oxidative folding of the class I H chain, and, together with tapasin, may make class I molecules more receptive to peptide loading through isomerization of the disulfide bond within the peptide binding groove. In this study, we used RNA interference to reduce the expression of ERp57 as a means to assess its functions in class I biogenesis. We show that in the absence of ERp57, H chain disulfide bond formation and α3 domain folding are substantially delayed, whereas the rate of ER to Golgi transport is slowed only slightly. No effect of ERp57 depletion was observed on the kinetics of H chain-β2m association, assembly of the peptide loading complex, or the loading of peptides onto class I. These findings support a role for ERp57 in H chain disulfide formation but suggest that the ERp57-tapasin disulfide conjugate may not be required for peptide loading. Interestingly, reducing the expression of another ER thiol oxidoreductase, ERp72, was completely without effect on class I biogenesis, consistent with a specialized role for ERp57 in this process and the existence of substrate preferences among different thiol oxidoreductases. Cells and Antibodies—Mouse L cells stably expressing the class I molecules, H-2Kb or H-2Dd, were maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Mouse EL4 cells expressing a truncated version of ovalbumin (residues 253–386; a kind gift of Dr. N. Shastri, University of California Berkeley) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. The following antibodies (Abs) were used in this study: anti-8, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum, which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the Kb molecule encoded by exon-8 (30Smith M.H. Parker J.M. Hodges R.S. Barber B.H. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); monoclonal antibody (mAb) 34-2-12S, which recognizes the foldedα3 domain of Dd molecules with an intact disulfide bond (17Ribaudo R.K.

Nature. 1981; 292: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); and mAb 25-D1-16, which is specific for Kb molecules complexed with the ovalbumin-derived peptide SIINFEKL (34Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1997; 6: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-tapasin antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of murine tapasin and anti-CNX antiserum raised against the ER luminal domain of dog CNX have been described previously (35Danilczyk U.G. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25532-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Suh W.K. Derby M.A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Schoenhals G.J. Fruh K. Berzofsky J.A. Williams D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1530-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-ERp57 antiserum was raised against glutathione S-transferase-fused mouse ERp57. The anti-glutathione S-transferase antibodies were removed by adsorption to glutathione S-transferase-agarose prior to use. Anti-CRT antiserum (SPA-600), anti-ERp72 antiserum (SPA-720), and anti-PDI antiserum (SPA-891) were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Rabbit anti-actin antiserum was purchased from Sigma. Anti-CaBP1 antiserum was the generous gift of Dr. D. Ferrari (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen, Germany). RNA Interference and Transfections—Two double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to mouse ERp57 DNA sequences AGCCAGCAACTTGAGAGATAA (siRNA 1) and AAGAGGCTTGCCCCTGAGTAT (siRNA 2) were synthesized and annealed by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). siRNA 2 was fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled to facilitate measurement of transfection efficiency. siRNA targeting mouse ERp72 (AAGCAGTTTGCTCCAGAATAT) and nontargeting control siRNA (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) were also purchased from Qiagen. Eighteen hours before transfection, 1 × 105 mouse L cells expressing H-2Kb or H-2Dd were seeded into 6-well dishes. siRNAs were transfected into the cells using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a final siRNA concentration of 40 nm. Cells were transfected for 4 days before assays were performed. For mouse EL4 TO cells, ERp57 siRNA was premixed with solution T included in the Nucleofector kit T (final siRNA concentration of 240 nm), and 6 × 105 cells were transfected with the Nucleofector device using parameter O17 (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 in the presence of siRNA for 3 days before being assessed for surface expression of Kb-SIINFEKL peptide complexes. For all RNA interference experiments, ∼1 × 105 siRNA-transfected cells were used to assess the efficiency of protein knockdown by Western blot. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and probed with the appropriate antiserum. Detection was performed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Radiolabeling and Immunoisolation—Pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments with siRNA-transfected L cells expressing either Kb or Dd molecules were performed in 35-mm plates. Cells were starved for 30 min with methionine-free RPMI 1640 and pulse-labeled for 2 min with 0.5 ml of medium containing 0.1 mCi of [35S]Met (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then washed with Met-free RPMI 1640 and chased for various periods in DMEM containing 1 mm Met and 500 μm cycloheximide. After washing for 3 min in cold PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), lysis was conducted in 500 μl of PBS, pH 6.8, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NEM, and protease inhibitors (60 μg/ml 2-aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (BioShop, Burlington, Canada)). Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g to remove nuclei and cell debris, the supernatant fraction was incubated on ice for 2 h with either anti-8 or 20-8-4S Ab for Kb and either 34-2-12S or 34-5-8S Ab for Dd. Immune complexes were recovered by shaking for 1 h with 30 μl of packed protein A-agarose beads. Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer from the beads and analyzed either by nonreducing or reducing SDS-PAGE (10% gel) followed by fluorography. Films were scanned using an EPSON 1680 scanner and were quantified using NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health). In all cases, backgrounds were subtracted by quantifying a blank area of the film corresponding in size to that of the gel band of interest. In experiments to assess the formation of the peptide loading complex, cells were radiolabeled for 45 min with [35S]Met, washed in cold PBS containing 20 mm NEM, and lysed in digitonin lysis buffer (1% digitonin in PBS, pH 6.8, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors). The lysate was incubated with anti-tapasin antiserum for 2 h. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-agarose and then washed twice with 0.2% digitonin in PBS, pH 6.8, before elution and analysis by SDS-PAGE. For class I ER to Golgi transport assays, Kb and Dd molecules were immunoisolated with anti-8 and 34-2-12S Ab, respectively, as described above and then were eluted from protein A beads with 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 6, containing 0.1% SDS and digested with 2 units of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 2 h prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Flow Cytometry Analysis—To assess the cell surface levels of class I molecules, 3–5 × 105 cells were trypsinized from culture dishes and incubated with mouse anti-class I mAbs (1.5 μg of mAb Y3 for Kb or mAb 34-5-8S for Dd) in 100 μl of culture medium for 20 min on ice. After incubation, cells were washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% NaN3) and then incubated with 0.4 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L chain-specific, Cedarlane, Hornby, Canada) in 100 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and then fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. Subsequent flow cytometry was performed using an EPICS Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). For analysis of the turnover kinetics of cell surface class I molecules, Kb -or Dd-expressing L cells were incubated for 18 h at 26 °C in DMEM containing 10 μg/ml human β2m (Sigma). Human β2m-containing DMEM was then replaced with prewarmed DMEM containing 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma), and cells were transferred to a 37 °C incubator. Cells (3–5 × 105) were removed at the indicated time points and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Kb-SIINFEKL complexes on the surface of EL4 TO cells were measured by flow cytometry using mAb 25-D1-16. The SIINFEKL peptide loading efficiency was expressed as the Kb-SIINFEKL level divided by the surface Kb level (as detected with mAb Y3). Quantification of Interferon α and β mRNAs—L cells expressing Kb molecules were either untransfected or transfected with control siRNA, siRNA targeting ERp57, and siRNA targeting ERp72. Cells were harvested after 12 h, and total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Digestion of contaminating DNA was performed using Fermentas DNaseI according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA in the presence of random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For quantitative PCR, reaction components were obtained from the LightCycler® FastStart DNA Master SYBR GreenPLUS I kit (Roche Applied Science). The LightCycler® instrument (Roche Applied Science) and corresponding software was used for all reactions. The following reaction conditions were used: preincubation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for interferon (IFN)-β, 65 °C for IFN-α2, and 60 °C for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) for 5 s, 72 °C for 10 s, melting curve analysis at 95 °C for 0 s, 65 °C for 15 s, and a continuous acquisition mode of 95 °C with a temperature transition rate of 0.1 °C/s. The PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1× Master SYBR GreenPLUS I buffer, 20 pmol of HPRT and IFN-β primers, 10 pmol of IFN-α2 primers, and 5 μl of template cDNA (concentration 100 ng/μl). The following primer sets were used: for IFN-α2, 5′-AAAGGGGAGCCTCCTCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTTTCCTCGTGATGCTGA-3′ (reverse); for IFN-β, 5′-ACACAAGCTTAACCACCATGAACAACAGGTGGATCCTCCACGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTAGGAATTCTCAGTTTTGGAAGTTTCTGGTAAGTCTTCG-3′ (reverse); and for HPRT, 5′-CAAGCTTGCTGGTGAAAAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGGGCATATC-3′ (reverse). Standard curves for IFN-α2, IFN-β, and HPRT were established using serial dilutions of template cDNA in triplicate in the RelQuant software (Roche Applied Science). Levels of IFN-α2, IFN-β, and HPRT mRNA were calculated based on these established standard curves, and the amounts of IFN-α2 and IFN-β mRNA were normalized to the amount of HPRT in each sample. All samples were analyzed in triplicate. Delayed H Chain Disulfide Bond Formation Is Observed upon Depletion of ERp57 but Not ERp72—To study the function of ERp57 in the process of class I biogenesis, we reduced the expression of ERp57 in L cells expressing the class I H-2Kb molecule by transfecting with 21-bp siRNAs. Following a 4-day transfection with siRNA 1, greater than 90% of ERp57 was depleted (Fig. 1A). No expression differences were observed for several other proteins, including CNX or the thiol oxidoreductases ERp72, PDI, and CaBP1. As a control to assess the effect of reducing the expression of a thiol oxidoreductase not previously implicated in class I biogenesis, we performed a similar experiment using siRNA directed against ERp72. Again, the level of ERp72 was reduced by >90% with no effects on the expression of ERp57 or several other proteins (Fig. 1B). Based on previous studies suggesting an interaction of ERp57 with free class I H chains (8Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Lindquist J.A. Hammerling G.J. Trowsdale J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1448-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we anticipated that this enzyme might participate in H chain disulfide formation. Consequently, the effect of ERp57 depletion on H chain disulfide bond formation was monitored in a pulse-chase experiment. After transfecting with ERp57 siRNA 1 or with control siRNA, L cells expressing the class I H-2Kb molecule were radiolabeled for 2 min with [35S]Met and chased in medium containing unlabeled Met and cycloheximide for periods of up to 30 min. Kb molecules were recovered from cell lysates with anti-8, an antiserum that reacts with free or β2m-associated Kb H chains. Isolated Kb H chains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions to allow resolution of species containing zero, one, or two disulfide bonds. The results show that disulfide bond formation was substantially slowed in the absence of ERp57 (Fig. 2A, top; quantified in Fig. 2B, siRNA 1). In control cells, 50% of H chains acquired both disulfide bonds by ∼2 min of chase, whereas in ERp57-depleted cells, the rate was 9-fold slower, with 50% of H chains acquiring both disulfide bonds by 18 min of chase. In this experiment, no zero-disulfide bond species was detected, possibly because the first disulfide bond formed co-translationally and therefore was already present following the 2-min pulse. To confirm these results, the same experiment was performed using siRNA 2, which targets a different region of the ERp57 mRNA (Fig. 2A, middle). In this case, the rate of H chain disulfide formation was slowed 11-fold upon depletion of ERp57 (quantified in Fig. 2B, siRNA 2). The half-time for acquisition of both disulfide bonds was ∼2 min in control cells versus 22 min in ERp57-depleted cells. In experiments testing the effect of ERp57 siRNA 2 on various control proteins, it was noted that this siRNA caused a ∼50% reduction of ERp72 expression in addition to the depletion of ERp57 (data not shown). However, this “off-target” depletion of ERp72 by siRNA 2 did not contribute to the observed slower H chain oxidation, since knockdown of ERp72 expression alone by >90% had no significant effect on H chain oxidation (Fig. 2A, bottom; quantified in Fig. 2B). The lack of effect due to ERp72 depletion, coupled with previous studies showing a lack of PDI interaction during class I biogenesis (26Farmery M.R. Allen S. Allen A.J. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14933-14938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggests that ERp57 may be the preferred thiol oxidoreductase promoting oxidative class I H chain folding. ERp57 Is Required for α3 Domain Folding but Not for H Chain-β2m Association—As an independent means to assess the involvement of ERp57 in H chain disulfide formation, the folding rate of the H chain α3 domain of class I H-2Dd molecules was assessed using mAb 34-2-12S. This antibody only recognizes Dd molecules that have a folded α3 domain with an intact disulfide bond (17Ribaudo R.K. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2935-2944PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, L cells expressing D molecules were transfected with ERp57 siRNA 1 or control siRNA and subjected to pulse-chase radiolabeling, and cell lysates were immunoisolated with mAb 34-2-12S. In contrast to cells treated with control siRNA, the α3 domain epitope formed more slowly when ERp57 expression was reduced by RNA interference (Fig. 3A, top). Whereas the t½ for epitope formation was ∼2 min in control cells, it was 8-fold slower in ERp57-depleted cells (t½ siRNA 1 = 16 min) (Fig. 3B). This finding was confirmed using ERp57 siRNA 2, for which a 9-fold slower rate of epitope formation was observed relative to control cells (Fig. 3A, middle; quantified in Fig. 3B). The observed slower α3 domain folding was not due to simultaneous partial depletion of ERp72 by siRNA 2, since ERp72 depletion alone had no effect (Fig. 3A, bottom). In con"

https://openalex.org/W1996506131,"Antizyme inhibitor (AzI) is a homolog of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme of polyamine synthesis. Antizyme inhibitor retains no enzymatic activity, but exhibits high affinity to antizyme (Az), a negative regulator of polyamine homeostasis. As polyamines are involved in maintaining cellular proliferation, and since AzI may negate Az functions, we have investigated the role of AzI in regulating cell growth. We show here that overexpression of AzI in NIH3T3 cells increased growth rate, enabled growth in low serum, and permitted anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, while reduction of AzI levels by AzI siRNA reduced cellular proliferation. Moreover, AzI overproducing cells gave rise to tumors when injected into nude mice. AzI overexpression resulted in elevation of ODC activity and of polyamine uptake. These effects of AzI are a result of its ability to neutralize Az, as overexpression of an AzI mutant with reduced Az binding failed to alter cellular polyamine metabolism and growth properties. We also demonstrate upregulation of AzI in Ras transformed cells, suggesting its relevance to some naturally occurring transformations. Finally, increased uptake activity rendered AzI overproducing and Ras-transformed cells more sensitive to toxic polyamine analogs. Our results therefore imply that AzI has a central and meaningful role in modulation of polyamine homeostasis, and in regulating cellular proliferation and transformation properties."

Solution NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize sites of interaction between Hsp90 and p23. Titration of p23 with Hsp90 results in the selective broadening of certain cross-peaks in the 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum. The interaction sites on p23 and Hsp90 have been localized by dissection of Hsp90 into single-domain and two-domain constructs. The N-terminal (N) domain of Hsp90 does not affect the NMR spectrum of p23 either in the presence or absence of the ATP analogue ATPγS. Similarly, the HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled N domain is unperturbed by the addition of p23. A subset of cross-peaks in the HSQC spectrum of p23 is shifted upon addition of the middle (M) domain of Hsp90, and the same shifts are observed upon the addition of the two-domain construct containing the N and M domains (NM). The addition of the co-chaperone Aha1, which is known to bind to the M domain of Hsp90, displaces p23 from Hsp90. The resonances that shift upon addition of the M and NM Hsp90 constructs correspond to those that were broadened at the lowest ratios of full-length Hsp90 to p23 and define an Hsp90 binding site that includes much of the C-terminal sequence of p23 together with a contiguous β-hairpin from the N terminus.

We conclude that p23 forms a specific complex with Hsp90 primarily through binding to its middle domain. The 90-kDa heat shock protein Hsp90 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that is present in abundance in eukaryotic cells (∼1-2% of cytosolic protein) (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr.

The protein is found as a homodimer; the monomer unit consists of three domains, the N-terminal domain (N), a middle domain (M), and a C-terminal dimerization domain (C) (Fig. 1A). The N domain has been associated with the weak ATPase activity of Hsp90 and may also be involved in co-chaperone and client protein binding. The M domain has been postulated as a major site of client protein binding but also influences the ATPase activity. In eukaryotic Hsp90s, the N and M domains are separated by a charged linker sequence of ∼60 residues; this segment is absent in prokaryotes. A popular model for Hsp90 action states that the binding of ATP or inhibitors causes conformational changes that influence the binding of clients and co-chaperones and may (4Prodromou C. Panaretou B.

Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1087-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and of a two-domain construct (N+M) of HtpG, the Escherichia coli analogue of Hsp90 (17Huai Q. Wang H. Liu Y. Kim H.Y. Toft D. Ke H. Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 579-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), have been reported. Hsp90 interacts with a number of client proteins, including steroid hormone receptors, kinases, and polymerases (18Wegele H. Muller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Steroid hormone receptors have been found to exist in long-lived complexes with Hsp90 and co-chaperones (particularly p23 and immunophilins) in the absence of steroid ligand (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). A number of co-chaperones are involved in the function of Hsp90, and new co-chaperones are constantly being identified. The literature consensus at present is that the association of co-chaperones with Hsp (Hsc)70 and Hsp90 determines the client specificity of these chaperone systems. Yet, for even the best known and most extensively studied co-chaperones, we are only beginning to understand their specific role in the function of Hsp90 and the structural basis for this interaction. For example, the structure of the complex between the stress-related co-chaperone Aha1 and Hsp90 was recently reported (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but no such structural studies have been reported on the p23-Hsp90 interaction. In recent years, interest in the Hsp90 system has increased exponentially, as the potential of Hsp90 inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, as anti-cancer agents has been recognized. Nevertheless, there remain a number of unresolved questions about the molecular mechanisms of Hsp90-mediated processes, and contradictory experimental evidence abounds in this field. For example, early in vitro studies implicated Hsp90 in ATP-mediated binding and chaperoning of unfolded proteins (19Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), but this activity has yet to be demonstrated in vivo, where Hsp90 interacts with specific client proteins after they have apparently attained a degree of tertiary structure (20Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 157-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 is the site of ATP binding (9Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar), the isolated N domain has no detectable ATPase activity (10Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The M domain is thought to contribute to the ATPase activity by conformational restriction of the γ-phosphate of ATP, which is disordered in the N domain/ATP structures; the crystal structure of the M domain contains a potential catalytic loop distantly homologous to those found in structurally related proteins (14Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this loop shows a number of different conformations in crystallographically independent copies of the M domain (14Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), an indication that it may be mobile in the absence of the N domain and ATP. The crystal structure of the yeast Hsp90 middle domain complexed with the N-terminal domain of the co-chaperone Aha1 (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) indicates a probable role for Aha1 in stabilizing a conformation of this catalytic loop that facilitates ATP hydrolysis. There is a complicated relationship between ATP hydrolysis, client protein binding, and co-chaperone interactions. One suggested sequence of events is: (i) binding of client protein to an “open” form of the Hsp90 dimer, (ii) binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain, (iii) transient dimerization of the N-terminal domain, clamping the client protein inside, (iv) binding and assistance of co-chaperones, forming a multichaperone complex (reviewed in Ref. 3Terasawa K. Minami M. Minami Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Other recent studies focus on the role of bound ATP in increasing the affinity of Hsp90 for client proteins (5McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the effects of bound client protein and p23 on the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (21McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The role of p23 remains confusing; it has been suggested that it binds to both the N-and C-terminal domains of Hsp90 and that binding requires the presence of ATP analogues (22Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). One study concluded that the role of p23 was to stabilize the interaction between Hsp90 and the client protein (23Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), whereas others appear to implicate p23 in client protein release after ATP hydrolysis (24Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both the N and M domains of Hsp90 have been implicated in the binding of p23 (25Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Using NMR, we have examined the interactions of p23 with Hsp90 and its isolated domains in solution. We have found that p23 binds to full-length Hsp90, but does not bind to the isolated N-terminal domain either in the presence or absence of an ATP analogue. Instead, p23 binds via a specific binding site to the M domain either as an isolated domain or in two-domain constructs containing the N and M domains or the M and C domains. In addition, p23 can be displaced from the Hsp90 complex by the addition of the co-chaperone Aha1, which has been shown to bind to the M domain (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The p23 constructs p23-(1-160) and p23-(1-119) were amplified by PCR from a human liver cDNA library and cloned into the expression vector pET21a. p23 constructs were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli BL21 DE3 (DNAY) grown in M9 minimal medium with overnight induction at 15 °C. Cell pellets from p23 cultures were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm DTT, 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylylamidodiphosphate; CD, circular dichroism. 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the soluble protein was purified on HiTrapQ ion exchange columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Bound p23-(1-160) was eluted from the Q column with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing p23-(1-160) were pooled and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S100 HR XK16 column in 10 mm Tris, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl. Protein yields were ∼50 mg/liter for p23-(1-160) and ∼17 mg/liter for p23-(1-119). Full-length Hsp90 was prepared by expression in E. coli. Clones for human and chicken Hsp90 were obtained from Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). In our hands, the chicken protein showed a slightly greater expression level, and it was therefore chosen for further experiments. Chicken Hsp90 is 91% identical to human Hsp90α over the entire protein sequence. Full-length chicken Hsp90 was prepared by a modification of the published method (27Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in minimal medium in the host BL21 DE3 pLysS with induction at 15 °C for 12-20 h. Cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT by sonication and the soluble fraction applied to a 60-ml Sepharose Q FF column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. Full-length Hsp90 was eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m KCl and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Hsp90 was applied to a 40-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient to 0.5 m KCl. The protein was concentrated in a Centriprep10 centrifugal filter device (Amicon) and purified by gel filtration chromatography on an 180-ml Sephacryl S200HR XK16 column in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 200 mm KCl. Hsp90 (yield ∼5 mg/l minimal medium) was concentrated and exchanged by dialysis into 10 mm Tris, pH 6.9, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT for NMR. Constructs for the N-terminal domain (N domain, residues 1-234), middle domain (M domain, residues 290-550), N terminus plus middle domains (NM construct, residues 1-550), and middle plus C-terminal domains (MC construct, residues 290-728) of chicken Hsp90α and the N-terminal region of Aha1 (human residues 1-162) were cloned into the T7 expression vector pET15b (Novagen), which introduces an N-terminal His tag and thrombin cleavage site into the expressed protein. All truncated Hsp90 constructs and Aha1-(1-162) were expressed in BL21 DE3 (DNAY) with induction at 15 °C for 12-20 h. Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm KCl, and 20 mm imidazole, and the soluble fraction of the cell lysate was purified by metal affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). His-tagged proteins were eluted with 180 mm imidazole and then purified by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA using a linear gradient to 1 m KCl. The protein constructs were further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S100HR column (2.6 × 65 cm) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. All His-tagged Hsp90 constructs were expressed exclusively as soluble proteins. The N, M, and NM constructs appear to be monomeric by gel filtration chromatography, whereas the MC and full-length constructs are dimeric. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR sample concentration for p23 was ∼0.3 mm in 0.5 ml of NMR buffer at pH 6.8 (p23-(1-119)) or 7.0 (p23-(1-160)) containing 95% H2O/5% D2O or 99.99% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 20 °C on Bruker DRX600, AVANCE 800, and AVANCE 900 spectrometers. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Guang Z. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (29Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 604-613Crossref Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Backbone resonance assignments were made using HNCA, HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB and HCA(CO)CANH spectra. Side chain assignments were made using three-dimensional 15N total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra and three-dimensional HCCH-COSY. Resonance assignments for p23 have been deposited in the Biomagnetic Resonance data bank (accession codes 6973 and 6974). For NMR binding studies, p23, Aha, and Hsp90 constructs were concentrated and dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, pH 6.9, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were collected with 5-10 μm protein in 3 mm Tris, pH 8, at 25 °C in a 0.2-cm cell using an Aviv Model 202 CD spectrometer. Design and Characterization of p23 Constructs—To explore the conformational preference of the C-terminal tail of p23, as well as to confirm the structure of the N-terminal domain as delineated in the x-ray crystal structure (30Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), two p23 constructs of different lengths were prepared, p23-(1-119) (encompassing the folded domain) and p23-(1-160) (the complete protein). The amino acid sequence of human p23 is shown in Fig. 1B aligned with a number of p23 sequences from eukaryotic organisms, including yeast and fungi. Only 10 residues are identical among all of these organisms (W8, R11, P61, K79, W86, L89, K95, F103, W106, and D108), although many others form highly homologous sets. In particular, the p23 sequences of the higher eukaryotes exhibit nearly total identity, even in the C-terminal sequence (Fig. 1B). The CD spectra of human p23-(1-119) and p23-(1-160) are unusual (Fig. 2A). The CD spectra, which are similar to published spectra (31Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), are consistent with β-structure in the N-terminal domain together with an unstructured region at the C terminus (shown by the increase in the negative ellipticity at 202 nm for p23-(1-160). The positive ellipticity at ∼230 nm is due to the high proportion of tryptophan residues (a total of 5) in the protein. A comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled p23-(1-119) and p23-(1-160) (Fig. 3) confirms that the N-terminal domain is folded and the C-terminal acidic tail is unfolded. There are very few cross-peaks that differ significantly between the two constructs. These differences mostly arise for histidines and for those residues, such as Cys-75, that are in close proximity to histidine side chains in the folded N-terminal domain and are thus consistent with the slight pH difference between the solutions used for the two spectra. These results confirm that the presence of the C-terminal sequence neither influences the structure of the N-terminal domain nor makes specific contacts with it. An x-ray structure has been published for the N-terminal domain (residues 1-110) of p23 (30Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structure consists of a β-sandwich, formed of 5-strand and 3-strand β-sheets. Examination of the three-dimensional 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effect spectrum of p23-(1-119) reveals that the β-sheet structure of p23 is the same in solution as it is in the crystal. A map of the cross-strand NOEs observed in the nuclear Overhauser effect spectrum confirms the presence of the two β-sheets of the β-sandwich. Design and Characterization of Hsp90 Constructs—Hsp90 is a homodimer of two 728-residue polypeptides, each with three domains, N, M, and C (Fig. 1A). The CD spectra of the isolated N and M domains (Fig. 2B) and the two-domain NM and MC constructs (Fig. 2C) indicate that all four proteins are folded. The 15N HSQC spectra of the single domains (Fig. 4) show that both the N and M domains are well folded in solution. The N domain is extremely well behaved, and shows no evidence for association in solution, either in the presence or absence of added ATP analogue ATPγS. The HSQC spectrum of the N domain shows changes upon the addition of ATPγS, consistent with binding of this ATP analogue to the Hsp90 N domain, and similar to the results of NMR studies of the N domain of yeast Hsp90 binding to ADP or to the ATP analogue AMP-PNP (32Dehner A. Furrer J. Richter K. Schuster I. Buchner J. Kessler H. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The M domain is also well behaved under NMR conditions but exhibits a propensity to aggregate at concentrations >500 μm. The 15N HSQC spectrum of the NM construct (not shown) is consistent with a homogeneous, folded protein, but is dominated by extremely high intensity cross-peaks arising from the charged linker between the N and M domains. The 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of the MC construct (not shown) shows broad resonances, consistent with the presence of a homodimer of ∼880 (440 × 2) residues. Interaction of p23 with Hsp90—The addition of full-length Hsp90 to p23 in the presence or absence of ATPγS results in broadening of the NMR signals in the HSQC spectrum, consistent with the binding of a large dimeric partner (Fig. 5A). As Hsp90 is titrated into the solution of 15N-labeled p23-(1-160) or p23-(1-119), certain resonances, such as Gly-83 and Lys-107, are found to broaden even at the lowest Hsp90 concentration, whereas others, including those assigned to the C-terminal tail, remain visible even at the highest Hsp90 concentration. The resonances of several of the tryptophan side chains show small shifts at low concentrations of Hsp90 before being broadened beyond detection at higher Hsp90 concentrations. This is also true of some of the backbone amides, such as those of Asp-111 and Val-15. Interaction of p23 with Domains of Hsp90—Complex formation between p23 and Hsp90 was shown to depend on the presence of ATP (33Sullivan W.P. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45942-45948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the binding site for p23 has therefore been assumed to be to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90, which contains the major ATP binding site. However, there is no published structural evidence that this is so. To define more precisely the sites of interaction of p23 and Hsp90, the one- and two-domain constructs of Hsp90 were added to labeled samples of p23, and unlabeled samples of p23 were added to 15N-labeled samples of the Hsp90 N and M domains and the NM construct. No effect was observed on the spectrum of 15N-labeled p23 upon the addition of the N domain construct, either in the presence (data not shown) or absence (Fig. 6B) of ATPγS. Similarly, no effect was observed on the spectrum of 15N-labeled N domain upon the addition of p23 (data not shown). However, specific concentration-dependent changes in the spectrum of p23 were observed upon the addition of the M domain (Fig. 5B). The NMR spectrum of p23 is affected in almost identical ways by the addition of the NM construct (Fig. 6A), and these resonances correspond to those that are preferentially broadened and/or shifted upon the addition of full-length Hsp90 (Fig. 5A). The magnitudes of the chemical shift changes and resonance broadening observed in the presence of the NM construct are the same with and without the ATP homologue ATPγS (Fig. 6A). A comparison of the changes caused by addition of the N, M, and NM constructs in a portion of the HSQC spectrum of p23 is shown in Fig. 6B. Competition between p23 and Aha1 for Binding to the Hsp90 Middle Domain—Aha1, a stress-related co-chaperone of Hsp90, has been relatively well characterized in its interactions with Hsp90 (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Panaretou B. Siligardi G.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1307-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In particular, the N-terminal domain of Aha1 has been shown to bind to the middle domain of Hsp90, and the interaction has been structurally characterized (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The co-chaperones Aha1 and p23 bind Hsp90 with similar affinities; the dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding of Aha1 to yeast Hsp90 in the presence of the ATP analogue AMP-PNP has been reported as 0.7 μm (34Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P. Maloney A. Sullivan J.K. Singh S. Millson S.H. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Cramer R. Mollapour M. Workman P. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1307-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), whereas the Kd values for p23 binding to human Hsp90β·AMP-PNP and the yeast p23 analogue Sba1 to yeast Hsp90·AMP-PNP are 1.5 and 1.75 μm, respectively (26McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 35Siligardi G. Hu B.

As shown above (Fig. 5B), certain resonances in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of p23 are shifted by the addition of the unlabeled M domain. Addition of unlabeled Aha1 (1-162) to this mixture (Fig. 6C) causes the p23 cross-peaks to return to chemical shifts coincident with the unbound state. The same result was obtained upon the addition of Aha1 to mixtures of 15N-labeled p23 with full-length Hsp90 or the two-domain constructs NM and MC, indicating that the p23 binding site in all Hsp90 constructs overlaps with that of Aha1. This result is consistent with previous gel filtration analyses of yeast Hsp90, Aha1, and Sba1 mixtures (36Harst A. Lin H. Obermann W.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Localization of the Binding Site of Hsp90 on p23—The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of p23 shows differential broadening and shift of some cross-peaks upon the addition of full-length Hsp90. The residues that show changes are mapped onto the structure of p23 (30Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in Fig. 7A. The changes in the 15N HSQC spectrum of p23 with the addition of the one- and two-domain parts of Hsp90 are consistent with specific binding to a well defined region at the tip of the p23 structure (Fig. 7B) that is completely consistent with the region affected by full-length Hsp90 (Fig. 7A). The binding site is shown in Fig. 7B to encompass a face of the folded portion of p23 that includes several of the conserved tryptophan side chains. This is reflected, for example, in the shifts of the indole NH resonances of these side chains (Figs. 5 and 6). Much of the sequence between residues 100-112 appears to be affected by Hsp90 binding, and some of the most significant effects are observed on Asp-111, which was undefined in the x-ray coordinates. The surface of p23 that interacts with Hsp90 has no unusual charge or hydrophobicity characteristics. The surface contains a number of charged side chains, including negative charges at positions 13, 81, 108, and 110 and positive charges at positions 11, 88, and 107. These charged side chains form a cap over the tryptophan side chains of the interaction site (Trp-8, -86, -106, and -109). Some of these residues are conserved, not only within the eukaryotic p23 sequences, but even to quite distantly related sequences such as yeast Sba1 and human Sgt1 (Fig. 1). The tryptophans show the most consistent sequence identity, with Trp-8 and -86 completely conserved throughout the entire set shown in Fig. 1. Trp-106 is conserved in p23 and Sba1, and Trp-109 is conserved only in higher eukaryotes. A concentration of negatively charged residues in the region 108-112 (human numbering) is common to all sequences except Sgt1, and the prominent presence of this region of the sequence in the Hsp90 binding site identified by NMR is an indication that a negative charge is likely required for binding by p23 (although not apparently for Sgt1). The fact that the crystal structure (30Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is undefined for residues after 110 may be an indication that this region is not well structured in the free p23 but becomes less mobile in the Hsp90 complex. Localization of the p23 Binding Site on Hsp90—It was previously thought that p23 interacted exclusively with the nucleotide-bound state of Hsp90 (22Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, recent results show that human p23 binds, albeit ∼10-fold more weakly, to nucleotide-free Hsp90, as well as to the Hsp90·AMP-PNP complex, as measured by calorimetry or surface plasmon resonance (26McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Conformational changes resulting from both binding of nucleotide and N-terminal domain dimerization are thought to enhance the affinity of p23 for Hsp90 (26McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 35Siligardi G. Hu B. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51989-51998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As a complement to these studies, we present the first structural characterization of the interaction site between p23 and Hsp90. The spectral changes that result from the addition of p23 to the Hsp90 N and M domain constructs show unequivocally that the primary binding site for p23 is the middle domain of Hsp90. This result is consistent with previous mapping and mutagenesis studies indicating that the Hsp90 middle domain is required for binding of p23 (25Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Siligardi G. Hu B. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51989-51998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our NMR studies indicate no requirement for the presence of ATPγS, as evidenced by lack of change in line width or chemical shift, for any of the interactions of p23 with Hsp90, either full-length or its fragments. However, an enhancement in affinity due to nucleotide binding would be difficult to measure by this method, especially for the larger complexes, because of resonance broadening. Effect of p23 on Hsp90 ATPase Activity—The co-chaperones Aha1 and p23 have opposite effects on the ATPase activity of Hsp90. Although Aha1 enhances the ATPase activity ∼12-fold, p23 inhibits Hsp90 ATPase activity (34Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P. Maloney A. Sullivan J.K. Singh S. Millson S.H. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Cramer R. Mollapour M. Workman P. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 342: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that p23 “locks” Hsp90 in a nucleotide-bound state that has high affinity for client proteins (26McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results give insight into this suggestion. The crystal structure of the complex between Aha1 and the middle domain of yeast Hsp90 shows an extensive contact surface between the two proteins (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p23 uses a smaller surface to bind Hsp90. Under solution NMR conditions, Aha1-(1-162) displaces p23 from complexes with full-length or truncated Hsp90 constructs. Previous mapping studies have implicated the N-terminal α-β-α and part of the α-coil regions of the Hsp90 middle domain as necessary for p23 binding (25Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This region of the Hsp90 middle domain contains residues that contact the N-terminal domain as well as a conformationally flexible loop (residues 370-390) implicated in ATPase activity. Residues of Aha1 that contact this loop in the Hsp90 middle domain are required for enhancement of the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (15Meyer P. Prodromou C. Liao C. Hu B. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Vlasic I. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism for p23 inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity consistent with these observations is that p23 binds the Hsp90 middle domain in the region of the catalytic loop, perhaps locking the flexible loop in a conformation where it is unavailable to assist in orienting the phosphate group for hydrolysis. Role of the C-terminal Tail—The role of the C-terminal ∼45 residues of p23 remains obscure. It remains highly flexible and unstructured according to the NMR spectra under all conditions tested. We have been unable to demonstrate any detectable influence of peptides, unfolded protein sequences or folded proteins, including Hsp90, on the spectrum of this region of the protein. In terms of the interaction of Hsp90 with p23, it is clear that the C-terminal tail has no influence at all, because the spectral changes that accompany the addition of Hsp90 or its fragments are identical for p23-(1-160) and p23-(1-119). Sequence conservation of this region is lower than for other regions of the protein (Fig. 1B), although it retains a high proportion of sequence identity between higher eukaryotes. This region of the protein is highly negatively charged and also contains in all species many of the sequence markers for natively unfolded proteins (38Obradovic Z. Peng K. Vucetic S. Radivojac P. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2003; 53: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It appears likely that the C-terminal tail has a function related to its flexible and negatively charged nature, perhaps as a “fly casting” (39Shoemaker B.A. Portman J.J. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8868-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) lure for partner proteins or possibly in a nonspecific but charge-facilitated interaction with other chaperones, co-chaperones, or client proteins. A recent report implicates the C-terminal tail of p23 in cell-death response in the endoplasmic reticulum (40Rao R.V. Niazi K. Mollahan P. Mao X. Crippen D. Poksay K.S. Chen S. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2005; Google Scholar). Examination of the interaction of Hsp90 with the co-chaperone p23 by NMR titrations of full-length and one- and two-domain constructs of Hsp90 reveal that p23 interacts with Hsp90 via a well defined site that encompasses much of the C terminus, plus an N-terminal hairpin loop. The resonances that are changed in the NMR spectrum of p23 upon addition of the N, M, NM, and full-length Hsp90 proteins are very similar, indicating that the more specific results obtained with the smaller Hsp90 constructs can be applied to infer that the location of the p23 binding site on Hsp90 is primarily via the middle (M) domain and that, under NMR conditions, the addition of the ATP analogue ATPγS has no influence on the p23-Hsp90 interaction. These results will form the basis for further work to characterize the Hsp90-p23 interaction in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2041592960,"Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine has been originally characterized in animal systems and has been shown to be involved in several fundamental processes including signal transduction, growth control, and malignancy. It has been later demonstrated to occur also in a number of bacteria, and recent data suggest that it may participate in the control of bacterial pathogenicity. In this work, we provide evidence that the Gram-positive human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus harbors a protein-tyrosine kinase activity. This activity is borne by a protein, termed Cap5B2, whose phosphorylating capacity is expressed only in the presence of a stimulatory protein, either Cap5A1 or Cap5A2, that enhances its affinity for the phosphoryl donor ATP. In fact, the last 27/29 amino acids of the C-terminal domain of either polypeptide are sufficient for stimulating Cap5B2 activity. The stimulation of Cap5B2 by Cap5A1 involves essentially three amino acid residues in a helix of Cap5A1 (Asp202, Glu203, and Asp205) and three residues in a helix (helix 7) of Cap5B2 (Glu190, Lys192, and Lys193), thus suggesting helix-helix interaction between these two proteins. This type of helix-helix interaction resembles the interaction required for the activation of MinD ATPase by MinE protein in the process of septum-site determination, MinD sharing sequence similarity with Cap5B2. Such activation mechanism is described here in a Gram-positive bacterial tyrosine kinase, and differs from the activation mechanism previously proposed for Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, it appears that S. aureus, and possibly other Gram-positive bacteria, utilizes a specific molecular mechanism for triggering protein-tyrosine kinase activity.

Therefore, it appears that S. aureus, and possibly other Gram-positive bacteria, utilizes a specific molecular mechanism for triggering protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine has long been considered a covalent modification specific to eukaryotes. In these organisms, it has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of a variety of fundamental biological functions, such as signal transduction, growth control, and malignant transformation (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). In the last decade, however, conclusive evidence has accumulated that tyrosine phosphorylation is not a phylogenetically compartmentalized process confined to higher organisms but, instead, occurs also in eubacteria and archaebacteria (2Cozzone A.J. Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Duclos B. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that, in these organisms, one of the main functions of tyrosine phosphorylation concerns the control of pathogenicity of virulent species through the regulation of exopolysaccharide production and transport (3Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4Paiment A. Hocking J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When comparing prokaryotes to eukaryotes in terms of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, it appears that the overall reaction of phosphorylation is identical in both classes of organisms in the sense that the enzymes involved, protein-tyrosine kinases, can autophosphorylate on multiple tyrosine residues, or phosphorylate other protein substrates on tyrosine, at the expense of ATP as the phosphoryl donor. However, when analyzing the corresponding mechanisms at the molecular level, a number of differences are emerging. Thus, in contrast to eukaryotic protein kinases, the ATP binding site of bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases includes two specific signatures, termed the Walker A and B motifs (5Doublet P. Vincent C. Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which are usually found in ATPases but not in kinases (6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). Other differences concern the biochemical properties of the kinases. For instance, bacterial kinases are insensitive to various molecules known to affect the eukaryotic enzymes, such as genistein, quercetin and tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone. Also, bacterial kinases are unable to phosphorylate synthetic substrates like poly(Glu80-Tyr20) or angiotensin II, which are, by contrast, easily targeted by eukaryotic kinases (7Grangeasse C. Vincent C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 339-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of the mechanism of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation reveals the existence of differences not only between bacterial and eukaryotic kinases but also within enzymes of different bacterial origin. In particular, a conspicuous contrast arises when comparing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In Gram-positive bacteria, two distinct proteins encoded by two different genes are required together for phosphorylation (8Mijakovic I. Poncet S. Boel G. Maze A. Gillet S. Jamet E. Decottignies P. Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Le Marechal P. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4709-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), whereas in Gram-negative bacteria, only a single protein is sufficient (10Niemeyer D. Becker A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5163-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Nakar D. Gutnick D.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, a specific tyrosine residue, located in the C-terminal domain of Gram-negative, but not Gram-positive, bacterial tyrosine kinases has been shown to be crucial for phosphorylation (14Whitfield C. Paiment A. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This is namely the case for protein kinase Wzc from Escherichia coli K12. Besides this crucial tyrosine (Tyr569), Wzc contains five other tyrosine residues clustered at its C-terminal end. A detailed examination of the mode of action of Wzc has shown that its phosphorylation occurs through a two-step process. First, the Tyr569 residue autophosphorylates in an intramolecular reaction, which results in an increased kinase activity of Wzc; then, Wzc can, in turn, phosphorylate the five terminal clustered tyrosines of another Wzc molecule in an intermolecular reaction (15Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of the absence of a Tyr569 counterpart in the tyrosine kinases of Gram-positive bacteria, as well as the requirement of two distinct proteins instead of one to generate a tyrosine kinase activity, it could be expected that a particular phosphorylation mechanism would occur in Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, it seemed of interest to investigate in detail the reaction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in Gram-positive bacteria. For that purpose, we analyzed in this work the tyrosine kinase activity of Staphylococcus aureus, a major human pathogen responsible for a diversity of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections. S. aureus genome analysis reveals two couples of polypeptides harboring a putative tyrosine kinase activity, the Cap5A1/Cap5B1 (also termed A1/B1) and the Cap5A2/Cap5B2 (also termed A2/B2). Although A1 and B1 are encoded by genes that are located in the cap operon controlling capsule biosynthesis, the genes encoding A2 and B2 are located elsewhere on the genome. In terms of biological role, A1 and B1 are thought to function together as a polysaccharide co-polymerase and because of their respective sequence similarity, A2 and B2 are supposed to have a similar activity. However the precise function of these proteins remains unknown. In this work, the tyrosine phosphorylating activity of A1/B1 and A2/B2 has been biochemically characterized and the amino acid sequences needed for this activity have been determined, leading to a molecular model based on specific protein-protein interaction required for the kinase activity. Such protein-protein interaction is reminiscent of a mechanism found in the MinD/MinE interaction required for the process of septum site determination. PCR Amplification and Cloning Experiments—The cap5A1, cap5A2, cap5B1, and cap5B2 genes were PCR-amplified by using genomic DNA of S. aureus Reynolds serotype 5 strain, and specific primers to which appropriate restriction sites had been added (supplemental Table SI). The PCR products of cap5A1, cap5A2, cap5B1, and cap5B2 were inserted in pET15b; cap5B2 was also inserted in pQE30. The list of plasmids used in this study is presented in Table 1. The nucleotide sequence of all synthesized and mutated genes was checked to ensure proper base replacement and error-free amplification. The plasmids were used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue or BL21(DE3)(pREP4GroESL) cells to, respectively, propagate plasmids or express the corresponding proteins. Cells were grown in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. DNA sequence analysis, BLAST search, and sequence alignment were performed by using MLRC and ESPript methods (17Gouet P. Courcelle E.

Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) or by PCR amplification. The first strategy was applied to generate single mutations in A1Ct. The corresponding primers used are listed in supplemental Table SI. The selection primer that eliminates the EcoRV site of the pGEXVM plasmid was obtained by creating a new SacI site. This procedure was applied directly to pGEXVM-A1Ct vector to generate substitution of either alanine (D202A, E203A, E204A, D205A, and E207A) or cysteine (D202C, E203C, and D205C) in GST-A1Ct (Table 1). The second strategy was used to create alanine (K188A, D189A, E190A, K192A, K193A, and K195A) and cysteine (D189C, E190C, K192C, and K193C) substitutions in B2. By using the different primers listed in supplemental Table SI two successive PCR amplifications, using pQE30-B2 as template (Table 1), were carried out. The amplified DNA fragment, with appropriate sites at both ends, was restricted by BamHI and HindIII and ligated with pQE30 vector previously opened with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids are listed in Table 1. To generate lysine substitution (K55M) in A1CtB2, two successive PCR amplifications were performed by using pQE30-A1CtB2 as template and primers A1193nt/B2ct/B2K55M. The resulting plasmid was termed pQE30-A1CtB2K. Construction of Chimerical Gene Expression Plasmids—Chimerical gene constructions were carried out by PCR amplification to fuse the last 87 bases of cap5A1 (A1Ct) and the last 81 bases of cap5A2 (A2Ct) to the 5′-end of cap5B1 or cap5B2 gene. First, primer pairs A1193nt/A1ctB1 and A2205nt/A2ctB1 were used for PCR amplification of, respectively, A1Ct and A2Ct to be fused with cap5B1 gene (B1). For fusion with cap5B2 (B2), primer pairs were, respectively, A1193nt/A1ctB2 and A2205nt/A2ctB2 (supplemental Table SI). Then, B1 was amplified with primer A1B1nt/B1ct or A2B1nt/B1ct, and B2 was amplified with A1B2nt/B2ct or A2B2nt/B2ct to allow fusion with any one of the A1Ct and A2Ct fragments. Finally, appropriate mixtures of PCR amplification products of A1Ct, A2Ct, B1, and B2 were prepared to perform another PCR amplification by using primer pairs A1193nt/B1ct, A1193nt/B2ct, A2205nt/B1ct, or A2205nt/B2ct and to obtain, respectively, fused DNA fragments A1CtB1, A1CtB2, A2CtB1, and A2CtB2. DNA fragments A1CtB1 and A2CtB1 were restricted by BamHI and PstI and ligated into pQE30 vector opened with the same enzymes. A1CtB2 and A2CtB2 were restricted by BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pQE30 opened accordingly. The resulting plasmids were termed pQE30-A1CtB1, pQE30-A1CtB2, pQE30-A2CtB1, and pQE30-A2CtB2 (Table 1). Construction of GST-A1Ct, GST-A2Ct, and GST-A1CtB2 Expression Plasmids—The 87-bp cap5A1-(577–666) and 81-bp cap5A2-(546–626) gene fragments encoding the last 29 and 27 C-terminal amino acids of Cap5A1 and Cap5A2, respectively, were synthesized by PCR amplification using pET15b-cap5A1 and pET15b-cap5A2 as templates and primer pairs A1193nt/A1ct and A2205nt/A2ct, respectively (supplemental Table SI). The DNA fragments synthesized were restricted by BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pGEXVM vector opened with the same enzymes. Plasmid pQE30-A1CtB2 was also used as the template for PCR amplification using primer pair A1193nt/B2ct to ligate the corresponding DNA fragment in pGEXVM vector. The resulting plasmids were termed pGEXVM-A1Ct, pGEXVM-A2Ct, and pGEXVM-A1CtB2 (Table 1). Overproduction and Purification of Proteins—His-tagged proteins (wild or mutated B1 and B2, chimerical A1Ct-B1, A1Ct-B2, A2Ct-B1, A2Ct-B2, and A1CtB2K55M) and GST-tagged proteins (A1Ct and A2Ct, and derivatives, and A1CtB2) were overproduced and purified as previously described (15Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified fractions were collected and dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol and stored at 4 °C. Kinase Assays and Photoaffinity Labeling—In vitro phosphorylation of 1–2 μg of different purified proteins was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm ATP with 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP as previously described (16Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling was performed as reported by Matsuyama et al. (20Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 nm [α-32P]ATP, 30 pm protein of interest, and a varying concentration of non-radioactive ATP, from 0 to 50 mm. After electrophoresis, radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Fluorescence Measurement—All experiments were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a Photon technology International Quanta Master I spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out as described previously (21Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Pietro A. Di Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Tryptophan-intrinsic fluorescence was monitored between 310 and 380 nm. Alternatively, an increasing concentration of N-methylanthraniloyl (MANT) 2The abbreviations used are: MANT, N-methylanthraniloyl; FRET, fluorescence resonance-energy transfer; GST, glutathione S-transferase. -ATP (Jenabiosciences GmbH) from 0 to 5 μm was added, and fluorescence resonance-energy transfer (FRET) between tryptophan residues and bound MANT-ATP was monitored through the appearance of a fluorescence emission peak between 400 and 530 nm. Correction for both the variation of volume and the inner-filter effect of MANT-ATP was performed under the same conditions by using N-acetyltryptophanamide. Peak integration was carried out at each MANT-ATP concentration with the Felix 1.21 software (Photon technology International). Curve fitting of the data were performed using the Graphit 2.11 software (Erithacus Software). Cysteine Oxidation and Disulfide Bond Formation—Oxidation of B2 and A1Ct cysteine residues was adapted from Oudot et al. (22Oudot C. Jaquinod M. Cortay J.C. Cozzone A.J. Jault J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 0.5 μg of mutated B2 and/or A1Ct was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 2 mm CuSO4. Samples were directly mixed with an electrophoresis loading buffer in the absence of 2-β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to perform electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agent. Samples were then analyzed by Western immunoblotting by using the SuperSignal West HisProbe Kit from Pierce. Finally, blots were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the chemiluminescence reagent from Amersham Biosciences. Activation of Cap5B2 by the C-terminal Domain of Cap5A2—The major difference between protein-tyrosine kinases of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria lies in the fact that the former produce kinase activity from a single polypeptide, whereas the latter require two distinct polypeptides, one homologous to the N-terminal periplasmic region and the other homologous to the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the Gram-negative counterpart (12Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that in Gram-positive bacteria the cytoplasmic peptide would interact with the membrane peptide to mimic the situation encountered in Gram-negative bacteria and, thus, would induce kinase activity. In the case of S. aureus serotype 5, the A1 and A2 polypeptides are located in the membrane, whereas B1 and B2 are in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1). Preliminary work carried out in our laboratory has shown that the B2 tyrosine kinase activity is enhanced in the presence of its cognate transmembrane partner A2 and, to an even greater extent, in the presence of the A1 polypeptide (data not shown). From these observations, it seemed of interest to determine which regions of A1 and A2 were needed to activate B2 and, possibly, B1 autophosphorylation. The C-terminal fragment of A1 (A1Ct) from Val194 to Asn222 and the C-terminal fragment of A2 (A2Ct) from Leu194 to Phe220, are located in the cytoplasm of cells by referring to Wzc topology (Fig. 1). We supposed that these fragments could interact with B1 and B2, respectively. To check this hypothesis, A1Ct and A2Ct were synthesized fused to a glutathione S-transferase tag (GST-A1Ct and GST-A2Ct), purified to homogeneity, incubated with either purified His6B1 or His6B2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 2 shows that both GST-A1Ct and GST-A2Ct were able to elicit the autokinase activity of Cap5B2. The extent of activation by A1Ct and A2Ct appeared to be comparable to that observed when the entire A1 or A2 protein was used (Fig. 2). Furthermore, it was observed that A1 and A1Ct seemed to activate B2 more efficiently than A2 and A2Ct, respectively. Surprisingly, B1 was not activated by A1, A2, A1Ct, or A2Ct. These results indicated that the cytoplasmic C-terminal part of either A1 or A2 is able to interact with B2 and promote its autophosphorylation. In contrast, B1 does not seem to possess such capacity, even though it exhibits over 57% identity to B2. Another approach was used to analyze the effects of A1Ct and A2Ct on tyrosine kinase activity based on the fusion of each of these two fragments to the N-terminal end of B1 or B2. Indeed, in Gram-negative bacteria, the cytoplasmic domain of the kinase, which has been shown to undergo alone tyrosine autophosphorylation, comprises an amino acid sequence upstream of the Walker A much longer than the corresponding sequence in the N-terminal part of B1 or B2 (Fig. 1). The purpose was then to check whether the Gram-negative organization could be reproduced and whether direct linkage of A1Ct or A2Ct to B1 or B2 could activate their tyrosine kinase activity, as previously observed by adding the physically distinct fragments, GST-A1 and GST-A2. Therefore, chimerical DNA constructions of A1Ct and A2Ct fused to either B1 or B2 were prepared and overexpressed with a His6 N-terminal tag by using pQE30 vector. Each of the corresponding chimerical proteins, His6A1CtB1, His6A1CtB2, His6A2CtB1, and His6A1CtB2, was purified to homogeneity, incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and analyzed in the same conditions as above. Both His6A1Ct-B2 and His6A2Ct-B2 appeared to incorporate a significant amount of radioactivity (Fig. 2). The phosphorylation signals detected for these two chimeras were quantitatively comparable to those obtained when B2 was incubated in the presence of GST-A1Ct or GST-A2Ct (Fig. 2). For a reason to be determined, they were more pronounced in the presence of A1Ct than with A2Ct, even though these two fragments share 72% structural identity. No phosphorylation of B1 was detected, as previously noted when B1 was incubated with either GST-A1Ct or GST-A2Ct. These results showed that the cytoplasmic domain of the tyrosine kinase B2 of the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus can function similarly to its Gram-negative counterparts and can undergo effective autophosphorylation when fused to the cytoplasmic C-terminal part of its transmembrane partner, either A1 or A2. To analyze further the process of B2 phosphorylation we checked whether it was an intra- or intermolecular reaction. To decide between this possibilities, a lysine substitution (K55M) was generated in the Walker A motif of His-tagged A1CtB2 thus rendering the mutated protein unable to sustain phosphorylation (5Doublet P. Vincent C. Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also produced A1CtB2 fused to GST to distinguish it, on the basis of molecular mass, from His6-A1CtB2K55M. In control assays, GST-A1CtB2 was shown to actively phosphorylate, whereas no phosphorylation occurred in the case of His6-A1CtB2K55M (Fig. 2). When both proteins were incubated together, the inactive His6-A1CtB2K55M chimera was effectively labeled (Fig. 2). It was concluded that A1CtB2 phosphorylates through an intermolecular process. Interaction with Cap5A Induces Structural Changes in Cap5B2— To determine the molecular mechanism of activation of B2 by A1/A1 Ct and, to a lesser extent, by A2/A2Ct, we hypothesized that structural rearrangements could occur in B2 when interacting with these fragments. The stimulation by A1 or A2 of the tyrosine kinase activity of B2 would then be because of the induction of a conformational change of B2 leading to a structural organization more appropriate for kinase activity. First, circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed to detect possible variations in the secondary structure of B2 when fused or not to A1Ct and A2Ct. The CD spectra appeared to be identical for each of the three proteins analyzed (B2, A1Ct-B2, and A2Ct-B2), and the calculated percentage of α-helix was in the same range (around 45%) for each of them (supplemental Fig. S1A). This result indicated that if structural rearrangements were occurring in B2 the secondary structure of the protein seemed, however, to be essentially unmodified upon fusion to A1Ct and A2Ct. Then, to get information on the tertiary structure of B2 and corresponding chimeras, fluorescence measurements were performed by following the variations of their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Taking advantage of the fact that B2 contains only one tryptophan residue (Trp104) in its sequence, the measurements made at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm showed that B2 alone exhibited a fluorescence emission spectrum characteristic of an accessible tryptophan residue with a maximum at around 346 nm. In the case of A1Ct-B2 and A2Ct-B2, a comparable emission spectrum was observed with, however, a blue shift of the emission fluorescence wavelength maximum to 336 nm, showing that structural modifications occurred in the local environment surrounding the tryptophan residue (supplemental Fig. S1B). It was therefore concluded, at this point, that upon binding of A1Ct and A2Ct, the three-dimensional structure of B2 was changed in connection with an increase in the B2 kinase activity. Cap5A Interaction Increases the Affinity of Cap5B2 for ATP and MANT-ATP—Two main possibilities could be envisaged to explain the higher kinase activity displayed by the B2 chimeras. Either the affinity of B2 for ATP was increased by its structural rearrangement, or its capacit"
https://openalex.org/W1979356310,"Previously, we have reported that BRCA1 regulates the expression of various classes of genes, including genes involved in xenobiotic stress responses (Bae, I., Fan, S., Meng, Q., Rih, J. K., Kim, H. J., Kang, H. J., Xu, J., Goldberg, I. D., Jaiswal, A. K., and Rosen, E. M. (2004) Cancer Res. 64, 7893–7909). In the present study, we have investigated the effects of BRCA1 on xenobiotic stress-inducible gene expression. In response to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, cytoplasmic AhR becomes activated and then translocates to the nucleus where it forms a complex with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). Subsequently, the AhR·ARNT complex binds to the enhancer or promoter of genes containing a xenobiotic stress-responsive element and regulates the expression of multiple target genes including cytochrome P450 subfamily polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1). In this study, we have found that endogenous and overexpressed exogenous wild-type BRCA1 affect xenobiotic stress-induced CYP1A1 gene expression. Using a standard chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we have demonstrated that BRCA1 is recruited to the promoter regions of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 along with ARNT and/or AhR following xenobiotic exposure. Our findings suggest that BRCA1 may be physiologically important for mounting a normal response to xenobiotic insults and that it may function as a coactivator for ARNT activity. Using immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and glutathione S-transferase capture assays, a xenobiotic-independent interaction between BRCA1 and ARNT has been identified, although it is not yet known whether this is a direct or indirect interaction. We have also found that the inducibility of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcripts following xenobiotic stress was significantly attenuated in BRCA1 knockdown cells. This reduced inducibility is associated with an altered stability of ARNT and was almost completely reversed in cells transfected with an ARNT expression vector. Finally, we have found that xenobiotic (TCDD) treatments of breast cancer cells containing reduced levels of BRCA1 cause the transcription factor ARNT to become unstable. Previously, we have reported that BRCA1 regulates the expression of various classes of genes, including genes involved in xenobiotic stress responses (Bae, I., Fan, S., Meng, Q., Rih, J. K., Kim, H. J., Kang, H. J., Xu, J., Goldberg, I. D., Jaiswal, A. K., and Rosen, E. M. (2004) Cancer Res. 64, 7893–7909).

Finally, we have found that xenobiotic (TCDD) treatments of breast cancer cells containing reduced levels of BRCA1 cause the transcription factor ARNT to become unstable. Inherited mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 confer increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S.

In addition, because BRCA1 expression is often decreased or even absent in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer, abnormal BRCA1 expression may also have a role(s) in nonhereditary tumors (3Wilson C.A. Ramos L. Villasenor M.R. Anders K.H. Press M.F. Clarke K. Karlan B. Chen J.J. Scully R. Livingston D. Zuch R.H. Kanter M.H. Cohen S. Calzone F.J. Slamon D.J. Nat.

Although these observations indicate that BRCA1 may act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, the specific function(s) of BRCA1 that could have this effect is still not completely understood. However, numerous studies have shown that BRCA1 regulates various pivotal cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcription, and many of the mechanisms involved have been identified (see Ref. 5Rosen E.M. Fan S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar for a review). Recent studies show that BRCA1 proteins are also required for maintaining chromosome stability by regulating centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle checkpoints (6Wang R.H. Yu H. Deng C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17108-17113Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Deng C.X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6222-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Weaver Z. Montagna C.

Although BRCA1 regulates transcription, the mechanisms involved are unlike classical transcriptional factors that directly bind DNA sequences. Rather, BRCA1 regulates transcription via protein-protein interactions. The BRCA1 C-terminal activation domain is responsible for transactivation in yeast or mammalian cells (9Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In addition to the terminal activation domain (aa 2The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); 5F203, 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluoro-benzothiazole; DF203, 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)benzothiazole; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; BRCA1, breast cancer susceptibility gene-1; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHX, cycloheximide; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CYP1A1, cytochrome P450/subfamily 1/polypeptide 1; ER, estrogen receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Luc, luciferase; NC, negative control; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetracholrodibeco-p-dioxin; WB, Western blotting; XRE, xenobiotic response element; IVT, in vitro translated; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); 5F203, 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluoro-benzothiazole; DF203, 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)benzothiazole; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; BRCA1, breast cancer susceptibility gene-1; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHX, cycloheximide; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CYP1A1, cytochrome P450/subfamily 1/polypeptide 1; ER, estrogen receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Luc, luciferase; NC, negative control; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetracholrodibeco-p-dioxin; WB, Western blotting; XRE, xenobiotic response element; IVT, in vitro translated; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1560–1863, now called AD2), a second activation domain of BRCA1 (designated AD1, aa 1293–1560) has been identified (10Hu Y.F. Miyake T. Ye Q. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40910-40915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These domains enable BRCA1 to interact with p53 and enhance its transcriptional activity (11Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 12Chai Y.L. Cui J. Shao N. Shyam E. Reddy P. Rao V.N.

Fan S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). BRCA1 can also regulate transcription by interacting with components of the basal transcription machinery (e.g. RNA helicase A, p300) (13Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Pao G.M. Janknecht R. Ruffner H. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zhong H. Nye A.C. Belmont A.S. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). BRCA1 also interacts with STAT1 to stimulate interferon-γ-mediated transcription (17Ouchi T. Lee S.W. Ouchi M. Aaronson S.A. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5208-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). BRCA1 interacts with estrogen receptor (ER)-α to inhibit ER-α transcription regulation activity (18Fan S. Wang J.A. Meng Q. Yuan R.Q. Ma Y.X. Erdos M.R. Pestell R.G. Yuan F. Auborn K.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1354-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 19Fan S. Wang J.A. Ma Y.X. Yuan R.Q.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7730-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The absence of BRCA1 caused ligand-independent activation of ER-α (21Zheng L. Annab L.A. Afshari C.A. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9587-9592Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). BRCA1 also interacts with androgen receptor and enhances androgen receptor-mediated transcription activation (22Yeh S. Hu Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K. Hsu C.L. Ting H.J. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Park J.J. Irvine R.A. Buchanan G. Koh S.S. Park J.M. Tilley W.D. Stallcup M.R. Press M.F. Coetzee G.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5946-5949PubMed Google Scholar). BRCA1 binds c-Myc and inhibits its transcriptional and transforming activities (24Wang Q. Zhang H. Kajino K. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We recently reported that BRCA1 stimulates antioxidant response element-driven transcriptional activity and enhances the activity of the antioxidant response transcription factor, nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (also called NRF2 (NFE2L2)) (25Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is the dimerization partner of a large family of transcriptional factors that act as environmental sensors and control the response of an organism to a wide array of environmental stimuli (26Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 27Denison M.S. Nagy S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). One of its heterodimeric partners, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), becomes activated in response to xenobiotic stress (for example, TCDD). Prior to ligand binding, AhR is sequestered in a cytoplasmic complex containing heat shock protein 90 (28Perdew G.H. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 589-593PubMed Google Scholar), co-chaperone p23 (29Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the immunophilin homolog XAP2 (30Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, the AhR-containing complex moves to the nucleus where AhR dissociates from the chaperone complex and forms a heterodimer with ARNT, the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim protein. These heterodimers can then bind to xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes where they regulate transcription. The regulation of cytochrome P450A1 (CYP1A1) expression has been studied extensively and has become a model for studying AhR activation (31Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The cytochrome P450s are essential enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs, foreign chemicals, arachidonic acid, cholesterol, steroids, and other physiologically relevant lipids. Recently, several drugs targeting particular P450 enzyme activities have been developed. Two of these drugs, DF203 and 5F203, potently inhibit human cancer cell growth, in part by affecting the AhR signaling pathway (32Bradshaw T.D. Westwell A.D. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we found that BRCA1 regulates multiple xenobiotic stress-inducible genes, including NQO1, UGT1A1, and gsta2 (25Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The promoters or enhancer regions of each of these genes contain a XRE and respond to xenobiotic stressors (33Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jaiswal A.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Emi Y. Ikushiro S.I.

A. 1990; 87: 3826-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In this study, we used TCDD, DF203, or 5F203 as xenobiotic stressors to investigate the role of BRCA1 in regulating the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, two genes whose xenobiotic stress-inducible responses in human breast cancer cells are well documented. Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Drug Treatments—Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75–1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell culture reagents were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). TCDD, at >99% purity, was obtained from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories (Andover, MA). TCDD was maintained as a stock solution (31 μm) in anhydrous tissue culture-grade dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO in all experiments was 0.1%. Both DF203 (National Service Center 674495) and its fluorinated analog 5F203 (National Service center 703786) were obtained from the drug repository of the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (Rockville, MD) and were prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 100 mm, aliquoted, and stored frozen at –20 °C until used. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western Blotting (WB)—All IP procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells grown on 100-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in a buffer (50 mm Tris (pH, 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and immunoprecipitated with either anti-ARNT rabbit antibody (H-172, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a combination of anti-human BRCA1 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Abs) against N- and C-terminal epitopes on BRCA1 (Ab-1 + Ab-2 + Ab-3, Oncogene Research Products) as previously described (19Fan S. Wang J.A. Ma Y.X. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Erdos M.R. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by WB using either an anti-ARNT rabbit antibody (H-172, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-BRCA1 rabbit antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Capture Assays—Briefly, purified GST fusion proteins or GST alone, produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLys cells, were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) to concentrate and immobilize them. Thereafter, the GST proteins immobilized on beads were mixed with a probe (in vitro translated [35S]-labeled ARNT) in a reaction buffer (40 units of RNasin Rnase inhibitor, 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 6 mm ATP, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 6 mm creatine phosphate). The beads were centrifuged and then washed three times with a washing buffer (0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 300 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The captured proteins were eluted in sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried under vacuum at 80 °C and autoradiographed. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in duplicate using the 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Roche Applied Science), on an Applied Biosystems-Prism Sequence Detector System 7700 and analyzed with SDS software. Real-time PCR conditions were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15-s denaturation at 95 °C, 60-s annealing/extension at 60 °C. SYBR Green was used to monitor the amounts of amplified double-stranded DNA fragments. Cycle threshold values were obtained to determine the fold change. The mRNA level of β-actin was also determined for each RNA sample and was used for normalization. The following primer sequences were used: CYP1A1 forward and reverse primers 5′-ctt gga cct ctt tgg agc tg-3′ and 5′-cga agg aag agt gtc gga ag-3′; CYP1B1 forward and reverse primers 5′-cac caa ggc tga gac agt ga-3′ and 5′-gat gac gac tgg gcc tac at-3′; β-actin forward and reverse primers 5′-tag cgg ggt tca ccc aca ctg tgc ccc atc ta-3′ and 5′-cta gaa gca ttt gcg gtg gac cga tgg agg g-3′, respectively. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Well controlled semiquantitative reverse-transcription-PCR assays were performed as described previously (25Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). GAPDH, whose expression is unaffected by TCDD or BRCA1-siRNA, was used as the loading control. The PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide (0.1 mg/ml) and photographed under UV illumination. The CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 primers described above were also used for the semiquantitative RT-PCR. Forward and reverse primers for BRCA1 were 5′-ttg cgg gag gaa aat ggg tag tta-3′ and 5′-tgt gcc aag ggt gaa tga tga aag-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for GAPDH were 5′-atg ttc gtc atg ggt gtg aa-3′ and (5′-ttc agc tca ggg atg acc tt-3′, respectively. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells (∼60,000 cells/well) grown in 24-well plates were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) transfection reagents. Total amounts of transfecting DNA/well were adjusted to a constant amount with empty vector (pcDNA3, for example). The transfected cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before being treated with chemicals, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity as previously described (25Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For normalization, a constant amount of pCMV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected and β-galactosidase activity was monitored as previously described (37Yi Y.W. Kim D.G. Jung Y.C. Hong S.S. Lee H.S. Bae I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two promoter constructs, p(XRE-1A1)-Luc (38Morel Y. Mermod N. Barouki R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6825-6832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or p(Cyp1a1)-Luc (39Cho I.J. Kim S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44103-44112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were used for this study. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Exponentially proliferating MCF-7 and T47D cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD. ChIP assays were performed as suggested in the manufacturer's instruction manual (Upstate Biotechnology). In brief, cross-linking was achieved by adding formaldehyde to 1% and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then collected in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. The resuspended, lysed cells were sonicated, yielding DNA fragments raging in size from 200 to 900 bp. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C (13,000 revolutions/min) and the supernatants collected and diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer. The diluted samples were precleared with 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% slurry for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies (anti-ARNT, -AhR, or -BRCA1) or control IgG as described above. Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from protein A beads with an elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). The immunoprecipitated DNA was separated from the protein complexes and used as a template for PCR reactions as described above. The following genomic sequences were used: CYP1A1 forward and reverse primers, 5′-taa gag ccc cgc ccc gac ttc ct-3′ and 5′-tag ctt gcg tgc gcc ggc gac at-3′), respectively, and CYP1B1 forward and reverse primers, 5′-gtt ccc tta taa agg gag-3′ and 5′-ctg cga tgg aag ccg ttg-3′), respectively, as previously reported (40Beischlag T.V.

Transfection with siRNA—Exponentially proliferating cells were transfected with chemically synthesized siRNA (control-siRNA or BRCA1-siRNA) and Lipofectamine 2000 for 72 h as previously described (25Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Alternatively, we used pKD-negative control (NC) empty vector or the pKD-BRCA1 siRNA expression vector (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) (see Fig. 8A). For ARNT knockdown, we used pooled siRNA sequences obtained from Dharmacon Inc. Statistical Methods—Statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test where appropriate. BRCA1 Overexpression Enhances Xenobiotic Stress-induced Gene and Protein Expression—TCDD is the prototype for one class of xenobiotics, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, which induce stress in human cells. To determine whether BRCA1 protein levels affect the expression of genes known to be induced by this class of xenobiotics, control and BRCA1-transfected cells were incubated for 24 h and then treated with 10 nm TCDD for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, changes in CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. We found that overexpressed BRCA1 enhanced TCDD-induced expression of both CYP1A1 (Fig. 1A) and CYP1B1 at the mRNA level (Fig. 1B) (p > 0.005 for comparisons of cells transfected with pCDNA3 versus BRCA1 in the presence of TCDD). To determine whether this enhanced response could reflect XRE-dependent transcriptional regulation, we transfected cells (MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75–1) with pcDNA3, BRCA1, and p(XRE-1A1)-Luc (which contains three tandem XREs from human CYP1A1), and 24 h later, we added TCDD (10 nm). Only the BRCA1-expressing plasmid enhanced TCDD-stimulated XRE promoter reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner in these three ER(+) breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2, A–C) (p < 0.005 or < 0.05 for comparisons of cells transfected with pCDNA3 versus BRCA1). Similar results were obtained when p(Cyp1a1)-Luc, a reporter plasmid containing 1195 bp of the rat Cyp1a1 promoter cloned into pGL3, was used (Fig. 2D). This BRCA1 effect is not limited to TCDD-induced stress, because stress-induced transcription caused by two other xenobiotic drugs of the same class, DF203 and 5F203, was also enhanced by the BRCA1 expression plasmid (Fig. 3) (p < 0.005 or < 0.05).FIGURE 2The effect of exogenous BRCA1 on a XRE-containing promoter in TCDD treated cells. Exponentially proliferating cells (MCF-7 (A), T47D (B), and ZR-75–1 (C)) were transiently transfected with empty vector or the BRCA1 expression vector and a p(XRE-1A1)-Luc reporter plasmid, treated with 10 nm TCDD, and assayed for luciferase activity as described under”Experimental Procedures.“ D, MCF-7 cells were transfected with BRCA1 and the p(Cyp1a1)-Luc reporter (34Jaiswal A.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and treated with 10 nm TCDD, and the promoter activity was monitored. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of four independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. For normalization of the luciferase assay data, triplicate transfections with pCMV-β-galactosidase and pcDNA3 vectors were done in parallel (25Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J.

The values represent means ± S.E. of quadruplicate wells (n = 4) of three independent experiments. BRCA1-transfected cells showed a higher fold induction of CYP1A1 than control cells in the presence of TCDD (p < 0.005–0.05).

Recruitment of AhR, ARNT, and BRCA1 to the human genomic CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proximal enhancer regions was monitored for 2 h following treatment of cell cultures with TCDD (10 nm). Genomic DNA, bound to proteins immunoprecipitated by antibodies specific for BRCA1, ARNT, or AhR, was used as a template for PCR to determine whether the association between these proteins and the CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 promoters was dependent on TCDD treatment (Fig. 4). We found that both BRCA1 and ARNT were detectably associated with the genomic CYP1A1 promoter in untreated MCF-7 and T47D cells and that TCDD treatment enhanced this association in both cell lines (Fig. 4A). In contrast, antibodies to BRCA1 and ARNT failed to immunoprecipitate detectable amounts of CYP1B1 promoter DNA from either cell line in the absence of TCDD treatment. Nevertheless, TCDD treatment enhanced BRCA1 and ARNT binding to CYP1B1 promoter DNA in both MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 4B). The association of AhR with either promoter in either cell line was only weakly or not at all detectable under our conditions, possibly because of the rela"
https://openalex.org/W2023501509,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium responsible for a number of human diseases. The mechanism underlying the intracellular parasitology of Chlamydiae remains poorly understood. In searching for host factors required for chlamydial infection, we discovered that C. trachomatis growth was effectively inhibited with GM6001 and TAPI-0, two compounds known as specific inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. The inhibition was independent of chlamydial entry of the cell, suggesting that the loss of extracellular metalloprotease activities of the host cell is unlikely to be the mechanism for the growth suppression. Nucleotide sequences of candidate metalloprotease genes remained unchanged in a chlamydial variant designated GR10, which had been selected for resistance to the inhibitors. Nevertheless, GR10 displayed a single base mutation in the presumable promoter region of the gene for peptide deformylase (PDF), a metal-dependent enzyme that removes the N-formyl group from newly synthesized bacterial proteins. The mutation correlated with an increased PDF expression level and resistance to actinonin, a known PDF inhibitor with antibacterial activity, as compared with the parental strain. Recombinant chlamydial PDF was covalently labeled with a hydroxamate-based molecular probe designated AspR1, which was developed for the detection of metalloproteases. The AspR1 labeling of the chlamydial PDF became significantly less efficient in the presence of excessive amounts of GM6001 and TAPI-0. Finally, the PDF enzyme activity was efficiently inhibited with GM6001 and TAPI-0. Taken together, our results suggest that the metalloprotease inhibitors suppress chlamydial growth by targeting the bacterial PDF. These findings have important biochemical and medical implications.

The AspR1 labeling of the chlamydial PDF became significantly less efficient in the presence of excessive amounts of GM6001 and TAPI-0. Finally, the PDF enzyme activity was efficiently inhibited with GM6001 and TAPI-0. Taken together, our results suggest that the metalloprotease inhibitors suppress chlamydial growth by targeting the bacterial PDF. These findings have important biochemical and medical implications. Chlamydiae are Gram-negative eubacteria that are divided into four species: Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci, and C. pecorum (1Grayston J.T. Campbell L.A. Kuo C.C. Mordhorst C.H. Saikku P. Thom D.H. Wang S.P. J. Infect Dis. 1990; 161: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae are widespread human pathogens (1Grayston J.T.

Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis. 1999; (ASM Press, Washington, D. C.): 139-169Google Scholar). C. pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia and bronchitis and may also be a cofactor for cardiovascular disease (3Kuo C.C. Coulson A.S. Campbell L.A. Cappuccio A.L. Lawrence R.D. Wang S.P. Grayston J.T. J. Vasc. Surg. 1997; 26: 29-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). C. trachomatis consists of three biovars. Biovar trachoma is responsible for preventable blindness and is also a major cause of sexually transmitted infections characterized by cervicitis, endometritis, and salpingitis in women and urethritis in men, whereas biovar lymphogranuloma venereum causes a more invasive sexually transmitted syndrome that attacks subepithelial and lymphatic tissues. Biovar mouse is not a human pathogen; however, it is a useful organism modeling human chlamydial infection in mice (2Schachter J. Chlamydia Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis. 1999; (ASM Press, Washington, D. C.): 139-169Google Scholar). Chlamydiae are strictly dependent upon host eukaryotic cells for their growth (4Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They have a distinct developmental cycle, which begins with attachment of an infectious elementary body (EB) 2The abbreviations used are: EB, elementary body; RB, reticulate body; L2, C. trachomatis serovar L2; GR10, an L2 mutant resistant to GM6001 and TAPI-0; MoPn, C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis; PDF, peptide deformylase; IFU, inclusion-forming unit; MOMP, major outer membrane protein; GMNC, GM6001 negative control; fMAS, N-formylmethionine-alanine-serine; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside; IC50, concentration that causes 50% inhibition. to the host cell that internalizes the bacterium into a vacuole termed inclusion. In the inclusion, the EB differentiates into the non-infectious, metabolically active reticulate body (RB), which replicates by binary fission. Around the midpoint of their developmental cycle, the majority of RBs start to reorganize back to EBs, which are then released to infect additional cells (4Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to their strict requirement for intracellular growth and the lack of methodology for genetic transformation, the molecular mechanisms underlying the intracellular development of Chlamydiae remain largely undefined. We are particularly interested in identifying host factors that are important for supporting chlamydial infection. In a screen of chemical compounds that target a variety of cellular activities, we unexpectedly discovered that reagents developed for suppressing matrix metalloproteases acted as highly effective inhibitors of C. trachomatis infection. However, detailed analyses pointed to peptide deformylase (PDF), a metal-dependent enzyme key to protein maturation in bacteria, as the inhibitors' target. Thus, these studies identify PDF as an essential enzyme for chlamydial replication and may also be a therapeutic target for chlamydial diseases, provided inhibitory specificity can be achieved. Reagents—GM6001, GM6001 Negative Control (GMNC), and TAPI-0 were purchased from Calbiochem. The structures of these three compounds are given in Fig. 1. Cycloheximide, sodium formate, NiSO4, imidazole, β-nicotinomide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD), and Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The structure of the AspR1 probe is also shown in Fig. 1. The protocol for synthesizing an earlier version of the AspR1 probe has been described (5Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10000-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The procedures for synthesizing the AspR1 probe have also been reported. 3Sieber, S. A., Niessen, S., Hoover, H. S., and Cravatt, B. F. (2006) Nat. Chem. Biol. 2, 274–281. [6-3H]Uridine (specific activity, 20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). N-Formyl-methionine-alanine-serine (fMAS) was purchased from Bachem Biosciences Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Cobalt-conjugated Sepharose was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Glutathione-agarose and the ECL kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). The Precision Plus Protein All Blue molecular weight standards (for covalent labeling experiments) and the broad range prestained protein standards (for all other experiments) were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Wild-type Chlamydial Strains—Strain 434/bu of C. trachomatis serovar L2 (L2), strain UW-3/Cx of C. trachomatis serovar D, and strain Nigg II of C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) represent biovars lymphogranuloma venereum, trachoma, and mouse, respectively. They were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Strain stocks were amplified using HeLa cells with the aid of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide added to the culture medium to block host protein synthesis (6Hatch T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 393-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selection and Cloning of Resistant Mutant—To select Chlamydia resistant to GM6001, L2 was cultured in HeLa cells in the presence of 6, 7, and 10 μm GM6001 for 3, 7, and 4 passages, respectively. The last passage was harvested, expanded in the absence of GM6001, and designated GR10. To obtain homogeneous clonal populations, we 1:10 serially diluted a GR10 stock before it was added onto HeLa cell monolayers grown on 35-mm culture dishes. Six replicate dishes were inoculated with each dilution of GR10 and were incubated at 37 °C. Two hours later free EBs were removed by three washes with medium. The infected cells were cultured for an additional 36 h. The monolayers were viewed carefully under an Olympus IX-41 inverted phase-contrast microscope with a 40× objective to identify inclusions. There was less than one inclusion per field in wells infected with a 1:106-diluted stock. An inclusion-containing cell (and the surrounding uninfected ones) was picked from each of the six dishes infected with that dilution. The cells were transferred into a tube containing 500 μl of culture medium, briefly sonicated to release EBs, and inoculated onto new HeLa monolayers to expand the resistant clones. Immunostaining of Chlamydial Inclusions—HeLa and A549 cells grown on coverslips were exposed to an EB stock for 2 h. Unless specified, infected cells were washed with medium to remove free EBs and were cultured in medium with or without the supplementation of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide and a metalloprotease inhibitor. Infected cells were fixed with cold methanol 40 h after infection and reacted to a monoclonal antibody against the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of L2 (7Greene W. Xiao Y. Huang Y. McClarty G. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Xiao Y. Zhong Y. Greene W. Dong F. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5470-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MoPn- and serovar D-infected cells were fixed at 30 and 48 h after infection, respectively, and reacted to a monoclonal antibody against chlamydial lipopolysaccharide (7Greene W. Xiao Y. Huang Y. McClarty G. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Xiao Y. Zhong Y. Greene W. Dong F. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5470-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Free primary antibodies were removed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were then reacted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (7Greene W. Xiao Y. Huang Y. McClarty G. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Xiao Y. Zhong Y. Greene W. Dong F. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5470-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After three additional washes, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and viewed with an Olympus IX-51 fluorescence microscope (9Li X. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27365-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For experiments comparing wild-type L2 and GR10, the multiplicities of infection for both were 5 inclusion-forming units (IFUs)/cell (see below). Quantitation of EB Production—For experiments comparing sensitivities of L2 and GR10 to GM6001 and TAPI-0, the infectivities of their EB stocks were titrated in parallel by measuring their abilities to form inclusions in HeLa cell monolayers grown on coverslips in 24-well plates. Six replicate wells with HeLa monolayers were infected with each dilution of a stock. Infected cells were fixed with cold methanol 40 h after infection and reacted to a monoclonal antibody. Inclusions were scored following immunostaining as described above (9Li X. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27365-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Essentially the same IFU values were obtained in three repeated titration experiments for each of the stocks. Titration of EB production for other purposes was carried out in essentially the same manner, except only duplicate wells were infected with each dilution. Determination of DNA Synthesis Activity of MoPn—HeLa cells in 24-well plates were infected with MoPn and cultured in the presence of indicated concentrations of GM6001 as well as cycloheximide (10Fan H.Z. McClarty G. Brunham R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fan H. Brunham R.C. McClarty G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, the incorporation of [6-3H]uridine into chlamydial DNA was determined as previously reported (10Fan H.Z. McClarty G. Brunham R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fan H. Brunham R.C. McClarty G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Growth Determination of Other Bacteria—LB medium was used to culture Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, while MRS medium (ATCC) was used to grow Lactobacillus delbrueckii. An E. coli MG1655 colony was inoculated into 10 ml of LB broth, which was divided into 2-ml aliquots. TAPI-0 was added to the aliquots to the final concentrations indicated. After overnight culture, A600 values were taken. Overnight L. delbrueckii and S. enterica cultures were diluted 100- and 30-fold, respectively, then cultured in the presence or absence of 20 μm GM6001. A600 values were measured at the indicated time points. Determination of S. enterica growth in HeLa cells was carried out as previously described (12Steele-Mortimer O. Brumell J.H. Knodler L.A. Meresse S. Lopez A. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected with a fresh culture of S. enterica grown to stationary phase. After washes to remove free bacteria, cells were cultured with medium containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin (to kill any residual free bacteria) plus or minus 20 μm GM6001 for indicated time periods. Gentamycin was then removed by washes. Intracellular bacteria were released by 0.1% Triton X-100, serially diluted, and plated onto LB agar plates. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, colony-forming units were scored (12Steele-Mortimer O. Brumell J.H. Knodler L.A. Meresse S. Lopez A. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—HeLa or A549 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates without coverslips; infection and inhibitor treatment were carried out as described for immunostaining. For Western blotting, medium was aspirated 24 h after infection, and cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. Sample processing, electrophoresis, blotting, and antibody detection have been detailed previously (9Li X. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27365-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Fan H. Turck C.W. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18617-18627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For dot blotting, cells were lysed in 200 μl of H2O; a 50-μl sample of the resulting EB/RB extract was blotted onto Zeta Probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The procedure for antibody detection of MOMP was the same as that for Western blotting. Sequence Determination—EBs of wild-type L2 and GR10 obtained from infected HeLa cells were digested overnight with 100 μg/ml Proteinase K. The chlamydial genomic DNA released was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Genes of interest were amplified using 50 ng of genomic DNA (per reaction) as the template. The primer sequences used for amplification are listed in Table 1. The resulting PCR fragments were gel-purified and subjected to automated sequencing analyses using primers that were 500 bases apart on both strands. The actual reading capacities of sequencing reactions were 600–750 bases.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used to amplify genes encoding proteins containing the HEXXH motifLocus tagProteinAccession no.5′ primer3′ primerCT072MetalloproteaseAAC676635′TTTCGATAGTGGTGCGG3′5′AGCATACAACAATCTCCTA3′CT422MetalloproteaseAAC680195′GCTGTTCAGCATCCAC3′5′GGCTCTGCGGTGAGAAG3′CT824Metalloprotease (insulinase)AAC684215′GTAGGCTGTCTTTCTTA3′5′GAATGCTTATCCCCAGA3′CT859aNote that CT859 was annotated “metalloprotease” under the accession number AAC68457 at the time the sequence analysis was performed.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase-PDF Fusion Protein—The PDF open reading frame of C. trachomatis (CT353) (14Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) was amplified with PCR and inserted into the pGEX-6p-2 E. coli expression vector using the BamH1 and NotI digestion sites. The glutathione S-transferase-PDF fusion protein was produced in the BL21 strain of E. coli, purified with glutathione-agarose as previously described (15Toye B. Zhong G.M. Peeling R. Brunham R.C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3909-3913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production of Antibody against Chlamydial PDF—Two Balb/c mice were immunized once every 2 weeks for a total of four times with the purified glutathione S-transferase-PDF fusion protein. Sera containing polyclonal antibodies against the chlamydial PDF were collected the 10th day after the final immunization. Production of His-tagged Chlamydial PDF—The PDF open reading frame was cloned into the pET21 T7-expression vector in-frame to the carboxyl-terminal (His)6-tag using the NdeI and SalI restriction sites. The resulting pET21-PDF plasmid was transformed into the BL21(ΔDE3)pLysS strain of E. coli. Transformed pLysS cells were cultured at 37 °C till A600 reached 0.6 and then were cultured at 30 °C for 3 h in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation, lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and sonicated to shear genomic DNA. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and used for enzyme assays or for labeling with the AspR1 probe or for further purification. Cobalt-conjugated agarose was used to absorb the (His)6-PDF. Elution of the recombinant protein was carried out with 150 mm imidazole solution containing 5 mm NiSO4. PDF Activity Assay—An assay previously developed for E. coli PDF (16Rajagopalan P.T. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was modified to measure the enzyme activity of chlamydial PDF. The assay mix, in a total reaction volume of 200 μl, contained 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm NaCl, 50 or 250 ng of purified His-tagged PDF or 5 μg of crude bacterial extract, and 4 mm fMAS. For testing the effects of chemical compounds on the deformylase, fMAS was added after 50 ng of His-tagged PDF had been incubated in the presence of desired concentrations of compounds for 10 min (17Chen D.Z. Patel D.V. Hackbarth C.J. Wang W. Dreyer G. Young D.C. Margolis P.S. Wu C. Ni Z.J. Trias J. White R.J. Yuan Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The deformylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C, terminated by heating at 95 °C for 3 min, and then placed on ice. The amount of formate generated from fMAS through the action of chlamydial PDF was reported by formate dehydrogenase that uses NAD as hydrogen recipient, which has a lower A340 value compared with its reduced form NADH. Thus, the heat-inactivated PDF reaction mix was mixed with 800 μl of 50 mm Hepes containing 0.5 unit of formate dehydrogenase, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm NAD. The A340 value was recorded immediately at the end of setting up the reporting reaction mix and again after a 3-h incubation at 37 °C. To estimate the amounts of formate generated by chlamydial PDF, a series of standard assays with various sodium formate inputs (ranging from 1 μm to 1 mm) was performed. These reactions generated a straight line (data not shown). The amounts of formate generated in all reactions with the chlamydial PDF are within the range of formate standards used. Labeling of PDF with the AspR1 Probe—Binding of the AspR1 probe to the chlamydial PDF was performed with procedures previously developed for labeling matrix metalloproteases with hydroxamate-based molecular probe (5Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10000-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Extracts prepared from untransformed pLysS cells or from the bacteria transformed with the pET21-PDF vector were mixed with 1 μm probe in the presence or absence of excessive GM6001 or TAPI-0 or GMNC. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min and irradiated at 365 nm for 1 h. Rhodamine was conjugated to the probe bound to the protein by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (18Speers A.E. Adam G.C. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4686-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-azide, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, and CuSO4 (final concentrations: 12.5 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm, respectively) were added to the complex. The conjugation reaction was allowed to take place for 1 h. Labeled samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized in-gel with a Hitachi FMBio II flatbed scanner (MiraiBio, Alameda, CA). Inhibition of C. trachomatis by GM6001 and TAPI-0—GM6001 is a hydroxamate-based compound that was developed as a specific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases. Acting as a pseudosubstrate, the compound binds to the active center of the enzymes where the hydroxamic group bonds with the catalytic zinc element of the enzymes (19Levy D.E. Lapierre F. Liang W. Ye W. Lange C.W. Li X. Grobelny D. Casabonne M. Tyrrell D. Holme K. Nadzan A. Galardy R.E. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GM6001 exhibited strong inhibitory effects on C. trachomatis infection. The biovar lymphogranuloma venereum organism L2 failed to form inclusion in the human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells cultured in the presence of 25 μm GM6001 (Fig. 2A). The strong inhibitory effect remained unchanged even when cycloheximide was used to inhibit the host protein synthesis, and consequently to inhibit host RNA and DNA syntheses, and thereby maximize chlamydial replication (Fig. 2A). GM6001 showed no visible cytotoxic effects on L2 and mock infected cells (data not shown). In fact, when subconfluent HeLa cells grown in 35-mm plates (2 × 106 cells per plate) were infected with L2 and cultured in the absence of cycloheximide, there were (3.7 ± 0.58) × 106 cells per plate in the five replicate plates treated with 10 μm GM6001 at the end of the 40-h culture period, whereas there were only (2.3 ± 0.29) × 106 cells per plate in the five untreated control plates at the same time. These corresponded to average increases of 1.9- and 1.2-fold in the cell number for treated and control experiments, respectively. This difference was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Thus, GM6001 appeared to be able to reverse the inhibition of host cell proliferation caused by chlamydial infection. In addition to HeLa cells, the inhibition of L2 growth by GM6001 was also observed in human lung carcinoma A549 cells as demonstrated by dot blot analysis (Fig. 2B) as well as immunostaining of inclusions (data not shown). Moreover, GM6001 effectively suppressed inclusion formation by serovar D of biovar trachoma (Fig. 2C). Finally, by measuring chlamydial DNA synthesis as an indicator of bacterial growth (10Fan H.Z. McClarty G. Brunham R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fan H. Brunham R.C. McClarty G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a dose-response curve of GM6001 inhibiting MoPn of biovar mouse was obtained (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that GM6001 inhibits the growth of all three biovars of C. trachomatis in multiple cell types. TAPI-0 is another hydroxamic inhibitor of metalloproteases (13Fan H. Turck C.W. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18617-18627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7019-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Like GM6001, TAPI-0 showed a striking inhibitory effect on L2 growth (Fig. 2E). Therefore, inhibition of chlamydial infection appears to be a common property of hydroxamate-based inhibitors of metalloproteases. In contrast, GMNC, a chemical derivate of GM6001 containing very minor modifications (as shown in Fig. 1) which cause a loss of binding to the catalytic zinc of metalloproteases (19Levy D.E. Lapierre F. Liang W. Ye W. Lange C.W. Li X. Grobelny D. Casabonne M. Tyrrell D. Holme K. Nadzan A. Galardy R.E. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), had no detectable effect on chlamydial growth (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that GM6001 and TAPI-0 inhibit chlamydial infection by targeting one or more metalloproteases. Lack of Growth Inhibition by GM6001 and TAPI-0 against Common Bacterial Species—The observation of strong inhibitory effects of GM6001 and TAPI-0 on chlamydial replication prompted us to address whether the growth of other bacterial species is also sensitive to these compounds. Neither GM6001 nor TAPI-0 showed any inhibitory effects on the growth of E. coli, L. delbrueckii, and S. enterica in liquid cultures (Fig. 3, A–C). Because S. enterica is a facultative intracellular bacterium, we also assessed whether its intracellular growth is affected by inhibition of metalloproteases. Clearly, GM6001 did not inhibit the growth of Salmonella in HeLa cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that GM6001 and TAPI-0 specifically inhibit Chlamydiae without affecting the growth of facultative intracellular or free-living bacteria. Entry-independent Inhibition—Mammalian cells express a wide range of metalloproteases (21Lopez-Otin C. Overall C.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar); many of them are inhibited by hydroxamates (19Levy D.E. Lapierre F. Liang W. Ye W. Lange C.W. Li X. Grobelny D. Casabonne M.

Biol. 2002; 3: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The chlamydial genome also encodes several candidate zinc metalloproteases (14Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R.

https://openalex.org/W1976055428,"IEX-1 (immediate early response gene X-1) is a stress-inducible gene. Its overexpression can suppress or enhance apoptosis dependent on the nature of stress, yet the polypeptide does not possess any of the functional domains that are homologous to those present in well characterized effectors or inhibitors of apoptosis. This study using sequence-targeting mutagenesis reveals a transmembrane-like integrated region of the protein to be critical for both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions. Substitution of the key hydrophobic residues with hydrophilic ones within this region impairs the capacity IEX-1 to positively and negatively regulate apoptosis. Mutations at N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation sites or truncation of the C terminus of IEX-1 also abrogated its potential to promote cell survival. However, distinguished from the transmembrane-like domain, these mutants preserved pro-apoptotic activity of IEX-1 fully. On the contrary, mutation of nuclear localization sequence, despite its importance in apoptosis, did not impede IEX-1-mediated cell survival. Strikingly, all the mutants that lose their anti-apoptotic ability are unable to prevent acute increases in production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the initial onset of apoptosis, whereas those mutants that can sustain anti-death function also control acute ROS production as sufficiently as wild-type IEX-1. These findings suggest a critical role of IEX-1 in regulation of intracellular ROS homeostasis, providing new insight into the mechanism underlying IEX-1-mediated cell survival.

A coordinated balance between cell survival and apoptosis is essential for embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cellular responses to various types of stress (1Herr I. Debatin K.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Defects in this balance may contribute to a variety of diseases, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, and aberrant embryonic development (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). Programmed cell death occurs in mitochondrion-dependent and independent pathways, and the former accounts for most forms of apoptosis in response to cellular stress, loss of survival factors, and developmental cues (3Green D.R.

The mitochondrial pathway triggers cell death as a consequence of alteration in mitochondrial membrane permeability induced by apoptotic effectors like oxidative stress and signaling-mediated translocation of Bax, Bad, Bid, or Bim, leading to the release of cytochrome c and other proteins contained in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (5Newmeyer D.D.

Conceivably, prevention of ROS production in the initial phase of apoptosis is essential to guard the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, protecting cells from undergoing apoptosis. IEX-1 (immediate early response gene X-1), also known as IER3, p22/PRG1, Dif-2, or the mouse homologue gly96, is a stress-inducible gene (12Pietzsch A. Buchler C. Aslanidis C. Schmitz G. Biochem.

Like other immediate early response genes, IEX-1 plays a pivotal role in cell survival under conditions of stress (20Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F.

In vivo targeted expression of IEX-1 to lymphocytes protects activated T cells from apoptosis, giving rise to an extended immune response after antigen stimulation and predisposing to a lupus-like autoimmune disease and T cell lymphoma in mice (23Zhang Y.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6845-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Gene-targeted deletion of IEX-1 caused hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive (25Sommer S.L. Berndt T.J. Frank E. Patel J.B. Redfield M.M. Dong X.

In the present study, we identify distinct as well as overlapping functional regions for anti- and pro-apoptotic activities of IEX-1. Substitution of three key hydrophobic residues with hydrophilic ones in the transmembrane (TM)-like sequence is sufficient to abrogate effects of IEX-1 on inhibition and promotion of apoptosis. Additionally, N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation as well as the C-terminal sequence of IEX-1, are all crucial for anti-apoptosis activity of IEX-1, but these structures appear to exert no discernible role in pro-apoptosis. On the contrary, mutation of nuclear localization sequence, despite its importance in apoptosis, did not impede IEX-1-mediated cell survival (26Kruse M.L. Arlt A. Sieke A. Grohmann F. Grossmann M.

IEX-1-mediated cell survival is found to correlate well with its ability of reducing intracellular ROS formation either at basal levels or immediately after apoptotic stimulation. These findings, in line with IEX-1 localization in mitochondria, suggest a key role for IEX-1 in regulation of ROS homeostasis in cells. Mutagenesis—Sequence-targeting mutagenesis of human IEX-1 was carried out according to a PCR overlap extension technique using primers containing the expected mutations. The primers were forward 5′-ATGGCACACTCTCGCAGCGCACACCC-3′ and reverse 5′-TAGAAGGCGGCCGGGTGTTGCT-3′ for generating IEX-1 C2AC7A mutant; forward 5′-ACCGAGCACGCAGTGCACGCGTTCTCTACC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTAGAGAACGCGTGCACTGCGTGCTCGGTG-3′ for K60AR63A mutant; and forward 5′-CTAACACTCACCAGCGTCTTCTGTCAAATCACCATGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCATGGTGATTTGACAGAAGACGCTGGTGAGTGTTAG-3′ for transmembrane segment mutation (TM-mutant). To substitute N-glycosylated asparagine at position 133, the following primers were employed to insert an NheI restriction enzyme site: forward 5′-GGGTACCATGTGTCACTCTCGAAGCTGTCA-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGTGCTAGCAAAGGGCTCGAGGACGGG-3′ for amplification of cDNA sequence 1–414; and forward 5′-TTGCTAGCACTTCGGAGCCCTCGGACTACGCT-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGATCCGAAGGCGGCCGGGTGTTG-3′ for sequence 402–471. The two PCR products were then fused in pBluescript using an NheI restriction enzyme site. Truncation of 18 residues at the C terminus was obtained by amplification of IEX-1 cDNA sequence ranging from 1 to 414 by PCR. All the IEX-1 mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. T18A mutant was a kind gift from Dr. F. Pörteu (Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France) (21Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) IEX-1 and its variants were cloned into mammalian cell-expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For localization studies, WT IEX-1 and its TM-mutant were cloned in-frame into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) to generate GFP fusion proteins. Transfection and Apoptosis Assays—Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and p65KO3T3 cells were seeded into gelatinized 12-well plates and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. p65KO3T3 is a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line derived from NF-κB p65-knock out mice (27Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected in duplicate with various constructs, along with a LacZ-expressing reporter plasmid at a 4:1 ratio of IEX-1 construct to reporter plasmid, using Polyfect® transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 36 h, the cells were treated with apoptosis inducers for indicated times, followed by fixation of the cells with 2% formaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature, and stained with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) overnight at 37 °C. Percentages of apoptosis were blindly evaluated by counting a minimum of 200 lacZ-positive cells in three randomly selected areas of each well in duplicate samples using an inverted microscope. Apoptotic cells were determined by characteristic morphology of apoptosis (20Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, relative caspase-3 activities, indicative of apoptosis, were measured in cell lysate using a caspase-3 fluorometric substrate. Briefly, the cells were transfected with WT IEX-1 or its variant constructs and stimulated as above, followed by lysis of the cells on ice for 30 min in a cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (50 μl) was incubated in triplicate for 10 min at room temperature with a caspase-3 fluorometric substrate (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) at a final concentration of 50 μm in the lysis buffer. The caspase-3 fluorometric substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was hydrolyzed by active caspase-3 specifically, releasing fluorescent 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin that was measured at 0 and 10 min, with the fluoroMax-3 spectrometer using 380/460 nm as excitation/emission wavelength. A blank was measured in parallel without substrate and subtracted from all the measurements. Isolation of Mitochondria—293T cells stably transfected with either WT IEX-1 or TM-mutant were suspended on ice for 10 min in homogenizing buffer (H buffer; 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 1:100 protein inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) and Dounce-homogenized. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The remaining supernatant was spun at 7,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet and an ER-enriched supernatant as described (28Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7991-7995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrion-enriched pellet was washed twice by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, re-suspended in H buffer, and loaded onto a continuous sucrose gradient from 0.8 m to 1.5 m in H buffer, followed by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2 h at 4°C using an SW41-Ti rotor (L-90K Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter). The visible mitochondrial band in the sucrose gradient was carefully collected and subjected to two more rounds of sucrose gradient fractionation as above. After a final centrifugation, samples were collected consecutively from the bottom of the centrifuge tube at 0.5 ml per fraction. Each fraction was diluted with 1 ml of H buffer, pelleted by centrifugation as above, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody (Ab) specific for IEX-1. Detection of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular ROS were assayed by measuring intracellular oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) as described (29Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate is 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, Invitrogen). It is nonfluorescent until removal of the acetate groups by intracellular oxidation and thus serves as a cell-permeate indicator for ROS. To measure intracellular ROS, the substrate was added directly to cell culture at a final concentration of 5 μm and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. DCF fluorescence intensity was measured randomly at six different fields per well with a Spectra MAX GEMINI EM microplate fluorometer using 488/525 nm as excitation/emission wavelength, and the average fluorescence intensity was given by the instrument. Background controls were cells transfected with the same construct without substrate loading, and two wells for each construct were measured in parallel. Western Blot Analysis—Cells transfected with indicated constructs were lysed in cell-lysis buffer and centrifuged to remove nuclei and cell debris. Approximately 50 μg of proteins of whole cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with a polyclonal Ab specifically recognizing IEX-1, which was raised in rabbits against IEX-1 peptide sequence 51–75 (30Feldmann K.A. Pittelkow M.R. Roche P.C. Kumar R. Grande J.P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 115: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IEX-1 and its mutants were detected by incubation of the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit Ab. The x-ray films were developed using a SuperSignal West Pico Kit (Pierce). The membrane was stripped and re-probed by anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Ab or anti-cytochrome C Ab (BD Sciences) for protein loading controls. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—To determine intracellular localization of IEX-1, MCF-7 and CHO cells on gelatinized coverslips were transfected with GFP vector control, IEX-1-GFP, or TM-mu-GFP construct for 36 h and examined directly by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. To determine localization of IEX-1 in mitochondria, cells expressing GFP, IEX-1-GFP, or TM-mu-GFP were counterstained for 30 min at 37 °C in complete culture medium with MitoTracker red580 (Molecular Probes Inc.), a red fluorescence specific for mitochondria, at a concentration of 50 nm, followed by five washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The stained samples were mounted and analyzed on a Leica TCS4D confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with Leica Confocal Software Version 2.5. Statistical Analysis—Two-tailed Student's t tests were used to analyze the statistical significance of experimental samples compared with relevant controls. Target Mutagenesis of IEX-1—IEX-1 does not share any of the functional domains significantly homologous with those presented in well characterized pro- or anti-apoptotic effectors, despite its pivotal role in regulation of apoptosis. To delineate functional domains of IEX-1, a series of mutants were made on the basis of residue charge, hydrophobicity, conservation, and demonstrated functional significance in other systems, as depicted in Fig. 1A. A C2A/C7A mutant has an alanine substitution in the place of two cysteines at positions 2 and 7, on the assumption that they may be involved in formation of an intra- or inter-peptide disulfide bond and are required for IEX-1-mediated regulation of apoptosis. IEX-1 contains a polybasic sequence HRKRSRR, spanning amino residues from 58 to 64, respectively. The sequence matches a canonical nuclear localization sequence motif, K(K/R)X(K/R) (13Kondratyev A.D. Chung K.N. Jung M.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1498-1502PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kruse M.L. Arlt A. Sieke A. Grohmann F. Grossmann M. Minkenberg J. Folsch U.R. Schafer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24849-24856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Targeting Lys and Arg at positions 60 and 63 for Ala replacement generated a K60A/R63A mutant. Like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, IEX-1 has a TM-like integrated region at positions 86–101 that can potentially target the protein to the ER, Golgi, and the mitochondria as predicted by the program PSORT. In an attempt of disrupting intracellular localization of IEX-1, three hydrophobic residues at positions 90, 93, and 99 were converted to hydrophilic Thr or Ser, respectively, within the TM-like region, and the mutant is referred to as the “TM-mutant” (Fig. 1A). In addition, a previous study identified an N-linked glycosylation site at position 133 of the protein, which is highly conserved in mammals (15Charles C.H. Yoon J.K. Simske J.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 797-801PubMed Google Scholar). To test its role in the function of IEX-1, Asn at position 133 was substituted with Ala by introducing an NheI restriction enzyme site. The replacement also resulted in substitution of a leucine with a serine residue at position 134, thus generating a two-site mutation, a N133A/L134S mutant (Fig. 1A). Finally, 18 residues at the C terminus were truncated to make a Δ139–156 deletion mutant. These variants, along with WT IEX-1, were transfected into 293T cells, CHO cells, or p65KO3T3 cells. The relative levels of protein expression were assessed 36 h later. It was found that protein expression levels of these IEX-1 variants, except for Δ138–156 mutant, were comparable to those of WT IEX-1 in 293T cells (data not shown), CHO cells (Fig. 1B) and p65KO3T3 cells (data not shown), indicating that these mutations did not adversely affect the stability of the protein. Truncation of the C terminus appeared to stabilize the polypeptide or to allow one of the IEX-1 isoforms accumulating at a high level (Fig. 1B, lane 7). Considering the fact that IEX-1 is a protein with a high turnover rate, its half-life being only 15–20 min (15Charles C.H. Yoon J.K. Simske J.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 797-801PubMed Google Scholar), the finding is somewhat surprising. IEX-1 expressed as multiple protein bands in SDS-PAGE, and their sizes varied slightly with cell lines (293T versus CHO cells), with prominent protein bands at 28, 23–25, and 18–20 kDa, respectively, in agreement with previous observations (15Charles C.H. Yoon J.K. Simske J.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 797-801PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y. Finegold M.J. Porteu F. Kanteti P. Wu M.X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6845-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Feldmann K.A. Pittelkow M.R. Roche P.C. Kumar R. Grande J.P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 115: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The TM-like Domain Is Required for Both Anti- and Pro-apoptosis—To determine effects of IEX-1 mutations on cell survival, WT IEX-1 and its variant constructs were transfected, along with or without a β-galactosidase-expressing reporter plasmid, into CHO cells, followed by stimulation of the transfectants for 6 h with staurosporin. Apoptosis was evaluated by counting apoptotic cells among β-galactosidase-positive cells (Fig. 2) or measurement of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3). Staurosporin induced ∼50% of cell death in vector-transfected cells over background controls (Fig. 2A). The staurosporin-triggered apoptosis was diminished by half in cells expressing WT IEX-1, an observation similar to the early investigation (21Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Expression of C2A/C7A and K60A/R63A mutants of IEX-1 also prevented cells from staurosporin-induced cell death to a degree comparable to WT IEX-1 (Fig. 2A). The result suggests that the two cysteines at positions 2 and 7 as well as the nuclear localization signal are not required for anti-apoptotic activity of IEX-1. In contrast, CHO cells expressing the TM-mutant underwent apoptosis indistinguishable from the cells transfected with a control plasmid (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the entire TM segment, ranging from 86 to101 residues, yielded a similar result (data not shown). These data suggest a critical role for the TM-like region in IEX-1-regulated cell survival. As a positive mutation control, we included IEX-1 T18A mutant in the assay, in which a threonine at position 18, a potential ERK phosphorylation site, was replaced by alanine (21Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As reported previously, expression of T18A mutant was also ineffective in preventing cells from apoptosis triggered by staurosporin. Similar results were obtained when these transfectants were treated with varying concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 2B) or when p65KO3T3 cells were transfected with these IEX-1 variants and stimulated by TNF-α (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 3Effects of IEX-1 and its variants on caspase-3 activation. CHO cells were transfected with indicated constructs and stimulated in triplicate for 6 h with or without 400 nm staurosporin (STS) (A) or 1 mm H2O2 (B). At the end of stimulation, cells were harvested, lysed, and reacted with a caspase-3-specific fluorometric substrate. Fluorescence intensity was measured immediately (0 min) or 10 min after addition of the substrate by FluoroMax-3 spectrometer using 380/460 nm as excitation/emission wavelength. A blank was measured in parallel without substrate and subtracted from all the measurement. Relative caspase-3 activity is expressed as percentage increases (means ± S.D.) in fluorescence intensity at 10 min relative to 0 time point in the cells transfected with the same construct. **, statistical significance (p < 0.01) in the presence versus absence of overexpressed IEX-1 or its variants after apoptotic stimulation. One representative result of three independent experiments performed is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The described percentages of cell death were consistent with increased caspase-3 activity that detects apoptotic cell death in a more objective manner as compared with counting apoptotic cells in the basis of their morphology. As shown in Fig. 3A, staurosporin treatment increased caspase-3 activity in CHO cells by ∼60% in vector-transfected cells as compared with dimethyl sulfoxide solvent-containing background controls. The increment was, however, reduced to 20% or <20% over background after expressing WT IEX-1, C2A/C7A, or K60A/R63A mutants (Fig. 3A). Mutation of the TM-like domain in IEX-1 again severely impaired its ability to prevent caspase-3 activation induced by staurosporin. This also was true for H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation in CHO cells (Fig. 3B) as well as TNF-α-stimulated caspase-3 activation in p65KO3T3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the TM-like domain is indispensable for IEX-1-mediated protection against apoptosis induced by both intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. Apart from anti-death effects, IEX-1 has also been shown to facilitate apoptosis under conditions of serum deprivation (32Grobe O. Arlt A. Ungefroren H. Krupp G. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Schafer H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To see whether these mutations had any effect on pro-apoptotic activity of IEX-1, CHO cells were transfected with various IEX-1 mutants, along with or without a β-galactosidase-expressing reporter plasmid. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium or media containing only 0.1% and 0.5% serum. Overexpression of WT IEX-1 enhanced apoptosis significantly under serum deprivation as shown by increases in the percentages of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4) or in caspase-3 activation (data not shown). In addition, the apoptosis-enhancing effect of IEX-1 remained intact while two cysteines at positions 2 and 7 were mutated. Strikingly, the TM-mutant not only failed to prevent cells from apoptosis (Figs. 2 and 3) but also was unable to influence cell death or caspase-3 activation under serum starvation, when compared with WT IEX-1 (Fig. 4A and data not shown). The finding stresses an indispensable role for the TM-like domain in regulation of both anti- and pro-apoptotic activities of IEX-1. Although important in anti-apoptotic activity, T18A mutant, similar to its WT counterpart, significantly enhanced apoptosis upon serum withdrawal, suggesting that ERK-induced phosphorylation at position 18 is not essential for the observed pro-apoptotic activity of IEX-1. Perhaps the ERK signaling pathway does not work appropriately under this condition. Conversely, a K60A/R63A mutant with an altered nuclear localization sequence showed no apoptosis-enhancing effects over background (Fig. 4A), in contrast to its insignificance in cell survival, confirming early investigation (26Kruse M.L.

Using transfected HEK 293T cells, treatment with a nonpeptide antagonist, SR49059, dramatically increased (∼60-fold) the surface expression of a misfolded, nonfunctional and intracellularly localized vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) mutant (D148A). This rescue of surface expression (111 ± 7%) was almost identical to wild type assessed by confocal microscopy and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based techniques. Recovery was not specific to D148A, since other surface-impaired mutations, D148N and D148E, and wild type were also increased following SR49059 exposure. However, surface delivery was specific to SR49059, since V1aR-selective peptide ligands or unrelated ligands were unable to mimic this action, suggesting that SR49059 acts intracellularly. SR49059-mediated surface rescue was time-, mutant-, and concentration-dependent but not directly related to its binding affinity. Maximal recovery was achieved following 12 h of treatment and did not involve de novo receptor synthesis or a consequence of preventing endogenous constitutive activity and/or internalization. Once at the surface, all mutants displayed enhanced signaling ability, and D148A was able to undergo agonist-mediated internalization. SR49059 was not effectively removed from the receptor, since signaling (EC50) of both wild type and D148A was reduced ∼40-fold. This is the first report of a pharmacological chaperone ligand to act on misfolded mutant V1a Rs. This work provides an excellent model to understand the mechanistic action of an important new class of drug that may have potential in the treatment of diseases caused by inherited mutations.

This complex sorting system provides an environment for folding, initial post-translation modifications and oligomeric assembly of proteins prior to their translocation to other regions of the cell. This regulated system also prevents misfolded proteins and/or accumulation of defective proteins that potentially can interfere with other cellular processes and promote their degradation via ubiquitination/proteasome pathways (reviewed in Refs. 3Wojcikiewicz J.H.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Protein misfolding can be caused by genetic mutation, fluctuations in temperature, cellular stress, and activation of signaling pathways that result in major diseases (4McClellan A.J. Tam S. Kaganovich D. Frydman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins are responsible for neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer (β-amyloid) and Parkinson disease (α-synuclein). Inherited mutations within cell surface receptors, such as ΔF508 in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (cystic fibrosis), enzymes (e.g. β-glucosidase) (lysosomal storage diseases), and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), retinitis pigmentosa (rhodopsin), melanocortin 4-receptor (familial obesity (5Nijenhuis W.A.

Conn P.M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 821-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Strategies to reverse or rescue the effects of misfolded proteins represent major avenues for experimental and therapeutic intervention. Among these strategies is manipulation of the pathways involving endogenous ER molecular chaperone proteins (e.g. calnexin) (1Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 2Welch W.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Katsanis E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 493-514PubMed Google Scholar), which regulate the binding, folding, stabilizing protein conformations, assembly, and/or signals for degradation of newly synthesized or misfolded proteins. Chemical agents, such as Me2SO, glycerol, and trimethylamine-N-oxide, can exert nonspecific chaperone effects by stabilizing some misfolded proteins and increasing their trafficking (2Welch W.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Bernier V. Lagacé M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). More recently, small ligands that represent a new class of compound termed “pharmacological chaperones” provide a more specific approach to target individual misfolded proteins (6Bernier V. Lagacé M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Ulloa-Aguirre A. Janovick J.A. Brothers S.P. Conn P.M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 821-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These nonpeptidic cell-permeable compounds have been suggested to stabilize a conformation within the protein architecture that can bypass ER quality control and reverse the effects of the defective protein. In the case of GPCRs, pharmacological ligands (antagonists and agonists) provide an alternative strategy to functionally rescue disease-causing mutations that are intracellularly retained. These include receptors V2R (9Morello J.-P. Salahpour A. Laperrière A. Bernier V. Arthus M.-F. Lonergan M. Petäjä-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin.

The action of chaperone ligands is not only restricted to mutant GPCRs, since maturation of wild-type (WT) δ-opioid receptors can also be increased upon exposure (17Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Bhalla S. Laperrière A. Morello J.P. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In general, very little is known about their mechanism(s) of action and if the pharmacology of receptor is normal following administration of this type of ligand. The structurally related nonapeptides hormones vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) mediate a plethora of physiological functions, including vasopressor and antidiuretic actions, by activation of specific receptors (18Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 19Thibonnier M. Coles P. Thibonnier A. Shoham M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four AVP/OT receptor subtypes (V1aR, V1bR, V2R, and OTR) have been cloned from different species and constitute a subfamily of the larger GPCR superfamily. The V1aR is widely expressed and mediates nearly all of the actions of AVP with the exception of antidiuresis (renal V2R) and adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion (pituitary V1bR). AVP mediates vascular smooth muscle (V1aR) contraction and regulates cardiovascular function (19Thibonnier M. Coles P. Thibonnier A. Shoham M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast, OT results in contraction of uterine myometrium (OTRs) during labor and mammary myoepithelium to elicit lactation (18Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). With the exception of the V2R (which couples to adenylyl cyclase), these receptors couple to Gαq/11, thereby generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol as second messengers. Ligands developed toward specific receptors within the AVP/OT receptor family have been reported to act as pharmacological chaperones (9Morello J.-P. Salahpour A. Laperrière A. Bernier V.

The aim of this study was to determine (i) if these and other related ligands can act as a pharmacological chaperones and rescue the surface expression of previously identified misfolded mutant V1aR (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and if so (ii) the conditions required to do this and (iii) if their pharmacology is normal once delivered at the cell surface. Materials—The cyclic antagonist 1-(β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine AVP (CA) was purchased from Bachem (St. Helens, UK). AVP and linear antagonist phenyl acteyl-d-Tyr(Me)2Arg6Tyr(NH2)9AVP (LA) were from Sigma (Poole, UK).

Cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen (Uxbridge, UK). All other reagents were of analytic grade and obtained from various commercial suppliers. Mutant Receptor Constructs—All mutations of the V1aR were made previously by PCR and have been described in detail (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All mutations (including the WT rat V1aR) in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 contained a previously engineered N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (21Hawtin S.R. Wheatley M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 437SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT rat A1R and mutant constructs (A1RΔ22 and A1RΔ34) in pcDNA3 (22Pankevych H. Korkhov V. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30283-30293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Dr. Edin Ibrisimovic and Dr. Christian Nanoff (University of Vienna, Austria). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, glutamine (2 mm), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm) in humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and transfected after 36 h using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol using 10 μg of DNA/dish. Radioligand Binding Assays—A washed cell membrane preparation of HEK 293T cells, transfected with the appropriate receptor construct, was prepared 36 h post-transfection as previously described (23Hawtin S.R. Wesley V.J Parslow R.A. Simms J. Miles A McEwan K. Wheatley M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Competition radioligand binding assays were performed in MultiScreen™ HTS 96-well opaque plates (Millipore, Watford, UK) containing 1.0-μm glass fiber (GF/B) filters and using the natural agonist [Phe3-3,4,5-3H]AVP (73 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as tracer ligand. Radioligand binding assays were performed as described previously (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Essentially, each well contained radioligand (1.0–1.6 nm), cell membranes (120–190 μg), and competing ligand and was incubated at 25 °C for 90 min. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm unlabeled AVP. Bound radioligand was separated from free ligand by filtration, and radioactivity was measured using a Topcount NXT scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the addition of Microscint20 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression to fit theoretical Langmuir binding isotherms to the experimental data using Prism4 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Individual IC50 values obtained for competing ligands were corrected for radioligand occupancy as described (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar), using the radioligand affinity (Ki) experimentally determined for each construct. AVP-induced Inositol Phosphate Production—HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates and transfected after 24 h using Transfast™ (Promega Corp., Southampton, UK). The assay for AVP-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates (InsPs) has been described in detail recently (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 h post-transfection, medium was replaced with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (20.0 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 24 h. Cells were washed five times with PBS and then incubated in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min, after which AVP was added at the concentrations indicated for a further 30 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 0.1 m HCOOH for 30 min. Samples were loaded onto AG1-X8 columns (formate form; Bio-Rad). A mixed inositol fraction containing mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (InsP-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) was eluted with 5 ml of 850 mm NH4COOH containing 0.1 m HCOOH, mixed with UltimaFlo AF scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression after fitting of logistic sigmoidal curves to the experimental data using GraphPad Prism4. Cell Surface Expression of Mutant Receptors—Cell surface expression of mutant V1aR constructs was determined by performing an indirect ELISA-based method as described (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates and transfected after 24 h using Transfast™. After 36 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 15 min at 25 °C. Cells were washed (3 × 5 min in TBS) prior to the addition of 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS for 45 min to block nonspecific binding. The anti-HA primary antibody (HA-7; Sigma) diluted to 1:30,000 in 3% (w/v) BSA/TBS was incubated on cells for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and reblocked (15 min) prior to incubation with secondary goat anti-mouse conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) diluted to 1:20,000 in 3% (w/v) BSA/TBS for 60 min. Cells were gently washed prior to the addition of colorimetric alkaline phosphate substrate p-nitrophenol phosphate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C (45 min) prior to removal of samples for colorimetric reading at 405 nm using an MRX plate reader (Dynatech Technologies, Chantilly, VA). For each experiment, mock conditions corresponding to the transfection of empty vector were included. The percentage of mutant receptor expressed at the cell surface is defined as 100 × ((ODmutant – ODmock)/(ODWT – ODmock)). All experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition, and values were obtained from at least three separate experiments. Agonist-mediated Internalization of Mutant Receptors—HEK 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected as described above. After 36 h, medium from cells was replaced with fresh growth medium prior to the addition of AVP to induce V1aR internalization at various time intervals and incubated at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. Quantification of receptors remaining at the cell surface was determined using ELISA as described above. The percentage of mutant receptor internalized is defined as 100 × ((ODbasal – ODmock) – (ODstimulated – ODmock))/(ODbasal – ODmock). All experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition, and values are from at least three separate experiments. Immunohistocytochemistry—HEK 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates containing poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (12 mm) and transfected using Transfast™ as described above. Cells were fixed and washed with TBS as described for ELISA. Cells were blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA/TBS containing glycine (1% (w/v)) for 45 min, followed by incubation with anti-HA primary antibody (diluted to 1:3,000 in 3% (w/v) BSA/glycine/TBS for 60 min. Cells were washed with TBS (3 × 5 min) prior to reblocking with 10% (v/v) goat serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were labeled with secondary antibody goat anti-mouse rhodamine red X (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) (diluted to 1:500 in 10% (v/v) goat serum in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. After a further three washes, coverslips were mounted on glass slides prior to confocal microscopy. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning microscope with a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. The HA-tagged receptors were visualized by exciting the rhodamine red X secondary antibody with a 543-nm HeNe laser and a 560-nm long pass filter. For each slide, images were captured at random sites from three separate experiments. The gains and offsets were kept constant for each image that was generated using the Zeiss LSM software (Jena, Germany). Recovery of Cell Surface Expression of a Misfolded Vasopressin V1a Receptor Using a Nonpeptide Antagonist—We have previously reported that a mutant [D148A]V1aR within the highly conserved DRY motif resulted in a misfolded receptor that was nonfunctional and localized intracellularly (Fig. 1) (20Hawtin S.R.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), an initial aim of this study was to investigate if a V1aR-specific ligand could act as a pharmacological chaperone by facilitating the trafficking/delivery of the [D148A]V1aRtothe cell surface. The nonpeptide ligand SR49059 was originally developed as a high affinity antagonist specific for V1aRs (25Serradeil-Le Gal C. Wagnon J. Garcia C. Lacour C. Guiraudou P. Christophe B. Villanova G. Nisato D. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As was previously reported, the [D148A]V1aR is poorly expressed on the cell surface of transfected HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2B) (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following a post-transfection treatment with SR49059 (10 mm; 20 h), a dramatic increase in localization of [D148A]V1aR was observed at the cell surface (Fig. 2D). This restoration of surface receptor localization was comparable with that observed for the WT V1aR when performed in parallel experiments (Fig. 2B). In contrast, treatment with SR49059 had little effect on localization of WT receptor compared without treatment (Fig. 2B) or cells expressing a control vector lacking receptor (data not shown).FIGURE 2Rescue of cell surface localization of Ala148 mutant receptor using a pharmacological chaperone ligand SR49059. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged WT V1aR or [D148A]V1aR. Post-transfection (16 h), cells were treated with vehicle (A and B) or SR49059 (10 μm) (C and D) and incubated for a further 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and processed for immmunocytochemistry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phase images (A and C) or excitation (543 nm) with the HeNe laser and a 560-nm long pass emission filter (B and D) are shown.

To overcome this, an ELISA-based assay with a high signal/noise ratio was developed to quantify surface expression of receptors incorporating an HA epitope sequence engineered at their amino terminus (Fig. 1) (20Hawtin S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Incorporation of this 9-amino acid sequence was previously shown not to affect ligand binding or signaling compared with an untagged WT V1aR (21Hawtin S.R. Wheatley M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 437SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was used in all subsequent experiments. Using the ELISA-based assay, SR49059 was able to significantly increase (56-fold) the surface expression of [D148A]V1aR compared with cells without treatment (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Furthermore, this recovery was almost identical to normal WT V1aR surface expression levels (Fig. 3A, Table 1) and was consistent with previous results obtained using confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). This dramatic increase in surface expression using SR49059 was not only specific to the [D148A]V1aR mutant, since WT receptor expression was also slightly increased (∼20%) compared with the level without treatment using the ELISA assay (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Together, these results show that the nonpeptide antagonist SR49059 is capable of acting as a pharmacological chaperone ligand by rescuing the surface expression of a misfolded mutant receptor.TABLE 1Ligand-specific recovery of cell surface expression of WT and mutant V1aRsReceptorCell surface expression (percentage of WT)ControlSR49059CALALA/SR49059SR121463SSR149415%%%%%%%WT100 (8)122 ± 4 (6)ap < 0.05 compared with each V1aR without drug treatment using ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett's test analysis (GraphPad Prism4).106 ± 6114 ± 3136 ± 11ap < 0.05 compared with each V1aR without drug treatment using ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett's test analysis (GraphPad Prism4).90 ± 7 (4)113 ± 11 (4)D148A2 ± 2 (7)bValues taken from Ref. 20.109 ± 7 (6)cp < 0.01 compared with each V1aR without drug trea"

In addition, OCA-B is crucial for B cell activation and germinal center formation. However, the molecular mechanisms for OCA-B function in these processes are not clear. Our previous studies documented two OCA-B isoforms and suggested a novel mechanism for the function of the myristoylated, membrane-bound form of OCA-B/p35 as a signaling molecule. Here, we report the identification of galectin-1, and related galectins, as a novel OCA-B-interacting protein. The interaction of OCA-B and galectin-1 can be detected both in vivo and in vitro. The galectin-1 binding domain in OCA-B has been localized to the N terminus of OCA-B. In B cells lacking OCA-B expression, increased galectin-1 expression, secretion, and cell surface association are observed. Consistent with these observations, and a reported inhibitory interaction of galectin-1 with CD45, the phosphatase activity of CD45 is reduced modestly, but significantly, in OCA-B-deficient B cells. Finally, galectin-1 is shown to negatively regulate B cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation upon BCR stimulation. Together, these results raise the possibility that OCA-B may regulate BCR signaling through an association with galectin-1.

Studies of OCA-B-deficient mice revealed that OCA-B has a broad role in regulating B cell development, acting in both antigen-independent and antigen-dependent processes (7Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S.

Nevertheless, the most dramatic defect in mice lacking OCA-B expression is an inability of these mice to form germinal centers (GCs) 3The abbreviations used are: GC, germinal center; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; IL-4, interleukin-4; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. or to express normal levels of isotype-switched secondary immunoglobulins (7Kim U.

Nature. 1996; 383: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The latter defect is due, at least in part, to reduced levels of transcription from normally switched Ig heavy chain loci rather than to defects in isotype switching per se, whereas OCA-B functions relevant to GC formation are still unclear. Although several new OCA-B target genes have been identified (17Brunner C. Laumen H. Nielsen P.J. Kraut N. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45231-45239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Kim U. Gunther C.S. Roeder R.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6825-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Laumen H. Brunner C. Greiner A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1577-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), none of these are fully responsible for the impaired GC formation in Oca-b–/– mice and as yet unidentified OCA-B target genes might be critical for this process (16Teitell M.A. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 546-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, other mechanisms might be also involved in OCA-B-mediated T cell-dependent immune responses. In fact, OCA-B has been shown to be essential for optimal BCR signaling, as B cell proliferation upon BCR stimulation is dramatically reduced in B cells lacking OCA-B (7Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussenzweig M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, reduced calcium influx and weaker and delayed substrate tyrosine phosphorylation after IgM stimulation are also observed in Oca-b–/– B cells (13Samardzic T. Marinkovic D. Nielsen P.J. Nitschke L. Wirth T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8320-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Brunner C. Marinkovic D. Klein J. Samardzic T. Nitschke L. Wirth T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, OCA-B plays a positive role in BCR signaling and B cell activation. Insufficient activation of Oca-b–/– B cells, along with other defects such as reduced expression of BLR1 and a consequent poorer homing ability (18Kim U. Gunther C.S. Roeder R.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6825-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), could result in impaired GC formation. The molecular mechanism for OCA-B-mediated BCR signaling is unknown. It is possible that OCA-B might modulate BCR signal transduction indirectly through its target genes. Additionally, an effect of OCA-B outside of the nucleus could be also involved in B cell responses to environmental stimuli and, thus, GC formation. Related to the last possibility is our recent description of a p35 OCA-B isoform that is generated from the single OCA-B mRNA via an alternative translation start site (20Yu X. Wang L. Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Immunity. 2001; 14: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the p34 isoform of OCA-B that is exclusively nuclear and functions as a transcriptional coactivator, p35 can be found both in the cell nucleus and in the cytosol and/or on the cell membrane and may represent a novel type of signaling molecule in B lymphocytes. This distinct property of p35 appears to result, at least in part, from the myristoylation of its N-terminal glycine residue, which represents a surprising and unprecedented modification of a transcription factor (20Yu X. Wang L. Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Immunity. 2001; 14: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that a novel mechanism mediated by OCA-B/p35 is involved in OCA-B-regulated B cell proliferation and differentiation. Recently, members of the galectin family of lectins have been found to play regulatory roles in the development of immune cells and to influence various immune response events. Among the 14 members, a 14-kDa polypeptide called galectin-1 has been shown to be expressed both in B lymphocytes and in other cell types (21Rabinovich G.A. Baum L.G. Tinari N. Paganelli R. Natoli C. Liu F.T. Iacobelli S. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Galectin-1, like other family members, contains a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and has affinity for β-galactosides. Lacking typical transmembrane segments and secretion signal peptides, galectin-1, like other members in this family, is secreted by a nonconventional pathway and binds to various cell surface receptors to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, to control cell growth or to induce apoptosis (22Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The intracellular galectin-1 is found mainly in the cytosol, although nuclear localization of galectin-1 can also be observed (24Wang J.L. Gray R.M. Haudek K.C. Patterson R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Changes of galectin-1 localization within subcellular compartments have been shown to correlate with the developmental and differentiation status of cells (25Choi J.Y. van Wijnen A.J. Aslam F. Leszyk J.D. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Penman S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3035-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Galectin-1 has been demonstrated to regulate T cell homeostasis and function (26Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 27Sotomayor C.E. Rabinovich G.A. Dev. Immunol. 2000; 7: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, a possible galectin-1 function in the B cell compartment is largely unexplored. As in other cell types, B cell galectin-1 may have both autocrine and paracrine functions. In support of this idea, it has been shown that galectin-1 can be secreted by activated B cells and that it can regulate T cell function (28Zuniga E. Rabinovich G.A. Iglesias M.M. Gruppi A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar). Stromal cell surface galectin-1 is crucial for pre-BCR signaling and acts through interaction with the surrogate light chain of the pre-BCR (29Gauthier L. Rossi B. Roux F. Termine E. Schiff C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13014-13019Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Another B cell surface receptor for galectin-1 is the glycoprotein CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase that is important for positive regulation of BCR signaling cascade and B cell proliferation and maturation (30Byth K.F. Conroy L.A. Howlett S. Smith A.J. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). By binding to CD45, galectin-1 can modulate its phosphatase activity and, therefore, influence the downstream Src-kinase activity (Lyn in pre-B cells) and B cell proliferation (31Fouillit M. Joubert-Caron R. Poirier F. Bourin P. Monostori E. Levi-Strauss M. Raphael M. Bladier D. Caron M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant galectin-1 has also been reported to induce apoptosis of transformed B cells but not normal B cells (32Murphy J.J. Stevanin T. Schoendorf D.S. Wells V. Mallucci L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 248SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33Wells V. Davies D. Mallucci L. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 978-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to galectin-1, the galectin family member galectin-3 was recently found to be expressed by activated murine B cells (34Acosta-Rodriguez E.V. Montes C.L. Motran C.C. Zuniga E.I. Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Gruppi A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 function is critical for signaling during IL-4-induced survival and differentiation of B cells (34Acosta-Rodriguez E.V. Montes C.L. Motran C.C. Zuniga E.I. Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Gruppi A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In normal human B cells, galectin-3 expression varies among specific B-cell developmental stages, with the lowest level in GC B cells and higher levels in naïve and memory B cells (35Hoyer K.K. Pang M. Gui D. Shintaku I.P. Kuwabara I. Liu F.T. Said J.W. Baum L.G. Teitell M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 and galectin-1 share similar chemical properties. However, unlike galectin-1, which is a proapoptotic factor for B lymphocytes, intracellular galectin-3 exhibits an anti-apoptotic activity that likely is mediated by interactions with Bcl-2 and other proteins implicated in apoptosis (i.e. Fas and Syntexin) (36Yang R.Y. Liu F.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In efforts to understand the role of OCA-B in BCR-mediated signal transduction, an unbiased yeast two-hybrid-based screen for cytoplasmic partners of OCA-B identified an OCA-B association with galectin-8. An extension of this study revealed interactions of OCA-B with the related CRD domain-containing polypeptides galectin-1 and galectin-3 as novel OCA-B interacting proteins in B lymphocytes. An examination of galectin-1 expression and secretion levels in Oca-b–/– B cells revealed increased levels of total and surface galectin-1 in comparison with wild-type B cells. Along with the demonstration of a modest, but nonetheless significant, reduction of CD45 phosphatase activity in Oca-b–/– B lymphocytes and the ability of recombinant galectin-1 to reduce BCR stimulation-mediated growth of B lymphocytes, these observations raise the possibility of BCR regulation by OCA-B through galectin-1 and its receptors, including CD45, on the B cell surface. Animals—10–14-Week-old Oca-b–/– mice (7Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussenzweig M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used for all experiments. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Laboratory Animal Research Center within The Rockefeller University. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as previously described (37Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid encoding the Cyto-trap bait was generated by inserting the cDNA sequences for OCA-B (1–140 amino acids) into pSos. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Cdc25H was transformed sequentially with pSos-OCA-B and a murine spleen cDNA library (Stratagene). The mammalian expression vectors encoding hybrid proteins were produced by inserting OCA-B/p35 sequences into the pCMV-GAL4 vector or by inserting galectin-1 cDNA sequences into the pVP-FLAG7 vector. A mammalian two-hybrid assay was conducted in 293T cells as described previously (37Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—Recombinant GST fusion or HIS-tagged proteins were expressed in bacterial cells and immobilized on glutathione or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. Then 6 μl of protein-conjugated beads (containing ∼6 μg of protein) was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 5 or 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled proteins or with 100 ng of purified HIS-galectin-1 in a final volume of 200 μlof BC150 (150 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) containing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors. In some cases, recombinant proteins were coupled to lactosyl-agarose beads. Equal amounts of protein-conjugated beads (containing ∼20 μg of proteins) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 150 μg of primary B cell lysate in a final volume of 500 μl of BC150 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. The beads were washed five times with incubation buffer, boiled in 10 μl of the 2× SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by autoradiography. In Vivo Cross-linking and Co-immunoprecipitation—Namalwa cells were treated with 2.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) for 25 min at room temperature and a total cell lysate in RIPA buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) was prepared. An equivalent amount of lysate in RIPA buffer from uncross-linked cells was also included as a control. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-OCA-B antibody. For conventional co-immunoprecipitation, lysates of Namalwa cells were prepared in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40 with 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against BC100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors. The lysates then were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-galectin-1 antibody. For transfection and co-immunoprecipitation assays, 293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-galectin-1 and OCA-B/p35 (either wild-type or mutant with a glycine to alanine change at the N-terminal myristoylation site) (20Yu X.

Cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection in BC300 (300 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. The lysates then were subjected to immunoprecipitation with M2-agarose. Proteins that specifically bind to M2-agarose beads were eluted with FLAG peptides and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B Cell Isolation and Immunoblot Analysis—Murine splenocytes were isolated from 10–14-week-old mice. T cells were depleted by Dyna-beads mouse pan T (Thy1.2) beads (DYNAL, Inc., Lake Success, NY) followed by overnight incubation to remove adherent cells. The purity of B cell preparations was evaluated by FACS analysis on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) after staining cells with B220-FITC (RA3–6B2), Mac-1-PE (M1/70), and CD3ε-APC (145–2C11) (all from BD Pharmingen). In all experiments, B cell homogeneity was more than 89%. Purified living cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum. When necessary, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml anti-μ (F(ab′)2) (Pierce), 1 μg/ml anti-CD40 (HM40–3, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and 50 units/ml of IL-4 (Invitrogen) as indicated. Dead cells were removed with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences). Then total cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer and equal amounts of total protein were subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies: goat anti-galectin-1 monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems), anti-Bob.1/OCA-B antibody (Santa Cruz), and anti-Lyn polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). For tyrosine phosphorylation analysis, cells were treated as indicated and washed with PBS, 1 mm vanadate. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer containing 1 mm vanadate and 1 mm NaF. Tyrosine phosphorylation was evaluated with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upsate Biotechnology). Blots were then stripped and probed with ERK-specific antibody (Santa Cruz). For secretion assays, isolated B cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, and ITS supplement (Sigma). Cell viability (>90%) was evaluated by trypan blue analysis. Cultured supernatants were collected after 12 h and concentrated 30-fold by centrifugation. Equal amounts of total protein from each supernatant were used for immunoblot analysis. Values were quantified with ImageQuant software. To evaluate surface-bound galectin-1, cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated in PBS, 200 mm lactose on ice for 1 h. Galectin-1 levels were analyzed with anti-galectin-1 (R&D Systems). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS, and stained with the indicated antibodies. Images were collected using a confocal microscope (LSM 510 microscope; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). FACS Analysis—Murine splenocytes were collected from 4 to 6 mice and prepared for staining according to standard procedures. Samples (1 × 106 cells) were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) until 5 × 105 events were acquired. In some experiments, 2.5 × 106 cells were analyzed on the BD LSR II system (BD Biosciences) until 1 × 106 events were acquired. Cell surface markers were detected using the following antibodies: B220-FITC (RA3–6B2), IgM-PE-Cy7 (R6–60.2), IgD-Biotin (217–170), CD21-TITC (7G6), SAv-APC (all from BD Pharmingen), goat anti-galectin-1 monoclonal antibody (R&D systems), and anti-goat PE (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA). CD45 Phosphatase Assay—Purified splenic B cells were subjected to CD45 phosphatase assay as described with minor modifications (38Lago Paz F. Galgani M. D'Oro U. Matarese G. Masci A.M. Zappacosta S. Racioppi L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In brief, T-depleted B cells were lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij 97 (Sigma), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CD45 antibody (RA3–6B2, BD Biosciences) and immune complexes were incubated at room temperature for 12 h in 500 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Reactions were terminated by addition of 500 μl of 1 n NaOH. Products were quantified by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Cell Growth Analysis—T-depleted B cells from wild-type mice were further purified by discontinuous Percoll gradient as described (7Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussenzweig M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and seeded in 96-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. Cells were pre-treated with the indicated amounts of galectin-1 (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) for 4 h at 37 °C. The indicated inducers were then introduced into culture medium and cells were subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays after a 40-h incubation at 37 °C according to manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Our previous results showed that OCA-B/p35 is located in both cytoplamic/membrane and nuclear compartments and suggested that it might function as a novel signaling molecule in B lymphocytes (20Yu X. Wang L. Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Immunity. 2001; 14: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the role of OCA-B/p35 in BCR-mediated signal transduction, we sought to identify proteins that bind to cytoplasmic OCA-B in B cells. We employed a yeast two-hybrid (SRS) screening method using the mouse OCA-B/p35 N-terminal domain (140 amino acids) as a bait. After several rounds of screening, we isolated seven positive clones from approximately 10 million transformants of a cDNA library derived from mouse splenocytes. Binding of proteins encoded by these clones to the full-length OCA-B was checked by back transformation of each into the reporter yeast strain containing full-length OCA-B/p35 as a bait. A cDNA clone encoding the C-terminal region (143 amino acids) of mouse galectin-8 showed strong and specific interaction with OCA-B/p35 in yeast. Because there have been no reports of galectin-8 expression in B lymphocytes and because our reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses failed to detect galectin-8 mRNA either in primary murine B cells or in most B cell lines (data not shown), these results may reflect an association of OCA-B with other galectins that are expressed in B lymphocytes. In fact, the related galectin-1 is expressed by activated B cells (28Zuniga E. Rabinovich G.A. Iglesias M.M. Gruppi A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar) and by B cells at various developmental stages (39Hoffmann R. Seidl T. Neeb M. Rolink A. Melchers S. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting a function in B lymphopoiesis. To examine an intracellular interaction of galectin-1 and OCA-B, we used a mammalian two-hybrid assay with vectors expressing murine galectin-1 fused to the VP16 transcription activation domain and OCA-B fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. 293T cells were transfected with these vectors, an internal control plasmid, and a reporter containing five GAL4 binding sites fused to the luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas the coexpression of GAL4 with VP16 or VP16-galectin-1 fusion proteins resulted in basal reporter activity, an 8-fold activation of reporter gene was observed when VP16 and GAL4-OCA-B (p35) were coexpressed. This effect is largely due to the transactivation activity of OCA-B when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (40Luo Y. Ge H. Stevens S. Xiao H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3803-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a more dramatic induction of reporter gene activity (∼40-fold) was achieved with the coexpression of GAL4-OCA-B and VP16-galectin-1 in 293T cells, indicating that OCA-B interacts with galectin-1 in mammalian cells. To confirm this interaction, we performed GST pulldown assays by incubating in vitro translated [35S]galectin-1 with immobilized GST-OCA-B fusion protein or GST alone. In this assay, [35S]galectin-1 bound to GST-OCA-B but not to GST (Fig. 1B), consistent with a direct interaction between OCA-B and galectin-1. Similarly, a purified HIS-tagged galectin-1 (expressed in bacteria) bound to GST-OCA-B but not to GST alone (Fig. 1C), strongly suggesting a direct protein-protein association between OCA-B and galectin-1. To document a possible interaction between OCA-B and galectin-1 in B lymphocytes, whole cell extracts from Namalwa B cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-galectin-1 or control antibody. As shown by the immunoblot analysis in Fig. 1D, OCA-B, but not the unrelated protein RPC39, was precipitated from Namalwa whole cell extracts by anti-galectin-1, but not control antibody, confirming an association of these two polypeptides in B cells. In a parallel analysis involving co-immunoprecipitation with anti-OCA-B antibody, cells were incubated with the bifunctional cross-linker DSP prior to extract preparation and co-immunoprecipitation. This analysis showed galectin-1 (predominantly monomer) immunoprecipitation with the OCA-B-specific antiserum, but not with preimmune serum or with OCA-B-specific antiserum in the absence of DSP treatment, and there was no co-immunoprecipitation of unrelated polypeptide (RPC39) under any conditions (Fig. 1E). The observation that DSP cross-linking is required for visulization of an intracellular OCA-B-galectin-1 interaction with anti-OCA-B co-immunoprecipitation, but not with anti-galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitation, may simply reflect the relative efficacies of the two antibodies in recognizing their epitopes in the OCA-B-galectin-1 complex and/or a difference in stability following antibody conjugation. Similarly, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of OCA-B and galectin-1 from BJAB whole cell extracts by anti-galectin-1 (data not shown). To gain further evidence for an intracellular OCA-B/galectin-1 interaction, immunofluorescent staining analyses were conducted with the Namalwa B cell line and with primary murine B cells. Staining of endogenous OCA-B and galectin-1 showed co-localizati"

Langerin, a cell surface C-type lectin of Langerhans cells, can be internalized and accumulates in Birbeck granules, subdomains of the endosomal recycling compartment that are specific to Langerhans cells. Langerin binds and mediates uptake and degradation of glycoconjugates containing mannose and related sugars. Analysis of the human genome has identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms that result in amino acid changes in the carbohydrate-recognition domain of langerin. The effects of the amino acid changes on the activity of langerin were examined by expressing each of the polymorphic forms. Expression of full-length versions of the four common langerin haplotypes in fibroblasts revealed that all of these forms can mediate endocytosis of neoglycoprotein ligands. However, sugar binding assays and differential scanning calorimetry performed on fragments from the extracellular domain showed that two of the amino acid changes reduce the affinity of the carbohydrate-recognition domain for mannose and decrease the stability of the extracellular domain. In addition, analysis of sugar binding by langerin containing the rare W264R mutation, previously identified in an individual lacking Birbeck granules, shows that this mutation abolishes sugar binding activity. These findings suggest that certain langerin haplotypes may differ in their binding to pathogens and thus might be associated with susceptibility to infection.

Langerin (CD207) is a cell surface C-type lectin located on Langerhans cells (1Valladeau J. Duvert-Frances V. Pin J.-J. Dezutter-Dambuyant C. Vincent C. Massacrier C. Vincent J. Yoneda K.

Biol. 2005; 25: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Langerin binds glycoconjugates containing mannose and related sugars and is able to mediate uptake and degradation of such ligands (5Takahara K. Omatsu Y. Yashima Y. Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Iyoda T.

Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These properties may allow langerin to play a role in antigen uptake and processing, the main function of Langerhans cells (7Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar). Evidence for such a role comes from the finding that anti-human langerin antibodies block uptake and presentation of mycobacterial nonpeptide antigens to CD1a-restricted T cells by Langerhans cells (8Hunger R.E. Sieling P.A. Ochoa M.T. Sugaya M. Rea T.H. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T. Blauvelt A. Porcelli S.A. Modlin R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Langerin is a type II transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular region consisting of a neck and a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). 3The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; Man-BSA, mannose30-bovine serum albumin; MBP-A, serum mannose-binding protein; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The CRDs bind mannose and related sugars, but like other C-type CRDs they exhibit only low affinity for monosaccharides and oligomerization is required for binding of oligosaccharide ligands (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Langerin oligomerizes to form stable trimers held together by a coiled coil of α-helices in the neck region (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of langerin is likely to be involved in internalization, but it does not contain typical internalization motifs identified in other endocytic receptors (1Valladeau J. Duvert-Frances V. Pin J.-J. Dezutter-Dambuyant C. Vincent C. Massacrier C. Vincent J. Yoneda K. Banchereau J. Caux C. Davoust J. Saeland S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2695-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP) shows three single nucleotide polymorphisms that result in amino acid changes in the CRD of human langerin. A rare mutation in the CRD of langerin that results in loss of Birbeck granules has also been identified in one individual (9Verdijk P. Dijkman R. Plasmeijer E.I. Mulder A.A. Zoutman W.H. Mommaas A.M. Tensen C.P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 714-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These changes have the potential to affect the activity of langerin and thus might also affect susceptibility to certain diseases, particularly those infectious diseases caused by microorganisms that contain surface glycans that can interact with langerin. This report presents analysis of the biochemical properties and functions of five forms of human langerin that each differ by one amino acid residue in the CRD. The results indicate that two of the amino acid changes reduce the stability of langerin and its affinity for mannose, whereas the rare tryptophan to arginine mutation abolishes sugar binding activity. Materials—Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Monosaccharides and Sepharose 4B were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Na125I and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside were from Amersham Biosciences. Mannose30-bovine serum albumin (Man-BSA) was purchased from E.-Y. Laboratories (San Mateo, CA) and iodinated by the chloramine-T method (10Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). Human genomic DNA samples were obtained from the European Cell Culture Collection (Porton Down, UK). Immulon 4 96-well microtiter plates were from Dynex Technologies (Worthing, UK). Mannose-Sepharose and galactose-Sepharose were prepared by the divinyl sulfone method (11Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Polymorphic Forms of Langerin—Amino acid changes corresponding to the polymorphisms in the CRD of human langerin were introduced into the human langerin cDNA using synthetic oligonucleotides. The changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of polymorphic forms of the langerin CRD and of the whole extracellular domain using bacterial expression systems were performed as described previously (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expression of Full-length Langerin in Fibroblasts—cDNAs coding for the polymorphic forms of full-length langerin were inserted into the retroviral expression vector pVcos (12Maddon P.J. Littman D.R. Godfrey M. Maddon D.E. Chess L. Axel R. Cell. 1985; 42: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI site. The neomycin resistance gene, under the control of the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter, was inserted into the resulting vector at the unique ClaI site. The final plasmids were transfected into ΨCre packaging cells (13Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cell lines stably expressing langerin were selected with G418. Langerin expression was detected by Western blotting of cell lysates. Cells were harvested using non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma), and lysates were prepared by sonication in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Following SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, langerin was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against bacterially expressed langerin CRD, and 125I-protein A. Radioactivity was detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Relative amounts of langerin expressed were quantified from Western blots using the ImageQuant software. Analysis of uptake and degradation of 125I-Man-BSA by fibroblasts expressing langerin was performed as described previously for cells expressing the chicken hepatic lectin (14Mellow T.E. Halberg D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Sugar Binding by Polymorphic Forms of Langerin CRD—Samples (1 ml) of langerin CRD produced in bacteria, in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2), were loaded on to 2-ml columns of mannose-Sepharose or galactose-Sepharose equilibrated in loading buffer. After washing with eight 1-ml aliquots of loading buffer, the columns were eluted with six 1-ml aliquots of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (elution buffer). All fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 17.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Direct binding of langerin CRD to Man-BSA was determined using a solid phase binding assay described previously for the CRD of rat mannose-binding protein (15Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plastic microtiter plates with removable wells were coated with langerin CRD (50 μl/well of 100 μg/ml solutions in loading buffer). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the wells were washed three times with cold loading buffer, filled with 5% (w/v) BSA in loading buffer, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 125I-Man-BSA was diluted with unlabeled Man-BSA, and serial 2-fold dilutions were prepared in loading buffer containing 5% BSA and added to the wells in duplicate. Following incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the wells were washed three times with cold loading buffer and counted on a gamma counter. Data were fitted to an equation for saturable binding superimposed on a linearly increasing background of nonspecific binding as shown in Equation 1 Man-BSAbound=Bkg+Max·[Man-BSA]/(KD+[Man-BSA])+slope·[Man-BSA](Eq. 1) where Bkg is the background binding, Max is the saturation level for specific binding, slope is the linear increase in nonspecific binding, and KD is the concentration of ligand at which half-maximal specific saturable binding is achieved (15Iobst S.T.

Oxford University Press, New York1997: 101-129Google Scholar). Values for KD are mean ± S.D. for two independent assays. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Samples of the extracellular domain of langerin were dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. Aliquots of sample (1 ml) and buffer were degassed for 15 min before loading the sample and reference cells of a Calorimetry Sciences Nano III calorimeter. All scans were preceded by 10 min of equilibration at the starting temperature. Initial scans from 20 to 35 °C were repeated until a stable base line was obtained. Denaturation experiments were run from 20 to 90 °C. Base lines were calculated using a fourth order polynomial equation to fit the data between 25 and 90 °C using SigmaPlot. Protein concentrations were determined using the alkaline ninhydrin assay (17Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 325-329Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). pH Dependence Assays—pH dependence of 125I-Man-BSA binding to langerin extracellular domain was determined using a solid phase binding assay described previously (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Buffers used were 25 mm sodium acetate for pH 4.0–4.5 and 25 mm MES/MOPS for pH 5.0–8.5. Buffers contained either 1 or 20 mm CaCl2. Data were fitted, using SigmaPlot, to an equation for pH dependence (18Wragg S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35400-35406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analysis of Sugar Binding by Langerin CRD with the W264R Mutation—The Arg264 form of the CRD of langerin was expressed in bacteria as described previously for the reference form (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Periplasmic proteins, including the expressed CRD, were extracted from the bacteria in 20 ml of loading buffer and passed over 10-ml columns of mannose-Sepharose or galactose-Sepharose. Columns were washed with ten 2-ml aliquots of loading buffer and eluted with eight 2-ml aliquots of elution buffer. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 17.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or Western blotting and staining with an anti-langerin antibody. Location of Polymorphic Residues in the CRD of Langerin—Examination of the SNP data base shows that three single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human langerin gene result in non-synonymous changes in amino acid residues in the CRD (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP). The changes are A278V (SNP data base cluster identification rs741326), N288D (SNP data base cluster identification rs13383830), and A300P (SNP data base cluster identification rs2080391). For the A278V polymorphism the average allele frequencies have been determined as Ala 0.504 and Val 0.496, with an average estimated heterozygosity value of 0.500. Thus, at this position in langerin, Ala and Val appear to be equally represented in the populations studied. At position 288, Asp is less common than Asn. The average allele frequencies are Asn 0.886 and Asp 0.114 with an average estimated heterozygosity value of 0.202. No heterozygosity data are available for the A300P polymorphism, although this SNP has been identified multiple times. In our analysis of 136 genomic DNA samples from a variety of different populations (38 black African, 17 Japanese, 17 French, 15 Italian, 12 Thai, 12 Oriental, 10 Aboriginal, 9 South American Indian, 6 Ashkenazi Jewish) the Pro allele was not found (data not shown), suggesting that it is uncommon. In the absence of a crystal structure of langerin, information about the likely positions of the polymorphic residues in the tertiary structure of the CRD can be obtained from analysis of the crystal structure of the homologous CRD of rat serum mannose-binding protein (MBP-A). Alignment of the sequences of the two CRDs and mapping of the three polymorphic residues in langerin onto the crystal structure of MBP-A are shown in Fig. 1. Position 288 of langerin, where the Asn/Asp change is found, corresponds to one of the residues of MBP-A, Asp188, which is a ligand for the auxiliary Ca2+ (Ca2+ 1). This Ca2+ is important for stabilizing the loops at the top of the CRD that interact with the principal Ca2+ (Ca2+ 2), which in turn ligates directly to sugar (Fig. 1B). Only two of the four residues that ligate Ca2+ 1 in MBP-A are conserved in langerin, so it is not yet clear whether langerin binds Ca2+ at this auxiliary site. Some other C-type CRDs, for example those of the selectins, bind Ca2+ only at the principal site (21Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, regardless of whether residue 288 is involved in Ca2+ binding to langerin, it is positioned close to the conserved principal Ca2+ binding site where the sugar is predicted to bind, suggesting that the presence of aspartate rather than asparagine at this position might affect the ability of the CRD to bind sugar. Position 278 of langerin corresponds to a residue located in the hydrophobic core of MBP. The presence of valine rather than alanine at this position would not be expected to have a direct effect on sugar binding by the CRD but might change the overall stability of the domain and thus have an indirect effect on the activity of langerin. Position 300 of langerin maps to a region of the CRD that forms an extended secondary sugar binding site in some C-type lectins, including the selectins and DC-SIGN (22Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Binding studies with a Man9 oligosaccharide suggest that the langerin CRD might contain an extended binding site (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), in which case the Pro/Ala change at position 300 might affect sugar binding. To test the effects of the polymorphic residues on the activity of langerin, mutations were introduced into the cDNA to produce amino acid changes at each of the three polymorphic positions in the CRD. Four forms of langerin were thus produced, one corresponding to the reference sequence Ala278, Asn288, Ala300 and three corresponding to versions each with an amino acid change at one of the polymorphic positions: Val278, Asn288, Ala300; Ala278, Asp288, Ala300; and Ala278, Asn288, Pro300. Full-length, membrane-bound versions of the four forms of langerin were expressed in fibroblasts. In addition, soluble fragments consisting of just the CRD and of the whole extracellular domain of each of the four forms of langerin were expressed in bacteria. Endocytosis by Variant Forms of Langerin—The reference form of langerin, when stably expressed as the full-length molecule in fibroblasts, mediates uptake and degradation of 125I-Man-BSA (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Stably transfected fibroblast cell lines expressing the other three forms of langerin were created so that the effects of the amino acid changes on endocytic activity could be determined. Western blotting of membrane extracts from the cell lines with an antibody specific for langerin showed a single band of the expected molecular weight for each form (Fig. 2A). Although there was some variation in expression levels on multiple cell lines isolated for each form of langerin, there was no consistent correlation between amino acid sequence and the amount of protein expressed (data not shown). These findings indicate that the amino acid changes probably do not substantially affect the rates of langerin biosynthesis. The relative amounts of langerin expressed in the four cell lines used for endocytic assays are given in the legend to Fig. 2A. Comparison of the abilities of cell lines expressing each form of langerin to endocytose 125I-Man-BSA showed that each of the four forms of langerin is able to mediate uptake and degradation of this neoglycoprotein ligand (Fig. 2B). In each case, ligand becomes associated with the cells and after a short lag period degradation products are released into the medium. Although each of the forms of langerin is functional in the endocytosis assay, there may be differences in the rate of endocytosis for the different forms. Taking into account the slightly different levels of langerin expressed in the four cell lines, the two cell lines expressing the Asp288 and the Pro300 forms of langerin appear to process less 125I-Man-BSA over the course of the assay than does the cell line expressing the reference form of langerin (Table 1). Variability inherent in the assays makes it difficult to quantify small differences in endocytic rate, but it is clear that none of the amino acid changes abolishes the ability of langerin to mediate endocytosis.TABLE 1Summary of the effects of amino acid changes due to single nucleotide polymorphisms on the function of langerinLangerin variantRelative endocytic activityaEndocytic activities adjusted for the amounts of langerin expressed were calculated from the values for ligand molecules processed and released into the medium/cell at 4 h (values from Fig. 2B) divided by the relative amounts of langerin/cell detected on Western blots (values given in Fig. 2A).Binding of CRD to Man-BSAMelting temperaturepHB at 1 mm Ca2+pHB at 20 mm Ca2+μg/ml°CAla278, Asn288, Ala3001.4KD = 10.6 ± 2.857.45.0 ± 0.14.4 ± 0.1Val278, Asn288, Ala3001.1KD = 10.6 ± 4.455.25.5 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.1Ala278, Asp288, Ala3000.7KD > 10054.45.9 ± 0.44.7 ± 0.1Ala278, Asn288, Pro3000.7KD > 10048.16.3 ± 0.24.7 ± 0.2a Endocytic activities adjusted for the amounts of langerin expressed were calculated from the values for ligand molecules processed and released into the medium/cell at 4 h (values from Fig. 2B) divided by the relative amounts of langerin/cell detected on Western blots (values given in Fig. 2A). Open table in a new tab Effect of Polymorphisms on Sugar Binding by the CRD of Langerin—The effects of the polymorphic residues on sugar binding were tested by assessing the ability of CRDs of the four forms of langerin to bind to columns of mannose-Sepharose. The monomeric CRD of langerin binds only weakly to monosaccharides, so assessing the sugar binding activity of the CRD alone is a sensitive way of detecting effects of amino acid changes (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). All four expressed CRDs were sufficiently retarded on 10-ml columns to allow purification from the bacterial extracts, indicating that none of the amino acid changes abolishes the ability of the CRD to bind to mannose (data not shown). This result is consistent with the finding that all four forms of langerin can bind and mediate uptake of 125I-Man-BSA. However, comparison of the elution profiles of the purified proteins on 2-ml columns of mannose-Sepharose indicated that two of the amino acid changes significantly reduce sugar binding activity. Consistent with previous results, the CRD of the reference form of langerin (Ala278, Asn288, Ala300) is retarded on a column of mannose-Sepharose, with protein appearing in some of the later Ca2+-containing wash fractions as well as in the fractions eluted with EDTA (Fig. 3A), but the protein does not bind to a column of galactose-Sepharose (Fig. 3B). The Val278 form of the CRD shows an elution pattern very similar to that of the reference form, indicating that replacement of Ala278 with Val has little effect on the sugar binding activity of langerin. In contrast, both the Asn288 and the Pro300 forms of the CRD elute from the mannose-Sepharose column earlier, indicating that replacement of Asn288 with Asp or Ala300 with Pro causes significant reduction in the affinity of the CRD for mannose. However, both the Asp288 and the Pro300 forms of the CRD are still retarded on the mannose-Sepharose column compared with the galactose-Sepharose column (Fig. 3), confirming that mannose binding activity is not abolished completely. The findings from the semiquantitative column binding assays were confirmed using a quantitative binding assay in which the affinity of the variant CRDs for Man-BSA was measured. Saturation binding curves indicate that replacement of Ala278 with Val has no effect on the affinity of the CRD for Man-BSA (Fig. 4 and Table 1), with very similar KD values being obtained for the Val278 form and the reference form. In contrast, for the Pro300 and Asp288 forms of the CRD, saturation could not be achieved at the concentrations of Man-BSA that could be tested. However, it is clear from the curves that the affinity of these two forms of the CRD for Man-BSA must be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of the reference form. Stability of Variant Forms of Langerin—Differential scanning calorimetry was used to assess the stability of the different forms of langerin. Initial comparison of the thermal stabilities of the CRD alone with the whole extracellular domain (neck + CRD) of the reference form of langerin shows that each of these fragments of the protein denatures at a temperature of ∼58 °C (Fig. 5). The main denaturation peak for the extracellular domain corresponds to the major peak seen for the CRD alone. The small shoulder seen at higher temperature in each case is due to precipitation of the denatured protein, as is often seen in these types of experiments. These results indicate that the coiled coil neck region and the CRD undergo a single unfolding event, suggesting that the CRDs and the neck region may be closely packed. In this respect, langerin resembles serum mannose-binding protein but differs from the tetrameric C-type lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR where the unfolding of the coiled coil neck regions and the CRD can be resolved, suggesting more flexible interactions between the neck and the CRDs (23Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Comparison of the denaturation curves for the extracellular domains of the variant forms of langerin shows that replacement of Ala300 with Pro causes a large decrease in thermal stability (Fig. 6). The Pro300 form of langerin denatures at a temperature ∼10 °C lower than the reference form. In contrast, replacement of Ala278 with Val or Asn288 with Asp results in decreases in denaturation temperature of ∼2–3 °C, indicating that these amino acid changes have only a small effect on the stability of langerin. Thus, for the Pro300 form of langerin, the large decrease in stability correlates with the decrease in sugar binding activity by the CRD, but changing Asn288 to Asp has less effect on stability than on sugar binding. The correlation between effects on stability and sugar binding activity indicates that reduction of sugar binding activity caused by the presence of proline rather than alanine at position 300 is due to disruption of the overall structure of the CRD. In contrast, the reduction in sugar binding activity caused by the N288D change appears to be due to a more local change in structure that affects the sugar binding site without disrupting the rest of the structure. pH Dependence of Ligand Binding—Determination of the pH dependence of ligand binding for the variant forms of langerin gives another means of assessing the effects of the amino acid changes. As is the case for other endocytic C-type lectins, sugar binding to langerin is pH dependent, with ligand release occurring at endosomal pH. pH-dependent release of sugar ligand is associated with a decrease in affinity for Ca2+ (6Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Assays performed"

We have shown here that Tpl2/Cot is constitutively activated in human leukemia cell lines transformed by the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). The kinase activity of Tpl2/Cot is normally suppressed through its physical interaction with an inhibitor, the NF-κB1 precursor protein p105.

The HTLV-I genome encodes a regulatory protein that has potent transforming activity and is required for HTLV-I-induced T cell transformation (3Jeang K.T.

Nicot C. Johnson J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 89: 69-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Tax promotes cell transformation by inducing aberrant expression of many host genes involved in cell growth and survival (6Sun S.-C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Ng P.W. Iha H. Iwanaga Y. Bittner M. Chen Y. Jiang Y. Gooden G. Trent J.M. Meltzer P. Jeang K.T. Zeichner S.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4484-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Among the cellular genes activated by Tax are those coding for interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor α subunit, which is likely required for the initial stage of T cell proliferation following HTLV-I infection. In addition, Tax also activates genes encoding other cytokines and cytokine receptors, cell cycle regulators, apoptosis inhibitors, and cell adhesion molecules. Tax induces cellular gene expression by deregulating the activity of transcription factors, most notably NF-κB (8Sun S.C. Yamaoka S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5952-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). NF-κB represents a family of inducible transcription factors that regulate diverse biological processes, including the growth and survival of both T cells and nonlymphoid cells (9Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar, 10Silverman N. Maniatis T.

The NF-κB factors are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with specific inhibitors belonging to the IκB family (14Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB involves phosphorylation of IκBs by a specific IκB kinase (IKK), which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). In response to various immune and stress stimuli, IKK is rapidly activated and mediates IκB phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, which allows NF-κB to move to the nucleus and exert its transcription function. Recent evidence suggests that NF-κB activation also involves phosphorylation of NF-κB members, especially the trans-activation subunit RelA. RelA phosphorylation is required for enhancing its transactivation function, thus allowing the κB enhancer-bound NF-κB to functionally mediate target gene transcription. Whereas NF-κB activation occurs transiently in a normal immune response, this cellular signaling pathway is persistently activated in freshly isolated adult T cell leukemia cells and T cell lines transformed by HTLV-I (6Sun S.-C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that the Tax-mediated persistent activation of NF-κB involves its physical association with IKK via the IKKγ subunit (16Chu Z.-L. Shin Y.-A. Yang J.-M.

Emerging evidence suggests that Tax also promotes the transactivation activity of NF-κB, although the underlying mechanism is not completely understood (19O'Mahony A.M. Montano M. Beneden K.

For example, it is unclear whether Tax targets the activation of upstream kinases, especially those involved in the activation or modulation of NF-κB function. In the work presented here, we have shown that Tax induces the activation of a protooncoprotein kinase, Tpl2 (also known as Cot; hereafter referred to Tpl2/Cot). Tpl2/Cot is a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase family initially identified as a transforming protein through functional cloning (21Miyoshi J. Higashi T. Mukai H. Ohuchi T. Kakunaga T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 4088-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The murine Tpl2/Cot was independently identified as a protooncogene activated by proviral insertion in T cell lymphomas induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (22Patriotis C. Makris A. Bear S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The T cell-transforming activity of Tpl2/Cot appears to involve both its overexpression and its truncation at the carboxyl-terminal region (23Ceci J.D. Patriotis C.P. Tsatsanis C. Makris A.M. Kovatch R. Swing D.A. Jenkins N.A. Tsichlis P.N. Copeland N.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transfection studies demonstrate that Tpl2/Cot activates a number of downstream signaling pathways, including those leading to activation of the ERK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, IKK/NF-κB, and NF-AT (24Salmerón A.

Although these findings provide important insight into the oncogenic potential of deregulated Tpl2/Cot, recent gene targeting studies reveal that Tpl2/Cot plays a physiological role in regulating the activation of MEK1 and its downstream target ERK in macrophages stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (28Dumitru C.D.

EMBO J. 2003; 15: 3855-3864Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We and others have recently shown that the signaling function of Tpl2/Cot is subject to tight regulation by the NF-κB1 precursor protein p105 (30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Beinke S. Deka J. Lang V. Belich M.P. Walker P.A. Howell S. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4739-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In macrophages as well as various other cell types analyzed so far, Tpl2/Cot is physically associated with p105 (26Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4739-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Through this molecular interaction, p105 both stabilizes Tpl2/Cot and inhibits its kinase function. Tpl2/Cot undergoes rapid degradation in p105-deficient cells derived from nfκb1 knock-out mice, which is associated with a defect in LPS-induced MEK/ERK signaling pathway. On the other hand, the p105-bound Tpl2/Cot is functionally inactive, and its activation involves signal-induced p105 degradation and the liberation of Tpl2/Cot. Strong evidence suggests that the signal-induced Tpl2/Cot activation requires IKKβ, which functions by phosphorylating p105 and triggering the proteolysis of p105 (32Waterfield M. Wei J. Reiley W. Zhang M.Y. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of IKKβ and proteasome are able to block LPS-stimulated activation of Tpl2/Cot and its downstream signaling pathways. Under normal conditions, the activated free Tpl2/Cot is rapidly degraded (30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Beinke S. Deka J. Lang V. Belich M.P. Walker P.A. Howell S. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4739-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which appears to serve as a mechanism that prevents persistent activation of this oncoprotein kinase. Remarkably, we have found in the present study that Tpl2/Cot is constitutively activated in a panel of HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines. This deregulated cell signaling is at least partially mediated through the Tax protein, because expression of Tax in the absence of other viral proteins is sufficient to activate Tpl2/Cot. These results provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which Tax deregulates cellular signaling pathways. Cell Lines and Primary Cells—C8166 (34Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P. Wong-Staal F.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HTLV-I-immortalized PBMC was generated by in vitro co-cultivation of PBMC with γ-irradiated MT-2 cells (41Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

To generate retroviral vectors encoding Tpl2/Cot and Tpl2/Cot mut, the corresponding cDNAs were subcloned into the pCLXSN retroviral vector (provided by Dr. Inder Verma, see Ref. 46Naviaux R.N. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-MEK1 was described previously (32Waterfield M. Wei J. Reiley W. Zhang M.Y. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The DNA constructs were partially sequenced at the Core Facility of Hershey Medical Center. The carboxyl-terminal-specific anti-p105 antibody (anti-p105C) was provided by Dr. Nancy Rice. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated HA antibody (3F10) was from Roche Applied Science.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, ionomycine, and LPS (derived from Escherichia coli 0127:B8) were from Sigma, and MG132 was from Alexis. Cell Transfection and Retroviral Infection—Jurkat cells (1 × 106), HeLa cells (1 × 105, seeded in 6-well plates), and 293 cells (1 × 105, seeded in 6-well plates) were transfected using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). Retroviral transduction was performed using the pCLXSN system provided by Dr. I. Verma (46Naviaux R.N. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for retrovirus production and infection was as previously described (48Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

The infected cells were enriched by drug selection using neomycin. Immunoblotting (IB) and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells were lysed in a kinase cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The Tpl2/Cot complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation (IP) and subjected to in vitro kinase assays essentially as described (50DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IP beads were washed twice with kinase cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase assays were initiated by addition to the beads of 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of substrate (GST-MEK1). After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the phosphorylated substrates and autophosphorylated Tpl2/Cot were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For p105 depletion, the cell lysates were incubated with anti-p105C antibody and protein A-agarose for 1 h followed by removing the p105 immune complexes by centrifugation. This procedure was repeated two more times to achieve the maximal p105 depletion. The p105-depleted cell lysates were then subjected to Tpl2/Cot kinase assays as described above. For IB assays, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and detected by specific antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescent system. For detecting MEK1 phosphorylation, the cells were starved overnight in medium containing low serum (0.5%) before preparation of the cell lysates. Reporter Gene Assays—Approximatedly 1.25 × 106 Jurkat cells were transfected with the indicated cDNA expression vectors together with 25 ng of κB-luciferase reporter. For normalizing the transfection efficiency, the cells were also transfected with a control Renilla luciferase reporter driven by the constitutive thymidine kinase promoter (5 ng). At 40 h post-transfection, the cells were collected for duel luciferase assays (Promega). The κB-specific luciferase activity was normalized based on the Renilla luciferase activity. Constitutive Tpl2/Cot Activation in HTLV-I-transformed T Cells—We examined the activity of Tpl2/Cot in HTLV-I-transformed T cells by immune complex kinase assays. As a positive control, we used LPS-stimulated RAW264 macrophage cell line. As expected, the kinase activity of Tpl2/Cot was hardly detectable in RAW 264 cells under unstimulated conditions but could be stimulated by LPS (Fig. 1A, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, however, constitutive Tpl2/Cot kinase activity was detected in a panel of HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines (lanes 6–10), including both IL-2-independent (C8166, MT2, SLB-1, HUT102) and IL-2-dependent (E55) lines. In contrast, no significant Tpl2/Cot activity was detected in several HTLV-I-negative T cell lines, including Jurkat, SupT1, and MALT4 (lanes 3–5). Parallel IB was performed to measure the expression of Tpl2/Cot proteins. As previously reported (21Miyoshi J. Higashi T. Mukai H. Ohuchi T. Kakunaga T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 4088-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 51Aoki M. Akiyama T. Miyoshi J. Toyoshima K. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1515-1519PubMed Google Scholar), Tpl2/Cot was expressed as two isoforms, Tpl2/CotL and Tpl2/CotS, denoting longer and shorter isoforms, respectively. The steady level of Tpl2/Cot in these cells was similar to that of HTLV-transformed T cells, although the HTLV-negative cell lines have very low levels of the short isoform of Tpl2/Cot (Tpl2/CotS) (Fig. 1A, middle panel). The low level of Tpl2/CotS expression did not seem to contribute to the lack of Tpl2/Cot kinase activity in the HTLV-I-negative cells, because normal human T cells from fresh PBMCs expressed both the long (Tpl2/CotL) and short (Tpl2/CotS) isoforms of Tpl2/Cot and did not exhibit significant constitutive Tpl2/Cot activity (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 1). Tpl2/Cot activation has been extensively studied in macrophages, where its activity is potently stimulated by LPS. It remains unclear whether Tpl2/Cot is activated in T cells by the T cell receptor signals. We examined this possibility by stimulating human PBMC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, pharmacological agents that stimulate the protein kinase C and calcium signals downstream of T cell receptors. Upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, we consistently detected a weak but significant increase in Tpl2/Cot kinase activity (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 2 and data not shown). This finding suggests the possible involvement of Tpl2/Cot in normal T cell activation. However, parallel kinase assays using the same amounts of cell lysate of HTLV-I-transformed C8166 cell line revealed a much more robust activation of Tpl2/Cot (lane 3). Significant Tpl2/Cot activity was also readily detected in PBMC immortalized with HTLV-I (lane 4). The levels of Tpl2/Cot in the normal and HTLV-I-transformed T cells were comparable (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Thus, the oncoprotein kinase Tpl2/Cot is potently activated in HTLV-I-transformed T cells. Active Tpl2/Cot Is Not Bound by p105—In primary bone marrow-derived macrophages and macrophage cell lines, Tpl2/Cot is stabilized through its physical association with p105 (26Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4739-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Within this stable complex, the MEK kinase activity of Tpl2/Cot is inhibited by p105 (30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Beinke S. Deka J. Lang V. Belich M.P. Walker P.A. Howell S. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4739-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of constitutive Tpl2/Cot activation by HTLV-I, we examined the association of Tpl2/Cot with p105 in the HTLV-I-transformed T cell line C8166. IP was performed with either anti-p105C or anti-Tpl2/Cot antibody, followed by IB detection of the p105-associated Tpl2/Cot and total Tpl2/Cot, respectively. As expected from the result presented in Fig. 1B, comparable amounts of total Tpl2/Cot were detected from PBMC and HTLV-I-transformed C8166 cells (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Importantly, however, the p105-associated Tpl2/Cot was significantly less in C8166 cells than in the PBMC (middle panel). The level of p105 was also lower in C8166 cells (top panel) as well as in the other HTLV-I-transformed T cells (data not shown). This finding suggested that a large proportion of Tpl2/Cot was not associated with p105 in the HTLV-I-transformed T cells. To confirm this idea, we removed the p105 complexes from C8166 cell lysates by antibody depletion assays. As shown in Fig. 2B, p105 was efficiently depleted after three rounds of IP using the anti-p105C antibody (upper panel, lane 2). As expected, the p105-associated Tpl2/Cot proteins were also depleted (lower panel, lane 2). However, parallel kinase assays revealed that the p105 depletion did not reduce the kinase activity of Tpl2/Cot (Fig. 2C, upper panel, lane 3), thus supporting the idea that the active form of Tpl2/Cot is free from p105 (30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Beinke S. Deka J. Lang V. Belich M.P. Walker P.A. Howell S.

Consistently, after p105 depletion substantial amounts of Tpl2/Cot were still precipitated by the anti-Tpl2/Cot antibody (lower panel, lane 3) but not by the anti-p105C antibody (lane 4). Together, these data suggest that activation of Tpl2/Cot in HTLV-infected T cells involves the liberation of Tpl2/Cot from its inhibitor p105. Active Tpl2/CotS Is Stable in HTLV-I-infected T Cells—Under normal conditions, the stability of Tpl2/Cot is dependent on its association with p105 (30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Beinke S. Deka J. Lang V. Belich M.P. Walker P.A. Howell S. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4739-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In response to LPS stimulation, the longer Tpl2/Cot isoform is rapidly dissociated from p105, which correlates with catalytic activation of Tpl2/Cot. However, the active form of Tpl2/Cot is degraded within a short time, which may serve to prevent persistent activation of this oncogenic kinase. Because Tpl2/Cot is constitutively active and dissociated from p105 in HTLV-I-transformed T cells, it indicated that the pathologically activated Tpl2/Cot is either stabilized or undergoing rapid resynthesis in these tumor cells. To examine these possibilities, we incubated the cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, followed by kinase assays and IB to examine the kinase activity and expression of Tpl2/Cot proteins. We performed these studies using two HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines, C8166 and MT2. Incubation of these cells with cycloheximide resulted in rapid degradation of Tpl2/CotL (Fig. 3A, middle panel), which was reminiscent of its degradation in LPS-stimulated macrophages (30Waterfield M. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This finding suggests"
https://openalex.org/W2096323713,"Osteocalcin is a small, secreted bone protein whose gene consists of four exons. In the course of analyzing the structure of fish osteocalcin genes, we recently found that the spotted green pufferfish has two possible exon 2 structures, one of 15 bp and the other of 324 bp. Subsequent analysis of the pufferfish cDNA showed that only the transcript with a large exon 2 exists. Exon 2 codes for the osteocalcin propeptide, and exon 2 of pufferfish osteocalcin is ∼3.4-fold larger than exon 2 previously found in other vertebrate species. We have termed this new pufferfish osteocalcin isoform OC2. Additional studies showed that the OC2 isoform is restricted to a unique fish taxonomic group, the Osteichthyes; OC2 is the only osteocalcin isoform found so far in six Osteichthyes species, whereas both OC1 and OC2 isoforms coexist in zebrafish and rainbow trout. The larger size of the OC2 propeptide is due to an acidic region that is likely to be highly phosphorylated and has no counterpart in the OC1 propeptide. We propose 1) that OC1 and OC2 are encoded by distinct genes that originated from a duplication event that probably occurred in the teleost fish lineage soon after divergence from tetrapods and 2) that the novel OC2 propeptide could be, if secreted, a phosphoprotein that participates in the regulation of biomineralization through its large acidic and phosphorylated propeptide.

Osteocalcin (OC), 3The abbreviations used are: OC, osteocalcin; BLAST, basic local alignment search tool; MGP, matrix Gla protein. also known as bone Gla protein (or BGP), is a small secreted protein, specific for vertebrate-calcified tissues, that belongs to the vitamin K-dependent (VKD) protein family. VKD proteins are characterized by the presence of several Gla residues resulting from the post-translational vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of specific glutamates and through which they can bind to a calcium-containing mineral such as hydroxyapatite (1Poser J.W.

Osteocalcin is synthesized by osteoblasts and odontoblasts as a pre-pro-protein (3Sommer B. Bickel M. Hofstetter W. Wetterwald A. Bone. 1996; 19: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and contains 3–4 Gla residues located within a conserved domain in the central part of the mature protein (4Hauschka P.V. Carr S.A.

Although a number of questions still remain concerning its mode of action at the molecular level, it has been proposed that osteocalcin is central to the control of tissue mineralization mechanisms (6Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G.J. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G.

Nishimoto and colleagues (9Nishimoto S.K. Waite J.H. Nishimoto M. Kriwacki R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have recently reported osteocalcin gene and cDNA structures for two pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) based on computer analysis of the genomic sequences retrieved from public data bases. Surprisingly, the size of putative exon 2 in these species was much smaller than those observed for other species (including fish; Fig. 1A), raising the question of the correctness of the computer prediction, in particular because manual analysis of both genomic sequences revealed that exon 2 could be longer, predicting a far larger osteocalcin peptide (Fig. 1B). However, experimental data were missing to confirm or refute one prediction or the other. The present study brings experimental data and new insights into the structure of the osteocalcin gene from T. nigroviridis with the identification of a large exon 2 coding for a prodomain containing multiple possible phosphorylation sites. We also present in silico evidence for the presence of this osteocalcin isoform in more fish species but not in mammals, birds, or amphibians. Fish Culture—Specimens of tropical fish T. nigroviridis (spotted green pufferfish) were obtained from a local pet shop (Picanço, Faro, Portugal) and kept until used at 22–24 °C in a closed recirculating system with water salinity at 8–12 parts/million and a natural photo period. Fish were fed once a day with frozen mollusks. RNA Preparation and cDNA Amplification—Total RNA was extracted from the head and bones as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C using Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), RNase Out (Invitrogen), and an oligo(dT) adapter (5′-ACGCGTCGACCTCGAGATCGATG(T)13-3′). PCR amplifications of osteocalcin cDNA fragments were achieved in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) using 5 μl of the reverse-transcribed RNA, Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and primers designed according to T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis putative OC exon 1 (PufOC-FW, 5′-CATGAAGACCCTGACTCTCCTCT-3′) and exon 4 (PufOC-RV, 5′-CTAGAAGGGTGGGGGGCCGTAGTA-3′). PCR reactions were performed as follows consisting of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification (one cycle is 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) and a final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. All PCR products were size-separated on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel, and selected PCR fragments were purified using the GFX Gel Band Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Purified PCR products were subsequently cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea). Genomic DNA Preparation and Gene Amplification—Genomic DNA was extracted from a mixture of tissues using the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen). Osteocalcin gene fragments were amplified from 50 ng of genomic DNA by PCR using Advantage DNA polymerase mix (Clontech) and primers designed according to T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis putative OC exons 1 and 4 (see above). PCR reactions were performed as follows consisting of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification (one cycle is 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C) and a final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were processed as described in the previous section. Sequence Reconstruction—The GenBank™ expressed sequence tag data base and Trace archive were extensively searched using BLAST facilities at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for sequences showing similarities to known osteocalcin transcripts or genes. Species-specific sequences were first clustered, and elements of each cluster were assembled using ClustalX (11Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) to generate, after manual correction, highly accurate consensus sequences. Virtual transcripts and genes were deduced from the joined consensus sequence using stringent overlap criteria. Virtual gene structure and splicing sites were predicted using comparative methods (homology to previously annotated genes) and GenScan facilities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Sequence Alignment and Analysis—Separate alignments for sequences of OC1 and OC2 mature protein were created using T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment software (12Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar) with parameters set to the default. Manual adjustments were made in a few cases to improve alignments. An alignment of the whole set of sequences was produced using a similar procedure. Sequence logos presented in Fig. 6 were created from T-Coffee multiple sequence alignments using WebLogo (13Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.-M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8449) Google Scholar). The sequence logos are presented as graphical displays, where the height of each letter is made proportional to its frequency. This shows the conserved residues as larger characters. Pairwise sequence identity values were computed as the percent of identical residues over the total number of aligned residues using alignments generated with T-Coffee and the Sequence Manipulation Suite (14Stothard P. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic Analysis—The neighbor-joining tree was built from T-Coffee alignments of fish osteocalcin mature peptides using MEGA version 3.0 (15Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Briefings in Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10656) Google Scholar). The PAM (percent accepted mutation) mutation data matrix was chosen, and the rate of change was taken as site-independent (the use of a γ-distributed variable rate of change among sites was tried and produced worse results in all cases). The phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA, where the internal branch labels, which are an estimate of branch assignment reliability, are branch support values and must not be confused with the bootstrap values produced by other programs, e.g. Phylip. Cloning of Spotted Green Pufferfish Osteocalcin cDNA and Gene—PCRs performed on head/bone reverse-transcribed RNA or genomic DNA using the PufOC-FW/RV primer set amplified a cDNA fragment of 579 bp and a gene fragment of 833 bp. The sequence of both fragments was determined from three independent clones, compared with annotated sequences available in GenBank™ using the BLAST facilities at NCBI and identified as the T. nigroviridis osteocalcin partial cDNA and gene. The comparison of cDNA and gene sequences using the Spidey mRNA-to-genomic alignment tool at NCBI identified four exons and three introns (supplemental Fig. 1), as in other osteocalcin genes. Analysis of exon size revealed an exon 2 in the T. nigroviridis osteocalcin gene ∼280 bp longer than those of other osteocalcin genes and 300 bp longer than the recent predictions of Nishimoto and colleagues (9Nishimoto S.K.

The phase of intron insertion, as defined by Patthy (16Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), was found to be identical to those in other osteocalcin genes (Fig. 1). Analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA revealed a protein with 1) a signal peptide, 2) a large propeptide (129 amino acids) containing 40 putative phosphoserine residues (phosphorylated by the Golgi apparatus casein kinase (17Christensen B. Nielsen M.S. Haselmann K.F. Petersen T.E. Sorensen E.S. Biochem.

Martel P. Viegas C.S.B. Price P.A. Cancela M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26659-26668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Searching Tetraodon Assembly Release 7 using a partial T. nigroviridis osteocalcin gene sequence and BLAST facilities at Ensembl identified a genomic fragment (chr.Un_random) containing the complete gene sequence (supplemental Fig. 1). Only one nucleotide (positioned in intron 3) of 786 was found to be different in both sequences. The existence of a second osteocalcin transcript that would exhibit a structure similar to those already published (i.e. with a short exon 2) was investigated. Various attempts to clone it through PCR only amplified the same long transcript with no evidence for a shorter one. Reconstruction of New Osteocalcin Sequences—The following nomenclature was adopted to designate osteocalcin isoforms, OC1 for osteocalcin short isoform (i.e. short exon 2) and OC2 for osteocalcin long isoform (i.e. long exon 2). Public sequence data bases were searched for osteocalcin sequences using the spotted green pufferfish osteocalcin sequence. Positive search results were clustered, and six cDNAs (red tail sheller OC2, three spined stickleback OC2, rainbow trout OC1 and OC2, zebrafish OC2, and channel catfish OC2) and two genes (torafugu OC2 and zebrafish OC2) could be reconstructed (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 2). The phase of intron insertion in the newly identified genes was found to be identical to those in other osteocalcin genes. Interestingly, all OC2 sequences belong to a unique taxonomic group, the Osteichthyes or bony fish. No evidence for the presence of any OC2 sequences in mammalian, avian, or amphibian taxa was found. Coexistence of Two Osteocalcins in Teleost Fish—Analysis of the isoform distribution in Osteichthyes (16 species represented) provided evidence for the presence of at least one isoform in 14 different species (five with OC1, five with OC2, and four with an undetermined OC) and of both isoforms in two fish (zebrafish and rainbow trout) belonging to distinct taxonomic groups (Fig. 3). Pairwise comparison of sequences outside the prodomain revealed that OC1 and OC2 are 65 and 54% identical in zebrafish and rainbow trout, respectively, suggesting that both isoforms are most probably coded by different genes. Reconstruction of both zebrafish genes from genomic fragments obtained in the laboratory of M. L. Cancela (DrOC1, results not shown) and available from GenBank™/Ensembl data bases (DrOC2, supplemental Fig. 2) confirmed the existence of two genes in zebrafish. The DrOC2 gene was found to exhibit the same phase of intron insertion as other known osteocalcin genes. Prodomain of OC2 Is Large, Acidic, and Contains Numerous Phosphorylation Sites—In osteocalcin genes, the entire exon 2 codes for the N-terminal part of the prodomain, a region quite variable and with no associated function. The analysis of osteocalcin prodomains from signal peptide cleavage, as predicted by SignalP (19Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), to propeptide cleavage at RXXR (18Laizé V. Martel P. Viegas C.S.B. Price P.A. Cancela M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26659-26668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that 1) OC2 prodomain is more than three times longer than that of OC1 and 2) OC2 prodomain exhibits higher acidic/basic and polar/non-polar residue ratios, mainly as a result of an enrichment in aspartate and glutamate (acidic) and serine (polar) residues (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Consequently, the OC2 prodomain is highly negatively charged and has a low isoelectric point, whereas hydropathy remains unchanged (Table 1). Another consequence of the selective enrichment in Asp, Glu, Ser, and also Ala is the low complexity of OC2 prodomain.TABLE 1Physicochemical analysis of OC1 and OC2 prodomainPropertiesOC1aMean ± S.D., n = 7.OC2aMean ± S.D., n = 7.t TestLength (amino acids)bCalculated using Peptide Statistic Tool.35 ± 1120 ± 14p < 0.001Molecular mass (kDa)bCalculated using Peptide Statistic Tool.3.7 ± 0.211.9 ± 1.5p < 0.001ChargebCalculated using Peptide Statistic Tool.+0.2 ± 2.4-19.2 ± 7.1p < 0.001Isoelectric pointbCalculated using Peptide Statistic Tool.6.7 ± 2.73.6 ± 0.2p = 0.01HydropathycCalculated using ProtParam.-0.70 ± 0.22-0.72 ± 0.15NSdNS, difference is not significant.a Mean ± S.D., n = 7.b Calculated using Peptide Statistic Tool.c Calculated using ProtParam.d NS, difference is not significant. Open table in a new tab A T-Coffee alignment of OC2 prodomain sequences was used to evaluate interspecies sequence homology and identify conserved residues. Calculated pairwise sequence identity revealed that OC2 prodomain sequences are moderately conserved (Fig. 4B) with an average identity of 44.6% (values from closely related species, i.e. spotted green pufferfish and torafugu, were excluded). As a comparison, OC2 mature peptide has an average sequence identity of 80.9%. Similarly, only 30 residue positions of 172 were totally conserved among OC2 prodomains (supplemental Fig. 3). A detailed search for conserved domain/motif in OC2 prodomain only identified the RXXR signature for the furin cleavage site. Interestingly, this signature was found to be isoform-specific; RQ(K/T)R and R(R/H/S)(R/K)R for OC1 and OC2, respectively. Analysis of osteocalcin prodomains for phosphorylation revealed, depending on the species, 19–51 residues, mostly serines, possibly phosphorylated at the (S/T)X(E/D/S)(P) motif in OC2 prodomains (Fig. 4B). No evidence for the presence of similar phosphorylation sites was found in OC1 prodomains. Prodomain of OC2 Is Similar to Phosphoproteins—Public sequence data bases were searched for proteins with similarity to OC2 propeptide using the BLAST facilities at NCBI. OC2 propeptide was found to have significant homology to 1) dentin phosphoprotein (a cleavage product of dentin sialophosphoprotein) and 2) phosvitin (a cleavage product of the egg yolk protein vitellogenin). Both proteins have been reported to be highly phosphorylated, and their similarity with OC2 prodomain is restricted to their phosphorylated domain. Mature Peptide Is Isoform-specific—All mature peptides were aligned using T-Coffee and their relationship analyzed in a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method. OC1 and OC2 mature peptides were found to cluster in separate groups (Fig. 5) demonstrating their specificity. It is therefore possible to distinguish osteocalcin isoforms not only by their prodomain but also by their mature peptide. Following this idea, osteocalcin from the common carp (CcOC), the swordfish (XgOC), the bluegill (LmOC), and the Nile tilapia (OnOC), where sequence information for the propeptide is missing, were included in this analysis. CcOC, LmOC, and OnOC were found to cluster with OC1 isoforms, whereas XgOC clustered with OC2 sequences (Fig. 5). To further validate this observation, the furin cleavage site of OnOC, available with mature peptide, was found to be R-Q-K-R, fitting the signature of the OC1 proteolytic site. Mature peptides of each osteocalcin isoform (10 sequences for OC1 and 8 sequences for OC2; see Fig. 3) were separately aligned using T-Coffee and alignments displayed as Logo sequences (Fig. 6). Analysis of each consensus sequence revealed 21 and 22 fully conserved residues (Fig. 6, black lettering) in mature peptide of OC1 and OC2, respectively, and 15 of those were found to be conserved in both proteins, indicating the presence of isoform-specific conserved residues (six in OC1 and seven in OC2). These residues are likely to be responsible for the clustering of OC1 and OC2 in Fig. 5. As expected, the recently published signature of osteocalcin Gla domain (18Laizé V. Martel P. Viegas C.S.B. Price P.A. Cancela M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26659-26668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is in total agreement with the reported OC1 consensus sequence, whereas it differs from those of OC2 at a single position (Asp in OC1 and Asp or Glu in OC2). We present here for the first time evidence for two different osteocalcin isoforms in vertebrates. A second osteocalcin (OC2) has been identified in teleost fish and coexists in two species with the previously identified osteocalcin (OC1). The main difference between OC1 and OC2 is in the prodomain, which is large, acidic and most probably highly phosphorylated in OC2. Computer Predictions Must Be Experimentally Confirmed—Although invaluable and quite reliable, computer predictions have to be confirmed whenever possible by biological experiments. Nishimoto and colleagues (9Nishimoto S.K. Waite J.H. Nishimoto M. Kriwacki R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) recently published a gene-based prediction of T. nigroviridis osteocalcin that was shown here to be erroneous with the cloning of the complementary DNA. Our work emphasizes the importance of biological support for any computer prediction. Two Osteocalcins in Teleost Fish—Although its presence in higher vertebrates (especially in mammals) cannot be ruled out, our data provide strong indications that OC2 may be restricted to teleost fish, which represent ancient vertebrates (bony fishes diverged from tetrapod lineage approximately 450 million years ago). The analysis of isoform distribution using available genome sequence information has shown that most fishes exhibit one isoform or the other, whereas both isoforms were found to coexist only in two species, zebrafish and rainbow trout. Comparison of osteocalcin isoforms from these species clearly showed that they share a common origin and are likely to have emerged from a gene duplication event (at a gene, chromosome, or genome level). Because both fish belong to distinct and distant taxonomic groups, this duplication event must be ancient and in fact is likely to have affected most bony fish (Fig. 7). Our hypothesis is strongly supported by recent studies analyzing zebrafish, medaka, and green pufferfish genomes, which have suggested that a whole-genome duplication event occurred in the teleost fish lineage after divergence from tetrapods (20Jaillon O. Aury J.M. Brunet F. Petit J.L. Stange-Thomann N. Mauceli E. Bouneau L. Fischer C. Ozouf-Costaz C. Bernot A. Nicaud S. Jaffe D. Fisher S. Lutfalla G. Dossat C. Segurens B. Dasilva C. Salanoubat M.

Frickey T. Meyer A. Van de Peer Y. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). After this event, osteocalcin duplicates have diverged and were either lost or retained. It seems from the data presented here that one of the duplicates, either OC1 or OC2, was lost in most fish species analyzed, whereas both were retained in zebrafish and rainbow trout. This is in total agreement with recent evidence suggesting a massive elimination of DNA after the duplication resulting in the retention of only a subset of the duplicates in most modern teleost genomes (22Woods I.G. Wilson C. Friedlander B. Chang P. Reyes D.K. Nix R. Kelly P.D. Chu F. Postlethwait J.H. Talbot W.S. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 23Amores A. Suzuki T. Yan Y.-L. Pomeroy J. Singer A. Amemiya C. Postlethwait J.H. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was found that more duplicates have been retained in the zebrafish genome than in those of the spotted green pufferfish (21Taylor J.S. Braasch I. Frickey T. Meyer A. Van de Peer Y. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The apparent presence of only one isoform (and always OC1) in amphibians, birds, and mammals is also in total agreement with the scenario developed in Fig. 7. Driving Force behind Isoform Selection—After the duplication of their genome, some fish species have retained both isoforms, whereas others retained either OC1 or OC2. The careful analysis of fish species presented in this study has not yet permitted us to connect the observed distribution of fish osteocalcins with their adaptation to a particular habitat (e.g. fresh water versus marine fish, deep-sea versus surface fish, tropical versus temperate fish), improved performances, faster embryonic development, or a specific evolutionary trait (cellular bone versus acellular bone). Similarly, analysis of data provided with each expressed sequence tag did not permit us to identify any tissue or developmental stage specific for OC2 gene expression. OC2 expressed sequence tags were found in embryo, fry, juvenile, and adult stages and in jaw, eye, and heart tissue. Additional studies aiming at the characterization of osteocalcin isoform distribution in more fish species, as well as the determination of sites of gene expression and protein accumulation for both isoforms, will be required to better understand the driving force behind osteocalcin isoform selection. Another important question to be answered in future studies is whether both proteins retain their original function. The analysis of both mature peptides has revealed differences in amino acid composition, but key positions, as well as the peptide architecture/structure, have been conserved, suggesting conservation of the function. Function of proOC2—The propeptide of OC1 is small (average size is 35 amino acids) and would only serve as a high affinity recognition site for vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (24Engelke J.A. Hale J.E. Suttie J.W. Price P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Despite exhibiting a similar carboxylase recognition site, OC2 propeptide is quite different from that of OC1, which is much longer (average size is 120 amino acids), more acidic, and serine-rich. Whether these serine residues, if any, are phosphorylated remains to be demonstrated, but the presence of phosphate groups would clearly confer a new dimension to proOC2. Numerous phosphorylated and acid residues would provide a protein with the ability to bind high amounts of calcium or calcium-containing crystals, suggesting an active role in biomineralization (25He G. Ramachandran A. Dahl T. George S. Schultz D. Cookson D. Veis A. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33109-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Gorski J.P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Various secreted proteins shown to contain clusters of multiple phosphoryl residues have been associated with tissue mineralization (teeth and bone) or involved in soluble calcium phosphate stabilization to prevent spontaneous precipitation (see Ref. 27Huq N.L. Cross K.J. Ung M. Reynolds E.C. Arch. Oral Biol. 2005; 50: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar for review). Several of these proteins share some similarity with OC2, essentially within the phosphorylation domain. They are 1) the dentin phosphoprotein (a possible nucleator/promoter of crystal growth in dentin), 2) the extracellular phosphoglycoprotein osteopontin (an inhibitor of biomineralization), 3) the phosvitin (a nucleator of crystal formation), and 4) the matrix Gla protein (a potent inhibitor of ectopic mineralization). However, the theory of proOC2 being involved in calcium binding or nucleation and growth of the inorganic calcium/phosphorus crystals becomes valid only if OC2 propeptide is found in the extracellular compartment at the proximity of the mineral. ProOC2 must be therefore secreted. Osteocalcin propeptide has been shown to be cleaved from the mature peptide by the furin, an endoprotease localized in the trans-Golgi network (28Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the fate of OC1 propeptide is controversial. Some studies have suggested that proOC1 remains in the cell and is not co-secreted with osteocalcin (29Gundberg C.M. Clough M.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), others have shown that proOC1 is present in blood serum and have even proposed that it could be used as a marker of osteoblastic function (30Hosoda K. Kanzaki S. Eguchi H. Kiyoki M. Yamaji T. Koshihara Y. Shiraki M. Seino Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The signature of the furin cleavage site was found to be isoform-specific, raising the possibility of differential cleavage efficiency. Whether OC2 propeptide is indeed cleaved and/or secreted remains uncertain and will need to be investigated in another study. Evolutionary Relationship between OC and MGP—It has been recently proposed that osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein could be closely related, OC resulting from MGP duplication during a genome duplication, which would have occurred around 400 million years ago (18Laizé V. Martel P. Viegas C.S.B. Price P.A. Cancela M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26659-26668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Comparison of OC1, OC2, and MGP protein structure shows that MGP and OC2 are closer to each other than to OC1 due to the presence in MGP and OC2 of a serine phosphorylation domain located within the prodomain and entirely encoded by exon 2 (Fig. 8). A glutamic acid residue, located at the end of the putative phosphorylation domain, was found to be conserved in all OC2 prodomains (Fig. 8 and supplemental Fig. 3); could this conserved Glu residue be γ-carboxylated, as reported in prodomain-like MGP (31Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4971-4975Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), reinforcing the similarity between MGP and OC2? Following this idea, could OC2 (thanks to its specific furin cleavage) be secreted as a propeptide and be, in suitable conditions, cleaved extracellularly, as it occurs for MGP at the ANXF cleavage site? In this case, both proteins would have a N-terminal phosphorylated domain capable of being cleaved, which could represent an additional step for their functional regulation. Finally, could an unprocessed OC2 (no furin cleavage) have a role similar to that of MGP (i.e. inhibitor of tissue calcification)? Additional studies aiming at the characterization of OC2 processing (γ-carboxylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic cleavage of prodomain), as well as the determination of protein function, will be required to better understand the relationship between OC and MGP. Our results support the hypothesis that 1) there exists in teleost fish a second osteocalcin gene (OC2), which originated from a duplication event (genome, chromosome, or gene duplication) that probably occurred in the teleost fish lineage soon after divergence from tetrapods; 2) this gene codes for a protein with a large acidic prodomain rich in phosphorylated residues that may be involved in the binding of calcium or calcium-containing crystals; and 3) OC2 could be involved as a secreted matrix-associated phosphoprotein in the regulation of biomineralization. Finally, our work emphasizes the importance for biological support of any computer prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2016052454,"JAK (Janus-activated kinase)-STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling is a major signal transduction pathway in mammalian cells. Different growth factors and cytokines were reported as activators of the JAK-STAT pathway in various cell types. Interestingly, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) was never reported as an inducer of the JAK-STAT pathway. In the present study, we show for the first time that AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, followed by nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated STAT3. In addition, we found that AVP induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AVP activates the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs. Furthermore, our results indicate that AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation requires both JAK2 and c-Src tyrosine kinases. The present study also implicates that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), which are serine/threonine kinases, are the mediators of STAT3 serine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation. We further suggest that AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively modulates AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, our results implicate a novel role for the JAK-STAT pathway, mediating AVP-induced VSMC hypertrophy.

STAT proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by JAK. STAT tyrosine phosphorylation promotes STAT homo- and heterodimerization via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, followed by translocation of activated STAT dimers to the nucleus. In the nucleus these proteins function as transcription factors, regulating the transcription, and therefore the expression, of various genes that participate in cell proliferation (1Aaronson D.S.

As in other cell types, the JAK-STAT pathway has a major role in VSMCs. The abundant isoforms in VSMCs are STAT1, STAT3, and JAK2. The JAK-STAT pathway could be activated in VSMCs through both tyrosine kinase receptor (YKRs) (5Bhanoori M. Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Hassid A. Jennings L.K. Rao G.N.

Almost all hormones and growth factors that activate the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs will eventually lead to cell proliferation (1Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 2Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W.

YKRs, cytokine receptors and GPCRs are all capable of activating the JAK-STAT pathway. In the case of JAK-STAT activation through YKRs (like EGFR and PDGFR) the tyrosine kinase receptor undergoes autotyrosine phosphorylation thus providing docking sites for both JAK and STAT proteins, which bind to the receptor via their SH2 domain. Once associated to the receptor, the STAT proteins are phosphorylated on conserved tyrosine residues by JAK (2Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W.

Unlike YKRs, GPCRs lack the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Therefore, the mechanism of GPCRs-induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway appears to be more elusive and intricate. It was previously described that GPCRs-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins appears to require the JAK family of tyrosine kinases (10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, the Src family of tyrosine kinases has also been implicated in phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins following activation of GPCRs (11Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous reports have shown that GPCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of different STAT isoforms seems to require different JAK and Src isoforms (7Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Besides the tyrosine phosphorylation, which is required for its activation and dimerization, STAT3 contains a single serine phosphorylation site, serine 727, which is located within a Pro-Met-Ser-Pro (PMSP) MAPK recognition sequence (12Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that most reports indicate that upon stimulation with various growth factors, serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated mainly by the MAPK proteins, and especially by extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (12Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is required for maximal transcriptional activity of the activated STAT dimer and appears to negatively modulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a vasoactive peptide, which leads to VSMC hypertrophy through activation of GPCR (14Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 15Geisterfer A.A. Owens G.K. Hypertension. 1989; 14: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Kribben A. Wieder E.D.

Interestingly, AVP was never reported as an activator of the JAK-STAT pathway. In the present study we show for the first time that AVP signaling through its GPCR activates the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs. We also examined whether JAK2 and c-Src are required for AVP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in VSMCs. Considering the major role of STAT3 serine phosphorylation in regulating STAT3 activity, we attempted to identify the serine/threonine kinases that are responsible for AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation. We also examined the cross-talk between STAT3 serine phosphorylation and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation of VSMCs. Finally, we investigated a possible involvement of the JAK-STAT pathway in AVP-induced hypertrophy. Materials—The control (scrambled) oligonucleotides, the p60 c-Src antisense oligonucleotides and the anti-total STAT3, JAK2, and actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Lipofectin was purchased from Invitrogen. AG490, SB203580, and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma. Total ERK2 antibody was prepared as previously described (17Aharonovitz O. Granot Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16494-16499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) was purchased from Pierce, and goat anti-mouse antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated), phosphospecific anti-ERK1/2 antibody and Hoechst 33258 were purchased from Sigma. Phosphotyrosine-specific and phosphoserine-specific anti-STAT3 anti-bodies were purchased from Calbiochem. Phosphotyrosine-specific anti-JAK2 antibody was purchased from Upstate, and anti-c-Src antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture—Primary rat VSMCs were isolated and cultured in 60-mm culture dishes in minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics as described previously (18Granot Y. Erikson E. Fridman H. Van Putten V. Williams B. Schrier R.W. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9564-9569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takeda K. Meyer-Lehnert H. Kim J.K. Schrier R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F254-F266PubMed Google Scholar). For all experiments, confluent VSMCs from the second through seventh passages were used. Cells were incubated with fetal calf serum-free minimum essential medium for 18–24 h prior to stimulation with different growth factors. Preparation of VSMC Lysates—VSMCs were treated with the various modulators and growth factors for the indicated times, the reaction was stopped with liquid nitrogen, and then the cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were scraped from the plates and gently sonicated (2 × 5 s, 40 W, 4 °C) and clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in cell extracts was determined according to Bradford analysis (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Cellular Fractionation—The preparation of nuclear and cytosolic fractions was carried out as described previously (21Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stimulation with AVP (100 nm), the cells (3 × 106) were washed, scraped into 0.5 ml of buffer A (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3,1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in 200 μl of the lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was mixed vigorously and centrifuged as above to yield a supernatant that contained the cytosol fraction. Nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending the nuclear pellet in 100 μl of extraction buffer (420 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol), brief sonication (2 × 5 s, 40 W, 4 °C), vigorous mixing, and centrifugation. Western Blotting—After separation of extracts by 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were immunoblotted using total ERK2, total STAT3, phosphospecific anti-ERK1/2, phosphotyrosine-specific anti-JAK2, anti-c-Src antibody, and phosphotyrosine-specific and phosphoserine-specific anti-STAT3 antibodies. In addition, protein levels were normalized against total ERK protein levels. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) Western blotting detection system. Oligonucleotide Treatment—Oligonucleotide treatment was carried out using Lipofectin as described previously by Duff et al. (22Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After treatment with either the control (scrambled) or the c-Src antisense oligonucleotides for 24 h, the medium was removed, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were allowed to recover for 30 min before stimulation with AVP. Protein/DNA Ratio—VSMCs were either pretreated with AG490 or received no treatment prior to stimulation with AVP for 0, 24, or 48 h. Then the DNA content and protein content of the cells were determined. The DNA content of the cells was determined using the Hoechst 33258 assay (23Kim Y.J. Sah R.L. Doong J.Y. Grodzinsky A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The cells were transferred from the culture dishes to a 96-well plate in 100 μl of fetal calf serum-free minimum essential medium and then 100 μl of Hoechst solution (10 μl/ml) was added to the well. Following a 10-min incubation, the absorbance was read on a microtiter plate spectrophotometer at 340 nm. For protein content determination, cells were lysed, and the protein concentration in cell extracts was determined according to Bradford analysis (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The protein/DNA ratio experiments were carried out three separate times, and each experiment contained triplicates of the various treatments. The significance of the results was determined by two-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05), performed by STATISTICA software. AVP Activates STAT3 and JAK2 in VSMCs—Currently, it has not been reported that AVP is capable of activating the JAK-STAT pathway. To examine whether AVP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in cultured rat aortic VSMCs, growth-arrested cells were treated for 10 min with AVP (100 nm). Other treatments were with AngII (100 nm for 10 min) and with EGF (1 nm for 10 min), both are known activators of the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs. Cells were lysed and immunoblotted with anti-STAT3 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody that recognizes the tyrosine 705-phosphorylated (but not the non-phosphorylated) form of STAT3. As shown in Fig. 1, AVP induced a significant tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, compared with untreated cells (negative control), indicating that AVP activates STAT3 in VSMCs. To determine the time dependence of AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, growth-arrested cells were treated at different times with AVP (100 nm). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot using anti-STAT3 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Fig. 2A), and densitometric analysis of the results was carried out (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B, AVP induces STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in a biphasic manner, with peaks following 15 and 60 min of stimulation with AVP. In addition, STAT3 serine phosphorylation was also examined using an anti-phosphoserine STAT3 antibody. Treatment with AVP led to a monophasic increase in STAT3 serine phosphorylation, with the highest level observed at 5–15 min (data not shown). Because several studies have demonstrated JAK2 involvement in STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in response to other growth factors (8Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18915-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we examined whether AVP induces tyrosine phosphorylation and thus activation of JAK2. Therefore, we examined JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to stimulation with AVP for different time periods. Tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 was detected by immunoblotting cell lysates with phosphotyrosine-specific anti-JAK2 antibody (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, a densitometric analysis shows a biphasic increase in JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with AVP, with maximal activation of JAK2 following 10 and 60 min. Of note, JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus activation, precedes STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting a possible role for JAK2 as the mediator of AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of STAT proteins, including STAT3, promotes their translocation to the cell nucleus, where they induce the transcription of their target genes. To determine whether AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by nuclear translocation, nuclear and cytosolic fractions of AVP-treated VSMCs were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions were subjected to immunoblot using phosphotyrosine-specific anti-STAT3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, AVP induced not only tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but also nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated STAT3 proteins. JAK2 and c-Src Tyrosine Kinases Are Involved in AVP-induced STAT3 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—JAK2 was previously reported as the mediator of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to various growth factors. To test whether AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is also mediated by JAK2, we used AG490, a selective JAK2 inhibitor, which inhibits JAK2 at low micromolar concentrations (<5 μm) but does not inhibit the family of Src tyrosine kinases even at higher concentrations than 50 μm (24Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with AG490 (10 μm) for 1 h prior to stimulation with AVP (100 nm) for 0, 15, and 60 min. As shown in Fig. 4A, AG490 inhibited AVP-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was greatly diminished by pretreatment with AG490, compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we suggest that AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of JAK2 and probably involves direct JAK2 phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine residues. Interestingly, STAT3 serine phosphorylation was not altered upon pretreatment with AG490 (Fig. 4C). STAT3 activation via GPCRs, for instance upon AngII and thrombin stimulation, appears to be mediated via different members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. To determine whether p60 c-Src (c-Src) is involved in AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMCs, we carried out experiments in which we utilized a specific c-Src antisense oligonucleotide to suppress c-Src protein expression. VSMCs were treated with a control (scrambled) oligonucleotide or with the c-Src antisense oligonucleotide using Lipofectin, for 24 h prior to stimulation with AVP (100 nm) for 60 min. Expectedly, treatment with the c-Src antisense oligonucleotide greatly diminished c-Src protein expression compared with treatment with the control (scrambled) oligonucleotide (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, the c-Src antisense oligonucleotide treatment significantly abrogated AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that c-Src is required for AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. AVP-induced STAT3 Serine Phosphorylation Is Mediated by ERK1/2—STAT3 serine phosphorylation has a major role in enhancing STAT3 transcriptional activity. Serine 727, which is the single serine phosphorylation site in STAT3, is located within a PMSP MAPK recognition sequence. Accordingly, previous studies have shown that upon stimulation with various growth factors, such as AngII, EGF, and PDGF, serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated by the MAPK family members, and especially by ERK1/2 (12Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was demonstrated that AVP induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation in VSMCs (18Granot Y. Erikson E. Fridman H. Van Putten V. Williams B. Schrier R.W. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9564-9569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To find whether STAT3 serine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation is mediated through the MAPK pathway, and specifically by ERK1/2, we used the specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (25Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with PD98059 (20 μm) for 20 min prior to stimulation with AVP (100 nm) for 0, 15, and 60 min. Pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 significantly blocked the phosphorylation and therefore the activation of ERK1/2, the down-stream targets of MEK (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, PD98059 also led to a decrease in STAT3 serine phosphorylation, suggesting that AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation is mediated by ERK1/2. Furthermore, treatment with SB203580 (10 μm, for 30 min prior to AVP stimulation), which is a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (26Wang Z. Canagarajah B.J. Boehm J.C. Kassisa S. Cobb M.H. Young P.R. Abdel-Meguid S. Adams J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1117-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), had no significant effect on STAT3 serine phosphorylation indicating that p38 MAPK is not responsible for AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 6E). AVP-induced STAT3 Serine Phosphorylation Negatively Modulates Its Tyrosine Phosphorylation—STAT3 serine phosphorylation was previously reported to negatively modulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To find whether STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively modulates STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with AVP, we also examined the effect of PD98059 pretreatment on AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6C, PD98059, which inhibited AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation, induced a significant elevation in AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, implying that upon AVP stimulation STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively modulates STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. To confirm these results we carried out experiments using PMA. PMA is a known modulator of protein kinase C (PKC) and subsequently of the MAPK pathway in various cell types (16Kribben A. Wieder E.D. Li X. van Putten V. Granot Y. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Caramelo C. Okada K. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Am. J.

In VSMCs, PKCα is the most abundant PKC isoform (31Stauble B. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 29: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies and our results (data not shown) have demonstrated that a 24-h exposure to PMA leads to a significant down-regulation of PKCα in several cell types, including VSMCs. Because the MAPK pathway is known to be activated via PKCα in VSMCs upon activation of GPCR (32Nemenoff R.A. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we investigated the involvement of PKCα in the MAPK pathway in response to AVP stimulation. Therefore, cells were either pretreated with PMA for 24 h or received no pretreatment, before stimulation with AVP (100 nm) for 0, 15, and 60 min. As expected, PMA treatment for 24 h markedly inhibited AVP-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7A). The abrogated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, because of the 24-h exposure to PMA, led to a significant decrease in AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 7B), further indicating that STAT3 serine phosphorylation in response to AVP is mediated by ERK1/2. Furthermore, the 24-h exposure to PMA, which led to decreased STAT3 serine phosphorylation, also led to a significant increase in AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, compared with cells that were not pretreated with PMA prior to AVP stimulation (Fig. 7C). These results support the notion that the negative modulation of STAT3 serine phosphorylation on STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs upon stimulation of VSMCs with AVP. Short term exposure to PMA (10 min) activates PKCα and subsequently the MAPK pathway (16Kribben A. Wieder E.D. Li X. van Putten V. Granot Y. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Caramelo C. Okada K. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F875-F881PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen C.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 30Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). To verify the results regarding STAT3 serine phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with PMA (2.5 μm) for 10 min prior to stimulation with AVP (100 nm) for 0, 15, or 60 min. As expected, pretreatment with PMA for 10 min markedly enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to AVP (Fig. 8A). Accordingly, AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation was also augmented in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 8B), confirming that STAT3 serine phosphorylation in response to AVP stimulation is directly mediated by ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 8C, pretreatment with PMA for 10 min significantly decreased STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to AVP. These results provide yet another indication that AVP-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 negatively regulates its tyrosine phosphorylation. Next, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively modulates its tyrosine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation. Therefore, we examined whether JAK2 is involved in that process. As shown in Fig. 8D, PMA treatment for 10 min prior to AVP stimulation, which enhanced AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation and reduced AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, also led to a significant decrease in AVP-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, PMA treatment for 24 h prior to AVP stimulation, which abrogated AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation and enhanced AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, also led to a significant increase in AVP-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7D). These results strongly suggest that JAK2 is involved in the mechanism by which STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively regulates STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation. The JAK-STAT Pathway Is Involved in AVP-induced VSMC Hypertrophy—Following our discovery that AVP activates the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs, it was interesting to find out the physiological consequences of that activation. As mentioned before, AVP leads to VSMC hypertrophy (14Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 15Geisterfer A.A. Owens G.K. Hypertension. 1989; 14: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Kribben A. Wieder E.D. Li X. van Putten V. Granot Y. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the JAK-STAT pathway was only implicated in VSMC proliferation and migration by various growth factors. Therefore, it was interesting to examine whether the JAK-STAT pathway is also involved in AVP-induced VSMC hypertrophy. Therefore, VSMCs were either treated with AG490 for 1 h or received no treatment prior to AVP treatment for 24 or 48 h. Hypertrophy is an increase in cell size because of elevation in protein content without DNA replication. Therefore, the hypertrophy assay was carried out by measuring the ratio between the protein content and the DNA content of the treated VSMCs. The protein content was measured by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), and the DNA content was measured using the Hoechst 33258 reagent, a fluorescent dye, which binds to the DNA of the cells (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 23Kim Y.J. Sah R.L. Doong J.Y. Grodzinsky A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Then, the ratio between the protein content and the DNA content is calculated for each treatment and is normalized according to the control, untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 9, treatment with AVP alone or following incubation with AG490 did not significantly affect cell viability, as indicated by the unaltered DNA content. However, the AVP treatment led to a significant increase in protein content, an increase that is inhibited by AG490 pretreatment. Accordingly, AVP treatment for 24 and 48 h leads to VSMC hypertrophy, as indicated by the significant increase in the protein/DNA ratio. Pretreatment with AG490 (10 μm, 1 h) prior to the AVP stimulation, completely abrogates VSMC hypertrophy, as indicated by the decrease in the protein/DNA ratio to control levels. These results suggest that the JAK-STAT pathway has a major role in AVP-induced VSMC hypertrophy. As previously described the JAK-STAT pathway is activated by various cytokines and growth factors, such as PDGF, EGF, interleukin-6, and AngII (5Bhanoori M. Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Hassid A. Jennings L.K. Rao G.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Yamamoto H. Crow M. Cheng L. Lakatta E. Kinsella J. Exp.

However, AVP was never reported as an activator of the JAK-STAT pathway. The results of the current study show for the first time that AVP induces both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT3, followed by nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated STAT3. Our results also demonstrate that both JAK2 and c-Src are required for AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, serine phosphorylation of STAT3 upon AVP stimulation appears to be mediated directly by ERK1/2 and was also shown to negatively modulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, our results indicate that the JAK-STAT pathway has a major role in AVP-induced VSMC hypertrophy. GPCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins often requires the involvement of the JAK and Src tyrosine kinases. In addition, different STAT isoforms requires different members of the JAK and Src families upon stimulation with different growth factors. For instance, both JAK2 and the Src family p59 Fyn tyrosine kinases are required for AngII-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas c-Src is required for AngII-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (7Liang H.

JAK2 was also shown to be a prerequisite for both STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation upon thrombin stimulation of VSMCs (8Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18915-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study we showed that AVP induces JAK2 phosphorylation and that inhibition of JAK2 with AG490 inhibits AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, down-regulation of c-Src using c-Src-specific antisense oligonucleotide abolished AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, our results indicated that both JAK2 and c-Src are required for AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Ram et al. (11Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) previously suggested that Src proteins may serve as scaffolds for both STAT and JAK proteins, thus mediating GPCR-induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Src activation was previously demonstrated upon AVP stimulation of various cell types (34Byron K.L. Lucchesi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7298-7307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Considering these studies and the results presented in this study, we propose that AVP binding to its GPCR activates both c-Src and JAK2, thereby inducing the formation of a c-Src-JAK2 complex. The activated c-Src may serve as a docking site for STAT3, which is then phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by JAK2. STAT3 was previously reported as a substrate for c-Src in vitro, and Liang et al. (7Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) even suggested that c-Src directly phosphorylates STAT3 upon AngII stimulation of VSMCs. On the other hand, JAK2 was reported to phosphorylate STAT3 in vivo on tyrosine residues upon stimulation with several growth factors and cytokines. In addition, our results showed that AVP induces JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation prior to STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and that phosphorylated and activated JAK2 is required for AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, we predict that upon AVP stimulation, STAT3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAK2, whereas c-Src serves as a scaffold for both JAK2 and STAT3. However, further study is required to find whether phosphorylated and active c-Src is required and to elucidate the mechanism by which AVP induces STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Importantly, the present study show that AVP not only induces STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation but also leads to nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated STAT3 proteins. Of note, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was undetectable in the cytoplasmic fraction, probably because of the immediate translocation of the phosphorylated STAT3 into the nucleus upon AVP stimulation. In addition, after STAT3 completes its transcriptional role in the nucleus, it undergoes rapid dephosphorylation by specific phosphatases, causing the fraction of tyrosinephosphorylated STAT3 in the cytoplasm to be extremely low and therefore undetectable. Besides phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, STAT3 is also phosphorylated on serine residues in response to several cytokines and growth factors. As mentioned before, phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 is required for maximal transcriptional activity, and it occurs within a PMSP MAPK recognition sequence. Therefore, it is not surprising that previous reports have indicated that STAT3 serine phosphorylation is mediated via the members of the MAPK family and mainly by ERK1/2 (12Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). For example, EGF induces the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 by ERK1/2 (13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-2 and AngII-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation was shown to be MEK/ERK-dependent (7Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that AVP induces STAT3 serine phosphorylation in a monophasic manner, with high levels of serine phosphorylated STAT3 observed at 5–15 min following AVP stimulation. Interestingly, the mode of AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation corresponds to that of the transient AVP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation (18Granot Y. Erikson E. Fridman H. Van Putten V. Williams B. Schrier R.W. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9564-9569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation was blocked upon treatment with PD98059, which is a specific inhibitor for MEK and consequently for ERK1/2. In contrast, the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580, did not affect AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation, demonstrating that p38 is not involved in AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation. Long exposure to PMA, which causes the down-regulation of PKCα and abrogation of ERK1/2 activation, also diminished AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation. Furthermore, enhanced activation of ERK1/2, because of short exposure to PMA, led to augmented STAT3 serine phosphorylation in response to AVP. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation is directly mediated by ERK1/2. In addition, incubation of the cells with both PMA for 10 min and PD98059 prior to AVP stimulation did not lead to decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 as compared with AVP treatment alone (data not shown), indicating that the PKC-dependent decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 8C) is also MEK-dependent. Of note, although the PKC pathway plays a major role in AVP-induced activation of the MAPK pathway, it is possible that other signaling pathways also lead to MAPK activation and STAT3 serine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation. Chung et al. (13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) has previously suggested that STAT3 serine 727 phosphorylation negatively modulates its tyrosine phosphorylation. Also noteworthy, negative modulation was demonstrated upon EGF stimulation of COS cells that transiently expressed STAT3. For instance, it was demonstrated that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the S727A STAT3 mutant was significantly higher than that of the wild type STAT3 protein expressed under similar condition in these cells. Our results showed that treatments with PD98059 and with PMA (for 24 h) that abolished AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation, caused by inhibition of ERK1/2, also enhanced AVP-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, short exposure to PMA, which augmented AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation because of enhanced ERK1/2 activation, also decreased STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation upon AVP treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that serine phosphorylation of STAT3 negatively modulates STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation upon AVP stimulation. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively modulates its tyrosine phosphorylation, we demonstrated that pretreatment of the cells with PMA for 10 min prior to AVP stimulation, which leads to enhanced serine phosphorylation and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation, also abrogates JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, PMA treatment for 24 h prior to AVP stimulation, which inhibits STAT3 serine phosphorylation and augments its tyrosine phosphorylation, also significantly enhances JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AVP-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation negatively regulates STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in a mechanism that involves JAK2. Therefore, a potential mechanism could be that phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727 modulates the accessibility of the tyrosine 705 residue to JAK2, its major tyrosine kinase, perhaps by creating a steric interference. It is also possible that the phosphorylation on serine 727 exposes the tyrosine 705 residue to a rapid dephosphorylation by specific phosphatases. Also noteworthy, pretreatment with AG490, which inhibits AVP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, had no effect on AVP-induced serine phosphorylation, indicating that it is the serine phosphorylation that negatively modulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and not vice versa. It will be of great interest to further investigate the potential mechanisms and cellular consequences of that unique cross-talk between AVP-induced STAT3 serine and tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that appears to be crucial for regulating STAT3 activity. Although the JAK-STAT pathway is capable of inducing migration of VSMCs upon stimulation with urokinase (37Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol.

However, AVP leads only to hypertrophy of VSMCs (14Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 15Geisterfer A.A. Owens G.K.

Therefore, we chose to examine hypertrophy as a possible physiological consequence of AVP-induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs. As shown in Fig. 9, pretreatment with AG490 prior to the 24- and 48-h stimulation with AVP, completely abrogated AVP-induced VSMC hypertrophy. These results indicate that the JAK-STAT pathway plays a major role in AVP-induced VSMC hypertrophy, possibly revealing a novel physiological consequence for the JAK-STAT pathway in VSMCs. In conclusion, in the present study AVP was shown to activate the JAK-STAT pathway, an important signaling pathway that appears to be involved in AVP-induced hypertrophy. AVP induces both JAK2-dependent STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK1/2-dependent serine phosphorylation. The intriguing AVP-induced cross-talk between the PKC-ERK pathway and the JAK-STAT pathway is demonstrated by the unique negative modulation of STAT3 serine phosphorylation on its tyrosine phosphorylation. The cross-talk between the serine phosphorylation and the tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be crucial for STAT3 activity, and further research is required to elucidate the role of that cross-talk in STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcription.

The results provide the first clear-cut indication of how toxin release can be controlled by a specific side chain of a carrier protein. The search for stable and nontoxic carrier-based drug delivery systems is a new trend in the recently emerging field of ligand-targeted therapeutics (1Allen T.M. Cullis P.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). The protein-mediated ligand-selective and high affinity carriers offer a promising strategy in drug targeting and controlled delivery of small therapeutic chemical agents (2de Wolf F.A. Brett G.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 207-236PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the rapid advancements, understanding the naturally ingenious ways by which the bioactive ligands are released and controlled has been the subject of substantial interest, especially among biological chemists. The mechanism of noncovalent ligand release has been studied for many carrier proteins. Lipoprotein receptor family, α-tocopherol transfer protein, retinol-binding proteins, pheromone-binding proteins, etc., are a few examples. Most models of ligand release from carrier protein complexes are hitherto found to be concomitant or subsequent to significant conformational changes in the protein structure (see Refs. 3Beglova N.

Elsevier, New York1999: 553-592Crossref Google Scholar) includes some of the most potent antitumor agents and appears to be the only well studied category of the natural antibiotic chromoproteins. Neocarzinostatin (NCS) 2The abbreviations used are: NCS, neocarzinostatin; holoNCS, holoneocarzinostatin; apoNCS, aponeocarzinostatin; NCS-C, NCS chromophore; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; EK, enterokinase; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide. (secreted by Streptomyces carzinostaticus), being the first member of this family (11Ishida N. Miyazaki K. Kumagai K. Rikimaru M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) Ser. A. 1965; 18: 68-76PubMed Google Scholar), has intrigued scientists by virtue of its novel architecture, unusually high DNA cleavage activity, and antitumor effect (12Abe S. Otsuki M. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2002; 2: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein component of NCS, aponeocarzinostatin (apoNCS), is biologically inactive but plays important roles in protecting and transferring the labile chromophore (NCS-C) to the target DNA (13Goldberg I.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24: 191-198Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that apoNCS does not bind to DNA (14Jung G. Kohnlein W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and its biological activity relies on the release of the tightly bound NCS-C (Kd ≤ 0.1 nm) (15Povirk L.F. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4773-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) before NCS interacts with DNA. The fundamental mechanism underlying such a process displays a fascinating partnership between the biologically active chromophore and the apoprotein-based drug delivery system. apoNCS is an all-β protein with 113 amino acid residues and two disulfide bonds. It possesses a deep cavity for noncovalent binding of its chromophore (16Gao X. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Wilson K. Kuromizu K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Kim K.H. Kwon B.M. Myers A.G. Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of apoNCS and holoNCS are reported to be almost superimposable (18Kim K.H. Kwon B.M. Myers A.G. Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The striking similarity between the structures of apoNCS and holoNCS imply that distinct structural changes might not be necessary for the binding or release of NCS-C. We also found that chromophore release of holoNCS can precede major secondary and/or tertiary structural changes in the protein (19Sudhahar G.C. Balamurugan K. Chin D.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39900-39906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This leads to a logical speculation of whether and which, if any, side chains can control the release via subtle fluctuations in protein conformation. We anticipate that the possible candidates responsible for gating the chromophore release should satisfy two criteria. First, they must reside on the surface rather than the interior of the protein. Second, they are likely to be located in the opening of the binding cleft rather than being distributed in other parts of the surface. Physiological release of a noncovalently bound ligand from a protein complex is often triggered by a specific contact with some trans-acting agents in a cell. Such contact, if present, is more likely to occur on the solvent-exposed surface than the interior. Next, when backbone conformation remains unchanged, association or dissociation of a ligand must be through the opening of the binding cleft. Fig. 1 illustrates an aqueous model of holoNCS (20Chin D.-H. Chem.-Eur. J. 1999; 5: 1084-1090Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) adapted from the crystal structure (pdb.1nco.ent) (see supplementary Fig. S1 on line for the stereo view of holoNCS complex). The NCS-C is clamped in between two β-hairpin loops, designated as Loop 1 (between strands 7 and 8) and Loop 2 (between strands 9 and 10). NMR studies on dynamics and relaxation of NCS reveal internal motion and localized flexibility in the loop regions around the binding cleft (21Mispelter J. Lefevre C. Adjadj E. Quiniou E. Favaudon V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Valerio-Lepiniec M. Nicaise M. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We speculate that these loop residues (residues 75–80 in Loop 1 and residues 98–102 in Loop 2) may play a pivotal role and thus set up mutagenesis studies to explore the effect of these side chains on chromophore release. Despite large efforts in the past to clone apoNCS, it was reported only in recent years by a few groups using a synthesized artificial gene (23Heyd B. Lerat G. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Nozaki S. Tomioka Y. Hishinuma T. Inoue M. Nagumo Y. Tsuruta L.R. Hayashi K. Matsumoto T. Kato Y. Ishiwata S. Itoh K.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11731-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We report for the first time a construct carrying the natural apoNCS gene and apply it for the first time in an enediyne toxin release study. Not willing to compromise on any possible loss of the structural identity of recombinant apoNCS to that of natural one from S. carzinostaticus in our mutagenesis studies, we designated a convenient strategy to produce recombinant apoNCS identical to the natural one, including at the termini. We also carefully performed a disulfide assay to ascertain the formation of the disulfide linkage in the recombinant apoNCS. Such concern could not be overlooked because our study highly depends on the quality of the folded conformation. Extraction of NCS-C—The NCS powder was from Kayaku Co., Ltd. (Itabashi-Ku, Tokyo, Japan). Repeated methanolic extraction of NCS-C was carried out from lyophilized NCS stock (0.5 mm) in 5 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0, following the described method (26Kuo H.-M. Lee Chao P.-D. Chin D.-H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The integrity and concentration of NCS-C were checked by HPLC analysis and the increased A340 (ε, 10,800) after titrating with excess apoNCS. Reconstitution of holoNCS—The reconstitution of holoNCSs was performed in ice by adding an equimolar (1:1) amount of the methanol-extracted NCS-C into a solution of recombinant protein in 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. The mixture was incubated at 0 °C for 5–10 min to ensure complete reconstitution. The holoNCSs were freshly made before experiments, and the methanol amount in the reaction mixture was adjusted to below 5%. Care was taken to avoid degradation of the labile chromophore, and the integrity of the NCS-C after reconstitution was examined by HPLC analysis. pCAL-n-EK-apoNCS Construct—The genomic DNA template was isolated from vegetative cultures of S. carzinostaticus (ATCC 15944). The sequence of the ncsA gene (GenBank™, National Institutes of Health genetic sequence data base (gi|420324|) (27Sakata N. Minamitani S. Kanbe T. Hori M. Hamada M. Edo K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which encodes the 147-amino acid pre-apoNCS with a signal peptide at the N terminus, was used for primer design. The native gene of the 113-amino acid apoNCS was amplified by PCR with the following primers: forward, 5′-GACGACGACAAGGCGGCGCCGACGGCTACGGT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGAACAAGACCCGTCGGAGCGGATCCTCCGATCA-3′. The 12-nucleotide upstream and 13-nucleotide downstream flanking sequences were included for ligation-independent cloning in T7/lac promoter-based Escherichia coli expression vector, pCAL-n-EK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The vector (50 ng), after it is digested with Eam11041 and gel-purified, was incubated at 72 °C for 10 min in a solution containing 1 mm dTTP and Pfu DNA polymerase (ligation-independent cloning kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to produce 12- and 13-nucleotide ligation-independent cloning single-stranded overhangs. Similarly, 175 ng of the gel-purified PCR amplicons was treated with Pfu DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mm dATP. The vector and insert were annealed at room temperature for 1 h of incubation, and the product was transformed into E. coli DH5α. The apoNCS gene was fused downstream to the sequence encoding the N-terminal calmodulin affinity peptide (CBP) tag that was combined with the EK cleavage site (28Wyborski D.L. Bauer J.C. Zheng C.F. Felts K. Vaillancourt P. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Vaillancourt P. Zheng C.F. Hoang D.Q. Briester L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 340-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inclusion of the EK site allowed complete removal of the CBP tag and generated apoNCS with the native N terminus (i.e. Ala1 in apoNCS). The DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons and pCAL-n-EK-apoNCS construct was performed twice on automated ABI prism sequencer model 310 (Applied Biosystems, CA) to verify the correctness of the sequence. Site-specific Mutant Constructs of apoNCS—A PCR-based quick change mutagenesis method was applied to obtain site-specific mutant constructs of apoNCS. The codon GCG and CUG were used for the replacement to Ala and Leu, respectively, according to the codon usage of E. coli (30Nakamura Y. Wada K. Wada Y. Doi H. Kanaya S. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 214-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Followed by PCR, DpnI was used to deplete the unmutagenized DNA. The mutant construct was transformed into E. coli DH5α, and the constructed plasmids were sequenced at least twice until the correct sequence was repeatedly confirmed. Expression and Purification of Recombinant apoNCS Proteins—The pCAL-n-EK expression construct of native or mutated apoNCSs was transformed into E. coli BL21 Codon Plus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The expression of CBP-apoNCS fusion protein was induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 5 h. After ultrasonication of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli cells, the CBP-apoNCS fusion protein was found in soluble fraction of the cell extract. The CBP-apoNCS fusion protein was purified using calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (28Wyborski D.L. Bauer J.C. Zheng C.F. Felts K. Vaillancourt P. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Vaillancourt P. Zheng C.F. Hoang D.Q. Briester L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 340-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was subsequently desalted and concentrated through Amicon or Centricon cellulose membrane (MWCO: 3000) (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The quantity of the recovered CBP-apoNCS fusion protein was evaluated by UV spectrophotometry. The extinction coefficient of the fusion protein at 278 nm, ε278 = 21,400 m–1, was estimated from the reported value for apoNCS, ε278 = 14,400 m–1 (31Povirk L.F. Dattagupta N. Warf B.C. Goldberg I.H.

Commun. 1979; 89: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and the calculated value for the CBP tag protein, ε278 = 7000 m–1 (ProtParam) (33Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). For each mg of the CBP-apoNCS fusion protein, 1 unit of EK (Invitrogen, CA, or GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) was added, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for several days. When the enzymatic cleaving of the CBP tag was more than 90% complete (checked by SDS-PAGE), the mixture was separated by DEAE-Sepharose (Fast Flow) resin (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl. The final protein product was collected after dialysis against water or filtration through Amicon or Centricon cellulose membrane (MWCO: 3000). The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC. The averaged purity was greater than 95%. The authenticity of each protein was verified by mass spectrometry and disulfide linkage test, as described below. The final yield of recombinant apoNCS and mutants was at a range of 0.25–4 mg/liter of LB culture. Aggregation was frequently observed during purification of wild type (WT) recombinant apoNCS and mutants. This caused low yield from some mutants. For instance, the average yield of D79A was only 0.25 mg/liter of LB culture. Among all mutants purified for the study, F78L showed the highest yield (4 mg/liter of LB culture). Expression and Purification of 15N-Labeled Proteins—Uniform 15N labeling was achieved by growing the host bacteria, E. coli BL21 Codon Plus, with vitamin B1 in M9 minimal medium containing 0.25 g/liter of 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., MA) as the sole nitrogen source. The purification of the labeled apoNCS and mutants was carried out following the same procedure as described above. The yield was about half of that of the corresponding unlabeled protein. Changing ammonium chloride from 0.50 to 0.125 g/liter of medium did not significantly reduce or improve the protein yield. Mass Spectrometry—All of the mass spectrometries were done on a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometry detector (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) equipped with atmospheric pressure ionization source using electrospray ionization (+)-charge mode. The protein samples were diluted in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for analysis. NMR Spectroscopy—One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of unlabeled WT apoNCS and mutants were recorded at room temperature on a Varian 600-MHz NMR spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA). The two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX 600-MHz spectrometer (Rheinstetten, Germany) at 25 °C. The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, in 10% D2O, 90% H2O. The cross-peaks for WT apoNCS were identified based on the reported assignments (25Urbaniak M.D. Muskett F.W. Finucane M.D. Caddick S. Woolfson D.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11731-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cross-peak of Tyr32, which is in a tyrosine corner-like motif and is considered to contribute stability of apoNCS (34Nicaise M. Valerio-Lepiniec M. Izadi-Pruneyre N. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), was used here as an internal reference. CD Spectroscopy—All of the CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a circulating water bath (Neslab, model RTE-140) (Portsmouth, NH). For apoNCS and its mutants, a 200-μl protein solution in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a concentration level of 10–15 μm for far UV CD and 50 μm for near UV CD, was used for measurement. The spectrum was recorded at 25 °C using a temperature controlled water-jacketed cell with 0.1-cm-path length at a scan speed of 20 nm/min. For reconstituted WT and mutated holoNCSs, a 10 μm sample in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, was used for measurement. Because of the instability of holoNCSs, the scan speed was increased to 100 nm/min to reduce time. All of the spectra were accumulated minimum five times and are corrected for the respective buffer blanks. The data are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity for both apoNCS and holoNCS (19Sudhahar G.C. Balamurugan K. Chin D.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39900-39906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescent changes from a holoNCS sample in kinetic release study were monitored by a SLM Aminco Bowman Series II luminescence spectrometer (SLM Aminco Bowman, Urbana, IL). The sample temperature was controlled at 25 °C by a thermostatic cell holder equipped with a refrigerated thermostatic bath circulator. The sample of volume 150 μl in a 3-mm square cell was used. A single point acquisition of emission data at 440 nm was collected once per 30 s by excitation at 340 nm. To avoid the degradation of holoNCSs by excessive exposure to the light source, the light shutter was controlled by modification of time scan mode using an in-house written macro language commands so that it can be closed in between data collections. In a 100-min monitoring, exposure of NCS to light was minimized to 2.33 min. A rapid kinetics setup was used for fast releasing mutant F78L, where the shutter control was suspended for the initial 3 min to collect data once per 5 s. After that, the shutter control was enabled as described. Disulfide Linkage Test—A facile disulfide evaluation procedure was developed for checking the integrality of the produced recombinant apoNCS and its mutants. To 100 μl of solution of 10 μm apoNCS protein in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, guanidine hydrochloride was added to a final concentration of 4 m. After mixing, 80-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide over apoNCS (20-fold excess/Cys residue) was added at 37 °C for 2 h. Under this treatment, alkylation can occur on any un-oxidized Cys residues in apoNCS. The protein sample was then desalted and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Thermal-induced Denaturation—The thermal-induced denaturationof50 μm of WT apoNCS and mutants, in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, was monitored by CD spectroscopy at 224 nm from 25–91 °C with 3 °C increments. The temperature was controlled by a microprocessor and a temperature sensor. The equilibrium time was 15 min, and the ellipticity was recorded for 30 s at each temperature setting. Kinetic Study on the Release of NCS-C—The rate of NCS-C release from natural, reconstituted WT or mutated holoNCSs was determined using the method previously published (19Sudhahar G.C. Balamurugan K. Chin D.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39900-39906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reconstituted holoNCSs (10 μm) were prepared in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and the release of NCS-C was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy at 25 °C after the addition of 5 mm GSH. The final reading of the emission was obtained after the sample was treated with 80% isopropanol (to complete the release of NCS-C). The release kinetics was also independently examined by HPLC analyses. The samples (0.5 nmol), prepared as above, were drawn at different time points and were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. The quantity of the intact NCS-C and GSH-induced adduct, which represent population of the protein-bound and released species, respectively, were estimated using the method described (35Chin D.-H. Tseng M.-C. Chuang T.-C. Hong M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Kinetic Release Data Processing Information—The rate of release is expressed as d[holoNCS]/dt=−kobs[holoNCS]u=−k1[holoNCS] (Eq. 1) where kobs and n are the observed rate constant and reaction order for the rate of disappearance of holoNCS, respectively, and k1 is the first order rate constant after approximation. However, the release rate decreased gradually with time when ratio of apoNCS to NCS-C increased with progressing lose of the intact NCS-C. For consistency, all of the rate constants were calculated from the initial 10% release that fit into a first order linear plot (the averaged r = 0.97 analyzed by the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA)). holoNCS-induced DNA Damage—The DNA cleavage ability of each chromoprotein complex was assessed by the proportion of conversion from form I DNA (supercoiled) to form II (relaxed; caused by single strand breaks) and form III (linear; caused by double-stranded breaks). The supercoiled pBR322 DNA was isolated from E. coli using Mini-Prep plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.). A 16-μl DNA drug reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 5 μm (final concentration) of freshly reconstituted holoNCS, 5 mm GSH, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 40 ng/μlof pBR322 DNA. The mixture was incubated at 16 °C for 15 min and was immediately loaded onto a 1% w/v agarose gel for analysis. HPLC Analyses—When release kinetics was followed by HPLC, the amount of the protein bound (intact form) and the released NCS-C (inactivated by GSH into an adduct) were analyzed by a Waters Millennium HPLC equipped with a 600E solvent delivery system, a 996 photodiode array detector, and a Waters 474 or a Jasco FP-1520 fluorescence detector using the described method (19Sudhahar G.C. Balamurugan K. Chin D.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39900-39906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Chin D.-H. Tseng M.-C. Chuang T.-C. Hong M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The purity of WT and mutated apoNCSs (0.5–1 nmol) were examined using a gradient that starts with a sharp increase from 0 to 30% of CH3CN (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 2 min, followed by a shallow linear increase to 35 and 40% in 17 and 52 min, respectively. The chromophore separation involved the gradient that starts with a sharp increase from 0 to 48% of acidic methanol containing 5 mm ammonium acetate at pH 5, within the initial 3 min, followed by a shallow linear increase to 80% in 65 min. Cloning and Characterization of Recombinant apoNCS Proteins—After a long attempt, we successfully isolated the native gene of the 113-amino acid apoNCS from S. carzinostaticus. The use of pCAL-n-EK allowed expression of a fusion protein from which apoNCS could be retrieved by a proteolytic removal of its tag by EK. The recombinant apoNCS thus obtained possessed the native termini without any extraneous residues. After DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography, the purified recombinant apoNCS and mutants showed a single band corresponding to the band of the natural apoNCS in SDS-PAGE. A single peak was observed by HPLC analysis, indicating the homogeneity of the purified proteins. The mono isotopic mass number of the recombinant WT apoNCS (11085 ± 1), as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry measurement, matches with the theoretical value (11085.2). The mono isotopic mass numbers of all mutants and 15N-labeled proteins are also in good agreement with their theoretical molecular weights. Disulfide Assay—To avoid any possible artifacts, it was crucial to examine whether all disulfide linkages were properly formed in the produced proteins. This assay was specifically developed for apoNCS, and the sensitivity and validity have been evaluated and confirmed. 3C.-J. Tseng and D.-H. Chin, unpublished data. As evidenced by mass spectrometry measurement, no alkylated species was observed for all purified proteins obtained in the current investigation. The results demonstrate the absence of free–SH in cysteine residues and indicate that the WT and all mutated apoNCSs contain two disulfides as the natural one does. CD Spectra of WT and Mutated apoNCS—The structural characterization of WT and mutant apoNCSs was carried out by CD. The far UV CD spectrum of the recombinant WT apoNCS (Fig. 2A) revealed a predominant β-sheet structure. The profile is consistent with that reported for the native apoNCS (19Sudhahar G.C. Balamurugan K. Chin D.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39900-39906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Heyd B. Lerat G. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. J.

Only a slight deviation was observed in the spectra of F76A and D99A mutants. Overall, the characteristic f"

This enzyme is an integral membrane protein composed of two 27-kDa subunits that assemble into a functional enzyme after translation using a highly conserved sequence of 16 amino acids in the C-terminal half of the polypeptide, 148DFLXXYIXEAHXXDGW163. In this study, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify the key residues in this domain required for holoenzyme assembly. Overexpression of sequential alanine-substituted mutants of a dimerization domain-green fluorescent protein fusion showed that sequence 152IYI154 was required for type I enzyme assembly and that a catalytically active monomer was generated by a single I152A substitution. Overexpression of the sequential alanine-substituted dimerization domain mutants in type II selenodeiodinase-expressing cells showed that five residues (153FLIVY157) at the beginning and three residues (164SDG166) at the end of this region were required for the assembly of the type II enzyme. In vitro binding analysis revealed a free energy of association of –60 ± 5 kJ/mol for the noncovalent interaction between dimerization domain monomers. These data identify and characterize the essential residues in the dimerization domain that are responsible for the post-translational assembly of selenodeiodinases.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and catalytically active enzymes are generated by the post-translational assembly of two enzyme subunits (4Safran M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3233-3238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain responsible for enzyme assembly is located between residues 148 and 163 of the 27-kDa type I deiodinase (D1) subunit, and it is highly conserved across species and among family members (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Different family member subunits interact with each other through this domain to assemble hybrid enzymes. Interestingly, the hybrid enzyme formed from the combination of a catalytically inert D1 subunit and a functional type II selenodeiodinase (SeD2) subunit is inactive, whereas hybrid enzyme dimers formed between a catalytically active D1 subunit and an inert D1 subunit or a binding surrogate retain catalytic activity, albeit at ∼50% of that of a wild-type homodimer (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).On the basis of the high conservation of this 16-residue-long deiodinase dimerization domain (DDD), we generated a DDD-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion that substitutes for one of the binding partners in the assembly process (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This soluble non-catalytic surrogate of the deiodinase subunit was found (i) to co-localize with both the D1 and SeD2 subunits, (ii) to form heterodimers with both the D1 and SeD2 subunits that could be isolated by immunoprecipitation, and (iii) to impair the catalytic activity of the assembled D1 and SeD2 heterodimers just like the heterodimers containing a catalytically inactivated full-length deiodinase subunit (6Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Notably, the soluble DDD-GFP deiodinase subunit surrogate eliminates the potential untoward effects resulting from mutagenesis-induced conformation changes in the polypeptide regions flanking the DDD in the native deiodinase subunit.In this study, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify key residues in the DDD that are required for holoenzyme assembly. The results show that three residues (Ile152, Tyr153, and Ile154) are responsible for the assembly of a D1 homodimer and that tight binding of the D1 dimerization domain (ΔG = –60 ± 5 kJ/mol for the isolated DDD) prevents holoenzyme disassembly and/or the dynamic exchange of binding partners. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to generate a dimer-deficient full-length D1 subunit. This dimer-deficient D1 subunit was catalytically active and did not form dimers. For SeD2, the assembly of the type II deiodinase homodimer required a broader region of the DDD and utilized residues at both ends of this domain. These data illustrate that the deiodinase family utilizes a common dimerization domain for the assembly of a fully functional enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All reagents used were of the highest purity commercially available. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). 3′,5′,3-Triiodothyronine was prepared by radioiodination of 3,3′-diiodothyronine using methods described previously (7Weeke J. Orskov H. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1973; 321: 357-360Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen or Midland Scientific, Inc. (Omaha, NE). Synthetic peptides were prepared by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). All iodothyronines were of the l-configuration and were purchased from Henning Berlin GmbH & Co. (Berlin, Germany). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, antibiotics, Hanks' buffered salt solution, glucose, trypsin, and Geneticin® (G418) were obtained from Invitrogen. Supplemented bovine calf serum was from Hyclone (Boulder, CO). Acrylamide and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide were from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Ammonium persulfate and TEMED were from Bio-Rad.Cell Culture—LLC-PK1 and SeD2 cells (C6 cells constitutively expressing exogenous rat SeD2) (8Leonard J.L. Leonard D.M. Safran M. Wu R. Zapp M.L. Farwell A.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were grown in 25-cm2 flasks, unless stated otherwise, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C as described previously (6Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Leonard J.L. Leonard D.M. Safran M. Wu R. Zapp M.L. Farwell A.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The growth medium was composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15 mm sodium bicarbonate, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 50 milliunits/ml penicillin, and 90 μg/ml streptomycin. Constitutive expression of SeD2 in C6 cells was maintained by adding 200 μg/mg G418 to the growth medium (8Leonard J.L. Leonard D.M. Safran M. Wu R. Zapp M.L. Farwell A.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown as described above with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum substituted for bovine calf serum. All cell types were subcultured every 3–5 days by seeding 50,000 cells/cm2 into 25-cm2 flasks. The culture medium was changed three times weekly.Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis of the p27 Dimerization Domain—Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 445–496 of rat p27 (GenBank™ accession number X57999) were used to create a series of DDD constructs with serial alanine substitutions along the D1 dimerization domain. 72-mer complementary oligonucleotides based on the native DDD sequence (5′-TAGACCACCATGGTCGCTGACTTCCTCATCATTTACATTGAAGAAGCTCACGCCACAGATGGATGGGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCAGAGCCCATCCATCTGTGGCGTGAGCTTCTTCAATGTAAATGATGAGGAAGTCAGCACCATGGTGGT-3′) were annealed, yielding a double-stranded 72-bp fragment (see Ref. 5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal Met residue in a Kozak consensus start site and NheI and BglII overhangs, and ligated in-frame into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), generating sequential alanine-substituted dimerization domain (ADD)-GFP fusion protein(s). Correct insertion was confirmed by DNA cycle sequencing.Generation of ADD-GFP-expressing LLC-PK1 and SeD2 Cells—LLC-PK1 or SeD2 cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks to 60% confluence and transfected with 5–10 μg of pEGFP-N1 (GFP control), pDDD-GFP, or individual members of the pADD-GFP family (A147DD to A163DD) using cationic liposomes (DOTAP®, Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As indicated, cells constitutively overexpressing DDD-GFP or individual ADD-GFP fusion proteins were generated by antibiotic selection with 1.5 or 1.0 mg/ml G418 for LLC-PK1 and SeD2 cells, respectively. G418-resistant cells were expanded without clonal selection, and individual cell populations were grown in the presence of 0.8–1.0 mg/ml G418 to maintain expression of the exogenous GFP fusion protein. Greater than 99% of the G418-selected LLC-PK1 and SeD2 cells expressed GFP fusion proteins as judged by fluorescence microscopy. The quantity of DDD-GFP fusion protein present in the LLC-PK1 and SeD2 cells that constitutively expressed the individual members of the ADD series was determined by measuring total GFP fluorescence in cell lysates using excitation at 484 nm and emission at 507 nm.Generation of Dimer-deficient D1 Subunits (p27A152)—Dimerization-deficient p27 was generated by an I152A substitution. In brief, 24-mer synthetic oligonucleotides bracketing the Ile152 codon (nucleotides 450–473, 5′-CTTCCTCATCGCTTACATTGAAGA-3′ ((+)-strand) and 5′-TCTTCAATGTAAGCGATGAGGAAG-3′ ((–)-strand), with the mutagenic nucleotides underlined) and the QuikChange-XL® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used to create full-length p27A152 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of the dimerization-deficient D1 subunit was confirmed by DNA cycle sequencing of the entire coding region (nucleotides 7–780).DNA Sequencing—Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed following the dideoxynucleotide method of Sanger et al. (9Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar) using cycle sequencing and iterative primers. All sequence information was confirmed by sequencing both strands.Photomicroscopy—LLC-PK1 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and grown to ∼60% confluence in 6-well culture plates. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of GFP (control), pDDD-GFP, or individual pADD-GFP plasmids as described above and grown at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with 100 mm glycine, and the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The subcellular distribution of GFP, DDD-GFP, and the individual ADD-GFP fusion proteins in LLC-PK1 cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Digital images were captured using a SPOT CCD camera (Meyer Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX) and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The photomicrographs shown are representative of 20–30 independent fields.Affinity Labeling and Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation of p27- and p27A152-expressing LLC-PK1 and HEK293 Cells—Six 75-cm2 flasks containing confluent monolayers of either LLC-PK1 or HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 7.5 μg of pcDNA3/p27A152 (dimerization-deficient p27) or pcDNA3/p27 (control) by cationic liposomes (DOTAP®) according to the manufacturer's instructions and grown for 24–48 h. D1 was affinity-labeled with 2 nm N-bromoacetyl-l-[125I]thyroxine (BrAc[125I]T4) in situ as described previously (6Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol.

The cell membranes in fractions 10–12 were collected, and the Percoll was removed by centrifugation at 3.9 × 108 gmin for 30 min in a Beckman SW 60Ti rotor. The purified membranes were solubilized with 5 mm taurodeoxycholate, and cell debris was removed by micro-centrifugation. Aliquots (300 μl) of solubilized membrane protein were layered onto 3.5 ml of 4–12% linear sucrose gradients prepared in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm taurodeoxycholate. Gradients were centrifuged for 24 h at 3.9 × 108 gmin in the SW 60Ti rotor, and 100-μl fractions were collected from the top of the sucrose gradient.Immunoprecipitation of D1 Monomers and Heterodimers—1 μl of anti-p27 antiserum (R3050) (6Leonard J.L.

Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, and the protein A beads were washed with 10 volumes (v/v) of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then counted in a well-type γ-counter.DDD Peptide Competitive Inhibition Assays—The binding properties of selected synthetic alanine-substituted DDD mutants and the DDD were determined by a fluorescence-based competitive binding assay. Reacti-Bind™ streptavidin-coated polystyrene plates (96-well; Pierce) were incubated with a 3-fold molar excess (360 pmol) of the C-terminally biotinylated DDD peptide (ADFLVIYIEEAHATDGWILAILK-biotin; DDD-biotin) at room temperature for 1 h. Unbound peptide was removed by washing three times with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) at 70 °C, and the plate was kept at 4 °C until used.Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled DDD (ASADFLIIYIEEAHATDGWAFKNNVK-FITC; DDD-FITC) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (final concentration of 154 nm at pH 7.2) and used as the reporter molecule. In brief, 100 μl of DDD-FITC was mixed with 100 μl of DDD or ADD peptide (A152DD, A153DD, or A154DD) at 0–300 μm; preformed DDD dimers were destabilized by heating to 70 °C (see “Results”); and 100-μl aliquots of each probe/peptide mixture were added to individual wells of the DDD-coated plate. Binding reactions were performed at 70 °C for 5 min. Unbound peptide was removed by aspiration; the wells were rinsed three times with 200-μl aliquots of phosphate-buffered saline heated to 60 °C; and 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature was then added to each well. Fluorescence was determined on a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorometer (Molecular Devices Corp.) at wavelengths of 492 nm (excitation) and 520 nm (emission) and processed using SoftMax Pro Version 4 software.Analytical Methods—D1 activity was determined in cell lysates by measuring the release of radioactive iodide from 10 μm 3′,5′,3-[125I]triiodothyronine (100 cpm/pmol) in 20 mm dithiothreitol (unless indicated otherwise) in a total volume of 100 μl. D1 assays were performed in triplicate, and reactions were conducted in universal deiodinase buffer (100 mm boric acid, 100 mm HEPES, 100 mm glycine (pH 5.5), and 1 mm EDTA) with 10–25 μg of cell protein and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Product formation was measured as described previously (10Leonard J.L. Ekenbarger D.M. Frank S.J. Farwell A.P. Koehrle J. J. Biol.

Data are expressed as units/mg of protein, where 1 unit equals 1 fmol of iodide released per min. All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test.RESULTSAt least two members of the selenodeiodinase family assemble into catalytically functional homodimers through a highly conserved DDD. Interestingly, a soluble DDD-GFP fusion protein substitution (schematically represented in Fig. 1A) also specifically partners with both D1 and SeD2 subunits to form stable heterodimers (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating that the isolated 16-residue-long domain contains all of the elements required for dimerization. To determine the role of individual residues in enzyme assembly, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis and our DDD-GFP fusion protein and measured the influence of the alanine-substituted DDD on catalytic activity.LLC-PK1 cells expressing a catalytically functional D1 holoenzyme were transfected with DDD-GFP, individual members of the ADD-GFP series, or GFP alone, and cells constitutively expressing the individual GFP fusion protein were selected by G418 resistance. Expression of the DDD-GFP fusion protein was confirmed by visual inspection using fluorescence microscopy. After correcting for autofluorescence, the cellular levels of the ADD/DDD-GFP fusion protein in LLC-PK1 cell lysates ranged from a low of 94 ± 10 relative fluorescence units (RFU)/mg of cell protein in A149DD-GFP cells to a high of 209 ± 30 RFU/mg of cell protein in A160DD-GFP cells. By comparison, DDD-GFP-expressing cells had 89 ± 4 RFU/mg of cell protein, a value equivalent to that in the M4-GFP-expressing LLC-PK1 cells with a 10:1 molar ratio of fusion protein to p27 (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the molar ratio of ADD-GFP fusion protein bait to the target p27 in the cells used in our studies ranged from ∼10:1 to 20:1. As reported previously (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 1B, constitutive expression of the DDD-GFP fusion protein decreased D1 activity in LLC-PK1 cells by ∼50%, characteristic of the assembly of a p27/DDD-GFP heterodimer. Sequential alanine substitution of individual residues along the 16-residue-long DDD-GFP fusion protein showed that mutation of three non-polar residues (Ile152, Tyr153, and Ile154) reversed the loss of D1 activity associated with the formation of the p27/DDD-GFP heterodimer. Alanine substitution of the remaining 11 amino acids did not alter the loss of D1 catalytic activity associated with the formation of the p27/DDD-GFP heterodimers, suggesting that these residues do not participate directly in the dimerization interaction.We then examined the subcellular distribution of the individual ADD-GFP mutants in LLC-PK1 cells to confirm that the altered D1 activity in cells expressing the ADD-GFP fusion proteins reflected the formation of heterodimer(s) between the fusion protein and native p27. The photomicrographs in Fig. 2 show examples of the subcellular distribution of representative ADD-GFP fusion proteins in LLC-PK1 cells. As observed previously for cells expressing GFP (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), fluorescence was found throughout the cell. Similarly, cells expressing the A152DD-GFP construct, which did not impair D1 activity, showed GFP fluorescence throughout the cell interior. On the other hand, expression of the A160DD-GFP fusion protein, which decreased D1 activity by ∼50%, led to the appearance of punctate and ribbon-like fluorescent signals along the cell periphery identical to those of the p27/DDD dimer (5Leonard J.L. Simpson G. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11093-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the ability of the ADD-GFP fusion protein to bind to native p27 located on the basolateral membrane parallels its ability to impair the catalytic activity when partnered with native p27.FIGURE 2Representative photomicrographs of LLC-PK1 cells transiently expressing the alanine series fusion proteins. Cells on coverslips were transfected with pEGFP-N1, pA152DD-GFP, or pA160DD-GFP and fixed after 24 h. Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Photomicrographs are representative of 20–30 individual cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of the Binding Properties of DDD Peptides—Based on the functional consequences of alanine mutants of DDD-GFP in situ, individual 26-residue-long DDD peptides were synthesized to examine the role of individual residues in dimerization without the constraints imposed by the flanking regions of its membrane-bound binding partner or the GFP reporter. The 17-residue-long DDD with a random leash of seven residues was synthesized, and a C-terminal biotin (DDD-biotin) or fluorescein (DDD-FITC) tag was added. Streptavidin microtiter plates were coated with the biotinylated DDD peptide, and the wells were washed free of unbound DDD-biotin. Approximately 20 pmol of DDD-biotin was immobilized as judged by UV spectrophotometry. Because the DDD is necessary and sufficient for deiodinase dimerization, we expected the synthetic DDD peptides to dimerize in solution and the DDD dimers to be immobilized on the streptavidin-coated wells. Consistent with this supposition, little, if any, DDD-FITC reporter bound to the DDD-coated wells when binding assays were performed at 37 °C. To destabilize the DDD dimers sufficiently to allow dynamic interactions of DDD monomers both in solution and bound to the wells, the plates were incubated at increasing temperatures from 55 to 70 °C with the DDD-FITC reporter in the absence and presence of a 20-fold molar excess of the DDD. There was a progressive increase in the quantity of DDD-FITC bound to the immobilized DDD from 11.8 ± 0.5 to 46.5 ± 2.8% of the total DDD-FITC as the temperature was increased from 55 to 70 °C, and the quantity of exchangeable binding peaked at ∼70 °C. At all temperatures, the addition of a 20-fold molar excess of the DDD decreased the quantity of DDD-FITC bound to ∼9–14% of the total, indicating that nonspecific binding of DDD-FITC was ∼12% of the total fluorescent reporter. The relationship between temperature and specific binding of DDD-FITC to the immobilized DDD is shown in Fig. 3. Regression analysis of the Arrhenius plot yielded a free energy of association of –60 ± 5 kJ/mol for the noncovalent dimerization reaction. Based on these findings, all subsequent competitive binding studies were performed at 70 °C.FIGURE 3Arrhenius plot of DDDWT dimerization. Groups of eight DDD-coated wells were incubated with 15.2 pmol of DDD-FITC (100 μl/well) with and without a 20-fold molar excess of the DDD peptide for 5 min at increasing temperatures (55–70 °C), and unbound DDD was removed by three washes with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Bound DDD-FITC levels were determined at wavelengths of 492 nm (excitation) and 520 nm (emission) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Diff, difference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data shown in Fig. 4A illustrate the concentration-dependent binding of DDD-FITC to the immobilized DDD. With increasing concentrations of DDD-FITC, there was a progressive increase in the quantity of DDD-FITC specifically bound that approached a plateau of ∼8 pmol of DDD-FITC/well when the concentrations exceeded 300 μm. Competition between DDD-FITC and three 26-residue-long ADD peptides with alanine substitutions at Ile152 (A152DD), Tyr153 (A153DD), and Ile154 (A154DD) was then evaluated. Compared with the DDD, which decreased DDD-FITC binding by >95%, the addition of a 20-fold molar excess of the individual ADD peptides decreased DDD-FITC binding by 50–65%, confirming that these individual residues (Ile152, Tyr153, and Ile154) contribute partially to the dimerization reaction (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Competitive binding analysis of DDD dimerization. A, saturation analysis of DDD binding. Groups of eight DDD-coated wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of DDD-FITC (15–300 μm, 100 μl/well) for 5 min at 70 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined as the quantity of DDD-FITC bound in the presence of 1 mm DDD. Unbound DDD-FITC was removed by three washes with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline.
