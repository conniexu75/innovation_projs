First, the bacterial product is converted to a thrombin-like agent by an activator substance found in plasma. This thrombin-like agent then produces fibrin. Gerheim, Ferguson and Travis2, and Kaplan and Spink3 have pointed out that the activator substance is associated with the albumin fraction in ammonium sulphate fractionation, while the latter workers showed that in alcoholic fractionation the activator appears to be associated with the alpha and beta globulins. Kaplan and Spink also have made an important contribution in their studies on the inhibition of the staphylocoagulase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2066887802,"The statement of Granit1 that the guinea pig has a ‘pure rod eye’ calls for comment. Franz2, referring to a paper of his own published in 1909, says that cones are missing from the retina of the guinea pig. Ovio3 admits the presence of a few cones. Kolmer4 describes cones and rods. He makes the significant remark that observation prior to his own had been made on poorly fixed material. Rods are four to five times as numerous as cones, and he comments on the clear vacuoles at the peripheral end of the cone myoids."

https://openalex.org/W1802470131,"Ion exchange resins (1) have been used in the investigation of A substance hydrolysates (2), but apparently no attempt has been made to determine whether they can be profitably used in the isolation or purification of undegraded A substance [1] from sources such as hog gastric mucin. Studies along these lines are reported in this communication."
https://openalex.org/W2020326876,"WHILE the methoxylated carbon-system of (IV) is conclusively established for certain degradation products of colchicine1,2, the synthesis of such unsymmetrically substituted dibenzcycloheptatrienes, necessary for further work, has hitherto miscarried, because of difficulties which are partly concealed and partly apparent2–4. A synthesis which promises to afford the requisite degree of adaptability has now been found and is based on the oxidation of appropriate 9- or 10-methylphenanthrenes with osmium tetroxide in benzene-pyridine5,6. In a model experiment, 9-methylphenanthrene (I) was thereby oxidized to 9 : 10-dihydroxy-9: 10-dihydro-9-methylphenanthrene (II), m.p. 130-131° (found: C, 79.9 ; H, 6.1 ; C15H14O2 requires C, 79.7 ; H, 6.2 per cent), from which, by cleavage with lead tetra-acetate and renewed cyclization, there was obtained the known 3 : 4 : 5 : 6-dibenzcyclohepta-1: 3 : 5-trien-7-one (III)2. Similarly, 2 : 3 : 4: 7-tetramethoxy-10-methylphenanthrene, m.p. 134–135° (found: C, 73.2 ; H, 6.4 ; C19H20O4 requires C, 73.1 ; H, 6.4 per cent), Was converted via the corresponding 9: 10-dihydro-9 : 10-diol, m.p. 156° (found: C, 66.0 ; H, 6.4 ; C19H22O6 requires C, 65.9 ; H, 6.4 per cent) into the unsaturated ketone (IV), which was identical with the part-product previously obtained1 by oxidizing deaminocolchinol methyl ether with sodium dichromate in acetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1968743137,"ALTHOUGH some references were made to visual investigations carried out for the Forces during the War, the International Conference on Colour Vision held at Cambridge during July 28–August 2 was concerned mainly with the fundamental problem of how the visual mechanism works and, in particular, with the apparatus by which differences of colour are perceived."
https://openalex.org/W2983257282,"At a joint meeting of the Biochemical Society and the Society for General Microbiology, the principles underlying microbiological assay were discussed in some detail1. The advantages of measuring bacteriological growth directly, thus avoiding the need to pass the lag period before making indirect measurements of growth, such as acidimetry, are offset by the greater complexity of apparatus and technique needed in the more direct ones, such as turbidimetry."
https://openalex.org/W1998183226,"EVIDENCE has been found that the main forms of defective red-green colour vision in man are multiple allelomorphs, alternative to each other and to the normal form1. In order to prove this hypothesis it would be necessary to show : (a) that the forms of red-green vision are discontinuous variations ; (b) that they are inherited true to type ; (c) that they segregate independently ; and (d) possibly that they have an order of dominance. It will be seen that the evidence in favour of the hypothesis is very strong."
https://openalex.org/W2020607037,"EXPERIMENTS have been made with five specimens of methylene blue as a vital stain for the spermatocytes of Helix aspersa. The specimens were an old German ‘polychrome methylene blue', and four others, ‘pure methylene blue', and just ‘methylene blue'."

https://openalex.org/W2031672351,"In a recent note1, we described the purification of renin by means of a fractional precipitation with protein-precipitating agents (sulphosalicylic acid and tungstic acid). In order to test the adaptability of this method, we have investigated the fractional precipitation of blood serum using electrophoresis (Tiselius) for analysing the composition of the products isolated. The most important of the results so far obtained is that it is possible, if we choose the right conditions and suitable precipitating agents, to perform the fractionation with a high degree of selectivity."

https://openalex.org/W1967624264,"THE recent publication of a paper by Woodward and Witkop1 suggesting a new structure for ketoyobyrine, based on degradative evidence, and of another by Schlittler and Speitel2, claiming the synthesis of this substance, prompts us to point out that on May 28, 1948, we submitted to the Chemical Society a paper describing the synthesis of ketoyobyrine. This has been accepted for publication in the Journal; but unfortunately its appearance cannot be expected for many months."
https://openalex.org/W1976753533,"A SERIES of experiments, extending over several years, in which potato plants were grown both in pots and in the field, in soil producing manganese deficiency, from the recently drained lake-bed at East Mailing Research Station, has led us to suspect the presence of some hitherto unexplained factor influencing manganese availability. The soil in question is an alluvial deposit containing a large amount of calcium carbonate and organic matter and has a pH of 8·0–8·5. The soil contains ample manganese, as simple extractions in Morgan‘s solution yield considerably more than 50 p.p.m. of manganese on a dry soil basis. This, however, is only a small fraction of the total, as is shown by extractions with strong acid. The amount of manganese available to the plant is, on the other hand, very small, since plants containing less than 1 p.p.m. on a fresh weight basis and showing acute deficiency symptoms are of common occurrence in certain areas of the lake-bed. Attempts to reproduce these conditions using the same soil in pot culture never succeeded in producing plants showing such marked symptoms or low manganese contents, although the soil pH was maintained between 8·0 and 8·5 by irrigating with water saturated with calcium carbonate. Water extracts of soil taken either from pots or the lake-bed itself showed negligible amounts of extractable manganese, although the plants grown in pot culture in the summer of 1948 showed no manganese deficiency, while those grown in 1947 Were much less deficient than those growing on the lake-bed."
https://openalex.org/W20105404,"β-Glucuronidase was first prepared from ox kidney by Masamune1 and later from ox spleen by Fishman2,3 and Graham4. Each of these workers, using l-menthylglucuronide as assay material, indicated that only one glucuronidase was present. Talalay, Fishman and Huggins5, using phenolphthalein-glucuronide as substrate, came to a similar conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2060710754,"The present purpose is to report further changes in our views on the genetics of N-type sheep. As stated and illustrated previously1,2,3, these animals have very high abundance of halo-hairs in the birth-coat, and their fleeces are usually hairy, that is, have much medullation. Of our four N-type stocks, one has been called ‘multifactorial-N’, two are ‘dominant-N’ and one ‘recessive-N’."

https://openalex.org/W2011613256,"THE first General Assembly of the World Federation of Scientific Workers was held in Czechoslovakia during September 21-25, as guests of the Czechoslovak Association of Scientific Workers. It was attended by thirty-three delegates and observers from thirteen countries (Austria, Britain, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, South Africa and the United States). Observers on behalf of Unesco and the World Federation of Trade Unions were present."

https://openalex.org/W4242875521,"The direct importance to the research worker of A an efficient scientific information service led the Cambridge Branch of the Association of Scientific Workers to hold a conference on October 25 to discuss various schemes that have been proposed. Although the subject had been discussed previously by professional abstractors and librarians, this was the first conference of ‘users’ of scientific information. The chairman, Sir Lawrence Bragg, outlined the two main aspects of the problem: (a) how are scientific workers to get to know of the work that interests them, and (b) having learned of it, how can they get a copy of the actual publication. The first is by far the more difficult. As regards the second, the personal contact provided by correspondence is invaluable, and any centralizing scheme must avoid destroying this."
https://openalex.org/W4243573674,"THE World Federation of Scientific Workers was founded in July 1946. It is a natural outcome of the growth of science, and of the scientific profession, in many countries. Associations of scientific workers concerned with the problems of scientists as scientists in general, rather than specialists in a particular technique, began with the foundation of the National Union of Scientific Workers in the United Kingdom in 1918. This body was originally a trade union; but it relinquished this status for about two decades, resuming it in 1941. Its name is now the Association of Scientific Workers, and it Jias more than eighteen thousand members. The success of the Association, with its young and widely varied membership, has made a deep impression in many countries overseas. Consequently, when the Association took the initiative in proposing a world federation of similar bodies, it found an enthusiastic response."

https://openalex.org/W4235417881,"In his book on colour vision, Dr. W. D. Wright1 discusses blue-blindness of the retinal fovea, which was described by A. Koenig2 fifty years ago and is now maintained by Willmer3 and himself for the same reasons: “This effect does not appear to have been the subject of further extensive study and although other workers were aware of Koenig's observation the general attitude appears to have been one of scepticism. Indeed most people either ignored or were ignorant of the phenomenon until Willmer recently reawakened interest in the subject”. Dr. Wright has apparently overlooked the controversy between E. Hering and A. Koenig."
https://openalex.org/W43457425,"THE more significant experimental facts for basing the structure of α-fagarine, one of the alkaloids isolated from Fagara coco1, were the presence of one methylimino group, two methoxyls and one dioxymethylene group, and the formation of m-methoxybenzaldehyde by oxidation2. α-Fagarine behaves as a tertiary base, since it does not react with nitrous acid and also lacks rotatory power."
https://openalex.org/W2005211527,"DURING the thirteenth International Congress of Zoology, which closed in Paris on July 27, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, holding its first meeting since the close of the Second World War, put forward a comprehensive programme for the reform and development of zoological nomenclature. All the thirteen meetings held by the Commission were open to all the members of the Congress, who were thus enabled to take an active part in the discussion of the proposals put forward by the Commission. As a result it was possible not only to obtain decisions on a much larger number of questions than would otherwise have been practicable, but also to ascertain much more readily the needs and general wishes of zoologists. The scheme finally adopted was approved unanimously by the Section on Nomenclature and, on the recommendation of the Section, by the Congress itself at its final plenary session."

We are only at the beginning, and this splendid research station gives us the opportunity not only of making up on these countries, but of surpassing them.” So declared the Right Hon. Joseph Westwood, Secretary of State for Scotland, when, on September 19, he officially opened the headquarters of the Scottish Seaweed Research Association—the Institute of Seaweed Research, Inveresk Gate, Musselburgh, Midlothian. Until recently a large mansion house, Inveresk Gate now contains adequate botanical, chemical, engineering and photographic laboratories, engineering workshops, a drawing office, a library, and conference and display rooms, apart from the necessary offices. The Institute stands in eleven acres of ground, and is situated sufficiently near Edinburgh, the University, and the sea to meet thb Association's various needs."
https://openalex.org/W2084370317,"THE occurrence of D amino-acids in several antibiotic polypeptides has stimulated interest in the correlation between the optical form of amino-acids and their effect on the antibacterial activity of certain molecules1,2.

https://openalex.org/W4252126046,"THE address which Mr. Herbert Morrison, the Lord President of the Council, delivered to the Conference of Industrial Research Associations on October 15 (see Nature, October 23, p. 645) should be studied carefully by all who are concerned with the conduct of scientific research and, in this time of stringently limited man-power, with the most effective distribution of the available scientific man-power between industry, the universities and the Government services in Britain. The development of the industrial research associations, with which the Lord President was ostensibly concerned, cannot wisely be considered apart from the general research effort of the country. As the recent report of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy indicated, approximately ten per cent of the qualified scientific workers engaged in Great Britain‘s research effort are already employed by the research associations. At the present time, any appreciable increase in their numbers must be at the expense of those employed in research in industry, in the universities or in other Government departments."
https://openalex.org/W4256068895,"ALTHOUGH the two earlier reports on ""Research —A National Resource"", covering both the ""Relation of the Federal Government to Research""and ""Industrial Research"", not to mention the more recent report from Dr. Vannevar Bush, ""Science —the Endless Frontier"", have to some extent prepared the British reader to appreciate the scale of the research effort in the United States —an effort in which it is estimated that 137,000 scientific workers were engaged in 1946 - 47, some 30,000 of them in government laboratories —it is not easy to convey a concise picture of the scope of the five reports which Mr. J. R. Steelman, chairman of the President‘s Scientific Research Board, has presented under the general title ""Science and Public Policy""*. The White Paper on ""Scientific Research and Development""issued in Britain is too slight to be comparable ; possibly Sir John Anderson‘s descriptive survey of government organisation for research in his Messel Memorial Lecture last July is a more useful comparative outline of British activities. From the critical point of view, the penetrating analysis of expenditure on research and development contained in the third report of the Select Committee on Estimates for the session 1946 - 47 makes that report the appropriate British document to set beside the Steelman reports, although the latter also contain features in common with the White Paper on the Scientific Civil Service and with the report of the Barlow Committee on Scientific Man-power. However, nothing of quite the same scope and nothing comparable in scale has yet been published in Britain, although it is equally true that the whole subject has been discussed very thoroughly and fully as intensively, if not as quantitatively, in books and reports from both public and private sources as well as in Parliament."
