Inspired by the composition of adhesive proteins in mussels, we used dopamine self-polymerization to form thin, surface-adherent polydopamine films onto a wide range of inorganic and organic materials, including noble metals, oxides, polymers, semiconductors, and ceramics. Secondary reactions can be used to create a variety of ad-layers, including self-assembled monolayers through deposition of long-chain molecular building blocks, metal films by electroless metallization, and bioinert and bioactive surfaces via grafting of macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W2119279196,"We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations."

https://openalex.org/W2140537016,"Structural information on nanometer-sized gold particles has been limited, due in part to the problem of preparing homogeneous material. Here we report the crystallization and x-ray structure determination of a p -mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA)–protected gold nanoparticle, which comprises 102 gold atoms and 44 p-MBAs. The central gold atoms are packed in a Marks decahedron, surrounded by additional layers of gold atoms in unanticipated geometries. The p-MBAs interact not only with the gold but also with one another, forming a rigid surface layer. The particles are chiral, with the two enantiomers alternating in the crystal lattice. The discrete nature of the particle may be explained by the closing of a 58-electron shell."
https://openalex.org/W2156866331,"With the advent of dense maps of human genetic variation, it is now possible to detect positive natural selection across the human genome. Here we report an analysis of over 3 million polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2 (HapMap2). We used 'long-range haplotype' methods, which were developed to identify alleles segregating in a population that have undergone recent selection, and we also developed new methods that are based on cross-population comparisons to discover alleles that have swept to near-fixation within a population. The analysis reveals more than 300 strong candidate regions. Focusing on the strongest 22 regions, we develop a heuristic for scrutinizing these regions to identify candidate targets of selection. In a complementary analysis, we identify 26 non-synonymous, coding, single nucleotide polymorphisms showing regional evidence of positive selection. Examination of these candidates highlights three cases in which two genes in a common biological process have apparently undergone positive selection in the same population:LARGE and DMD, both related to infection by the Lassa virus, in West Africa;SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, both involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR and EDA2R, both involved in development of hair follicles, in Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2110525565,"RNA interference through non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) represents a vital component of the innate antiviral immune response in plants and invertebrate animals; however, a role for cellular miRNAs in the defence against viral infection in mammalian organisms has thus far remained elusive. Here we show that interferon beta (IFNbeta) rapidly modulates the expression of numerous cellular miRNAs, and that eight of these IFNbeta-induced miRNAs have sequence-predicted targets within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA. The introduction of synthetic miRNA-mimics corresponding to these IFNbeta-induced miRNAs reproduces the antiviral effects of IFNbeta on HCV replication and infection, whereas neutralization of these antiviral miRNAs with anti-miRNAs reduces the antiviral effects of IFNbeta against HCV. In addition, we demonstrate that IFNbeta treatment leads to a significant reduction in the expression of the liver-specific miR-122, an miRNA that has been previously shown to be essential for HCV replication. Therefore, our findings strongly support the notion that mammalian organisms too, through the interferon system, use cellular miRNAs to combat viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2081204899,"Arginine methylation occurs on a number of proteins involved in a variety of cellular functions. Histone tails are known to be mono- and dimethylated on multiple arginine residues where they influence chromatin remodeling and gene expression. To date, no enzyme has been shown to reverse these regulatory modifications. We demonstrate that the Jumonji domain–containing 6 protein (JMJD6) is a JmjC-containing iron- and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase that demethylates histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2) and histone H4 at arginine 3 (H4R3) in both biochemical and cell-based assays. These findings may help explain the many developmental defects observed in the JMJD6 –/– knockout mice."

https://openalex.org/W2019115334,"Horizontal gene transfer, in which genetic material is transferred from the genome of one organism to that of another, has been investigated in microbial species mainly through computational sequence analyses. To address the lack of experimental data, we studied the attempted movement of 246,045 genes from 79 prokaryotic genomes into Escherichia coli and identified genes that consistently fail to transfer. We studied the mechanisms underlying transfer inhibition by placing coding regions from different species under the control of inducible promoters. Our data suggest that toxicity to the host inhibited transfer regardless of the species of origin and that increased gene dosage and associated increased expression may be a predominant cause for transfer failure. Although these experimental studies examined transfer solely into E. coli , a computational analysis of gene-transfer rates across available bacterial and archaeal genomes supports that the barriers observed in our study are general across the tree of life."
https://openalex.org/W2073157831,"The breakup of the supercontinent Gondwanaland into Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India about 140 million years ago, and consequently the opening of the Indian Ocean, is thought to have been caused by heating of the lithosphere from below by a large plume whose relicts are now the Marion, Kerguelen and Réunion plumes. Plate reconstructions based on palaeomagnetic data suggest that the Indian plate attained a very high speed (18-20 cm yr(-1) during the late Cretaceous period) subsequent to its breakup from Gondwanaland, and then slowed to approximately 5 cm yr(-1) after the continental collision with Asia approximately 50 Myr ago. The Australian and African plates moved comparatively less distance and at much lower speeds of 2-4 cm yr(-1) (refs 3-5). Antarctica remained almost stationary. This mobility makes India unique among the fragments of Gondwanaland. Here we propose that when the fragments of Gondwanaland were separated by the plume, the penetration of their lithospheric roots into the asthenosphere were important in determining their speed. We estimated the thickness of the lithospheric plates of the different fragments of Gondwanaland around the Indian Ocean by using the shear-wave receiver function technique. We found that the fragment of Gondwanaland with clearly the thinnest lithosphere is India. The lithospheric roots in South Africa, Australia and Antarctica are between 180 and 300 km deep, whereas the Indian lithosphere extends only about 100 km deep. We infer that the plume that partitioned Gondwanaland may have also melted the lower half of the Indian lithosphere, thus permitting faster motion due to ridge push or slab pull."

https://openalex.org/W2137357450,"Genetic analysis of mammalian color variation has provided fundamental insight into human biology and disease. In most vertebrates, two key genes, Agouti and Melanocortin 1 receptor ( Mc1r ), encode a ligand-receptor system that controls pigment type-switching, but in domestic dogs, a third gene is implicated, the K locus, whose genetic characteristics predict a previously unrecognized component of the melanocortin pathway. We identify the K locus as β- defensin 103 ( CBD103 ) and show that its protein product binds with high affinity to the Mc1r and has a simple and strong effect on pigment type-switching in domestic dogs and transgenic mice. These results expand the functional role of β-defensins, a protein family previously implicated in innate immunity, and identify an additional class of ligands for signaling through melanocortin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2088433268,"As a superconducting thin film becomes disordered and subject to an increasing magnetic field, a point is reached when it undergoes a transition from a superconducting to an insulating state. Dubi et al. use numerical simulations to study this transition — or, as it turns out, two types of transition. The key effect of disorder is to create 'islands' of strong superconductivity, coupled by regions that are only weakly superconducting. In the case of weak disorder, an increasing magnetic field eventually destroys the superconducting state throughout the material, leading to an insulator. When disorder is strong, superconductivity persists in the islands, and the effect of a magnetic field is to suppress the coupling between them — again leading to an insulating state. These findings may be relevant to the high-temperature superconductors, where intrinsic disorder may play a role. As a superconducting thin film is made more disordered, or subject to an increasing magnetic field, a point is reached when the material undergoes a transition from a superconducting to an insulating state. Numerical simulations have been used to shed light on the nature of this transition, or, as it turns out, two types of transition. The interplay of superconductivity and disorder has intrigued scientists for several decades. Disorder is expected to enhance the electrical resistance of a system, whereas superconductivity is associated with a zero-resistance state. Although superconductivity has been predicted to persist even in the presence of disorder1, experiments performed on thin films have demonstrated a transition from a superconducting to an insulating state with increasing disorder or magnetic field2. The nature of this transition is still under debate, and the subject has become even more relevant with the realization that high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors are intrinsically disordered3,4,5. Here we present numerical simulations of the superconductor–insulator transition in two-dimensional disordered superconductors, starting from a microscopic description that includes thermal phase fluctuations. We demonstrate explicitly that disorder leads to the formation of islands where the superconducting order is high. For weak disorder, or high electron density, increasing the magnetic field results in the eventual vanishing of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter, thereby forming an insulating state. On the other hand, at lower electron densities or higher disorder, increasing the magnetic field suppresses the correlations between the phases of the superconducting order parameter in different islands, giving rise to a different type of superconductor–insulator transition. One of the important predictions of this work is that in the regime of high disorder, there are still superconducting islands in the sample, even on the insulating side of the transition. This result, which is consistent with experiments6,7, explains the recently observed huge magneto-resistance peak in disordered thin films8,9,10 and may be relevant to the observation of ‘the pseudogap phenomenon’ in underdoped high-Tc superconductors11,12."
https://openalex.org/W1976059977,"Nuclear import of transfer DNA (T-DNA) is a central event in Agrobacterium transformation of plant cells and is thought to occur by the hijacking of certain host cell proteins. The T-DNA–associated virulence protein VirE2 mediates this process by binding to the nuclear import machinery via the host cell factor VIP1, whose role in plants has been so far unknown. Here we show that VIP1 is a transcription factor that is a direct target of the Agrobacterium -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MPK3. Upon phosphorylation by MPK3, VIP1 relocalizes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and regulates the expression of the PR1 pathogenesis-related gene. MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of VIP1 is necessary for VIP1-mediated Agrobacterium T-DNA transfer, indicating that Agrobacterium abuses the MAPK-targeted VIP1 defense signaling pathway for nuclear delivery of the T-DNA complex as a Trojan horse."

https://openalex.org/W1997637686,"Hundreds of species of reef-building corals spawn synchronously over a few nights each year, and moonlight regulates this spawning event. However, the molecular elements underpinning the detection of moonlight remain unknown. Here we report the presence of an ancient family of blue-light-sensing photoreceptors, cryptochromes, in the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. In addition to being cryptochrome genes from one of the earliest-diverging eumetazoan phyla, cry1 and cry2 were expressed preferentially in light. Consistent with potential roles in the synchronization of fundamentally important behaviors such as mass spawning, cry2 expression increased on full moon nights versus new moon nights.

https://openalex.org/W2164251428,"The Rip2 kinase contains a caspase recruitment domain and has been implicated in the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB downstream of Toll-like receptors, Nod-like receptors, and the T cell receptor. Although Rip2 has been linked to Nod signaling, how Nod-Rip2 proteins mediate NF-κB activation has remained unclear. We find Rip2 required for Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation and to a lesser extent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. We demonstrate that Rip2 and IκB kinase-γ become stably polyubiquitinated upon treatment of cells with the NOD2 ligand, muramyl dipeptide. We also demonstrate a requirement for the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf6, and the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1 in Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation. Rip2 polyubiquitination is also stimulated when macrophages are infected with live Mycobacterium tuberculosis but not when infected with heat-killed bacteria. Consistent with our data linking Rip2 to NOD and not Toll-like receptor signaling, M. tuberculosis-induced Rip2 polyubiquitination appears MyD88-independent.

In contrast to TLRs that recognize pathogens at the cell surface or within the endosome, NLRs induce innate immune responses by recognizing bacterial products released into the cytosol. Several NLRs, including Nod1 and Nod2 proteins, induce cytokine production by activating the transcription factor NF-κB and by stimulating MAP kinase activation (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar). The Nod1 protein recognizes a form of peptidoglycan containing the amino acid meso-diaminopimelic acid produced by Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria (2Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y.

Transfection studies have shown that expression of Nod proteins stimulates NF-κB activity, and the ability to stimulate NF-κB reporter activity is dependent on the co-expression of the adapter protein Rip2 (4Ogura Y.

Yet how Rip2 proteins achieve Nod-mediated NF-κBorMAP kinase activation remains undefined.Rip2 is a member of the Rip protein family of which there are currently seven members (5Meylan E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Like the prototype Rip1, Rip2 contains an N-terminal serine threonine kinase domain followed by an intermediate region and a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD). Overexpression of Rip2 stimulates NF-κB activation and induces apoptosis, and expression of kinase-inactive Rip2 activates an NF-κB reporter, suggesting that the kinase activity of Rip2 may not be required for NF-κB activation upon stimulation of the Nod pathway (6McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To elucidate function, several groups generated Rip2-deficient mice and stimulated Rip2-deficient macrophages with TLR and NLR ligands. These studies concluded that Rip2 mediates NF-κB signals from multiple TLRs, NLRs, and from the T cell receptor (7Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G.

Similar data have recently been published by Nunez and co-workers (9Park J.H. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Kanneganti T.D. Hasegawa M. Body-Malapel M. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2380-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) who find Rip2 required for cytokine production induced through NLRs but not TLRs. We show that treatment of macrophages with the Nod2 ligand MDP stimulates the ubiquitin modification of endogenous Rip2 and IKK-γ. The ubiquitin modification of Rip2 is stable and involves the conjugation of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. MDP-induced Rip2 polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation require the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf6, and the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1.The Nod2 pathway has been implicated in the innate immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, as Nod2-deficient macrophages are impaired in their cytokine response to infection with M. tuberculosis (10Ferwerda G. Girardin S.E. Kullberg B.J. Le Bourhis L. de Jong D.J. Langenberg D.M. van Crevel R. Adema G.J. Ottenhoff T.H. Van der Meer J.W. Netea M.G. Plos Pathog. 2005; 1: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, a quantitatively small fraction of the transcriptional changes induced by M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages can be attributed to TLR2/4- or MyD88-dependent pathways (11Shi S. Blumenthal A. Hickey C.M. Gandotra S. Levy D. Ehrt S. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3318-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest nonredundant roles for NOD2 and TLR in the innate immune recognition of M. tuberculosis. We find that infection with live, but not heat-killed, virulent strains of M. tuberculosis stimulates Rip2 polyubiquitination. Therefore, we hypothesize that Nod proteins recognize M. tuberculosis components that are translocated into the cytosol, and consistent with this model, Rip2 polyubiquitination induced by live M. tuberculosis infection appears MyD88-independent, implicating NLRs in the cytosolic recognition of M. tuberculosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Macrophages and M. tuberculosis Infection—To isolate peritoneal activated macrophages, wild type and rip2–/– mice (gift of Dr. Vishva M. Dixit, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco) were injected with 3 ml of thioglycolate by intraperitoneal injection. Three days later, macrophages were isolated by gentle flushing of the peritoneal cavity. Peritoneal macrophages were left unstimulated or treated with MDP or purified LPS (Sigma). NF-κB activation was measured using phospho-IκBα antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), p38 MAP kinase, and JNK1/2 activity was measured using anti-phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), respectively.

M. tuberculosis (strain H37Rv) was cultivated in 7H9 broth to exponential phase and washed thoroughly in phosphate-buffered saline prior to infection. Bacterial clumps were removed by passing the washed suspension through a 5 μm syringe filter. “Heat-killed” bacteria were inactivated by heating to 80 °C for 30 min. Macrophages were infected for 1 or 2 h, after which filtered cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or immunoblotted with anti-phospho-IκB-α antibody (Cell Signaling Technology).Plasmids and Constructs—The full-length Rip2 constructs were provided by Dr. Vishva M.

For all transfection studies, HEK293T cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/plate on 60-mm plates. Constructs were transfected to HEK293T cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs were transfected to HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Mouse control and Tak1-specific siRNAs were transiently transfected into the mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line using a two-step transfection procedure and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).Generation of Ubc13 Stably Knock Down RAW 246.7 Cell Lines—The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was infected with lentiviruses containing shRNA sequences specific for Ubc13 (Open Biosystems) and selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. Selected puromycin-resistant pools of cells were left unstimulated or treated with MDP, and Rip2 polyubiquitination was assayed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. The expression of the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 in the lentiviral infected pools was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-Ubc13 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For all immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays, cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with a protease mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), and immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 or anti-NEMO antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polyubiquitinated Rip2 or NEMO/IKK-γ proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To examine endogenous protein interactions, cells were lysed in an endogenous lysis buffer (0.5 m Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaF, and 0.5 m sodium pyrophosphate) supplemented with a protease mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 antibody, and then immunoblotted with either anti-Tak1 or anti-Traf6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Expression of epitope-tagged, transfected proteins or endogenous proteins was detected by immunoblotting with corresponding antibodies.RESULTSThe CARD domain kinase Rip2 has been implicated in signaling from multiple TLRs, including TLR2, -3, and -4, the T cell receptor, and the cytosolic NOD1/2 pathways. To understand how Rip2 mediates such diverse signals, we isolated macrophages from Rip2-deficient mice and stimulated the cells with the NOD2 ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or with purified LPS to stimulate the TLR4 pathway. We found that MDP and LPS induced NF-κB, p38 MAP kinase, and JNK1/2 activation when wild type macrophages were stimulated (Fig. 1A). Rip2-deficient macrophages also respond upon LPS stimulation but appear impaired in their ability to mediate NF-κB activation when treated with MDP (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the MDP-induced phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK1/2 activity was consistently impaired but not abrogated, suggesting that Rip2 contributes to MAP kinase activation but is not absolutely required (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggest that Nod-mediated MAP kinase activation may involve other CARD domain containing adapter proteins. One possibility may be CARD9, as Card9-deficient mice exhibit defects in p38 MAP kinase and JNK activation in Nod-stimulated cells.We hypothesized that Nod-mediated IKK activation may involve the ubiquitin modification of Rip2 or IKK-γ/NEMO, and we tested this possibility by stimulating the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with the Nod2 ligand MDP and assayed for the presence of polyubiquitinated Rip2 or NEMO/IKK-γ. We observed a ligand-dependent induction of Rip2 and NEMO/IKK-γ polyubiquitination, and interestingly, Rip2 polyubiquitination appears to precede the ubiquitin modification of NEMO/IKK-γ. Nod2 pathway activation by MDP appears to induce the stable modification of Rip2 and IKK-γ, suggesting that Rip2 and IKK-γ may be conjugated by Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. To test this possibility, HEK293 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged versions of Rip2 and NOD2 in the presence of wild type or mutant forms of ubiquitin where only the lysine(s) at positions 63 or 48 are available for conjugation. In this setting, Rip2 appeared preferentially modified by Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, and this activity appeared dependent on the presence of NOD2 (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that activation of the NOD2 pathway stimulates the stable Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of Rip2.FIGURE 2NOD2 pathway activation stimulates the stable Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of Rip2. A, MDP treatment stimulates the ubiquitin modification of endogenous Rip2 and NEMO/IKK-γ. The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was left untreated or treated with the NOD2 ligand MDP (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed, and an equal amount of total protein was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Rip2 or anti-NEMO antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect ubiquitinated proteins, immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted (IB) with an anti-ubiquitin (anti Ub) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total immunoprecipitated Rip2 or NEMO/IKK-γ protein was measured by immunoblotting with anti-Rip2 or anti-NEMO antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). B, NOD2 expression stimulates the stable, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of Rip2. Omni-tagged NOD2 and FLAG-tagged Rip2 constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of HA-tagged Lys-63-only or HA-tagged K48-only forms of ubiquitin. Rip2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Western blots were performed with the indicated antibodies. Expression levels of both FLAG-Rip2 and Omni-NOD2 were measured by immunoblotting total cell lysates with anti-FLAG or anti-Omni antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our studies suggest that NOD2-induced NF-κB activation may be mediated by the ubiquitin conjugation of Rip2 and IKK-γ, and the transfection studies suggest that Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains may stably modify both proteins. Therefore, we were interested in testing whether MDP-induced NF-κB activation and Rip2/IKK-γ polyubiquitination require expression of the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, known to conjugate Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. To address a requirement for Ubc13, we infected the MDP-responsive mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs specific for the Ubc13 enzyme. These stable pools of RAW 264.7 macrophages were impaired in their ability to phosphorylate IκBα in response to MDP or TNF-α (data not shown). Rip2 polyubiquitination was detected in RAW 264.7 macrophages expressing a control shRNA; however, treatment with the Nod2 ligand MDP failed to stimulate Rip2 polyubiquitination when the Ubc13-deficient cells were stimulated (Fig. 3A and not shown). The level of Rip2 polyubiquitination and MDP-induced NF-κB activation correlated with the reduction of Ubc13 expression achieved in the RAW 264.7 pools.FIGURE 3MDP-induced Rip2 polyubiquitination is dependent on the expression of the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf6. A, MDP fails to stimulate Rip2 polyubiquitination in Ubc13-deficient RAW 264.7 macrophages. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was infected with lentiviruses containing shRNA sequences specific for Ubc13 or green fluorescent protein as a control, and stable puromycin-resistant pools were selected. These lines were left untreated or stimulated with MDP (10μg/ml) for the time periods indicated. Cells were lysed, and an equal amount of total protein was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-ubiquitin (anti Ub) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total immunoprecipitated Rip2 protein was measured by immunoblotting with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Expression of Ubc13 level was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-Ubc13 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). B, Rip2 polyubiquitination requires the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf6 but not Traf2. Omni-tagged NOD2 was expressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of either a control siRNA or siRNA specific for Traf2 or Traf6. Rip2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin to detect polyubiquitinated Rip2 proteins. Expression levels of Omni-NOD2 and Traf2 or Traf6 protein levels was measured by immunoblotting the total cell lysates with anti-Omni, anti-Traf6, and anti-Traf2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). C, MDP stimulates interaction between endogenous Rip2 and Traf6. RAW 264.7 macrophages were left untreated or treated with 10 μg/ml MDP for the indicated periods of time. Cells were lysed, and an equal amount of total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Traf6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The total immunoprecipitated Rip2 protein was measured by immunoblotting with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). D, Traf6 expression is required for MDP- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was transfected with control siRNA or a pool of Traf6 siRNAs. Forty eight hours later, the cells were left untreated or stimulated with MDP (10μg/ml) for the time periods indicated or with IL-α (5 ng/ml) for 10 min. NF-κB activation was measured by immunoblotting with a phospho-IκBα antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Traf6 and β-actin levels were determined by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In transfected cells, Rip2 has been shown to interact with Traf2, -5, and -6 proteins (6McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of these Traf proteins may modify Rip2 upon Nod2 pathway stimulation. To identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the modification of Rip2, we transfected HEK293 cells with epitope-tagged versions of NOD2 and Rip2 and tested whether MDP- or NOD2-dependent Rip2 polyubiquitination is observed in cells where Traf2 or Traf6 expression was reduced. In HEK293 cells transfected with NOD2 and stimulated with MDP, Rip2 polyubiquitination was detected, as expected (Fig. 3B). Similarly, in cells where Traf2 expression is reduced via transfection of siRNAs specific for Traf2, MDP stimulated Rip2 polyubiquitination, and this modification appeared NOD2-dependent. In contrast, Rip2 polyubiquitination was reduced in MDP-stimulated HEK293 cells in which Traf6 expression was reduced (Fig. 3B), thereby implicating Traf6 as a potential Rip2 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the Nod2 pathway. We also examined whether MDP or NOD2 pathway activation stimulates an association between Rip2 and Traf6. Using co-immunoprecipitation, MDP treatment stimulated interaction between endogenous Rip2 and Traf6 between 30 and 60 min following MDP treatment. Consistently, polyubiquitinated Rip2 proteins are detected at similar time periods following MDP treatment (Fig. 2A).To further test a requirement for Traf6, we attempted to knock down the expression of Traf6 in the RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line and then stimulated the cells with IL-1 or MDP. As expected, no IL-1-induced NF-κB activation is detected in the Traf6 knocked down cells; however, the control shRNA-treated cells activate NF-κB upon IL-1 treatment. MDP-induced NF-κB activation is clearly impaired in cells where Traf6 expression is reduced, suggesting that Traf6 is required for optimal NF-κB responses to MDP (Fig. 3D). These data are consistent with a model whereby Traf6 modifies Rip2 upon activation of the Nod2 pathway, raising the possibility that this enzyme may be targeted in human inflammatory disease.Our data suggest that Rip2 polyubiquitination may contribute to NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation by recruiting the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1. Therefore, we tested whether Rip2 interacts with Tak1 and whether MDP stimulates an endogenous Rip2/Tak1 interaction. A Rip2/Tak1 interaction could be readily demonstrated in transfected cells (Fig. 4A) and an endogenous Rip2/Tak1 interaction was detected following MDP treatment (Fig. 4B), during a time period when a Rip2/Traf6 interaction was also observed (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these data suggest that MDP stimulation or NOD2 pathway activation stimulates the formation of a Rip2-Ubc13-Traf6-Tak1 complex that results in the stable ubiquitin modification of Rip2.FIGURE 4Rip2 and the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1 interact upon MDP stimulation, and Tak1 expression is required for MDP-induced IKK activation. A, Rip2 and Tak1 interact in transfected cells. FLAG-tagged Tak1 and HA-tagged Rip2 were either co-expressed or expressed alone in HEK293T cells. Tak1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-FLAG antibody and Rip2 detected by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA antibody, or Rip2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody to detect associated Tak1 proteins. Relative expression of each construct was measured by immunoblotting the total cell lysate with anti-HA or -FLAG antibodies. B, MDP stimulates interaction between Rip2 and Tak1. The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was left untreated or treated with 10 μg/ml MDP for the indicated periods of time. Cells were lysed, and an equal amount of total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Tak1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total immunoprecipitated Rip2 protein was measured by immunoblotting with anti-Rip2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). C, Tak1 expression is required for TNF- and MDP-induced NF-κB activation. Mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages cell line was transfected with control siRNA or a pool of Tak1 siRNAs. Forty eight hours later, the cells were left untreated or stimulated with MDP (10 μg/ml) for the time periods indicated or with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. NF-κB activation was measured by immunoblotting with a phospho-IκBα antibody (Cell Signaling). Tak1 and β-actin levels were determined by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data predict that MDP-induced NF-κB activation will be dependent on the expression of the ubiquitin-dependent kinase Tak1. We reduced Tak1 expression levels in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line and tested its effects on MDP- and TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Consistent with the transfection studies, NF-κB activation was reduced in both the MDP- and TNF-stimulated Tak1 “silenced” cells, although it remained unaffected when the control cells were stimulated with either MDP or TNF-α (Fig. 4C). These data led us to propose that Tak1 is critical for NOD2 signaling to NF-κB. Thus, stimulation of the NOD2 pathway results in the recruitment and subsequent ubiquitin modification of Rip2 by a Ubc13-Uev1a and Traf6 complex. Polyubiquitinated Rip2 then signals the recruitment and activation of the Tak1 kinase.Although MDP stimulates NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation and mutations in the CARD15 gene are associated with human inflammatory disease, MDP has not, as yet, been shown to bind to the NOD2 protein (15Girardin S.E.

Hence, we were interested in testing whether infection with live bacteria stimulates the ubiquitin modification of Rip2.

To test whether M. tuberculosis infection stimulates Rip2 polyubiquitination, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages with a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) or with a heat-killed bacteria and assayed for polyubiquitinated Rip2 proteins at 1 and 4 h post-infection. Infection with live M. tuberculosis stimulated Rip2 polyubiquitination, whereas heat killing destroyed the ability of M. tuberculosis to induce the modification of Rip2 (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Live M. tuberculosis infection stimulates Rip2 polyubiquitination.

This implies that a group of highly diverse organisms has evolved within the changing contexts of variation in effective human population size and lifespan, shaping the equilibria achieved, and creating relationships resembling climax communities. We propose that such ecosystems contain nested communities in which equilibrium at one level contributes to homeostasis at another.

https://openalex.org/W2058782620,"Rab guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulate vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells by reversibly associating with lipid membranes. Inactive Rab GTPases are maintained in the cytosol by binding to GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI). It is believed that specialized proteins are required to displace GDI from Rab GTPases before Rab activation by guanosine diphosphate-guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GDP-GTP) exchange factors (GEFs). Here, we found that SidM from Legionella pneumophila could act as both GEF and GDI-displacement factor (GDF) for Rab1. Rab1 released from GDI was inserted into liposomal membranes and was used as a substrate for SidM-mediated nucleotide exchange. During host cell infection, recruitment of Rab1 to Legionella-containing vacuoles depended on the GDF activity of SidM. Thus, GDF and GEF activity can be promoted by a single protein, and GDF activity can coordinate Rab1 recruitment from the GDI-bound pool."

The crystal structures of hexameric DnaB and its complex with the helicase binding domain (HBD) of DnaG reveal that within the hexamer the two domains of DnaB pack with strikingly different symmetries to form a distinct two-layered ring structure. Each of three bound HBDs stabilizes the DnaB hexamer in a conformation that may increase its processivity.

https://openalex.org/W1990496214,"It's important to try to work out the weight — or more properly the mass — of a distant stellar object because it plays such a large part in determining its behaviour. Black holes are of particular interest, but are not easy targets. The usual way of weighing a black hole is to determine its gravitational pull on a nearby object, and that has now been achieved for a black hole in the recently discovered binary system M 33 X-7, in the nearby galaxy Messier 33. At 15.7 solar masses, it is the most massive 'stellar-mass' black hole known. Its companion star is one of the most massive known stars, at around 70 solar masses, and M 33 X-7 is 16 times more distant than any other confirmed stellar black hole. Models of stellar evolution have difficulty producing black holes in close binaries with masses ten times that of the sun, which is consistent with the fact that the most massive stellar black holes known so far all have masses within one standard deviation of that. This paper report a mass of 15.65 ±1.45 times that of the sun for the black hole in the recently discovered system M 33 X-7, which is located in the nearby galaxy Messier 33. Stellar-mass black holes are found in X-ray-emitting binary systems, where their mass can be determined from the dynamics of their companion stars1,2,3. Models of stellar evolution have difficulty producing black holes in close binaries with masses more than ten times that of the Sun (>10 ; ref. 4), which is consistent with the fact that the most massive stellar black holes known so far2,3 all have masses within one standard deviation of 10 . Here we report a mass of (15.65 ± 1.45) for the black hole in the recently discovered system M 33 X-7, which is located in the nearby galaxy Messier 33 (M 33) and is the only known black hole that is in an eclipsing binary5. To produce such a massive black hole, the progenitor star must have retained much of its outer envelope until after helium fusion in the core was completed4. On the other hand, in order for the black hole to be in its present 3.45-day orbit about its (70.0 ± 6.9) companion, there must have been a ‘common envelope’ phase of evolution in which a significant amount of mass was lost from the system6. We find that the common envelope phase could not have occurred in M 33 X-7 unless the amount of mass lost from the progenitor during its evolution was an order of magnitude less than what is usually assumed in evolutionary models of massive stars7,8,9."

Whether additional proteins play a role in the endosomal sorting of CXCR4, however, remains to be determined. Nonvisual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 (also termed β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2, respectively), function in GPCR desensitization and also serve as endocytic adaptors to recruit phosphorylated receptors for internalization through clathrin-coated pits (13Marchese A.

Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were treated with vehicle (DMEM + 0.5% FBS) or CXCL12 (10 nm) in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (to prevent protein synthesis) for 3 h. We have found that 10 nm CXCL12 produces the same level of CXCR4 degradation as 100 nm CXCL12 (20Marchese A. Benovic J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 259: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were directly lysed in 2× sample buffer, and receptor levels were detected as we have previously shown (6Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev.

For RNA interference experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA directed against arrestin-2 (100 nm), arrestin-3 (100 nm), or arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 together (50 nm each) using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For studies in HEK293 cells, the cells were transfected with siRNA as described for HeLa cells, followed by transfection with HA-CXCR4 the following day using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of Ubiquitinated CXCR4—HEK293 cells grown on 10-cm dishes were transfected with arrestin-2, arrestin-3, arrestin-2/3, and control siRNA as described above, followed by co-transfection of HA-CXCR4 and FLAG-ubiquitin the next day. Detection of ubiquitinated CXCR4 was as previously described (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Measuring Receptor Internalization—HEK293 cells grown on 10-cm dishes were transfected with siRNA for arrestin-2 and control siRNA as described above, followed by co-transfection of HA-CXCR4 the next day. Receptor internalization was measured by cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described (6Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged CXCR4 were serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS overnight (14–16 h) followed by treatment with the same medium without or with 30 nm CXCL12 for 15, 30, and 60 min. After stimulation, the cells were placed on ice, lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A)). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and equal amounts of clarified lysates were processed. An anti-AIP4 monoclonal antibody (G11; Santa Cruz) was used to immunoprecipitate endogenously expressed AIP4 in HEK293 cells, essentially as previously described (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect endogenous arrestins. GST Pulldowns—Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with GST fusion constructs were grown overnight at 37 °C. The following day, the cultures were diluted 1:50 and grown to an A600 ∼ 0.4–0.5 at 37 °C and then induced with 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 18 °C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and sonicated on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 × g at 4 °C followed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads overnight at 4 °C while rocking. The samples were washed and resuspended in binding buffer. For binding experiments using transfected cells, 1–3 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing the protein of interest for 12–16 h. The samples were washed three times in binding buffer, eluted in 2× sample buffer by boiling for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For binding experiments using purified proteins, 1 μg of GST fusion protein was incubated with 300 ng of purified arrestin-2 for 1 h and processed in the same manner. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells were transfected with arrestin-2 siRNA followed by transfection of HA-CXCR4 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein at its carboxyl-terminal end (HA-CXCR4-YFP). The cells were treated with CXCL12 for 3 h, followed by fixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining for EEA1 and LAMP2. For AIP4 and arrestin-2 co-localization experiments, HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with HA-CXCR4, mCh-AIP4, and YFP-arrestin-2 were serum-starved for 14–16 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and treated with vehicle or 30 nm CXCL12 for 30 min followed by permeabilization and fixation. The images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal imaging system with a 63× W Apochromat objective at 512 × 512 resolution. The acquired images were analyzed using Image J 1.3v software (NIH). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed and subjected to statistical analyses using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). To elucidate the mechanisms mediating CXCR4 degradation and ubiquitination, we initially examined the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 on agonist promoted degradation of endogenous CXCR4 in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), agonist-promoted degradation of CXCR4 was inhibited in cells transfected with either arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 siRNA or both, suggesting that arrestins are involved in agonist-promoted degradation of CXCR4. Interestingly, inhibition of CXCR4 degradation was more pronounced in cells depleted of arrestin-2 compared with arrestin-3, even though the siRNA-mediated depletion of arrestin-3 was consistently greater than depletion of arrestin-2, suggesting a more important role for arrestin-2 in degradation of activated CXCR4. We next examined the role of arrestin-2 in agonist-promoted CXCR4 degradation in HEK293 cells, a model cell line used previously to study CXCR4 trafficking (6Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We found that degradation of HA-tagged CXCR4 induced by agonist was significantly inhibited in arrestin-2-depleted cells as compared with control siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 1, C and D), consistent with that observed with endogenous CXCR4 in HeLa cells. We have previously shown that internalization is a prerequisite for degradation (6Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and because arrestins are thought to play a role in CXCR4 internalization (15Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Orsini M.J. Parent J.L. Mundell S.J. Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we next determined whether inhibition of internalization could account for the attenuated degradation observed in the arrestin-2 siRNA-treated cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting arrestin-2 or control siRNA together with HA-tagged CXCR4, and receptor internalization was assessed by cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described (6Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, agonist-promoted internalization of CXCR4 in arrestin-2-depleted cells was similar to that in control siRNA-transfected cells, suggesting that arrestin-2 is not involved in agonist-promoted internalization of CXCR4. Direct ubiquitination of CXCR4 at the plasma membrane is required for its sorting to the degradative pathway but not for its internalization (6Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Because arrestin-2 also appears to be required for CXCR4 degradation but not internalization, we next assessed whether the effect on CXCR4 degradation is due to a role on CXCR4 ubiquitination. HEK293 cells transfected with siRNA targeted against arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 or control siRNA plus HA-tagged CXCR4 and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin were stimulated with or without agonist for 30 min, followed by receptor immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting to detect the incorporation of tagged ubiquitin, as previously described (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1F, ubiquitination of CXCR4 was not affected in arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 siRNA depleted cells as compared with control siRNA-treated cells, even though arrestins were substantially depleted (Fig. 1F, bottom panel). In addition, the ubiquitination status of CXCR4 was not altered in cells that were transfected with a siRNA that targets both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 with respect to mock transfected cells (Fig. 1G), further suggesting that arrestins are not involved in CXCR4 ubiquitination. Taken together, these data indicate that arrestin-2 is not involved in CXCR4 ubiquitination and internalization and suggest that its role in CXCR4 degradation is likely due to a post-internalization function such as endosomal sorting into the degradative pathway. We next examined the distribution of CXCR4 in arrestin-2-depleted HEK293 cells that were treated with or without CXCL12 using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In the absence of stimulation, CXCR4 was localized predominantly to the plasma membrane in both control and arrestin-2 siRNA-treated cells, although a portion of CXCR4 was also localized to intracellular puncta that partially overlapped with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (Fig. 2A, top panels, control and arrestin-2) or late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP2 (Fig. 2B, top panels, control and arrestin-2), suggesting that CXCR4 undergoes constitutive internalization and trafficking to early endosomes and lysosomes. Upon treatment with CXCL12 for 3 h, in the control treated cells, CXCR4 mostly co-localized with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP2 (Fig. 2B), but not with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that CXCR4 traffics efficiently to lysosomes upon stimulation with CXCL12. In contrast, upon stimulation with CXCL12 in the arrestin-2 siRNA-treated cells, CXCR4 mostly co-localized with EEA1 and not LAMP2, suggesting that transit from endosomes to lysosomes is impaired as compared with control treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that arrestin-2 is required for proper CXCR4 trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes. We previously showed that AIP4 is localized to endosomes and mediates endosomal sorting of CXCR4 (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); therefore, we next asked whether arrestins facilitate AIP4-mediated trafficking of CXCR4. To address this, we initially determined whether arrestins interact with AIP4 in cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 and FLAG-tagged AIP4 or empty vector (pCMV). Whole cell lysates were subject to immunoprecipitation using a FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting to detect arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 in the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 3A, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 co-immunoprecipitation was observed in cells transfected with FLAG-tagged AIP4 but not in vector-transfected cells, suggesting that arrestins associate with AIP4 in cells. To define the nature of the interaction, we examined whether AIP4 and arrestin-2 interact directly or via an intermediate protein. Purified arrestin-2 was incubated with glutathione beads that were coated with full-length AIP4 fused to GST or GST alone (shown schematically in Fig. 3B), and bound arrestin-2 was detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, GST-AIP4, but not GST alone, bound to purified arrestin-2, suggesting a direct interaction between AIP4 and arrestin-2. AIP4 generally binds to its target proteins via its four tandem WW domains (19Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Ingham R.J. Colwill K. Howard C. Dettwiler S. Lim C.S. Yu J. Hersi K. Raaijmakers J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Taylor L. Yeung B. Vassilovski G. Amin M. Chen F. Matskova L. Winberg G. Ernberg I. Linding R. O'Donnell P. Starostine A. Keller W. Metalnikov P. Stark C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7092-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); therefore, we next asked whether the interaction with arrestin-2 is mediated by the WW domains. As shown in Fig. 3C, arrestin-2 also bound to a GST fusion protein of the AIP4 WW domains (GST-WW-I-IV); however, GST-AIP4 appeared to bind better than GST-WW-I-IV, suggesting that there may be additional sites on AIP4 that bind to arrestin-2. Alternatively, full-length AIP4 may maintain a more favorable arrestin-2 binding conformation. Similarly, we observed better binding of GST-AIP4 than GST-WW-I-IV to HA-tagged arrestin-2 expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, it appears that the WW domains, at least in part, mediate the interaction with arrestin-2. To explore which of the four WW domains of AIP4 mediated the interaction with arrestin-2, we examined the ability of each individual WW domain to bind to arrestin-2. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins containing individual WW domains were assessed for their ability to interact with HA-tagged arrestin-2 in whole cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3E, the interaction with arrestin-2 is mediated by WW domains I and II, but not WW domains III and IV of AIP4. WW domains interact with proline-rich motifs in various contexts, and because arrestins contain several proline-rich sequences, we decided to use truncation mutagenesis to determine the AIP4-binding regions on arrestin-2. Various arrestin-2 truncation mutants used in these studies are shown schematically in Fig. 4A. Initially, we examined two truncation mutants encompassing the amino-terminal (amino acids 1–260) and carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 261–418) regions of arrestin-2. Whole cell lysates of HEK293 cells expressing HA-tagged arrestin-2 truncation mutants were incubated with glutathione beads coated with WW domains I–IV fused to GST or GST alone. As shown in Fig. 4B, GST-WW-I-IV bound to arrestin-2-(1–260) but not arrestin-2-(261–418). Further truncation of arrestin-2-(1–260) to residues 179 and 161 revealed that binding to AIP4 was most likely mediated by residues located between residues 161 and 260. Interestingly, this region contains a proline-rich stretch within the hinge region (174–181) that connects the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of arrestin-2 (23Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mutation of two proline residues to alanines (arrestin-2-(P180A/P182A)) and deletion of 8 amino acids (Δ175–182) encompassing the proline residues within this region in the context of the 1–260 construct failed to abrogate binding to GST-WW-I-IV (data not shown), suggesting that these residues are not important for binding to AIP4 and that other regions may be involved. To gain further insight into the mechanism by which arrestins function in AIP4-dependent degradation of CXCR4, we examined whether receptor activation promotes the interaction between AIP4 and arrestin-2. Initially, we compared the ability of AIP4 to bind to wild-type arrestin-2 and arrestin-2-R169E. The arrestin-2-R169E mutant is thought to mimic the form of arrestin when it is bound to activated and phosphorylated GPCRs and is thus considered to be “constitutively active” (24Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 465-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either arrestin-2 wild-type or R169E mutant together with FLAG-tagged AIP4 or empty vector (pCMV). Whole cell lysates were subject to immunoprecipitation using the FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting to detect arrestin-2 in the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 5A, a single band corresponding to arrestin-2 was observed in cells transfected with FLAG-tagged AIP4 but not in cells transfected with empty vector. Interestingly, arrestin-2-R169E showed enhanced binding to FLAG-tagged AIP4 as compared with wild-type arrestin-2 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that receptor activation may promote arrestin-2 binding to AIP4. To confirm our findings, we next examined whether activation of CXCR4 promotes the association between endogenous AIP4 and arrestin-2 in HEK293 cells that stably express HA-tagged CXCR4. The cells were treated in the absence or presence of CXCL12 followed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous AIP4 and immunoblotting to detect arrestins in the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 5B, incubation of cells with agonist for 15–30 min induced a robust increase in the amount of arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 detected in AIP4 immunoprecipitates, which diminished by 60 min, indicating that activation of CXCR4 promotes a time-dependent interaction between AIP4 and arrestins. To determine whether AIP4 and arrestin-2 co-localize within the same subcellular compartment, we employed immunofluorescence confocal microscopy on HEK293 cells co-expressing HA-CXCR4, YFP-arrestin-2, and mCh-AIP4. The cells were treated with agonist for 30 min, permeabilized, fixed, and observed using a confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 5C, in the vehicle-treated cells, arrestin-2 and AIP4 were mostly diffuse, although AIP4 was also found in puncta, consistent with its localization to endosomes (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the CXCL12-treated cells, arrestin-2 became punctate and showed strong co-localization with AIP4. Taken together, these data suggest that arrestin-2 co-localizes with AIP4 on endosomes upon CXCR4 activation, which may facilitate its ability to mediate sorting of CXCR4 into the degradative pathway. Here, we establish that arrestin-2 functions in endosomal sorting of CXCR4 into the degradative pathway (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Arrestin-2 likely facilitates AIP4-mediated events critical for endosomal sorting of CXCR4, although the precise mechanism is not known. Arrestin-2 is likely not a target for ubiquitination by AIP4 because siRNA-mediated depletion of AIP4 did not have any effect on the basal ubiquitination status of arrestin-2 (data not shown). Arrestin-2 might facilitate CXCR4 stimulated ubiquitination of HRS, which is AIP4-dependent (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HRS also mediates lysosomal targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor. However, AIP4, despite its co-localization with HRS on endosomes, functions in sorting CXCR4 and not epidermal growth factor receptor, suggesting that the endosomal sorting activity of AIP4 is specific for a subset of receptors targeted to lysosomes (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 21Slagsvold T. Marchese A. Brech A. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is possible that the specificity of AIP4 for CXCR4 endosomal sorting is a function of its ability to bind to arrestin-2 on endosomes. Regardless, our data support a model whereby arrestin-2 interacts with AIP4 on endosomes, where it likely modulates endosomal functions of AIP4 that are critical for lysosomal targeting of CXCR4 (7Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 21Slagsvold T. Marchese A. Brech A. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between AIP4 and arrestin-2 in cells is regulated by activation of CXCR4, we can detect basal binding between the proteins when overexpressed in the absence of activated receptor (Fig. 3). It may be possible that the AIP4-binding site is only partially accessible in the inactive conformation and that arrestin-2 activation makes it more accessible leading to greater AIP4 binding. Alternatively, it is possible that there are multiple AIP4-binding sites in arrestin-2. For example, a low affinity binding site may be accessible when arrestin-2 is in the inactive conformation, and a second, high affinity site may become accessible upon arrestin-2 activation, leading to a stronger interaction with AIP4. Nevertheless, our data indicate that AIP4 and arrestin-2 interact directly in vitro, and their association in cells is regulated by CXCR4 activation. In addition, we have identified the amino-terminal region of arrestin-2 and AIP4 WW domains I and II as the binding regions that may facilitate the interaction in cells. Typically, arrestin binding to activated and phosphorylated GPCRs occurs at the plasma membrane, which is thought to promote a conformational change in arrestin exposing the buried carboxyl-terminal end that binds to partners such as clathrin and β-adaptin (13Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because CXCR4 activation promotes AIP4 binding to arrestin-2, arrestin-2 may be recruited to phosphorylated CXCR4 before it interacts with AIP4. However, because the AIP4-binding site maps to the amino-terminal half of arrestin-2, we believe the mechanism of the interaction will be distinct from that for clathrin and β-adaptin, although a conformational change in arrestin-2 is likely required. Interestingly, the arrestin-2-AIP4 interaction is maximal after 15–30 min of agonist treatment, when both proteins co-localize on endocytic vesicles. Thus, it is possible that arrestin-2 binds to phosphorylated CXCR4 and AIP4 at the plasma membrane, and all three proteins co-traffic as a complex to endosomes. Arrestins have been shown to form stable complexes with certain GPCRs and several signaling molecules that persist for some time on endosomes (25Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15315-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but whether this is true for CXCR4, AIP4, and arrestin-2 remains to be determined. It is also possible that arrestin-2 interacts with phosphorylated CXCR4 at the plasma membrane, which co-internalize as a complex and once on endosomes somehow interacts with the endosomal pool of AIP4. This may also explain why arrestin-2 is not important for ubiquitination of the receptor at the plasma membrane. We show that in addition to not being involved in the ubiquitination of CXCR4, arrestin-2 is not involved in its internalization. It is possible that arrestin-2 mediates desensitization of CXCR4, although this function has been previously assigned to arrestin-3 (16Fong A.M. Premont R.T. Richardson R.M. Yu Y.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Patel D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which possibly also mediates CXCR4 internalization (15Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Orsini M.J. Parent J.L. Mundell S.J. Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, arrestin-2 may instead be directly recruited to endosomes by activated CXCR4, where it carries out its endosomal sorting function. Regardless of the mechanism, our data reveal that arrestin-2 co-localizes with AIP4 on endocytic vesicles, where it likely functions to mediate lysosomal targeting of CXCR4. In conclusion, we describe a novel function for arrestin-2 as an endosomal sorting molecule together with AIP4 to mediate CXCR4 entry into a degradative pathway. This function deviates from the general paradigm that arrestins serve as adaptors for clathrin-dependent internalization of GPCRs at the plasma membrane and suggests that arrestins may also serve as endosomal adaptor proteins required for sorting GPCRs into the degradative pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2152673117,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), unlike other muscle cells, do not terminally differentiate. In response to injury, VSMCs change phenotype, proliferate, and migrate as part of the repair process. Dysregulation of this plasticity program contributes to the pathogenesis of several vascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension. The discovery of mutations in the gene encoding BMPRII, the type II subunit of the receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) provided an indication that BMP signaling may affect the homeostasis of VSMCs and their phenotype modulation. Here we report that BMP signaling potently induces SMC-specific genes in pluripotent cells and prevents dedifferentiation of arterial SMCs. The BMP-induced phenotype switch requires intact RhoA/ROCK signaling but is not blocked by inhibitors of the TGFbeta and PI3K/Akt pathways. Furthermore, nuclear localization and recruitment of the myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTF-A and MRTF-B) to a smooth muscle alpha-actin promoter is observed in response to BMP treatment.

In this study, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to measure the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the co-clustering of membrane raft-associated fluorescent proteins (FPs) and FPs targeted to the nonraft membrane fraction. By fitting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer data to an isothermal binding equation, we observed a specific co-clustering of raft-associated donor and acceptor probes that was sensitive to latrunculin B (Lat B), which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, treating with jasplakinolide to enhance actin polymerization increased co-clustering of the raft-associated FPs over that of the nonraft probes. We also observed by immunoblotting experiments that the actin-dependent co-clustering coincided with regulation of the raft-associated Src family kinase Lck. Specifically, Lat B decreased the phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of Lck (Tyr505), and combining the Lat B with filipin further decreased the Tyr505 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the Lat B-dependent changes in Lck regulation required CD45 because no significant changes occurred in treated T cells lacking CD45 expression. These data define a role for the actin cytoskeleton in promoting co-clustering of raft-associated proteins and show that this property is important toward regulating raft-associated signaling proteins such as Lck.

Current models define cell membranes to be structurally heterogeneous in nature, composed of discrete domains with unique physical and biological properties. This lateral heterogeneity is essential for many membrane functions, including cell signaling (1Bray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

However, studies of membrane structure and function remain challenging, because functionally discrete domains are often below the resolution of light microscopy. Accordingly, properties of cell membranes and membrane domains remain unclear and even controversial (8Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). An important example of domains in biological membranes is the cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts. In the membrane raft model, rafts form through associations between cholesterol and other membrane lipids, giving rise to a discrete lipid phase with which specific membrane proteins associate (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Many studies have characterized raft domains using membrane fractionation, where it is postulated that rafts are represented by a nonionic detergent-resistant, glycolipid-enriched membrane fraction that is present in cell lysates (10Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Notably, however, some investigators contend that this fraction is an artifact of detergent lysis, and the membrane raft model is inaccurate (8Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Supporting the notion that the detergent-resistant glycolipid-enriched membrane fraction is representative of membrane domains in intact cells, separate studies have demonstrated a protein and lipid clustering that is specific to glycolipid-enriched membrane-associated molecules (11Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 13Zacharias D.A.

Imaging studies of raft-associated probes suggest that the rafts are heterogeneous in nature (18Jacobson K. Mouritsen O.G. Anderson R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), ranging in size from nanoclusters that are ∼5 nm in diameter and containing no more than a few protein molecules (14Sharma P.

Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), to larger nanodomains that are ∼25-100 nm in size (12Varma R. Mayor S.

Finally, fluorescence imaging experiments have demonstrated micron-size raft macrodomains that are detergent-resistant and enriched with raft-associated molecules (3Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 15Janes P.W.

One example of the macrodomains is the immunological synapse in stimulated lymphocytes (24Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar, 25Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), which forms where lymphocytes contact a cell containing antigen. In T cells and other lymphocytes, evidence of membrane rafts also comes from studies of signaling proteins in the outer membrane. For example, enriched in the membrane raft fraction are proteins that participate in signaling from the surface antigen receptors, and their targeting to the raft fraction is often necessary for efficient cell activation (26Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). One such enzyme is the Src family kinase Lck, which functions in signaling from the T cell receptor following binding to major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes. Disruption of Lck targeting to rafts attenuates T cell activation (27Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and in resting T cells, membrane rafts function in regulating Lck (28Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 29Kabouridis P.S. Janzen J. Magee A.L. Ley S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The factors that govern formation of membrane domains, including membrane rafts, continue to be elucidated. One such factor is the actin cytoskeleton, which can affect the lateral distribution and mobility of membrane proteins (30Rodgers W. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12591-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Lenne P.F. Wawrezinieck L. Conchonaud F. Wurtz O. Boned A. Guo X.J. Rigneault H. He H.T. Marguet D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In relation to rafts, actin occurs in the detergent-resistant raft fraction (23Jordan S. Rodgers W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and actin-filaments co-associate with known membrane raft markers (16Rodgers W. Zavzavadjian J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Jordan S. Rodgers W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton is also necessary for formation of some types of raft macrodomains in lymphocytes (16Rodgers W. Zavzavadjian J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Jordan S. Rodgers W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Rodgers W. Farris D. Mishra S. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 97-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the degree to which the actin cytoskeleton participates in establishing membrane rafts, such as its contribution toward protein clustering relative to that of the cholesterol-dependent lipid ordering, is not established. Importantly, the actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that changes in response to extracellular signals, and it may therefore represent one mechanism for governing the size and distribution of membrane rafts in the plasma membrane. By measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 2The abbreviations used are:FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferFPfluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinLATlinker for activation in T cellsLat Blatrunculin BTXSTriton X-100 solublePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate. between separate membrane-anchored fluorescent proteins, we show here a specific clustering of raft-associated membrane probes by the actin cytoskeleton. By immunoblotting, we also show the actin cytoskeleton is necessary for effective regulation of Lck. Similar effects on protein co-clustering and Lck regulation were observed in cells where cholesterol was sequestered using filipin. We conclude that both cholesterol and the actin cytoskeleton are necessary in establishing a membrane environment that provides for efficient regulation of raft-associated enzymes such as Lck. fluorescence resonance energy transfer fluorescent protein cyan fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein linker for activation in T cells latrunculin B Triton X-100 soluble phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate Gene Construction—Generation of CFP and YFP fusion proteins containing either the first 10 amino acids of Lck (L10) or the first 15 residues of Src (S15) was performed as described previously (33Rodgers W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides (33Rodgers W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for the L10 and S15 sequences were annealed and subcloned into the SmaI site of pWay20 (34Lo W. Rodgers W. Hughes T. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (98): 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) containing CFP or YFP in place of GFP. A fragment encoding the first 36 residues of linker for activation of T cells (LAT36) was amplified from the sequence of the full-length protein using the following primers: 5′-CATCATCTAGAATGGAGGAGGCCATCCTGG-3′ (coding); and 5′-TCTAGTGAATTCGTTGTTGTTGTTGTTGTTGTCGTAGGAGCCTGGTC-3′ (noncoding). The underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for XbaI and EcoRI in the coding and noncoding primers, respectively. The amplified product was digested and subcloned into the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen), upstream and in-frame to YFP. Lyn-CFP-YFP and CFP-T2DN-YFP have been described previously (17Sohn H.W. Tolar P. Jin T. Pierce S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and were generously provided by Dr. S. Pierce (National Institutes of Health). Cell Culture and Transfection—Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1) were maintained in medium containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. For gene expression, the cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser II; Bio-Rad) as described (23Jordan S. Rodgers W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For transfection, 107 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of RPMI and containing 25 μg of plasmid DNA. Settings of 330 V and 960 μF were used for electroporation. 48 h post-transfection, viable cells were separated by centrifuging the samples over Cellgro™ (MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Stable clones expressing CFP fusion proteins were selected by limiting dilution using medium containing G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Following drug selection, the clones were enriched for protein expression by flow cytometry and maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Cell Lysis, Equilibrium Centrifugation, and Immunoblotting—For sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation experiments, 107 cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of a 1% Triton X-100 solution in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA (TNE). For lysis, the samples were incubated with the detergent solution for 20 min at 4 °C and then processed with a Dounce homogenizer (8 strokes). Intact nuclei and large cell debris were removed by centrifuging (Eppendorf model 5417C; Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and diluted with an equal volume of an 85% sucrose solution in TNE. After gently mixing, the sample was overlaid in a SW50.1 rotor tube with 3.0 ml of a 30% and 1.5 ml of a 5% solution, each in TNE. The samples were centrifuged for 16-18 h at 200,000 × g. Following centrifugation, the gradients were harvested by fractionating from the top. Approximately 10% of each fraction was separated by gel electrophoresis. The fluorescent probes were detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody specific to GFP that recognizes YFP and CFP (Covance Research Products, Richmond, CA). Assays of Lck regulation began by lysing 106 cells in 100 μl of Laemmeli sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by incubation at 100 °C for 5 min. After lysis, equivalent amounts of the samples were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using monoclonal antibody to Lck (clone 2B;; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or rabbit antibody to Tyr(P)505 of Lck (Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA). All of the immunoblots were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using a LumiImager work station (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis—The samples were prepared for microscopy by seeding ∼106 cells onto a poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslip and then fixed by incubating in a 2% solution of paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. For the drug treatments, seeded coverslips were washed with RPMI containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (RPMIHEPES). Next, the medium was replaced with RMPI-HEPES containing either 1% Me2SO (Sigma) alone, or drug diluted from a 100× stock solution in Me2SO. Final drug concentrations were 5 μm latrunculin B (Lat B) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 0.5 μm jasplakinolide (Invitrogen), and 5 μg/ml filipin (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). All of the incubations were for 30 min at 37 °C. Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. CFP was excited at 458 nm, and emission was detected between 473 and 505 nm. YFP was excited at 514 nm, and emission was detected from 530 to 600 nm. The images were collected using a 63× oil objective (NA 1.2), and recorded in 12-bit mode at a scan rate of 2.56 μs/pixel. All of the image processing and quantitation was performed using IPLab (BD Biosciences). FRET was measured based on the increase in the CFP signal following photobleaching of the YFP. Photobleaching of YFP was restricted to a region of interest 8 × 5 pixels (2.1 × 1.3 μm) in size and was performed by illuminating the sample for 750 iterations (∼45 s) at 514 nm with the laser at full power. Four images were acquired for each region of interest: 1) an image of YFP fluorescence before bleach (YFPpre), 2) an image of CFP fluorescence before bleach (CFPpre), 3) an image of YFP fluorescence after bleach (YFPpost), and 4) an image of CFP fluorescence after bleach (CFPpost). In addition, to correct for bleaching of CFP during YFP bleaching (CFPYFP bleach), cells expressing CFP alone were taken through all the steps of FRET measurement. Cells expressing only YFP were used to determine the YFP bleed-through into the CFP channel (CFPYFP). Fluorescence intensities of each region of interest were measured on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and measurement of YFPpre - YFPpost showed the photobleaching extinguished >95% of the YFP fluorescence. CFPpre was corrected for YFP bleed-through into the CFP channel using the following operation. CFPpre,corrected=CFPpre-CFPYFP(Eq. 1) CFPpost bleach was corrected for both bleaching of CFP during YFP bleaching and YFP bleed-through by the following equation. CFPpost,corrected=(CFPpost-CFPYFP)+CFPYFPbleach(Eq. 2) From the corrected values, FRET efficiency (E%) was calculated as follows. E&x0025;=(CFPpost,corrected-CFPpre,corrected)CFPpost,corrected×100(Eq. 3) FRET was measured in 75-100 separate cells, restricted to those cells where the expression of the donor and acceptor were approximately equal. Co-clustering was quantitated by fitting plots of E% versus acceptor intensity to Equation 4 (below). Curve fitting and all of the statistical analysis were performed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Standard error was determined as described (35Cumming G. Fidler F. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) using standard deviations from the curve fitting. The statistical significance of the differences in K values was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test for distributions of unequal variance (Equations 14.2.3 and 14.2.4 in Ref. 36Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. 3rd Ed. Cambridge University Press, New York2007: 720-772Google Scholar). The K values determined to be significantly different are indicted by asterisks, which represent a probability greater than 99.99% that the two values are different. Targeting of Fluorescent Proteins to the Raft and Nonraft Membrane Fractions—The membrane-targeted FPs used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1A. Specifically, CFP and YFP served as the FRET donor and acceptor, respectively. Each was targeted to the membrane fraction of Jurkat T cells by either the N-terminal 10 residues of Lck (L10), the N-terminal 15 residues of Src (S15), or the N-terminal 36 residues of linker for activation of T cells (LAT36). We have described the L10 and S15 membrane targeting signals previously (33Rodgers W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), where it was shown the L10 sequence targets FPs to the detergent-resistant membrane raft fraction and the S15 signal limits FPs to the Triton X-100-soluble (TXS), nonraft membrane fraction. LAT36 contains the transmembrane domain of LAT but lacks its cytoplasmic domain with associated linker functions (37Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the LAT36 sequence targets fusion proteins to the raft fraction (38Shogomori H. Hammond A.T. Ostermeyer-Fay A.G. Barr D.J. Feigenson G.W. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18931-18942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) because of palmitoylation of a set of membrane-proximal cysteine residues (39Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B are fractionation data showing the membrane targeting features of the L10, S15, and LAT36 sequences. In addition, in Fig. 1B are confocal images showing each membrane anchor efficiently targeted the FPs to the plasma membrane. Visualization of FRET by Acceptor Photobleaching—To establish detection of FRET, we first measured energy transfer in T cells expressing a control peptide consisting of CFP and YFP separated by a two-amino acid linker and containing the membrane-anchoring signal of Lyn (Lyn-CFP-YFP). The energy transfer efficiency (E%) was measured based on the increase in donor fluorescence following photobleaching of the acceptor (40Pentcheva T. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6625-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to show that observed changes in CFP fluorescence following YFP photobleaching were specific to FRET, measurements were made using cells expressing a second control peptide containing CFP and YFP separated by a 236-amino acid linker (CFP-T2DN-YFP). Examples of FRET measurements of the CFP-YFP fusion peptides are shown in Fig. 2A. The yellow box in each image represents the region where the acceptor was photobleached. Accompanying the images are plots of the fluorescence intensity values of the outer membrane in the CFP and YFP channels before (red) and after (green) photobleaching. The vertical lines in the plots mark the boundaries of the bleached regions and show the photobleaching extinguished ∼95% of the YFP fluorescence. For the Lyn-CFP-YFP, the photobleaching was accompanied by an approximately 2-fold increase in the CFP signal. In contrast, photobleaching YFP of the CFP-T2DN-YFP resulted in no detectable change in its CFP fluorescence. Thus, the changes in CFP fluorescence following photobleaching of YFP were specific to FRET. Resolution of Protein Co-clustering by FRET—Earlier studies showed that co-association of FRET donor and acceptor pairs with membrane domains is reflected in plots of E% versus acceptor concentration (13Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 17Sohn H.W. Tolar P. Jin T. Pierce S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 40Pentcheva T. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6625-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 42Tolar P. Sohn H.W. Pierce S.K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The principal behind this property is illustrated in Fig. 2B. First, in the absence of co-clustering, E% increases linearly with increasing acceptor as the distance between the donor and acceptor decreases proportionally because of molecular crowding. In contrast, when the donor and acceptor co-cluster, such as through co-association with membrane domains, the distance between the donor-acceptor pair reaches a minimal distance, after which E% no longer increases with increasing acceptor concentration. Tsien and co-workers (13Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) showed the associative properties of the donor and acceptor pair such as that illustrated in Fig. 2B can be discriminated by the parameter K in the following isothermal binding equation, E&x0025;=E&x0025;maxF(F+K)(Eq. 4) where F represents the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor, which we defined as the prebleach intensity of the YFP fluorescence. Based on Equation 4, K is analogous to a dissociation constant of the donor and acceptor pair, approaching zero as the degree of co-clustering of the fluorescent proteins increases. In Fig. 2C are examples of K representing the relative co-clustering of donor and acceptor pairs using FRET data from the Lyn-CFP-YFP and CFP-T2DN-YFP fusion proteins. In the experiment with Lyn-CFP-YFP, K approached zero (K = 12), reflecting an apparent co-clustering that is due to an adjacent donor and acceptor in the fusion protein. In contrast, for CFP-T2DN-YFP, where we predicted the apparent co-clustering to be minimal because of a large separation of the donor and acceptor pair, K is 2 orders of magnitude larger (K = 1710) than that of the Lyn-CFP-YFP. Note also for each fit that the residual differences between the experimental and predicated values for E% are minimal and distributed randomly about zero, thus indicating a favorable fit of the experimental data to Equation 4. In contrast, fitting the FRET data from Lyn-CFP-YFP to Equation 4 but constrained by the K determined for CFP-T2DN-YFP resulted in a large deviation of the residual differences from zero (supplemental Fig. S1, top row). Thus, application of Equation 4 reliably discriminates the co-clustering of the separate donor-acceptor pairs. As an additional control, we determined the effect of protein aggregation on the apparent co-clustering of the L10-anchored probes (Fig. 2C). Specifically, we measured the FRET between L10-CFP and L10-YFP in cells treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and sphingomylinase, which represent conditions where raft-associated proteins aggregate (43Nishimura S.Y.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). K for the co-treated samples approached that of the Lyn-CFP-YFP (K = 68), and this value is approximately one-fifth that determined for L10-CFP and L10-YFP in untreated cells (Fig. 3). These data therefore further validate the approach of using K to distinguish the relative co-clustering of separate membrane proteins. Cholesterol-dependent Co-clustering of Membrane-anchored Fluorescent Proteins—To determine the relative co-clustering of the membrane-anchored FPs, we fitted FRET data to Equation 4 from cells co-expressing L10-or S15-CFP with L10-, LAT36-, or S15-YFP (Fig. 3; see also Fig. 5). Consistent with the membrane raft model, these data show a specific and cholesterol-dependent co-clustering of probes that associate with the detergent-resistant raft fraction. For example, the lowest values for K occurred in samples double-labeled with L10-CFP and either L10-YFP or LAT36-YFP (K = 263 and 154, respectively), and these values were up to 11-fold lower than K determined for cells co-expressing an S15-anchored probe with the L10- or LAT36-FPs (1100 < K < 1700) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, cells co-expressing L10-CFP with either L10- or LAT36-YFP and treated with filipin to sequester cholesterol (45Bolard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 257-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and disrupt the membrane raft fraction (Fig. 4) exhibited up to a 10-fold increase in K. However, disruption of protein co-clustering by filipin was specific to donor and acceptor"
https://openalex.org/W2080884088,"Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous calcium-binding protein, regulates diverse cellular functions by modulating the activity of a variety of proteins. However, little is known about how CaM directly regulates transcription. Screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated calmodulin as a probe identified a calmodulin-binding NAC protein (CBNAC). Using gel overlay assays, a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding domain was identified in the C terminus of this protein. Specific binding of CaM to CaM-binding domain was corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis and a split-ubiquitin assay. Using a PCR-mediated random binding site selection method, we identified a DNA-binding sequence (CBNACBS) for CBNAC, which consisted of a GCTT core sequence flanked on both sides by other frequently repeating sequences (TTGCTTANNNNNNAAG). CBNAC was able to bind to CBNACBS, which resulted in the repression of transcription in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Interestingly, the transcriptional repression mediated by CBNAC was enhanced by CaM. These results suggest that CBNAC may be a CaM-regulated transcriptional repressor in Arabidopsis."

The model-based predictions and associated experiments help explain why only one of two classes of activating Ras point mutations with in vitro transformation potential is commonly found in cancers. Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network. This system-level analysis of the oncogenic Ras network provides new insights and potential therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2081579371,"A computational analysis of the nuclear genome of a red alga, Cyanidioschyzon merolae , identified 11 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes in which the 3′ half of the tRNA lies upstream of the 5′ half in the genome. We verified that these genes are expressed and produce mature tRNAs that are aminoacylated. Analysis of tRNA-processing intermediates for these genes indicates an unusual processing pathway in which the termini of the tRNA precursor are ligated, resulting in formation of a characteristic circular RNA intermediate that is then processed at the acceptor stem to generate the correct termini."
https://openalex.org/W1576522185,"Interleukin (IL)-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immunity. IL-15 is unique among cytokines due to its participation in a trans signaling mechanism in which IL-15 receptorα (IL-15Rα) from one subset of cells presents IL-15 to neighboring IL-2Rβ/γc-expressing cells. Here we present the crystal structure of IL-15 in complex with the sushi domain of IL-15Rα. The structure reveals that theα receptor-binding epitope of IL-15 adopts a unique conformation, which, together with amino acid substitutions, permits specific interactions with IL-15Rα that account for the exceptionally high affinity of the IL-15·IL-15Rα complex. Interestingly, analysis of the topology of IL-15 and IL-15Rα at the IL-15·IL-15Rα interface suggests that IL-15 should be capable of participating in a cis signaling mechanism similar to that of the related cytokine IL-2. Indeed, we present biochemical data demonstrating that IL-15 is capable of efficiently signaling in cis through IL-15Rα and IL-2Rβ/γc expressed on the surface of a single cell.

The cell-surface receptor for IL-15 comprises three subunits: IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) α, IL-2Rβ (also known as IL-15Rβ, CD122, and p75), and γc (also known as CD132 and p65). The ectodomain of IL-15Rα consists of a single sushi domain (6Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J. Loomis A. Shanebeck K. DuBose R. Cosman D. Park L.S. Anderson D.M.

This finding suggests that the architecture of IL-15R subunits in the IL-15 quaternary complex differs from that of IL-2 receptor subunits in the IL-2 quaternary complex, which are assembled in cis (i.e. on the surface of the same cell) as revealed by the recently reported IL-2·IL-2Rα·IL-2Rβ·γc crystal structure (25Wang X.

Although trans presentation is currently thought to be the major mechanism by which IL-15 exerts its biological effects in vivo, the possibility for the assembly of a cis IL-15 quaternary complex on cells capable of expressing IL-15Rα, IL-2Rβ, and γc, has not been ruled out (18Schluns K.S.

In this report, we present the crystal structure of murine IL-15 in complex with the sushi-domain fragment of IL-15Rα, refined to 2.2-Å resolution. The structure reveals the molecular determinants of the specific, high affinity IL-15·IL-15Rα interaction. Importantly, helix B and the hC-hD loop of IL-15 adopt unique conformations, which permit specific interactions with IL-15Rα that likely account for its significantly higher affinity relative to the IL-2·IL-2Rα interaction. We also present biochemical data demonstrating that, in addition to trans presentation, IL-15Rα is capable of presenting IL-15 to IL-2Rβ/γc in cis, suggesting a potential role for cis IL-15 presentation in certain biological contexts. Finally, analysis of the structure suggests that flexibility of the linker and/or PT region of IL-15Rα permit IL-15 and its three receptor components to be assembled identically at the ligand-receptor interface whether IL-15 is presented in cis or trans. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA fragments encoding the full-length ectodomain of mature murine IL-15Rα (residues 1-168; sIL-15Rα1-168), and the full-length mature murine IL-15 (residues 1-114) were cloned into the TA vector pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen) as fusion proteins containing an N-terminal histidine tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Selenomethionine-labeled proteins were synthesized using the large scale dialysis mode of the Escherichia coli cell-free reaction (30Kigawa T. Yamaguchi-Nunokawa E. Kodama K. Matsuda T. Yabuki T. Matsuda N. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2002; 2: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both IL-15 and sIL-15Rα1-168 precipitated during synthesis. The precipitated proteins were denatured in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm dithiothreitol and were refolded separately or co-refolded by rapid dilution into 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.3) containing 1 m arginine hydrochloride, 5 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione. After stirring for 24 h at 4 °C, the protein solutions were filtered and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl for 12-24 h at 4 °C. The refolded proteins were purified to homogeneity by chromatography on affinity (HisTrap) and gel-filtration (Superdex 200 HR 10/30) columns. The histidine tags were removed by overnight digestion with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C. Due to the location of the tobacco etch virus cleavage site, seven residues from the histidine tag (GSSGSSG) remain at the N termini of the IL-15 and sIL-15Rα1-168 proteins after histidine tag cleavage. During the gelfiltration step with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl, IL-15 eluted as a mixture of trimeric and monomeric species, and only the monomeric protein was used for subsequent experiments. For complex formation, separately refolded monomeric IL-15 and sIL-15Rα1-168 were mixed at a 1.5:1 molar ratio and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 15 filtration unit. The IL-15·sIL-15Rα1-168 mixture was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted at a position consistent with 1:1 complex formation, which was confirmed via analytical ultracentrifugation. Co-refolded IL-15·sIL-15Rα1-168 complex behaved identically to the separately refolded and reconstituted complex during purification. The co-refolding method was utilized for large scale protein preparation due to its consistently higher yields. For large scale protein preparation, an anion exchange step (Mono Q HR 5/5) was added prior to the final gel-filtration step (which was performed using a Superdex 75 HR 16/60 column). All columns were purchased pre-packed from GE Healthcare. Limited Proteolysis, Crystallization, and Data Collection—Initial crystallization trials of the IL-15·sIL-15Rα1-168 complex were performed using the standard sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Despite extensive screening efforts, we were unable to obtain crystals of the complex using the full-length ectodomain of IL-15Rα. During protein synthesis and purification, we noted that the C-terminal region of sIL-15Rα1-168 was extremely sensitive to proteolytic degradation, suggesting that this region of the receptor is highly flexible. To obtain boundaries more suitable for crystallization, we performed limited proteolysis experiments on the IL-15·sIL-15Rα1-168 complex. Using elastase (Nacalai Tesque), a stable fragment of the complex was identified during small scale pilot experiments, and the reaction conditions were scaled-up. The digested protein was purified by gel-filtration chromatography and analyzed using MALDI-TOF and N-terminal sequencing. The results of this analysis showed that the PT region and most of the linker region of IL-15Rα are rapidly degraded and that the stable fragment of IL-15Rα corresponds to residues 1-71, which includes the entire sushi domain and the first five residues of the linker region. The results also showed that IL-15 was not proteolytically digested. On the basis of these results a modified IL-15Rα construct (sIL-15Rα1-71) was generated, synthesized, and purified in complex with IL-15 as described above for sIL-15Rα1-168. Diffraction quality crystals of the selenomethionine-labeled IL-15·sIL-15Rα1-71 complex (hereafter referred to as IL-15·IL-15Rα) were grown by mixing 2 μl of IL-15·IL-15Rα (18 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl) with 2 μl of crystallization buffer (1.7 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 3% benzamidine-HCl) and incubating at 20 °C using hanging drop vapor diffusion. Large, single crystals measuring 0.5 mm in the longest dimension appeared within 5-7 days. Crystals were flash frozen in a final cryoprotectant solution composed of the mother liquor and 25% glycerol. Diffraction data were measured on an ADSC Quantum210 detector at Photon Factory-Advanced Ring, Beamline NW12. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The IL-15·IL-15Rα crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P4212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 118.5 Å, c = 76.11 Å. There are two IL-15·IL-15Rα complexes in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of ∼58%. Structure Determination and Refinement—The IL-15·IL-15Rα structure was solved using diffraction data collected at the selenium absorption peak wavelength (λ = 0.9793 Å) of one selenomethionine-derivatized crystal. The program SOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to locate the selenium sites and to calculate the phases using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The program RESOLVE (33Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) was used for density modification, and ARP/wARP (34Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) was used to generate an initial model via automatic model building. Positional and B-factor refinements were performed using the program CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and model building into the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps was performed with the program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard G. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The final refined atomic model contains residues 1-114 of both copies of IL-15 in the asymmetric unit, residues 3-71 in one copy of IL-15Rα, and residues 3-70 in the other copy of IL-15Rα in the asymmetric unit, 90 water molecules, and one benzamidine molecule. The remaining residues of the N-terminal histidine tag are completely disordered in both copies of IL-15Rα, whereas the last three residues of this region are ordered in both copies of IL-15 and are included in the atomic model. Additionally, residues 1-2 are disordered in both copies of IL-15Rα, and residue 71 is disordered in one copy of IL-15Rα in the asymmetric unit. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2PSM. Superimposition of the Cα trace of the two copies of IL-15 and the IL-15Rα shows that they are essentially identical (r.m.s.d. = 0.451 Å and 0.202 Å, respectively). Representations of the structure were created with the programs PyMOL 3DeLano, W. L. (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. and CCP4MG (38Potterton L. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Gruber J.

Generation of IL-15Rα- and IL-2Rβ-expressing FDC3 Cell Line—The cDNA of full-length murine IL-15Rα and IL-2Rβ were amplified by PCR and introduced into retroviral vectors, MSCV-IRES-GFPRV and pNX-IRES-hCD4RV, respectively. The murine mast cell line, FDC-P1 (39Dexter T.M. Garland J. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), was purchased from ATCC, re-cloned, and renamed as FDC3. This cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and conditioned media of P815 cells expressing IL3. PLAT:E packaging cell lines were transfected with IL-15Rα/MSCV-IRES-GFPRV or IL-2Rβ/pMX-IRES-hCD4RV by FuGENE according to the manufacture's instructions. After 24 h, the medium was replaced, and the retroviral supernatant was generated by culturing the cells for a further 24 h. The FDC3 cell line was infected by overnight culture in retroviral culture supernatant containing 8 mg/ml Polybrene. Infected FDC3 cell lines were purified by cell sorting for expression of the green fluorescent protein and/or the hCD4 surface markers. Sorted cells were expanded, were >90% pure, and stably expressed the retroviral markers. Single Cell Assay—FDC3αβ and FDC3β cells cultured in IL-3 containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 days were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and cultured in IL-15-free, IL3-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum for 7 h. A single cell was picked up by micropipette and transferred into a well of a Terasaki plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum in the presence or absence of 30 ng/ml IL-15. Cell division was checked under the microscope at 0 and 22 h of incubation. Thymidine Uptake Assay—The sIL-15Rα protein used for the thymidine uptake assay was produced using a modified method of a previously published protocol (40Ruchatz H. Leung B.P. Wei X.Q. McInnes I.B. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5654-5660PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA coding full-length ectodomain of murine IL-15Rα was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pQE30 bacterial expression vector (His-sIL-15Rα1-168). His-sIL-15Rα1-168 was expressed in E. coli strain M15 cells and was purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. Proliferation assays were set up in 96-well microtiter plates. Murine IL-15 (R&D) was diluted across the plates in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml His-sIL-15Rα1-168 protein. In the experiment using IL-15·IL-15Rα1-168 complex or IL-15·IL-15Rα1-71 complex, the concentrations of IL-15 were calculated based on the content of IL-15 in the complex. FDC3αβ or FDC3β cells were plated at 4000 cells in 96-well flat-bottom plate and incubated for 24 h. The plates were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (0.1 μCi/well, Amersham Biosciences) for the last 6 h of culture. The cells were harvested on glass fiber filters and counted on a mutidetector direct beta counter (Matrix 96, Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Dose-response curves were generated and analyzed using GraphPad Prism. To elucidate the structural basis for the high affinity and specificity between IL-15 and IL-15Rα, and to obtain insights into the architecture of the IL-15·IL-15R complex, we have determined the crystal structure of IL-15 in complex with IL-15Rα. Initial attempts to crystallize IL-15 in complex with the full-length ectodomain of IL-15Rα were unsuccessful. Limited proteolysis experiments performed on purified IL-15·IL-15Rα complex led to the identification of a stable IL-15Rα fragment (encompassing the sushi domain and the first five residues of the linker region) that was amenable to crystallization (see “Experimental Procedures”). The IL-15·IL-15Rα structure was solved using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method and has been refined to 2.2-Å resolution with working and free R values of 22.4% and 23.6%, respectively (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-15Rα interacts with the upper edge of the IL-15 four-helix bundle.TABLE 1Summary of crystallographic analysisData collection statisticsResolutionReflections (total/unique)CompletenessRsymaRsym = 100 × ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) - 〈I(hkl)〉|/∑hkl∑iIi(hkl).SignalÅ%〈I/σI〉50.0-2.19407,623/28,362100 (100)bValue in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 2.27-2.19 Å.5.7 (16.3)bValue in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 2.27-2.19 Å.23.0Refinement statisticscThe atomic model consists of 2,833 protein atoms, 90 water molecules, and 1 benzamidine molecule.ResolutionReflectionsRcryst/RfreedRcryst/free = 100 × ∑hkl∥Fo(hkl)| - |Fc(hkl)∥/∑hkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo (>0) and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. 5% of the reflections were used for calculation of Rfree.r.m.s.d.BondsAnglesB-factorseFor bonded protein atoms.Å%Å°Å225.0-2.1953,06422.3/23.60.0061.21.6a Rsym = 100 × ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) - 〈I(hkl)〉|/∑hkl∑iIi(hkl).b Value in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 2.27-2.19 Å.c The atomic model consists of 2,833 protein atoms, 90 water molecules, and 1 benzamidine molecule.d Rcryst/free = 100 × ∑hkl∥Fo(hkl)| - |Fc(hkl)∥/∑hkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo (>0) and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. 5% of the reflections were used for calculation of Rfree.e For bonded protein atoms. Open table in a new tab Structure of Receptor-bound IL-15—The crystal structure shows that IL-15 comprises a left-handed antiparallel four-helix bundle (hA, hB, hC, and hD) with the helices arranged in an up-up-down-down topology typical of members of the short-chain subfamily of helical cytokines (Fig. 1A) (41Rozwarski D.A.

As expected based on primary sequence, IL-15 contains two disulfide bridges, which the structure shows help to stabilize the conformation of the hC-hD loop in regions of the loop that engage in contacts with the receptor (Fig. 1A). Despite sharing only 16% sequence identity overall, the helices that comprise the four-helix bundles of receptor bound IL-15 and IL-2"

Grafting of the CDRs of m528Fv onto a selected framework region of human antibodies, referred to as humanization, reduced the antibody's affinity for its target by a factor of 1/40. The reduction in affinity was due to a substantial reduction in the negative enthalpy change associated with binding. Crystal structures of the ligand-free antibody fragments showed no noteworthy conformational changes due to humanization, and the loop structures of the CDRs of the humanized antibodies were identical to those of the parent antibodies. Several mutants of the CDR-grafted (humanized) variable domain fragment (h528Fv), in which some of the Vernier zone residues in the heavy chain were replaced with the parental murine residues, were constructed and prepared using a bacterial expression system. Thermodynamic analyses of the interactions between the mutants and the soluble extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor showed that several single mutations and a double mutation increased the negative enthalpy and heat capacity changes. Combination of these mutations, however, led to somewhat reduced negative enthalpy and heat capacity changes. The affinity of each mutant for the target was within the range for the wild-type h528Fv, and this similarity was due to enthalpy-entropy compensation. These results suggest that Vernier zone residues make enthalpic contributions to antigen binding and that the regulation of conformational entropy changes upon humanization of murine antibodies must be carefully considered and optimized.

Although these residues, referred to as Vernier zone residues, do not directly interact with the antigen, careful selection of these residues may prove essential for the success of loop transplants in antibodies, and variation of these sites may also have a role in shaping the diversity of structures found in the primary repertoire and a role in affinity maturation (21Foote J.

We also found that humanization of 528, a murine antibody specific for the human EGFR (41Kawamoto T. Sato J.D. Le A. Polikoff J. Sato G.H. Mendelsohn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), led to a substantial reduction of the antibody's affinity for its target. In this study, we focused on Vernier zone residues of 528 to determine what is predominantly responsible for the reduction of affinity that occurs upon humanization. Several mutants of the variable domains of humanized 528 (h528Fv), in which some of the Vernier zone residues in the heavy chain were replaced with the parental murine residues, were constructed and prepared using a bacterial expression system. The interactions between mutants and the soluble extracellular domain of EGFR (sEGFR) were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). On the basis of results obtained, we discuss the role that Vernier zone residues may play in the high affinity of antibodies for their targets. Construction of CDR-grafted (Humanized) 528 Antibody—Anti-human EGFR murine antibody 528 was humanized by means of the CDR-grafting method. First, sequences of human immunoglobulin variable regions were identified from the DDBJ data base (available on the World Wide Web) by using the BLAST sequence program. We chose the sequences of human variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) chains with the highest homology with the 528 framework regions. Amino acid sequences of BR55-2 (accession ID A25561; 88% identity in framework) and Xu-12 (accession ID AF062257; 68% identity in framework) were selected for the VL framework and the VH framework, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequences of the variable domain fragment of anti-human EGFR murine antibody 528 (m528Fv) and of humanized 528Fv (h528Fv). The genes encoding h528Fv were chemically synthesized by a method based on overlap extension PCR as described previously (38Asano R. Kudo T. Nishimura Y. Makabe K. Hayashi H. Suzuki M. Tsumoto K.

Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the vector constructed and then incubated at 37 °C in 2× YT broth with 100 mg of ampicillin per liter of culture. When the optical density reached 0.8 at a wavelength of 600 nm, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm to induce expression of the target protein, and the cells were further grown overnight. The culture supernatant was salted out with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation, and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein precipitates were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer for 2 days. The precipitates formed during dialysis were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a TALON immobilized metal affinity chromatography column (Invitrogen) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm imidazole, and then the adsorbed protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 150 mm imidazole. Further purification was performed by anion exchange chromatography (Resource S; GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) followed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex200pg (26/60; GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan). A C-terminal hexahistidine tag-fused sEGFR was expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells, which were kindly provided by Dr. Tsutomu Arakawa (Alliance Protein Laboratories). Cells were grown in a medium composed of RPMI1640 (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For large scale production, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% nonessential amino acid solution (Invitrogen) for 3 days. Nickel-charged His-bind resin (1% volume; Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) was added to the supernatant of the culture medium and allowed to batch bind at 4 °C for more than 12 h and then loaded to the column. After washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, the elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole) was added for elution of the protein of interest. Final purification was performed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex200pg (26/60; GE Healthcare). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were measured on a REFLEX III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Analytische, GmbH, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Sinapic acid was applied as a matrix and dissolved to saturation in water/acetonitrile (2:1, v/v) containing 0.067% trifluoroacetic acid. Sample solutions from each stage were mixed with the sinapic acid-saturated solution in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, and then 1 μl of the mixed solution was loaded onto the sample target. After co-crystallization on the target, the crystals were washed two times with 2 μl of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to remove salts. Analysis was performed in positive and linear modes with an accelerating voltage of 27 kV, and 200 scans were averaged. Preparation of m528Fab Fragment—The Fab fragment of m528 was generated by papain digestion of m528 IgG (subtype IgG2a) with an ImmunoPure Fab Preparation Kit (Pierce). The Fab fragment was separated from undigested IgG and the constant domain fragment (Fc) by means of a Protein A column. The flow-through fraction was collected and used for crystallization. Crystallization of h528Fv and m528Fab—All crystallization experiments were performed using the vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Crystal screening was performed by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using Crystal Screens I and II, Salt Rx (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA), and Wizards 1 and 2 (Emerald Biostructures, Bainbridge Island, WA). Well-diffracted crystals were obtained in hanging drops equilibrated against a reservoir solution consisting of 3 m sodium chloride and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for h528Fv and 1.4 m ammonium sulfate, 0.01 m cadmium chloride, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.1) for m528Fab. The crystallization drops contained equal volumes (2 μl) of reservoir and purified protein solution (20 mg/ml for h528Fv and 36 mg/ml for m528Fab in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data for h528Fv were obtained at the NW-12 beamline at KEK PF-AR (Japan). Crystals of h528Fv were flash-cooled to 100 K by using paratone-N oil as a cryoprotectant. The protein crystallized in the space group P65 with the following unit cell dimensions: a = b = 63.28 and c = 225.34. The resolution was 2.1 Å. Data were processed with HKL2000 and SCALA of the CCP4 program suite (45Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure of h528Fv was solved by molecular replacement with the MOLREP program of CCP4 (46Collaborative Computational Project 4 (1994) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The search models used were the VH domain of humanized anti-CD40 ligand antibody (Protein Data Bank code 1I9R) and the VL domain of anti-HIV protease antibody (Protein Data Bank code 1CL7), respectively. After rigid body refinement with the REFMAC program (47Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Diffraction data for m528Fab were obtained at the BL-6A beamline at KEK PF (Japan). Crystals of m528Fab were flash-cooled to 100 K by using 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The m528Fab crystallized in the space group P62 with the following unit cell dimensions: a = b = 126.60 and c = 68.28. The resolution was 2.3 Å. The structure was determined as described for h528Fv.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Thermodynamic parameters for the interactions between the sEGFR domain and m528Fv, h528Fv, and several mutants were determined by microtitration calorimetry using a VP-ITC from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA) (51Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). The experimental conditions were as follows. sEGFR at a concentration of 2 μm in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.005% Tween 20 in a calorimeter cell was titrated with a 20-μm solution of the Fv in the same buffer. The ligand solution was injected 25 times in 10-μl portions over a period of 15 s. Data acquisition and subsequent nonlinear regression analysis were done in terms of a simple binding model, using the MicroCal ORIGIN software package. The enthalpy changes (ΔH) and binding constants (Ka) for the antigen-antibody interactions were directly obtained from the experimental titration curves. The Gibbs energy changes, ΔG =-RT ln Ka, and the entropy changes, ΔS = (ΔG + ΔH)/T, for the associations were calculated from the ΔH and Ka values. The heat capacity changes (ΔCp) were estimated from the temperature dependence of the enthalpy changes. Estimation of Protein Concentration—The concentration of sEGFR was estimated by using A2801…percnt; = 9.53 (cm-1m-1).

A2801…percnt; = 16.8 (cm-1m-1) was used for the mutants, including Y27D (52Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol.

We selected human antibody frameworks with the highest homology to the framework of m528Fv, and CDR regions defined by Kabat et al. (53Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar) were grafted onto the frameworks selected. Murine and human heavy chain V genes are classified into three known clans (54Schroeder Jr., H.W. Hillson J.L. Perlmutter R.M. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both VH genes of parental murine antibody 528 (J558 family) and selected human antibody framework Xu-12 (VH1 family) belong to clan I (55Kirkham P.M. Mortari F. Newton J.A. Schroeder Jr., H.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences designed were chemically synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). The Fv fragments were expressed using an E. coli secretory expression system and were purified from the culture supernatant by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and subsequent size exclusion chromatography. Final yields of m528Fv and h528Fv were ∼1.0 mg/liter of culture (Fig. 2). For functional characterization of the Fvs, c-Myc peptide tag was fused to the C terminus of both chains. Flow cytometric analyses using some EGFR-positive cells and anti-c-Myc peptide tag antibody 9E10 indicated that both Fv fragments had binding profiles identical to that of IgG, and specific inhibition of the binding of the Fvs to the cell surface antigen by the IgG was confirmed (data not shown) (37Takemura S.

A functional GPI anchor was identified in cell-associated Plb1 by (G)PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC)-induced release of Plb1 from strain H99 membrane rafts and inhibition of GPI anchor synthesis by YW3548, which prevented Plb1 secretion and transport to membranes and cell walls. Plb1 containing β-1,6-linked glucan was released from H99 (wild-type strain) cell walls by β-1,3 glucanase, consistent with covalent attachment of Plb1 via β-1,6-linked glucans to β-1,3-linked glucan in the central scaffold of the wall. Naturally secreted Plb1 also contained β-1,6-linked glucan, confirming that it originated from the cell wall.

Del Poeta M. Sorrell T.C. Turner K.M. Wright L.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that cryptococcal Plb1 serves dual functions in the cryptococcal cell, namely, that it is involved in membrane homeostasis and remodelling and in the maintenance of cell wall integrity. Both functions would contribute to fungal survival in the environment and the mammalian host. In addition, secreted Plb1, which facilitates tissue invasion, may be directly derived from the cell wall, in which case, the cell membrane is not, as is currently believed, the only source of extracellular Plb1. Reagents—Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagents were obtained from Pierce Chemical Co., l-α-phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl (C16:0) (DPPC), l-α-lyso phosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl (C16:0) (LysoPC), and β-1,3 glucanase (Trichoderma haziarum) from Sigma Aldrich. 1,2-di[1-14C] palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 1-[14C]palmitoyl lyso-PC, and protein G-Sepharose and ECL reagents, from GE Healthcare (Rydalmere, NSW, Australia). (G)PI-PLC (Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene OR) and Prozyme (San Leandro, CA), respectively. Zirconia/silica beads (0.5 mm) were purchased from Biospec Products, Inc. (Daintree Scientific, TAS, Australia) and Immobilon™, PSQ 0.2 μm Membrane from Millipore Corp. NuPAGE™ 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel and loading reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Mulgrave, Vic, Australia), Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, from Bio-Rad and YW3548 was a gift from Taroh Kinoshita (Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Japan). Antibodies—Antibodies to Plb1 were prepared as described (7Siafakas A.R. Wright L.C. Sorrell T.C. Djordjevic J.T. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Djordjevic J.T. Del Poeta M. Sorrell T.C. Turner K.M. Wright L.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies to β-1,6-linked glucan were supplied by Frans Klis (Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam). Donkey anti-goat, rabbit anti-mouse, and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugates were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and GE Healthcare, respectively. Strains—A highly virulent, high Plb1-producing strain (H99) of C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A (wild type), its PLB1 deletion mutant (ΔPLB1) and the reconstituted strain, ΔPLB1rec, were supplied by Dr. Gary Cox, Duke University. Subcellular Fractionation—Cryptococcal total and raft membranes were prepared as described (7Siafakas A.R. Wright L.C. Sorrell T.C. Djordjevic J.T. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cryptococcal cells, either grown on SAB agar for 72 h or in YNB/2% glucose for 24 h, were homogenized in MES-buffered saline (MBS; 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) containing protease inhibitors and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant collected. The pellet was further disrupted by probe sonication and the centrifuged pellet was retained for preparation of cell walls. The supernatant was centrifuged at 135,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the pellet (total membranes) and supernatant (cytosol). Membranes were incubated with Triton X-100 (1%) prior to fractionation into raft and non-raft fractions on a sucrose gradient. Gradient fractions containing each membrane type were pooled and pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 135,000 × g. Cell wall material (3500 × g pellet) was washed with 1 m NaCl (washes kept), resuspended in 100-300 μl of β-1,3 glucanase made up as a 20 mg/ml solution in water or MBS/protease inhibitors and incubated with agitation for 1-2 h at 37 °C. Supernatants, containing cell wall proteins, were collected following centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and either analyzed by Western blot for Plb1 and laccase or immune-captured with antibodies to β-1,6-linked glucan (see below). (G)PI-PLC-mediated Release of Plb1 from Membranes—Total and raft membranes were washed with 1 m NaCl to remove cytosolic material and collected by ultracentrifugation (135,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 100-200 μl of (G)PI-PLC incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, MBS pH 6.5 or 25 mm HEPES pH 7, 0.5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) with/without (G)PI-PLC (0.5-1U) from either B. cereus or B. thuringiensis. In some instances Tris-HCl was replaced with HEPES or MBS with no difference in release of GPI-anchored Plb1. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h with agitation. Released proteins were separated from the membrane-associated proteins by ultracentrifugation. Investigation of the Association of Plb1 with Membranes—Membranes were resuspended in (G)PI-PLC incubation buffer with/without (G)PI-PLC, incubated for 1 h and ultracentrifuged. Membrane pellets and supernatants were subjected to phase-separation with TX-114 from which contaminating detergents had been removed (22Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of chilled MBS/protease inhibitors and 1% (v/v) purified TX-114 was used to solubilize membranes or proteins released from membranes, by incubation at 4 °C for 1-2 h. Insoluble debris was cleared by untracentrifugation. The suspension was incubated at 37°C for 1 h to achieve phase separation and centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase was collected, and the organic phase was back-washed three times with MBS/protease inhibitors. The proteins in both phases were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v) in preparation for SDS-PAGE and Plb1 Western blotting. YW3548 Inhibition Studies—YW3548 is a terpenoid lactone, which inhibits synthesis of GPI anchors and prevents transport of yeast GPI-anchored proteins to the cell surface (10Sutterlin C. Horvath A. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Wang Y. Dreyfuss M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells from an overnight culture of C. neoformans in 2× YNB/2% glucose, were washed three times with 50 ml of saline, resuspended in 50 ml of 1× YNB/2% glucose and incubated for 8 h. YW3548 (or methanol solvent) was then added to 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 nm, and incubation was resumed for 12 h. Preliminary experiments had established that YW3548 concentrations of up to 0.1 nm did not affect growth or viability of C. neoformans. Cells were washed, subcellular fractions prepared, and proteins released from membranes/cell walls by incubation with (G)PI-PLC/β-1,3 glucanase, respectively. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of Plb1 or laccase 1 protein by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and loaded on to a 4-12% NUPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). Following SDS-PAGE (100 mA, 1 h), proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Plb1 and laccase were detected by incubation with anti-Plb1 peptide antibody (1 μg/ml) or anti-laccase 1 antibody (2 μg/ml), respectively, for 1 h, then with secondary antibody diluted 1:2,000 (donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP or rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP) for a further hour. Bands were visualized using ECL on Hyper film. Immune-Capture—Proteins in cryptococcal secretions or released from cell wall fractions by high salt-washing (1 m NaCl) or treatment with β-1,3-glucanase were diluted with 10× TNET buffer to give a final concentration of 1× TNET buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Anti-β-1,6-glucan antibody (2 μg) and protein G-Sepharose beads (100 μl of a 50% slurry in 1× TNET buffer) were added, and incubation was carried out overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g, and supernatants aspirated. Beads were washed with 5 × 1 ml of 1× TNET (with 0.5% Triton X-100) and a final time with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with anti-Plb1 or anti-laccase antibodies. Activity Assays—Phospholipase B1 activities (LPL, LPTA, and Plb) in cryptococcal secretions were assayed radiometrically in a final volume of 125 μl at 37 °C as described (5Chen S.C. Wright L.C. Golding J.C. Sorrell T.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 431-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed as described (7Siafakas A.R. Wright L.C. Sorrell T.C. Djordjevic J.T. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Hamilton A.J. Holdom M.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 488-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SOD activity was assayed using a kit (Dojindo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SOD activity was calculated as the rate of inhibition of reduction of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 where one unit was defined as a 50% decrease from the control value (no SOD) over 30 min at 37 °C. The results are presented as total SOD activity. Determination of Cell Wall Integrity—The integrity of cryptococcal cell walls was assessed after 48 h of growth on SAB agar plates containing 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Congo Red or 0.5 mg per ml caffeine (24Banks I.R. Specht C.A. Donlin M.J. Gerik K.J. Levitz S.M. Lodge J.K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Capsules were visualized by Transmission electron microscopy as described (25Himmelreich U. Allen C. Dowd S. Malik R. Shehan B.P. Mountford C. Sorrell T.C. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plb1 Is Released from Membranes by Exogenous (G)PI-PLC and Partitions into TX-114—We have shown previously that Plb1 is present in cryptococcal membranes (7Siafakas A.R. Wright L.C. Sorrell T.C. Djordjevic J.T. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing, hydropathy plotting, and GPI anchor motif scanning using the DGPI/GPI-SOM prediction programs, predict that cryptococcal Plb1 is attached to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor. We used two classical approaches to confirm this, namely, release from the membrane following incubation with GPI-specific phospholipase C ((G)PI-PLC) and partitioning into the detergent, TX-114. (G)PI-PLC cleaves between the α-1-6-myo-inositol-PO4 and the diacylglycerol (DAG) group within the anchor sequence and converts the GPI-anchored protein, which is hydrophobic due to the DAG lipid anchor, to a soluble (hydrophilic) form. Each form partitions differently with the biphasic detergent, TX-114. The membrane-associated virulence determinant, superoxide dismutase (SOD), which lacks the predicted GPI anchor consensus motif as per the DGPI/GPI-SOM prediction programs, was used as a control. Following incubation with (G)PI-PLC, all membrane-associated Plb1 was released into the supernatant (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6); ∼10% was released by washing with 1 m NaCl (lane 1) and ∼10-15%, by incubation in the absence of (G)PI-PLC (lanes 2 and 3). Plb1 release was not affected by the addition of protease inhibitors (results not shown), confirming that neither endogenous membrane proteases nor proteases that may be potential contaminants in the (G)PI-PLC preparation were responsible for the effect. As expected for a GPI-anchored protein, the TX-114 partitioning experiments confirmed that Plb1 is integrally associated with the membrane. Fig. 1B (compare lanes 5 and 6) indicates that membrane-associated Plb1 partitioned exclusively into the hydrophobic (detergent) phase. In experiments where Plb1 had been released from membranes by preincubation with (G)PI-PLC prior to incubation with TX-114, no membrane Plb1 protein was detected in either the aqueous or the detergent phase (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). The Plb1 protein was now present in the supernatant and associated exclusively with the hydrophilic (aqueous) phase, indicating that the hydrophobic lipid component of the protein had been removed (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Only a small amount of SOD activity (∼10%) was released from membrane preparations by (G)PI-PLC and controls (see Fig. 2) confirming that the membrane association of SOD is not GPI-anchor-mediated and supporting the specificity of the results for Plb1. Plb1 Is Attached to Raft Membranes via a GPI Anchor—We next investigated whether Plb1 is tethered to raft membranes, in which it is known to be concentrated (7Siafakas A.R. Wright L.C. Sorrell T.C. Djordjevic J.T. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), by the GPI anchor. As shown in Fig. 3, a large proportion of membrane associated Plb1 was derived from lipid rafts (compare lanes 3 and 7). Following (G)PI-PLC treatment, all of the raft-associated Plb1 was released into the supernatant (compare lanes 1-4). A small amount of Plb1 protein that associated with non-raft membrane fractions was resistant to cleavage by (G)PI-PLC (compare lanes 6 and 8); this may be explained by partial inhibition of (G)PI-PLC by the higher concentrations of Triton X-100 in mixed membrane micelles. Inhibiting GPI Anchor Biosynthesis Prevents Plb1 Transport and Secretion—YW3548 inhibits α-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which adds the third mannose to the core GPI structure. Consequently, the supply of anchors to proteins displaying a GPI anchor consensus motif is reduced and transport of GPI-anchored proteins from ER to Golgi is prevented (10Sutterlin C. Horvath A. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Wang Y. Dreyfuss M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Incubation of cryptococci with non-toxic concentrations of YW3548 inhibited transport of Plb1 to the cell membrane, cell wall, and into the supernatant in a concentration-dependent manner (see Fig. 4A). Despite this, Plb1 protein was detected in total cell lysates, indicating that its synthesis was not inhibited by the treatment (results not shown). The cryptococcal virulence determinant, laccase 1, which localizes in the cell wall but lacks the motifs that predict acquisition of a GPI anchor (26Zhu X. Gibbons J. Garcia-Rivera J. Casadevall A. Williamson P.R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), was included as a specificity control. As expected, YW3548 did not affect cellular export of laccase 1 (see Fig. 4B). Plb1 Is Covalently Linked to β-Glucans in the Cryptococcal Cell Wall—If, as in other yeast, GPI-anchored proteins are covalently attached to β-1,6-linked glucans in the outer cell wall and β-1,6-linked glucans are themselves attached to β-1,3-linked glucans, we reasoned that incubating cell walls with β-1,3 glucanase would release cryptococcal Plb1 containing β-1,6-linked glucan. Fig. 5A demonstrates that after removal of non-covalently bound Plb1 from cell wall preparations of wild-type H99 with 1 m NaCl, Plb1 was released by β-1,3 glucanase. A significant amount of con-covalently bound Plb1 was also released by high salt washing. Quantitation of the Plb1 released by high salt and β-1,3 glucanase treatment, revealed a similar contribution of each to the total pool of cell wall-associated Plb1 (Figs. 5A and 7B). No Plb1 was detected in the corresponding fractions prepared from ΔPLB1 (not shown).FIGURE 7Plb1 is concentrated in the cell wall during heat stress. Cells were grown at 25, 30, and 37 °C in YNB for 24 h. Culture supernatants (secretions) were collected, and cells were fractionated into cell walls, membranes, and cytosol. Cell wall fractions were washed with 1 m NaCl to release noncovalently associated Plb1 and treated with β-1,3 glucanase to release covalently associated Plb1. Plb1 was released from membranes with (G)PI-PLC. Each fraction was subjected to Plb1 Western blotting (A). The Plb1 in each fraction was quantified by densitometry (B). For each temperature, the total Plb1 was ∼65,500, 53,500, and 80,000 density units, respectively. Results are representative of one experiment with identical results obtained in a second experiment, and are normalized to the total value obtained at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteins released from the cell wall fraction by high salt and β-1,3 glucanase, and cytosolic proteins, were immune-captured with antibodies to β-1,6-glucan prior to Western blotting with anti-Plb1 antibody (Fig. 5B). Fractions of cytosol were run as a control to investigate whether the Plb1 found there (see Fig. 7) originated from cell walls due to mechanical shearing in the homogenization procedure. A band with the MW of Plb1 was present only in cell wall preparations of H99 pretreated with β-glucanase. Cytosolic Plb1 was devoid of β-1,6-linked glucan, indicating that it did not originate from cell walls. No Plb1 was detected in any fractions prepared from ΔPLB1. Control experiments to detect laccase 1 released from cell walls by both high salt washing and treatment with β-1,3 glucanase, did not yield a protein containing β-1,6-linked glucan as expected, because laccase 1 has no GPI anchor (results not shown). Plb1 Is Released from Cryptococcal Cell Walls by Endogenous β-Glucanase(s)—We next investigated Plb1 in the secretions of H99 for the presence of β-1,6-linked glucan. We chose a secretion temperature of 25 °C as Plb1 secretion is greatest at this temperature (see Fig. 7B). Fig. 5C shows that Plb1 secreted at 25 °C is recognized by antibody to β-1,6-linked glucan indicating that cell wall-associated Plb1 is a source of endogenously secreted Plb1. No Plb1 was secreted by ΔPLB1. Plb1 and Cryptococcal Cell Wall Integrity—GPI-anchored proteins play a role in maintaining cell wall integrity in S. cerevisiae. Indicators of compromised cell wall integrity include altered cell and colony morphology, clumping (27Martinez-Lopez R. Monteoliva L. Diez-Orejas R. Nombela C. Gil C. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3341-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Bates S. Hughes H.B. Munro C.A. Thomas W.P. MacCallum D.M. Bertram G. Atrih A. Ferguson M.A. Brown A.J. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 90-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and reduced growth in the presence of SDS, Congo Red, or caffeine (24Banks I.R. Specht C.A. Donlin M.J. Gerik K.J. Levitz S.M. Lodge J.K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Ram A.F. Klis F.M. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 30Kuranda K. Leberre V. Sokol S. Palamarczyk G. Francois J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1147-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The microscopic morphology and appearance of colonies of ΔPLB1, cultured on SAB agar, revealed an abnormal wrinkled (rather than smooth) appearance and flocculation (clumping), unlike the wild-type H99 and the reconstituted strain (ΔPLB1rec) (see Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, ΔPLB1 was more sensitive to SDS and Congo Red (Fig. 6C) but not to 0.5 mg/ml caffeine (not shown). As the capsule of C. neoformans is anchored to cell wall components (31Reese A.J. Doering T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and was reduced in density in a PKC-defective strain of C. neoformans with a cell wall integrity defect (32Heung L.J. Kaiser A.E. Luberto C. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28547-28555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the capsule densities of cells from H99 wild type, ΔPLB1, and ΔPLB1rec were compared using transmission electron microscopy (see supplemental information). Cells from ΔPLB1 colonies had capsules of a lower density than cells from H99 wild type and ΔPLB1rec. However, the diameter of the capsule and cell wall, relative to the diameter of the cell, was similar in all three strains (p = 0.7242 and p = 0.0932, respectively, by nonparametric Mann-Whitney two-tailed analysis). Effect of Temperature Stress on Plb1 Distribution—Cell wall-associated Plb1 was increased at least 3-fold under conditions of heat stress (30-37 °C), with a concomitant decrease in secreted protein (Fig. 7). Plb1 in cell membranes also decreased with increasing temperature, with a concomitant increase in cytoplasmic Plb1 (Fig. 7). Total Plb1 protein produced at each temperature (25, 30, and 37 °C), remained constant (∼65,500, 53,500, and 80,000 density units, respectively). We also measured the effect of temperature on secreted Plb1 activity, by radiometric assay (Fig. 8). Despite the reduced amount of Plb1 protein secreted at 30-37 °C, the LPL specific activity (and total activity (not shown)), increased 3-fold at 30 °C compared with 25 °C and decreased slightly when the temperature was increased from 30 to 37 °C, suggesting that Plb1 is more active at higher temperatures. Similar results were obtained for LPTA (not shown). PLB activity was below the level of detection. The pathogenic potential of fungi such as C. neoformans, C. albicans, and probably Aspergillus spp., depends on host factors and a fungal virulence composite that includes secreted Plb1. Using C. neoformans as a model pathogen, this study provides the first demonstration that Plb1 contributes to fungal survival by maintaining integrity of the cell wall and that the cell wall is a source of secreted enzyme. The localization of Plb1 in both the membrane and cell wall was shown to depend on the presence of a GPI anchor and was influenced by temperature stress. We first confirmed predictions from motif scanning programs that cryptococcal Plb1 is attached to raft membranes via such an anchor. Specifically, Plb1 was released from membranes by an exogenous (G)PI-PLC. Membrane-associated Plb1 partitioned into the hydrophobic phase of TX-114 and was converted from a hydrophobic to a soluble form following enzymatic cleavage with (G)PI-PLC. The virulence determinant, SOD, was used as a specificity control. Like Plb1, it is found in membrane rafts (7Siafakas A.R. Wright L.C. Sorrell T.C. Djordjevic J.T. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but does not contain a secretory leader peptide or a GPI anchor attachment motif. As predicted, SOD was not released by (G)PI-PLC. Inhibition of GPI anchor formation by the terpenoid lactone, YW3548, inhibited transport of Plb1 to, and its release from, the cell surface, indicating that GPI anchor formation is an essential prerequisite for cellular export and release of Plb1. Cellular export of laccase, another virulence determinant that localizes in the cell wall, but which lacks the motifs that predict acquisition of a GPI anchor, was not affected by incubation with YW3548. Approximately half of the Plb1 recovered from the cell wall fraction of C. neoformans was released by high-salt washing and the remainder, by enzymatic digestion with β-1,3 glucanase. Only the latter fraction contained β-1,6-linked glucan, a sugar linkage that is unique to the fungal cell wall, indicating that there is a covalent association between Plb1 and cell wall β-1,6-linked glucan via either a mannose sugar within the Plb1 GPI anchor or an amino acid in the Plb1 C terminus (14Muller G. Gross E. Wied S. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 442-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fujii T. Shimoi H. Iimura Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The source of the non-covalently bound Plb1, which lacked the β-1,6-linked glucan, is presumably the cell membrane. Endogenous (G)PI-PLC activity has been associated with the release of GPI-anchored proteins from S. cerevisiae protoplasts (14Muller G. Gross E. Wied S. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 442-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of β-1,6-linked glucan on naturally secreted Plb1 implicates endogenous β-glucanases in the release of Plb1 from the cell wall. Furthermore, β-1,3 glucanase activity has been detected in cryptococcal secretions (34Macekova D. Farkas V. Kishida E. Takeo K. J. Basic Microbiol. 2006; 46: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and four putative endo-β-1,3 glucanase genes are present in the cryptococcal genome data base (35Levitz S.M. Specht C.A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The product of one gene (CNBC2400), is present in cryptococcal cell walls (36Eigenheer R.A. Jin Lee Y. Blumwald E. Phinney B.S. Gelli A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2007; 7: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the remaining three are predicted to be GPI-anchored (35Levitz S.M. Specht C.A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no β-1,6 glucanase genes or activity have been found, suggesting that Plb1 is linked via β-1,6-linked glucan to β-1,3-linked glucan in the central scaffold of the cell wall and that endogenous β-1,3 glucanases are responsible for its secretion. Deletion of cryptococcal PLB1 compromised cell wall integrity of C. neoformans. This was demonstrated by increased sensitivity of ΔPLB1 to SDS, a detergent and protein destabilizer (24Banks I.R. Specht C.A. Donlin M.J. Gerik K.J. Levitz S.M. Lodge J.K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and to Congo Red, which binds to β-glucans and interferes with cell wall construction (29Ram A.F. Klis F.M. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Growth of ΔPLB1 was unaffected by caffeine. In S. cerevisiae, caffeine inhibits rapamycin-sensitive Tor1 kinase, activating the Pkc1p-Mpk1p cell wall integrity cascade and producing a fortified cell wall with increased resistance to zymolyases (30Kuranda K. Leberre V. Sokol S. Palamarczyk G. Francois J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1147-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The resistance of ΔPLB1 to caffeine suggests that neither PLB1 nor its breakdown products affect the cell wall integrity pathway downstream of Tor1 kinase. Taken together, these findings suggest that the role of Plb1 in cell wall integrity is structural and independent of its enzyme activities and that it relates to the control of cell wall porosity, as reported previously for cell wall-associated mannoproteins (21de Nobel J.G. Klis F.M. Priem J. Munnik T. van den Ende H. Yeast. 1990; 6: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A second novel function of cell wall-associated Plb1 may be to release protein cargo transported across cell walls inside membrane-bound vesicles. Rodriguez et al. (37Rodrigues M.L. Nimrichter L.

The amount of Plb1 in the cell wall increased, and that in cell membranes and secretions decreased, as the growth temperature rose from 25 to 30-37 °C. Because increasing temperature would reduce cell wall stability (38Kraus P.R. Fox D.S. Cox G.M. Heitman J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the temperature-dependent association between Plb1 and the cell wall supports its role in cell wall integrity. This suggests that Plb1 has a role in defense of C. neoformans against temperature stress in the natural environment and the human host. We postulate that release of Plb1 from cell membranes at higher temperatures is stimulated by increased activity of GPI anchor-cleaving enzymes which increases transport of Plb1 to the cell wall, where β-glucanase expression and/or activity, and hence Plb1 release to the exterior, are suppressed. It is noteworthy that although less Plb1 protein was secreted at 30-37 °C, its specific activity was greater than that secreted during culture at 25 °C. This may provide a compensatory mechanism, which allows Plb1 to provide a dual function at host physiological temperature, namely to maintain cell wall integrity and hence survival in the host, while at the same time facilitating invasion of host tissue. In conclusion, we have identified a novel pool of Plb1 in the cell wall which can serve as a source of secreted enzyme thereby promoting invasion of host tissue. The biological functions of Plb1 in the cryptococcal cell now include not only a role in membrane homeostasis and turnover but also maintenance of cell wall integrity and hence survival, especially during heat stress. These findings open up a new area of investigation into mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis. We thank Stephen Schibeci and Prof. Gwendolyn Gilbert for critically reviewing this manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2041648250,"Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is a critical DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway required to maintain genome stability. Many prokaryotes possess a minimalist NHEJ apparatus required to repair DSBs during stationary phase, composed of two conserved core proteins, Ku and ligase D (LigD). The crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase domain of LigD mediating the synapsis of two noncomplementary DNA ends revealed a variety of interactions, including microhomology base pairing, mismatched and flipped-out bases, and 3′ termini forming hairpin-like ends. Biochemical and biophysical studies confirmed that polymerase-induced end synapsis also occurs in solution. We propose that this DNA synaptic structure reflects an intermediate bridging stage of the NHEJ process, before end processing and ligation, with both the polymerase and the DNA sequence playing pivotal roles in determining the sequential order of synapsis and remodeling before end joining."
https://openalex.org/W2049979794,"Plants encounter a variety of environmental stresses that affect their cellular machinery and that they adapt to on a daily basis. Lipid peroxidation is one consequence, at the cellular level, of such stresses and yields cytotoxic lipid aldehydes, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), that react with specific sites in proteins, leading to diverse changes in protein function and/or stability. We have assessed the sensitivity of plant mitochondrial proteins to HNE modification, using one-dimensional and two-dimensional denaturing PAGE and blue native-PAGE coupled to immunological detection and tandem mass spectrometry identification. A select range of proteins was modified by exogenous application of HNE to mitochondria isolated from Arabidopsis cell cultures. These included a number of proteins that directly interact with the ubiquinone pool, as well as a number of soluble matrix proteins. Mitochondria isolated from cell cultures following hydrogen peroxide, antimycin A, or menadione treatment had significantly reduced respiratory capacity and elevated levels of HNE adduction to specific subsets of proteins. Targets identified included the proteins affected by direct application of HNE but also some new proteins, including a number of matrix dehydrogenases, the inner membrane adenine nucleotide translocator, and the outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel. Degradation products of some proteins were also found to be HNE adducted, suggesting a link between HNE adduction and protein turnover. Some of the major enzyme complexes that were HNE adducted did not show demonstrable changes in their maximal activity measured with artificial acceptors, but changes did occur in associations between respiratory chain complexes following stress treatments.

These aldehydes are cytotoxic, generally more stable than ROS, and can cause extensive damage to proteins and other cellular constituents. HNE is the most abundant and toxic aldehyde generated through ROS-mediated peroxidation of abundant lipids in plants such as linoleic acid (1Schneider C. Tallman K.A. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol.

HNE has been shown to form Michael adducts via this C-3 atom with the sulfhydryl group of Cys residues, the imidazole group of His residues, and the ϵ-amino group of Lys residues on a large number of proteins (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Recently it has been proposed that HNE can also modify Arg residues of proteins (4Isom A.L. Barnes S. Wilson L. Kirk M. Coward L. Darley-Usmar V. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1136-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to Michael adduct formation, Lys residues also form Schiff bases and pentylpyrrole adducts with HNE via the C-1 aldehyde group (5Sayre L.M. Arora P.K. Iyer R.S. Salomon R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). HNE has also been shown to react via the C-3 position with the sulfhydryl groups of lipoic acid moieties on proteins (6Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Modification of proteins by HNE has the potential to have serious detrimental effects in a cell because of modification of amino acids and the potential to form cross-links in proteins (1Schneider C.

Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that not all modifications by HNE are detrimental or have a measurable effect on function. For example, increasing modification of KGDC by HNE in aged rat mitochondria leads to an increase in activity that correlated with a lowered Km value of the enzyme for α-ketoglutarate (14Moreau R. Heath S.H. Doneanu C.E. Lindsay J.G. Hagen T.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, HNE has been shown to activate uncoupling protein function in plant and animal mitochondria by an undefined mechanism (18Smith A.M. Ratcliffe R.G. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51944-51952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Plant mitochondria are known to respond to oxidative stress by the induction of respiratory bypasses of the phosphorylating respiratory chain (19Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), as well as the induction of antioxidant defenses such as the ascorbate/glutathione pathway (20Chew O. Whelan J. Millar A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46869-46877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and a specific mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (21Sweetlove L.J.

We have previously shown during oxidative stress in Arabidopsis (21Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and environmental stress in pea (23Taylor N.L. Heazlewood J.L. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1122-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that, in addition to these defense responses, specific mitochondrial proteins are degraded under oxidative stress by an unknown pathway. In both cases this degradation was coincident with the loss of lipoic acid cofactors of decarboxylating dehydrogenases, which we had previously linked in potato mitochondria to modification by the lipid peroxidation product HNE (24Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have also shown in a detailed investigation of the impact of HNE on respiratory chain terminal oxidase function in plants that the stress-responsive nonphosphorylating alternative oxidase was much more sensitive to HNE inhibition than the cytochrome pathway (25Winger A.M. Millar A.H. Day D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In that study, a combination of lipid peroxidation assays and the use of antibodies to HNE adducts revealed that hydroxyalkenals (HAEs) are produced in a dark-grown Arabidopsis cell culture model in response to H2O2, antimycin A, or menadione and that this led to an array of HNE-modified protein bands appearing in isolated mitochondrial samples (25Winger A.M. Millar A.H. Day D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we have undertaken a more systematic analysis of the targets of HNE in plant mitochondria using antibodies to HNE and mass spectrometry analysis to identify the targets and to determine whether there are links between HNE adduction and mitochondrial response to, or damage by, oxidative stress. Arabidopsis Cell Culture and Mitochondria Isolation—A heterotrophic Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture, established from callus of ecotype Lansberg erecta stem explants, was cultured in Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture (Phyto-Technology Laboratories) supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (w/v) naphthaleneacetic acid, and 0.005% (w/v) kinetin. Cell cultures (120 ml) were maintained in 100 μmol m–2 s–1 light at 22 °C with shaking (120 rpm). At 7 days, cells (20 ml) were subcultured into 100 ml of fresh media. Cell cultures used for experimental analysis in this work were maintained in the dark with shaking (120 rpm) following subculture. Mitochondria were purified from 7-day-old Arabidopsis cell cultures as described previously (26Millar A.H. Liddell A. Leaver C.J. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 53-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNE Treatment of Isolated Mitochondria and Oxidative Stress Treatments of Cells—Cells from 7-day-old dark-grown Arabidopsis cell cultures were treated with 88 mm H2O2 (prepared in water by Asia Pacific Specialty Chemicals, Seven Hills, New South Wales, Australia), 25 μm antimycin A (prepared in ethanol), or 400 μm menadione (prepared in ethanol). Isolated mitochondria were incubated with indicated concentrations of HNE for 20 min at 25 °C with shaking (800 rpm). HNE treatment of mitochondria subsequently analyzed by oxygen electrode was carried out by incubation of HNE with 200–300 μgof mitochondrial protein in 250 μl of oxygen electrode reaction medium in the oxygen electrode chamber at 25 °C. Measurement of Oxygen Consumption—All oxygen consumption measurements were performed using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech, UK) attached to a personal computer. Calibration of the electrode was carried out by setting 100% to the current recorded in air-saturated water at 22 or 25 °C and by setting 0% to the current recorded after addition of sodium dithionite to the water to remove all oxygen in the electrode chamber. Various substrate, inhibitor, and effector standard additions are made as required. Arabidopsis cell culture (300 μl) was suspended in cell culture media to give a final volume of 1 ml. Total respiration of intact cells was measured at 22 °C following the addition of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (4 μm). Respiration through the alternative pathway or the cytochrome pathway in intact cells was measured following the additions of 1 mm KCN or 1 mm n-PG, respectively. Isolated mitochondria (200–300 μg of protein) were suspended in 1 ml of oxygen electrode reaction medium (0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm TES, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) at 25 °C. Total isolated mitochondrial respiration was measured at 25 °C in the presence of various substrates as follows: for succinate-dependent respiration, succinate (10 mm) and ATP (0.5 mm); for malate plus glutamate-dependent respiration, malate (10 mm), glutamate (10 mm), thiamine pyrophosphate (0.2 mm), NAD (2 mm) and coenzyme A (12 μm). Respiration via the alternative pathway by isolated mitochondria was measured in the presence of the complex III inhibitor myxothiazol (2.5 μm), the reductant dithiothreitol (5 mm), and the AOX activator pyruvate (5 mm). Respiration via the cytochrome pathway was measured in the presence of the AOX inhibitor n-PG (0.5 mm). Protein Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis gels were either stained with colloidal Coomassie or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. IEF/SDS-PAGE was performed using immobilized pH gradient strips (Immobiline DryStrips, GE Healthcare) of pH range 3–10NL (nonlinear; 18 cm) or 4–7 (linear; 24 cm). Proteins were precipitated by addition of acetone to samples to a final concentration of 90% acetone. Samples were placed at –20 °C overnight to allow precipitation of proteins. Precipitates were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 20 min and solubilized in either 350 μl (3–10NL) or 450 μl (4–7 linear) of IEF sample buffer (6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (w/v) IPG buffer pH 3–10NL or pH 4–7). 2 μl (3–10NL), or 2.6 μl (4–7 linear) of tributylphosphine (1:9 in IEF sample buffer) was added to each sample. Samples were then used to rehydrate either pH 3–10NL DryStrips, or pH 4–7 DryStrips overnight at room temperature. Isoelectric focusing was performed using a flatbed electrophoresis unit (Multiphor II, GE Healthcare) at 20 °C. Following isoelectric focusing, strips were removed and incubated for 50 min in IEF/SDS-PAGE transfer buffer (4 m urea, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, trace bromphenol blue, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8). The second SDS-PAGE dimensions were run by placing the strips on top of 1-mm thick (25 × 18 cm) polyacrylamide gels (Ettan, Dalt 6, GE Healthcare) and following standard procedures. Blue native-PAGE was performed based on the method by Schägger and von Jagow (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial samples (500 μg) were pelleted at 18,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in BN solubilization buffer with digitonin (150 mm acetate, 10% glycerol, 5% (w/v) digitonin, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 10 μl per 100 μg of protein to solubilized the membranes. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 18,300 × g for 10 min to remove unsolubilized material. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube containing 5% Serva Blue G at 1 μl per 20 μl of solubilization buffer. The first dimension separation was performed on 1.5-mm thick (16 × 11 cm) polyacrylamide gels using the Protean II system (Bio-Rad). The gel consisted of a stacking layer (0.25 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 4% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide (33:1), 0.05% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, 0.1% (v/v) TEMED, 25 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0), and a gradient separating layer (0.25 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 4.5–16% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide (33:1), 0.05% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, 0.1% (v/v) TEMED, 25 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The gels were run with a cathode buffer (50 mm Tricine, 0.02% (w/v) Coomassie 250G, 15 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0) in the upper chamber and an anode buffer in the lower chamber (50 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0) of the gel tank. The gel was run initially at a constant voltage of 100 V for 45 min and thereafter with a constant current of 15 mA per gel, with voltage limited at 500 V, for 10 h. Gel runs containing samples used for in-gel assay analysis were paused after 3 h of electrophoresis, and the upper cathode buffer was exchanged for cathode buffer minus Coomassie to allow for a clearer background on the gel. Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie, prepared for in-gel enzymatic analysis, or prepared for second dimension SDS-PAGE. Enzyme Assays and In-gel Activity Staining—All assays were performed with mitochondrial samples ruptured by freeze/thaw thus allowing direct access of substrates to both sides of the inner membrane. Succinate dehydrogenase (complex II of the respiratory chain) was measured using a protocol modified from Singer et al. (29Singer T.P. Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 616-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 200 μg of protein was added to 1 ml of succinate dehydrogenase reaction mixture (60 μm 2,6-dichlorophenylindophenol, 0.03% (w/v) phenazine methosulfate, 1 mm KCN, 1 mm n-PG, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.6). The reaction was started by the addition of 40 mm succinate to the mixture. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was measured as DCPIP reduction at 600 nm. Calculation of amount of DCPIP reduced was performed using ϵ = 15.7 mm–1 cm–1. In-gel measurement of complex I activity was performed based on the method described in Zerbetto et al. (30Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Following blue native separation of mitochondrial protein, gels were washed four times for 5 min each with double distilled H2O and incubated in 50 ml per five lanes of NADH DH assay mixture (0.14 mm NADH, 1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) until the stained complex was visible (10 min to 1 h). The reaction was stopped by rinsing the gel in water and transferring the gel to fixing solution (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid). NADH and deamino-NADH to FeCN [Fe(CN)3–6] was measured spectrophotometrically as NADH oxidation at 340 nm using ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 (31Menz R.I. Griffith M. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and malate dehydrogenase were measured spectrophotometrically following NADH reduction and oxidation, respectively, at 340 nm using ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 (24Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Immunodetection—Proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to Hybond™-C extra nitrocellulose blotting membrane according to the method of Towbin et al. (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) using a Hoefer SemiPhor (GE Healthcare) transfer system using standard procedures. Following Western blotting, the membrane was incubated in 1% blocking solution (Roche Applied Science), either for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker or overnight at 4 °C without rocking, to block nonspecific binding of the antibody. Following a brief rinse in TBS/Tween, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal HNE adduct antibodies (HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostics International Inc.) at 1:2000 dilution overnight at 4 °C, with gentle rocking. The membrane was washed by three quick rinses, a 15-min and two 5-min washes with TBS/Tween, incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) in 1% Western blocking reagent for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The membrane was washed as before and detected using the BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD) kit (Roche Applied Science). Images of the membranes were obtained using a LAS 1000 CCD camera and ImageGauge software (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Peptide Extraction from Gels—Gel spots of interest were excised from colloidal Coomassie-stained diagonal PAGE or two-dimensional gels, placed into wells of 96-well PCR plates and frozen at –80 °C until analyzed. Gel spots were thawed and destained twice with de-stain solution (50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 10 mm NH4HCO3) for 45 min each time on an orbital shaker. Gel spots were then dried at 50 °C for 1 h and digested overnight with digestion solution (12.5 μg/ml trypsin, 10 mm NH4HCO3, 0.00125% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted by incubation with 12 μl of 100% acetonitrile for 15 min on an orbital shaker. The supernatant from each sample was placed into a clean well of a new 96-well PCR plate. Each gel spot was incubated further with 10 μl of a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid for 15 min with shaking. The supernatant was taken and placed with the previously extracted supernatant, and the previous 15-min incubation was repeated. Samples were dried down in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 15 μl of resuspension solution (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) immediately prior to mass spectrometry. Samples were analyzed using either an Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar i LC/MS/MS system or an XCT Ultra (three-dimensional ion trap) from Agilent Technologies. Protein Identification by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Samples from HNE-treated isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1) were analyzed using an Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system and an Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar i LC/MS/MS system equipped with the IonSpray source running Analyst QS software (version 1.1) with the instrument in positive ion mode. Each extracted peptide sample was loaded in turn with the Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system onto a 0.5 × 50 mm C18 (5 μm, 100 Å) reverse phase column (Higgins Analytical) with a C18 OPTI-GUARD guard column (Optimize Technologies) at 16 μl/min equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were eluted from the C18 reverse phase column into the QSTAR Pulsar i by a 7-min acetonitrile gradient (5–80%) at 16 μl/min under constant formic acid concentrations of 0.1%. During the period of ion detection, eluted peptides were analyzed by the mass spectrometer at 8 μl/min. The method used to analyze eluted ions employed the information-dependent acquisition capabilities of Analyst QS and the rolling collision energy feature for automated collision energy determination based on the ions m/z (Sciex/AB). The method employed a 1-s time of flight-MS scan, which automatically switched (using information-dependent acquisition) to a 2-s product ion scan (MS/MS) when a target ion reached an intensity of greater than 30 counts, and its charge state was identified as 2+, 3+, or 4+. Time of flight-MS scanning was undertaken in the m/z range of 400–1600 m/z using a Q2 transmission window of 380 atomic mass units (100%). Samples analyzed from oxidative stress-treated samples (Figs. 4 and 5; supplemental Tables S2 and S3) used an Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system and an Agilent Technologies XCT Ultra IonTrap equipped with an ESI source equipped with a low flow nebulizer in positive mode controlled by Chemstation (revision B.01.03, build 204, Agilent Technologies) and MSD Trap Control version 6.0 Build 38.15 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH). Each extracted peptide sample was loaded in turn with the Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system onto a 0.5 × 50-mm C18 (5 μm, 100 Å; Varian) h"

The outer membrane of nontypeable H. influenzae is dominated by lipooligosaccharides (LOS), many of which incorporate sialic acid as a terminal nonreducing sugar. Sialic acid has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the survival of the bacteria within the host environment. H. influenzae is incapable of synthesizing sialic acid and is dependent on scavenging free sialic acid from the host environment. To achieve this, H. influenzae utilizes a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter. In this study, we characterize the binding site of the extracytoplasmic solute receptor (SiaP) from nontypeable H. influenzae strain 2019. A crystal structure of N-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-bound SiaP was determined to 1.4Å resolution. Thermodynamic characterization of Neu5Ac binding shows this interaction is enthalpically driven with a substantial unfavorable contribution from entropy. This is expected because the binding of SiaP to Neu5Ac is mediated by numerous hydrogen bonds and has several buried water molecules. Point mutations targeting specific amino acids were introduced in the putative binding site. Complementation with the mutated siaP constructs resulted either in full, partial, or no complementation, depending on the role of specific residues. Mass spectrometry analysis of the O-deacylated LOS of the R127K point mutation confirmed the observation of reduced incorporation of Neu5Ac into the LOS. The decreased ability of H. influenzae to import sialic acid had negative effects on resistance to complement-mediated killing and viability of biofilms in vitro, confirming the importance of sialic acid transport to the bacterium.

Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative bacterium and a mucosal pathogen in humans. Strains can be encapsulated or nonencapsulated (nontypeable; NTHi). Encapsulated strains can cause meningitis and septicemia, whereas nontypeable strains commonly cause various local mucosal infections, including otitis media and bronchitis. The outer membrane of NTHi is exposed to a challenging environment in humans, and thus components of the outer membrane have undergone extensive study in an attempt to understand how this bacterium evades the host immune response. A major outer membrane component of NTHi is lipooligosaccharide (LOS). 4The abbreviations used are:LOSlipooligosaccharideO-LOSO-deacylated LOSTRAPtripartite ATP-independent periplasmicELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayMALDI-LIT-MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-linear ion trap instrument-mass spectrometryCFUcolony-forming unitsPBSphosphate-buffered salineITCisothermal titration calorimetryMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidESRextracytoplasmic solute-binding receptorKDOketodeoxyoctanoateNeu5AcN-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid. 4The abbreviations used are:LOSlipooligosaccharideO-LOSO-deacylated LOSTRAPtripartite ATP-independent periplasmicELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayMALDI-LIT-MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-linear ion trap instrument-mass spectrometryCFUcolony-forming unitsPBSphosphate-buffered salineITCisothermal titration calorimetryMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidESRextracytoplasmic solute-binding receptorKDOketodeoxyoctanoateNeu5AcN-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid. These complex glycolipids were demonstrated to play a role in microbial virulence and pathogenicity (1Rao V.K. Krasan G.P. Hendrixson D.R. Dawid S. St. Geme III, J.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). LOS contains carbohydrate epitopes that mimic human glycosphingolipids, allowing the bacteria to evade the host immune response (2Mandrell R.E. McLaughlin R. Aba Kwaik Y. Lesse A. Yamasaki R. Gibson B. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LOS of NTHi is a heterogeneous mixture of glycoforms (3Masoud H. Moxon E.R. Martin A.

Sialic acid (N-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)) can be incorporated into the LOS as a terminal nonreducing sugar, protecting the bacterium from complement-mediated killing by normal human serum (6Hood D.W.

The precise structures of many of these sialylated LOS glycoforms have yet to be fully elucidated (10Jones P.A. Samuels N.M. Phillips N.J. Munson Jr., R.S. Bozue J.A. Arseneau J.A. Nichols W.A.

The donor for this transfer is CMP-sialic acid, which is synthesized from CTP, and sialic acid by SiaB, the CMP-sialic acid synthetase (6Hood D.W. Makepeace K. Deadman M.E. Rest R.F. Thibault P. Martin A. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Sialic acid is also incorporated into the biofilm matrix (11Greiner L.L. Watanabe H.

Immun. 2004; 72: 4249-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and is important for the long term viability of cells within the biofilm (12Allen S. Zaleski A. Johnston J.W. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5291-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Aside from incorporation into LOS, sialic acid can be utilized as a carbon and nitrogen source by the bacteria, the first step of which is mediated by neuraminyl lyase (NanA) (13Vimr E. Lichtensteiger C. Steenbergen S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As H. influenzae is not capable of synthesizing sialic acid; the bacteria depend on transport of exogenous sources. It was recently elucidated that NTHi uses a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter to import sialic acid. This transporter consists of two distinct integral membrane components that are fused in NTHi, SiaT (12Allen S. Zaleski A. Johnston J.W. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5291-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (also known as SiaQM (14Severi E. Randle G. Kivlin P. Whitfield K. Young R. Moxon R. Kelly D. Hood D. Thomas G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1173-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) and an extracytoplasmic solute receptor, SiaP, which binds sialic acid with high affinity. A previous study of SiaP was carried out with the unencapsulated serotype d laboratory strain Rd (14Severi E. Randle G. Kivlin P. Whitfield K. Young R. Moxon R. Kelly D. Hood D. Thomas G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1173-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and its structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (15Muller A. Severi E. Mulligan C. Watts A.G. Kelly D.J. Wilson K.S. Wilkinson A.J. Thomas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22212-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SiaP belongs to the periplasmic binding protein type II superfamily of α/β proteins. This family includes several of the sugar transport-binding proteins. The overall structure is similar to the one reported by Muller et al. (15Muller A. Severi E. Mulligan C. Watts A.G. Kelly D.J. Wilson K.S. Wilkinson A.J. Thomas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22212-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is a two-domain protein, and the ligand binds inbetween the two domains. In this study, the binding site of SiaP from the pathogenic NTHi strain 2019 is characterized, and the mechanism of Neu5Ac binding is elucidated. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Stains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise stated, Escherichia coli was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with or without agar (2.0%) and supplemented with antibiotics as needed.

This fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), creating pCR146. Sequencing and comparison with the H. influenzae Rd KW-20 genome confirmed the fragment contained HI0146. The 1,268-bp SmaI fragment from pBSL86 (16Alexeyev, M. F. (1995) BioTechniques 18, 52, 54, and 56Google Scholar) containing the kanamycin resistance gene nptII was ligated into the PacI site of pCR146 that had been blunt-ended and phosphatase-treated. This plasmid was designated pCR146Kn. The correct orientation and structure of the construct was confirmed by sequencing. NTHi 2019 and NTHi 2019siaT were transformed with uncut plasmid pCR146Kn. Mutants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The resulting mutants, NTHi 2019siaP and 2019siaPsiaT, were used for subsequent analysis. Complementation of the NTHi 2019siaP Mutant—The open reading frame HI0601.1 contains an authentic frameshift in the NTHi 2019 genome (17Johnston J.W. Zaleski A. Allen S. Mootz J.M. Armbruster D. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Munson R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 26-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We used this region to insert a copy of siaP to complement the 2019siaP mutant as described previously (17Johnston J.W. Zaleski A. Allen S. Mootz J.M. Armbruster D. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Munson R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 26-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PCR was used to amplify a 1,023-bp fragment containing the siaP open reading frame from NTHi 2019 genomic DNA using primers 146C-1 and 146C-2. The PCR fragment was digested with SmaI and ligated into the SmaI site of p601.1-Sp2, creating p601.1Sp-146. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. NTHi 2019siaP was transformed with plasmid p601.1-Sp-146, and transformants were selected on sBHI agar with 15 μg/ml ribostamycin and 25 μg/ml spectinomycin. Southern analysis was used to confirm the correct construction of the mutants. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced into siaP using the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). Primers were designed from the sequence of siaP to produce the mutations (supplemental Table S2). Template DNA (p601.1Sp146Comp) was first methylated using DNA methylase and protocols from Invitrogen. The methylated template DNA was amplified by PCR using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Reactions were transformed into DH5α-T1RE. coli, and transformants were selected on LB agar containing 125 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin. Transformants were passed three times on selective media, and the presence of point mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. NTHi strain 2019siaP was transformed by incubation with the mutated p601.1Sp146Comp plasmid, and selection was performed using sBHI containing spectinomycin (25 μg/ml) and ribostamycin (15 μg/ml). Transformants were passed three times on selective media, and the presence of the mutation in the genome was confirmed by sequencing a cloned PCR fragment containing the siaP gene. Expression and Purification of SiaP—Plasmid pKHT101 was created by the directional ligation of a blunt-end PCR fragment amplified from NTHi strain 2019 genomic DNA with primers HI0146F1 and HI0146R1 to linearized pBAD102/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cloning into and expression from pBAD102/D-TOPO results in a protein with an N-terminal thioredoxin tag and a C-terminal 6× histidine tag. The ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). Transformants were screened, and DNA sequencing was used to confirm the construct. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C and 225 rpm in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At mid-log phase (A600 ∼0.5), expression of SiaP was induced with 0.002% arabinose. Four hours after induction, the culture was harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 7,280 × g and 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 45 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) per 1 liter of culture and lysed using a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 186,010 × g and 4 °C to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The resulting supernatant was mixed with TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The slurry was allowed to incubate on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 5 h and then it was transferred to a gravity column. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A with 1 m NaCl. Finally, elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) was used to elute the protein. The predominant form of the purified protein lacked the thioredoxin fusion, as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (XK 16, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. After the protein was loaded, the column was washed with 55 ml of buffer B. For elution, a linear gradient of buffer B containing 10–500 mm NaCl, with a total volume of 130 ml, was used. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. SiaP eluted between 200 and 250 mm NaCl. This purification step allowed for the removal of the thioredoxin-fused protein form. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Diffraction quality crystals were grown at 4 °C using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method from drops consisting of a mixture of equal volumes of protein solution (37 mg/ml SiaP in 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Neu5Ac, pH 8.0) and reservoir solution (100 mm MES, 30% w/v PEG 6000, pH 6.0; Qiagen). SiaP crystals were flash-frozen in mother liquor containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals were mounted in loops for data collection at 100 K from the GM/CA CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL. The data were collected on a MAR-CCD detector with a crystal to detector distance of 250 mm. The data were processed and scaled using D*trek (18Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northhampton, MA). Protein concentration was determined in 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride by measuring the A280 and using an extinction coefficient of 20,480 m–1 cm–1. Titrations were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with 10 mm NaCl. The concentrations of SiaP and Neu5Ac varied among titrations, and each binding experiment was repeated 1–2 times. The nonspecific heat released by the dilution of both the sugar and the protein was calculated by averaging the heat liberated during the last 3–5 injections. This value was then subtracted from the raw heat released during each injections. To derive the value of stoichiometry, the data sets were analyzed using a single-site binding model from the ORIGIN ITC analysis software (Microcal). In this analysis the values for stoichiometry, change in enthalpy (ΔH), and affinity were fit using nonlinear least squares analysis. To derive the values for affinity and ΔH, data sets were globally analyzed using the single-site binding model in the program SEDPHAT (23Dam J. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 651-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this analysis, the value for stoichiometry was fixed at 1:1, whereas ΔH and affinity were fit using nonlinear least squares analysis. Errors for affinity and ΔH derived from the global analysis were calculated using the Monte-Carlo analysis software built into SEDPHAT. The values for the change in entropy (TΔS) were calculated from the globally derived values of affinity and ΔH using Gibb's free energy equation ΔG0 =–RTlnKa =ΔH-TΔS, where ΔG0 is Gibb's free energy; R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature of the binding reaction. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Bacteria were grown on sBHI agar plates containing 100 μm Neu5Ac. Cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS (20 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) at an A600 of 0.15. The wells of Costar 3590 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Corning Glass) were filled with 100 μl of the bacterial suspension, and six wells for each strain were tested. The plates were dried at 40 °C overnight. The plates were washed four times with 72 mm sodium acetate, 165 mm sodium chloride, 0.55% Tween 20 using an ELx50 Auto Strip Washer (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). A neuraminidase digest was performed on three of the wells from each strain by adding 100 μl of 0.5 unit/ml neuraminidase (Roche Diagnostics) diluted in neuraminidase buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 154 mm NaCl, 9 mm CaCl2, 25 μg/ml human serum albumin, pH 5.6). The other three wells received 100 μl of the buffer alone. The plate was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, and the wells were washed. The monoclonal antibody 3F11, diluted 1:250 in TBST (10 mm Tris, 165 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, pH 7.4), was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature overnight (∼18 h) followed by a wash. The secondary antibody, phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), diluted 1:2000 in TBST, was added. Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (1.0 mg/ml; Sigma) in 8.2% diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8 was added. When yellow color had developed, the A405 was read using a Microplate Autoreader EL311 (BioTek Instruments). The mean for each strain was converted to a ratio of A405 with neuraminidase treatment divided by A405 without neuraminidase. Purification and Preparation of O-Deacylated LOS and Neuraminidase Treatment—LOS was purified from plate-grown bacteria as described previously (12Allen S. Zaleski A. Johnston J.W. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5291-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To make the LOS more amenable for mass spectrometric analysis, O-linked fatty acids were removed from the lipid A moiety as described previously (24Gibson B.W. Engstrom J.J. John C.M. Hines W. Falick A.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 645-658Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The highly purified LOS (∼0.1 mg) was incubated in anhydrous hydrazine (50 μl; Sigma) at 37 °C for 35 min with mixing every 10 min. Samples were cooled on ice prior to and after the addition of ice-cold acetone (250 μl; Sigma) then transferred to –20 °C for 2 h. The quenched reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted O-deacylated LOS (O-LOS) was dissolved in MilliQ H2O (50 μl) and evaporated with a speed vacuum system. To remove salts and other low molecular weight contaminants, the O-LOS (∼20–30 μg) was suspended on a nitrocellulose membrane (type VS, 0.025 μm; Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) over water for ∼1 h. The desalted O-LOS was removed from the membrane, concentrated with a speed vacuum system, and analyzed by mass spectrometry on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-linear ion trap instrument-mass spectrometry (MALDI-LIT-MS). For removal of Neu5Ac, the O-LOS (∼20–30 μg) was digested in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, containing immobilized neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (type VI; Sigma) for 20 h at 30 °C with shaking. The enzyme was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant (∼15 μl) was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for drop dialysis. The desialylated O-LOS was concentrated and analyzed by MALDI-LIT-MS. Mass Spectrometry of O-LOS—Aliquots of O-LOS were desalted by mixing with Dowex 50 beads (100–200 mesh, NH+4 form; Bio-Rad) prior to mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric data were collected on a Finnigan™ LTQ™ linear ion trap mass spectrometer coupled to a vMALDI ion source (Thermo-Electron, San Jose, CA). Aliquots of the O-LOS (0.5 μl) were spotted onto a 96-well stainless steel sample plate and allowed to dry. Dried samples were overlaid with 0.5 μl of 50 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) in 50% acetonitrile. Data were collected in negative ion mode over two mass ranges: m/z 800–4000 and 2000–4000. Tandem MS data were collected in negative mode to confirm sialylation, using a precursor isolation width of 3 m/z, normalized collision energy of 40% (RF amplitude in percent used for fragment ions), activation Q of 0.25, and an activation of 30 ms. All spectra were recorded using automatic gain control to control the number"
https://openalex.org/W2053995411,"The insect cytokine paralytic peptide (PP) induces muscle contraction in silkworm larvae. Here we demonstrate that bacterial and fungal cell wall components peptidoglycan and glucan stimulate muscle contraction via activation of PP in the hemolymph. Anti-PP antibody suppressed the muscle contraction induced by PP, peptidoglycan, or glucan. The contraction was also inhibited by free radical scavengers and serine protease inhibitors. Moreover, injecting live silkworms with peptidoglycan or glucan generated the active form of PP. The active form of PP was also produced in vitro when peptidoglycan or glucan was incubated with hemolymph containing the PP precursor. Generation of the active form of PP was suppressed by free radical scavengers and serine protease inhibitors. Furthermore, PP activation in isolated hemolymph was inhibited by potassium cyanide, suggesting that cellular activity is involved. Stimulation by peptidoglycan promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species by silkworm hemocytes. The addition of either the active form of PP or anti-PP antibody to Staphylococcus aureus injected into silkworm larvae delayed or enhanced, respectively, the killing effect of S. aureus, suggesting that activated PP contributes to host resistance to infectious pathogens. These findings suggest that immunologic stimulants such as peptidoglycan or glucan induce reactive oxygen species production from larval hemocytes, followed by the activation of serine protease, which mediates the PP processing reaction and leads to defensive responses.

The immune system comprises a complex network of cells and molecules that protect the organism from infection. The system is divided into two categories: acquired immunity and innate immunity. Advances in immunologic research indicate that both types of immunity work closely together by inducing the secretion of cytokines (1Hoebe K. Janssen E. Beutler B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 2Jones S.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3463-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 3Luster A.D. Curr. Opin.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 3786-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The cytokine network is indispensable for self-defense, but once the system goes out of control and an excessive amount of cytokine molecules is produced, serious damage, such as sepsis, occurs in the host animal (5Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi K.S. Flavell R.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Bach J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 998: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because of the complicated nature of the cytokine network, the molecular mechanisms underlying such disorders are not yet clarified. Many features of innate immunity are conserved from vertebrates through invertebrates (8Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar, 9Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Invertebrates lack acquired immunity, so they protect themselves against invaders such as bacteria and fungi by innate immunity alone. Therefore, invertebrates are simple and convenient models to use for investigating innate immunity (10Garcia-Lara J. Needham A.J. Foster S.J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Innate immunity in invertebrates consists of humoral and cellular components (11Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Yu X.Q. Immunol.

The humoral component includes antimicrobial peptides (15Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 16Yamakawa M. Tanaka H. Dev. Comp.

Ohashi-Kobayashi A. Natori S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and melanin (19Marmaras V.J. Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the cellular component includes phagocytosis by circulating hemocytes (20Hillyer J.F. Schmidt S.L. Christensen B.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 313: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Receptors that bind to various non-self components have been characterized (21Ferrandon D. Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); pattern recognition proteins, such as peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) 2The abbreviations used are: PGRPpeptidoglycan recognition proteinβGRPβ-1,3-glucan recognition proteinPPparalytic peptideROSreactive oxygen speciesTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycineNBTnitro blue tetrazoliump-APMSFp-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride. and β-1,3-glucan recognition protein (βGRP), recognize peptidoglycan and β-1,3-glucan, respectively (22Yu X.Q. Zhu Y.F. Ma C. Fabrick J.A. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Downstream of these receptors, there are a number of protein cascades including kinases and proteases that transmit the information and induce various immunologic responses. For example, in insects, melanization begins after peptidoglycan binds to PGRP, subsequently activating the serine protease cascade, followed by the phenoloxidase-dependent synthesis of melanin and reactive quinones, which are toxic to microorganisms (23Nappi A.J. Vass E. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 24Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol.

When the host insect is injured and invaded by microorganisms, free components circulating in the hemolymph are activated and transmit information among host cells (26Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Paralytic peptide (PP) is one such molecule in the silkworm Bombyx mori. PP is a cytokine-like factor that has been purified from the hemolymph of silkworm larvae (27Ha S.D. Nagata S. Suzuki A. Kataoka H. Peptides. 1999; 20: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PP belongs to the ENF peptide family based on its similarity with the primary sequence, especially at the C-terminal domain (28Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PP is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is constitutively present in hemolymph. The active form of PP, the C-terminal 23-amino acid residue peptide, is generated from the precursor (29Kamimura M. Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa Y. Kiuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition to paralysis, PP induces morphologic changes of the plasmatocytes, a key hemocyte subtype in cellular defensive reactions (30Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Kiuchi M. Kamimura M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 52: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Generation of the active form of PP is suggested to be important for cessation of bleeding in the host and for eliminating the non-self substance. The mechanism by which PP is activated in the presence of foreign invaders, however, remains to be elucidated. It was previously reported in another lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta, that the activation of PP is mediated by serine proteases (31Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When hemolymph is exposed to atmospheric oxygen, reactive oxygen species (ROS) might be produced, resulting in the activation of serine proteases. In this study, we examined whether the stimulation of innate immunity leads to the production of ROS followed by the activation of serine proteases, which produce the active form of PP. The results demonstrated that PP processing is induced by peptidoglycan or glucan in the silkworm hemolymph and that this reaction is mediated by ROS and serine proteases. Insects—Silkworm eggs (B. mori, Hu·Yo × Tukuba·Ne) were purchased from Ehime Sanshu (Ehime, Japan). Silkworm larvae were reared on an artificial diet (Silkmate 2S, Nihon Nosan, Yokohama, Japan) at 27 °C. Muscle Contraction Assay—The measurement of muscle contraction activity using silkworm is described previously (32Sekimizu K. Larranaga J. Hamamoto H. Sekine M. Furuchi T. Katane M. Homma H. Matsuki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the heads of fifth instar silkworm larvae (3–4 g) were cut off, and the peritrophic membranes were removed. Each specimen was tied and attached to a transducer to measure isotonic contraction with a load of 27 g. Test samples were dissolved or suspended in 0.9% NaCl and injected into the body fluid of a specimen with a 1-ml syringe attached to a 27-gauge needle (Terumo, Japan). The intensity of the muscle contraction was expressed as the contraction value, calculated by measuring the maximum length of each specimen before (x cm) and after (y cm) the injection using the formula (x - y)/x. Immune stimulants, peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus, and glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The inhibitors, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, edaravone, benzamidine chloride, and p-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation, Nacalai tesque, and Wako, respectively, and the anti-PP antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthetic PP (29Kamimura M. Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa Y. Kiuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test the effects of inhibitors, 50 μl each of two samples (inhibitor and stimulant) were successively injected with an interval of 5–10 s. Detection of the Active Form of PP in the Hemolymph of Live Silkworm Larvae—The test samples (50 μl) were injected into the body fluid of fifth instar silkworm larvae (days 4–7). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the abdominal legs were cut with scissors, and hemolymph bled from the wound was collected in a 1.5-ml plastic tube. The samples were immediately heated in boiling water for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis, as described below. As a control, the active form of PP (4 kDa), which was chemically synthesized, was used. Protein samples were resolved by Tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 16.5% gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-PP antiserum diluted 1:6000 in blocking solution. For detection, the membrane was secondarily probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig from donkey (Amersham Biosciences), followed by reaction with Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and was then exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences, UK). Detection of the Active Form of PP in Vitro in Isolated Hemolymph—Hemolymph collected from cutting the abdominal legs of fifth instar silkworm larvae was incubated with test samples at 25 °C for 3 min and then boiled for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and subjected to Western blot analysis. Detection of ROS Generation from Silkworm Hemocytes—The generation of ROS was detected using a nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay as previously described (33Arumugam M. Romestand B. Torreilles J. Roch P. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 100-μl hemocyte suspension (106 cells/ml) was mixed with 100 μl of NBT solution (1.4 mm NBT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylthiourea) and incubated with phorbol myristate acetate (a stimulator of ROS production) or peptidoglycan at 25 °C for 60 min. Hemocytes were observed under a microscope to detect the formation of NBT formazan particles, a reaction product of NBT and ROS, inside the cells. For quantitative measurement of ROS production, the samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 70% methanol. The samples were further centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in an extraction solution (3 ml of 2 m KOH and 3.5 ml of Me2SO) by vigorous mixing. The samples were centrifuged at 3500 × g for 20 min, and optical density values at 630 nm were measured by a photometer. Effect of the Active Form of PP and anti-PP Antiserum on Host Resistance to Bacterial Infection—Saline, synthetic PP, anti-PP antiserum, or normal rabbit serum was filtered through a sterile 0.22-μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore) and mixed with S. aureus MSSA1 (cultured for 18 h in LB10 medium) or saline, respectively. Test samples (50 μl) were injected into the body fluid of fifth instar silkworm larvae (day 1). Infected silkworms were incubated at 27 °C, and the number of viable larvae was counted. Induction of Muscle Contraction in Silkworm Larvae by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—Previously, we reported a sepsis model using silkworm larvae by intrahemolymph injection of pathogenic bacteria and fungi (34Hamamoto H. Kurokawa K. Kaito C. Kamura K. Manitra Razanajatovo I. Kusuhara H. Santa T. Sekimizu K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Kaito C. Kurokawa K. Matsumoto Y. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). During the course of the study, we noticed that paralysis occurred after injecting the larvae with a highly concentrated culture of bacteria or fungi. Paralysis was observed even if heat-killed bacteria or fungi were injected. Because the paralysis was accompanied by shrinkage of the silkworm body, we suspected that the bacteria or fungi induced the contraction of the silkworm muscles. We focused on this observation and examined it further using a method we previously reported for quantitative measurement of muscle contraction of silkworm larvae (32Sekimizu K. Larranaga J. Hamamoto H. Sekine M. Furuchi T. Katane M. Homma H. Matsuki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Injection of heat-killed S. aureus into larval muscle specimens induced muscle contraction (Fig. 1A). Peptidoglycan, a major component of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall, is responsible for this reaction, because purified peptidoglycan from S. aureus also induced muscle contraction (Fig. 1B). In addition, glucan from S. cerevisiae induced muscle contraction (Fig. 1C). We previously reported that kainic acid mediates muscle contraction in silkworms (32Sekimizu K. Larranaga J. Hamamoto H. Sekine M. Furuchi T. Katane M. Homma H. Matsuki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The process proceeds rapidly, suggesting that kainic acid acts as a receptor agonist at the nerve-muscle junction. The contraction induced by peptidoglycan or glucan described above, however, differed from that mediated by kainic acid in two points. First, the reaction was very slow; the time required to reach maximum contraction by peptidoglycan or glucan was ∼10 min, whereas kainic acid induced a contraction within 2 s (data not shown). Second, muscle contraction by kainic acid was severely inhibited by l-glutamic acid (32Sekimizu K. Larranaga J. Hamamoto H. Sekine M. Furuchi T. Katane M. Homma H. Matsuki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas the reaction by peptidoglycan or glucan was not (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that muscle contraction induced by peptidoglycan or glucan was a different process from that mediated by kainic acid, a neurotransmitter receptor agonist. PP-induced Muscle Contraction in Silkworm Larvae—PP was originally identified as a peptide that causes paralysis (27Ha S.D. Nagata S. Suzuki A. Kataoka H. Peptides. 1999; 20: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the physiologic functions of PP are related to self-defense (29Kamimura M. Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa Y. Kiuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Kiuchi M. Kamimura M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 52: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because we observed that paralysis caused by injection of bacteria or fungi was similar to that caused by PP, we hypothesized that muscle contraction in silkworm larvae induced by peptidoglycan or glucan was mediated by PP. When we injected synthetic PP into larval specimens, the muscles contracted in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). The minimum amount of PP required to trigger muscle contraction in this assay was 2 ng, similar to the amount of PP needed to induce paralysis in live larvae (27Ha S.D. Nagata S. Suzuki A. Kataoka H. Peptides. 1999; 20: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Muscle contraction induced by PP was suppressed by prior injection of anti-PP antiserum into the specimen (Fig. 1E). Muscle contraction induced by peptidoglycan or glucan was also inhibited by preinjection of anti-PP antiserum (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that muscle contraction induced by peptidoglycan or glucan is mediated by PP. Involvement of ROS in Muscle Contraction Induced by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—ROS are involved in various processes of innate immunity (36Bogdan C. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Moreover, in hemolymph exposed to air, active PP is processed from precursors by proteases (29Kamimura M. Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa Y. Kiuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together with our present results, we speculated that ROS are involved in activating the protease that generates the active form of PP when larvae are injected with peptidoglycan or glucan. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of H2O2, a source of ROS, on silkworm muscle contraction. H2O2 slowly induced larval muscle contraction in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). This reaction was repressed by the prior injection of N-acetyl-l-cysteine or edaravone (37Aizawa H. Makita Y. Sumitomo K. Aburakawa Y. Katayama T. Nakatani-Enomoto S. Suzuki Y. Fujiwara K. Enomoto H. Kuroda K. Kimura T. Yahara O. Koyama S. Maruyama J. Nakamura M. Hasebe N. Kikuchi K. Intern. Med. 2006; 45: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), free radical scavengers (data not shown). We then tested whether these compounds inhibit contraction caused by peptidoglycan or glucan. These radical scavengers repressed peptidoglycan- and glucan-induced muscle contraction but did not inhibit PP-induced muscle contraction (Fig. 2A). These findings suggest that peptidoglycan and glucan induce ROS production, resulting in PP activation followed by muscle contraction. Previous studies demonstrated that when bacteria were added to insect hemocyte culture medium, certain species of ROS were secreted from the cells (38Pereira L.S. Oliveira P.L. Barja-Fidalgo C. Daffre S. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 99: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We tested whether silkworm hemocytes produce ROS when stimulated with peptidoglycan. We performed the NBT reduction assay to measure ROS, and ROS production significantly increased in hemocytes incubated with peptidoglycan (Fig. 2B). Microscopic observation revealed that insoluble NBT formazan particles, a reaction product of NBT and ROS, appeared inside the hemocytes (data not shown). These results support the notion that hemocytes recognize the outer components of microorganisms and produce ROS, which then mediate PP processing. Involvement of Serine Proteases in Muscle Contraction Induced by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—Soluble receptors for peptidoglycan or glucan have been identified in silkworm hemolymph (39Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 40Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors activate a serine protease cascade and induce melanization (24Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Moreover, the formation of active PP in hemolymph exposed to air is suppressed by a serine protease inhibitor in another moth, M. sexta (31Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that serine proteases are involved in the activation of silkworm PP triggered by peptidoglycan or glucan. Pretreatment of larval muscle specimens with a serine protease inhibitor, benzamidine or p-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride (p-APMSF), significantly inhibited peptidoglycan or glucan-induced muscle contraction (Fig. 3). On the other hand, these serine protease inhibitors did not suppress PP-induced muscle contraction (Fig. 3). Thus, serine proteases activate PP when stimulated by peptidoglycan or glucan. Generation of Mature PP in Hemolymph of Live Silkworm Larvae by Injection of Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—PP exists in an inactive form (proPP) in silkworm hemolymph. When hemolymph bled from the body is exposed to air, proPP is cleaved by serine proteases, resulting in the formation of active PP (31Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We examined whether the active form of PP is generated when muscle contraction is induced by peptidoglycan or glucan. After injecting live silkworm larvae with peptidoglycan or glucan, hemolymph was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis probing with an anti-PP antibody. Mature PP appeared in response to these stimulants in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). The generation of mature PP was also observed when H2O2 was injected into the hemolymph of live larvae (Fig. 4B). Therefore, ROS generated from H2O2 in larval hemolymph might stimulate PP processing. We further examined the effect of serine protease inhibitors on PP processing induced by H2O2 in the hemolymph of live silkworms. The injection of benzamidine or p-APMSF together with H2O2 into the hemolymph of live larvae inhibited the formation of mature PP (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that proPP in the hemolymph is cleaved by serine proteases that are activated by ROS. Generation of the Active Form of PP in Vitro in Isolated Hemolymph—We then examined the activation of PP in vitro using hemolymph collected from intact larvae. Isolated hemolymph was incubated with peptidoglycan or glucan, and the samples were subjected to Western blot analysis probing with an anti-PP antibody. The active form of PP was generated in hemolymph incubated with peptidoglycan or glucan in vitro (Fig. 5A). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (Fig. 5B), benzamidine, and p-APMSF (Fig. 5C) inhibited the reaction, suggesting that ROS and serine proteases mediate PP processing induced by the components of bacteria or fungi. In mammalian innate immune systems, macrophages and lymphocytes secrete ROS in response to bacteria (41Marcinkiewicz J. Ciszek M. Bobek M. Strus M. Heczko P.B. Kurnyta M. Biedron R. Chmielarczyk A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2007; 88: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We examined whether the activation of PP in silkworm hemolymph involves cellular processes. Potassium cyanide, an inhibitor of cellular ATP synthesis, inhibited the generation of the active form of PP in the hemolymph (Fig. 5D). This finding suggests that, different from the melanization that occurs in cell-free silkworm plasma, PP activation induced by peptidoglycan or glucan involves cellular process mediated by hemocytes. Effect of the Active Form of PP and Anti-PP Antiserum on Host Resistance to Bacterial Infection—Although PP is considered to be involved in innate immunity, it has been unclear whether the active form of PP contributes to host resistance to bacterial infection. We examined the effect of the active form of PP and anti-PP antiserum on the survival of silkworms infected with S. aureus. Silkworms injected with S. aureus died within 100 h, whereas 50% of silkworms injected with a mixture of S. aureus and active PP survived for more than 110 h (Fig. 6). On the other hand, 50% of silkworms co-injected with S. aureus and anti-PP antiserum died within 70 h (Fig. 6). Analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method indicated that the effects of active PP and anti-PP antiserum on the survival of silkworms were statistically significant (p < 0.01), whereas the effect of normal rabbit serum was not (p > 0.05). These results suggest that PP activation is critical for host protection in the presence of infectious bacteria. Activation of Cytokine-like Factor PP by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—The cytokine-like factor PP from silkworm B. mori was originally characterized as a peptide that causes paralysis of silkworms when injected into the hemolymph (27Ha S.D. Nagata S. Suzuki A. Kataoka H. Peptides. 1999; 20: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Homologous peptides were identified from lepidopteran insects such as Trichoplusia ni, Heliothis virescens, M. sexta, Spodoptera exigua, and Antheraea yamamai (42Skinner W.S. Dennis P.A. Quistad G.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1993; 104: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Skinner W.S. Dennis P.A. Li J.P. Summerfelt R.M. Carney R.L. Quistad G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12873-12877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, active PP was reported to induce the hemocyte spreading activity that is responsible for insect innate immunity (30Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Kiuchi M. Kamimura M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 52: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism of PP activation by physiologic factors has remained unknown. Our present results suggest that (i) peptidoglycan and glucan, well known stimulants of innate immunity, induce PP activation in silkworm hemolymph, (ii) the process is mediated by ROS and serine proteases, and (iii) a cellular process is involved (Fig. 7). In invertebrates, there are several receptors that recognize peptidoglycan or glucan. For example, PGRP is well characterized, and it mediates the melanization and production of antimicrobial peptides (39Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 44Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). βGRP, Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein, and apolipoprotein bind to glucan (40Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lee W.J. Lee J.D. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7888-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 46Whitten M.M. Tew I.F. Lee B.L. Ratcliffe N.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 47Ujita M. Katsuno Y. Kawachi I. Ueno Y. Banno Y. Fujii H. Hara A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These receptors are candidates that might be involved in the first step of PP activation. Silkworm PGRP and βGRP have two isoforms: a free type and a membrane-bound type (48Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4995-5002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recently, the presence of an intracellular type was demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster (49Kaneko T. Yano T. Aggarwal K. Lim J.H. Ueda K. Oshima Y. Peach C. Erturk-Hasdemir D. Goldman W.E. Oh B.H. Kurata S. Silverman N. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The free forms of βGRP and PGRP are suggested to mediate melanization, whereas the roles of cellular receptors in the immune network are not known. Our results suggest that hemocyte receptors contribute to the processing of PP, an insect cytokine-like factor. ROS Mediate PP Processing Induced by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—ROS are produced by stimulated immune cells and show various activities in innate immunity. ROS not only kill microorganisms directly by oxidizing the membrane lipids, but they also act as intercellular messengers. ROS induce nuclear factor-κB-mediated inflammatory cytokine production, antimicrobial peptide synthesis, and apoptosis of severely infected cells (36Bogdan C. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 50Sun S.C. Faye I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ROS generation occurs both inside and outside of immune cells. When the cells recognize foreign substances, they undergo a process called oxidative burst in which NADPH oxidase at the cell surface is hyperactivated and ROS generation occurs (51Forman H.J. Torres M. Am J. Respir Crit. Care Med. 2002; 166: S4-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This phenomena is well characterized in mammalian neutrophils and is also reported in some insect hemocytes such as Bladerus discoidalis (52Whitten M.M. Ratcliffe N.A. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Galleria mellonella (53Bergin D. Reeves E.P. Renwick J. Wientjes F.B. Kavanagh K. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4161-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although we observed ROS production inside the peptidoglycan-stimulated hemocytes, we failed to detect ROS in hemocytes incubated with glucan using the NBT assay. This result might reflect the specificity of the NBT and ROS reaction. Because different receptors recognize peptidoglycan or glucan, it seems reasonable to speculate that the type of ROS produced by these two immunity stimulants might also be different. In the PP activation process, more detailed studies are required to determine the type of cells that produce ROS and the type of ROS produced in response to peptidoglycan or glucan stimulation. Our findings indicating the cellular production of ROS by peptidoglycan might support our hypothesis, but we could not exclude other possible interpretations; for example, ROS generated extracellularly might permeate the immune cells and activate subcellular proteases. Further studies are needed to determine the compartments in which ROS production and protease activation actually occur. Serine Proteases Mediate PP Processing Induced by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—By using inhibitors, we showed that serine proteases are involved in PP processing induced by peptidoglycan or glucan. Serine proteases generally possess high substrate specificities and regulate various processes in self-defense systems. In the invertebrate innate immune response, serine proteases mediate hemolymph coagulation, antimicrobial peptide production, and melanization (54Gorman M.J. Paskewitz S.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 55Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The primary structure of mature PP is highly homologous to that of other ENF family peptides such as growth blocking peptide, plasmatocyte spreading peptide, and cardioactive protein (27Ha S.D. Nagata S. Suzuki A. Kataoka H. Peptides. 1999; 20: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All of these mature peptides have 23–25 amino acid residues and are generated from larger precursors, but none of the cleaving enzymes have been identified. Four amino acid residues near the cleavage site are highly conserved among ENF family peptides (27Ha S.D. Nagata S. Suzuki A. Kataoka H. Peptides. 1999; 20: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, serine proteases that participate in generating the active form of PP in silkworms might be involved in activating other ENF family peptides. Biochemical characterization of these serine proteases is required for further understanding of the production mechanism of ENF family peptides, including PP. Some enzymes are activated by ROS-mediated oxidation. For example, the activity of a typical metalloprotease that degrades collagen is stimulated by H2O2 or xanthine/xanthine oxidase, which produces ROS (56Siwik D.A. Pagano P.J. Colucci W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C53-C60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that both PP processing and muscle contraction induced by H2O2 were suppressed by serine protease inhibitors. The results suggest that ROS activate a serine protease that cleaves the PP precursor, resulting in muscle contraction. In general, ROS act on cysteine and methionine residues of proteins and oxidize them (57Forman H.J. Torres M. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 189-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the oxidation of amino acid residues in the serine protease by ROS might stimulate the enzyme activity to generate mature PP. The Biologic Relevance of the Activation of Insect Cytokine PP Induced by Bacterial and Fungal Cell Wall Components—We demonstrated that peptidoglycan and glucan, innate immunity stimulants, induce the activation of the insect cytokine-like factor PP, followed by muscle contraction of silkworm larvae. A coupling between innate immunity and muscle contraction was previously demonstrated in mammals; the cytokine interleukin-4 induces the contraction of smooth muscle in the digestive tract (58Khan W.I. Vallance B.A. Blennerhassett P.A. Deng Y. Verdu E.F. Matthaei K.I. Collins S.M. Infect Immun. 2001; 69: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 59Khan W.I. Collins S.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 143: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This process is regarded as an immune response against pathogenic parasites. We speculate that PP activated in response to the invasion of microorganisms might provide similar defensive effects in the host insect. PP activation in infected silkworms was critical for the resistance to infectious pathogens; therefore, we propose that cytokine-like factor PP be redefined as a true “cytokine” that contributes to self-defense in the host animals. Although cytokines are important for the host to fight pathogenic invaders under regulated conditions, an exaggerated response by activated cytokines causes serious problems in the host (7Bach J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 998: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, excess cytokines produced in the mammalian digestive tract cause intestinal disorders (60Canto E. Ricart E. Monfort D. Gonzalez-Juan D. Balanzo J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Vidal S. Clin. Immunol. 2006; 119: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, excessive production of cytokines in sepsis patients causes multiple organ failure (61Casey L.C. Balk R.A. Bone R.C. Ann Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Intense muscle contraction by activated PP might be an outcome of such an exaggerated response. We previously reported that an overdose of PP killed silkworms (62Miura K. Kamimura M. Aizawa T. Kiuchi M. Hayakawa Y. Mizuguchi M. Kawano K. Peptides. 2002; 23: 2111-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our present finding of PP activation by innate immunity stimuli resulting in muscle contraction will provide clues to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of disorders caused by excessive cytokine production in body fluid. We thank Dr. N. Higashi (The University of Tokyo) for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2054523600,"CP12 is a protein of 8.7 kDa that contributes to Calvin cycle regulation by acting as a scaffold element in the formation of a supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in photosynthetic organisms. NMR studies of recombinant CP12 (isoform 2) of Arabidopsis thaliana show that CP12-2 is poorly structured. CP12-2 is monomeric in solution and contains four cysteines, which can form two intramolecular disulfides with midpoint redox potentials of –326 and –352 mV, respectively, at pH 7.9. Site-specific mutants indicate that the C-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between CP12-2 and GAPDH (isoform A4), whereas the N-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between this binary complex and PRK. In the presence of NAD, oxidized CP12-2 interacts with A4-GAPDH (KD = 0.18 μm) to form a binary complex of 170 kDa with (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2 stoichiometry, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and multiangle light scattering analysis. PRK is a dimer and by interacting with this binary complex (KD = 0.17 μm) leads to a 498-kDa ternary complex constituted by two binary complexes and two PRK dimers, i.e. ((A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2-(PRK))2. Thermodynamic parameters indicate that assembly of both binary and ternary complexes is exoergonic although penalized by a decrease in entropy that suggests an induced folding of CP12-2 upon binding to partner proteins. The redox dependence of events leading to supramolecular complexes is consistent with a role of CP12 in coordinating the reversible inactivation of chloroplast enzymes A4-GAPDH and PRK during darkness in photosynthetic tissues.

The photosynthetic reduction cycle for carbon organication (Calvin cycle) is a finely regulated metabolism that plants keep tuned with light reactions of photosynthesis under variable environmental conditions.

Alternatively, reversible down-regulation of A4-GAPDH activity can be achieved through formation of a supramolecular complex with PRK and the regulatory peptide CP12 (2Wedel N. Soll J. Paap B.K.

Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but once incorporated into the complex, both A4-GAPDH and PRK activities are inhibited in a coordinated manner (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar to A8B8-GAPDH, the stability of the supramolecular complex involving A4-GAPDH, CP12, and PRK is controlled by thioredoxins and several cofactors, including NAD(H) and NADP(H), ATP, and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (3Wedel N.

It is generally agreed that aggregated forms of GAPDH (A8B8) and GAPDH-CP12-PRK complexes are prevalent in chloroplasts in the dark, whereas illumination favors the accumulation of fully active GAPDH tetramers (A2B2, A4) and PRK dimers (4Scheibe R.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8163-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal half of CP12 is closely related to the C-terminal extension (CTE) of GAPDH B-subunits (24Pohlmeyer K. Paap B.K. Soll J. Wedel N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both the CTE and the C-terminal part of CP12 contain a couple of conserved cysteines, which can form an intramolecular disulfide and are potential targets of thioredoxin regulation (3Wedel N. Soll J.

In addition, most CP12 proteins contain a second pair of conserved cysteines in the N-terminal half of the molecule also able to form a disulfide bond (2Wedel N. Soll J. Paap B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10479-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Petersen J. Teich R. Becker B. Cerff R. Brinkmann H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2006; 23: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the redox properties of CP12 disulfide bonds are unknown, and it is difficult to predict whether CP12 could exist in different redox states in vivo. Studies on the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (20Graciet E. Gans P. Wedel N. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8163-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) help to trace the sequence of events during the formation of CP12-mediated supramolecular complexes. First, A4-GAPDH (in complex with NAD) interacts with oxidized CP12, and then oxidized PRK can participate in the assembly of the ternary complex, resulting in strongly inhibited enzyme activities.In this paper, we shall investigate some biochemical-molecular features of A. thaliana CP12-2 and properties of the supramolecular complexes it forms with A4-GAPDH and PRK. The CP12-2 isoform, produced by one of three CP12 genes known for this species (8Trost P. Fermani S. Marri L. Zaffagnini M. Falini G. Scagliarini S. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Photosynth. Res. 2006; 89: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was chosen as a model, since the expression pattern of the CP12-2 gene in different Arabidopsis organs and conditions strictly followed that of GAPDH, PRK, and other Calvin cycle genes (8Trost P. Fermani S. Marri L. Zaffagnini M. Falini G. Scagliarini S. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Photosynth. Res. 2006; 89: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Marri L. Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting model supports the view that these supramolecular complexes represent an instrument for photosynthetic organisms to finely modulate Calvin cycle turnover in response, for example, to changes in light intensity as commonly occur in natural environments and to safely and reversibly store photosynthetic enzymes in an inactive conformation during the night.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Heterologous expression and purification of recombinant A4-GAPDH (At3g26650), PRK (At1g32060), CP12-2 (At3g62410), and CP12-2 site-specific mutants of A. thaliana were performed as described (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NMR analyses were performed on uniformly 15N-labeled His-tagged CP12-2 samples obtained by transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Euriso-top, France) as the sole nitrogen source. An overnight culture of 25 ml in M9 medium was transferred to 500 ml of fresh M9 medium, both supplied with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C under shaking. When optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0 units, expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Since M9 minimal medium prevented rapid cell growth, the induction phase was prolonged for 15 h before cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm; 15 min). CP12-2 was purified from the resulting pellet as previously described (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), desalted in appropriate buffers, and stored at –20 °C. Concentrations of purified proteins are all referred to native conformations (CP12-2 monomers, A4-GAPDH tetramers, and PRK dimers).CP12-2 Site-specific Mutants—Site-specific mutants of recombinant CP12-2 were obtained as previously described (26Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44946-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PCR primers were the following (mutation sites are underlined): C22S(up), 5′-AAGCTCAGGAGACTTCTGCGGGCGATCC-3′; C22S(down), 5′-ATCGCCCGCAGAAGTCTCCTGAGCTTCC-3′; C73S(up), 5′-ACAATCCTGAGACCAACGAGTCCCGTACTTACG-3′; C73S(down), 5′-TTGTCGTAAGTACGGGACTCGTTGGTCTCAGG-3′. The presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.NMR Spectra—Uniformly 15N-labeled CP12-2, provided with His tag, was oxidized by the addition of 20 mm oxidized DTT (Sigma). After 16–18 h of incubation at 4 °C, the sample was desalted in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and concentrated. NMR samples were typically 300 or 600 μl of 1 mm CP12-2 solution in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5% (v/v) 2H2O, 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide.Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (30Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with 256 and 2048 complex points in F1 and F2 dimensions, respectively, at 20 °C on a Bruker AvanceII 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) probe, including field xyz gradients.Spectra were processed using Topspin™ version 1.3 (Bruker). Chemical shifts were referenced to internal d4-3-(trimethylsily) propionic acid, according to Ref. 31Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J.

Redox titration experiments were performed with 70 μm CP12-2 incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with variable ratios of reduced and oxidized DTT (20 mm total concentration) in a final volume of 500 μl. After incubation, samples were desalted with PD10 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. In order to avoid any possible DTT contamination, only the first 2 ml of eluted samples were collected. Control experiments were performed under the same conditions but in the absence of CP12-2. Absorbance at 280 and 412 nm was recorded immediately before and after the addition of 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The number of solvent-accessible thiol groups under different redox conditions was calculated from the ratio between the absorbance at 412 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 14,150 m–1 for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (thiolate) dianion) (32Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the absorbance at 280 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 8,370 m–1 for CP12-2) (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Redox titration results were fit by nonlinear regression (CoHort Software) to the Nernst equation for two redox components (26Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44946-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Midpoint redox potentials are reported as average values ± S.D. of triplicate experiments.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Calorimetric measurements were carried out using a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Each experiment was performed at a constant temperature of 30 °C and consisted of 25 injections of 10-μl aliquots, repeated every 200 s. All samples were degassed by stirring under vacuum before use. Heat of dilution, measured by control experiments in which samples were injected into a buffer-filled cell, was subtracted. Signals recorded in each experiment were integrated using OriginPro 7.5 software supplied with the instrument. The thermodynamic binding parameters (dissociation constant (KD), variations of enthalpy (ΔH), Gibbs free energy (ΔG), entropy (ΔS), and the number of binding sites (n)) were obtained by nonlinear regression of the integrated heat plots, according to the “one set of sites” model of the software.Calorimetric titrations of binary complex formation were carried out with 15 μm oxidized CP12-2 in 25 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm NAD, pH 7.5, in both sample and reference cells, whereas the syringe was filled with 52 μm A4-GAPDH in the same buffer. Although CP12-2 behaved as a ligand, it was not filled in the syringe because of its very high heat of dilution. The presence of ligand (CP12-2) in the cell and macromolecule (A4-GAPDH) in the syringe was taken into account in the elaboration of primary data.Calorimetric titrations of ternary complex formation were performed with 5 μm preformed binary complex in 25 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm NAD, pH 7.5, in sample and reference cells, whereas the syringe was filled with 70 μm PRK dissolved in the same buffer. Thermodynamic parameters of binary and ternary complex formation are reported as average values ± S.D. of triplicate experiments.Dynamic Light Scattering (MALS-QELS)—Purified single proteins and preformed binary and ternary complexes were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography connected to a multiangle light scattering (MALS) equipped with QELS module (quasielastic light scattering) for RH measurements. 100-μl samples were loaded on a Superdex 200HR column (GE Health-care) equilibrated in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, with 0.2 mm NAD (for A4-GAPDH, binary, and ternary complexes) or without NAD (for PRK and CP12-2). A constant flow rate of 0.6 ml min–1 was applied. Elution profiles were detected by an Optilab rEX interferometric refractometer and a Dawn EOS multiangle laser light-scattering system at 690 nm (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Data acquisition and processing were carried out using ASTRA 5.1.9.1 software (Wyatt Technology). Determination of molecular masses and hydrodynamic radii are reported as mean values ± S.D. of duplicate experiments.RESULTSCP12-2 of A. thaliana Is Intrinsically Unstructured and Monomeric—NMR analysis of CP12-2 in the oxidized state revealed that most of the amide proton resonances are localized between 8.5 and 8.0 ppm, the so-called random coil region, strongly suggesting that CP12-2 is mainly unstructured (Fig. 1). Only a few residues located at the C terminus exhibit amide chemical shifts outside the random coil range, indicating structuration (33Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with the importance of disulfide bridges in this respect, the reduction of oxidized CP12-2 by DTT led to typical random coil signals (not shown), as previously described for Chlamydomonas CP12 (20Graciet E. Gans P. Wedel N. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8163-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The calculated molecular mass of recombinant CP12-2 (after proteolytic cleavage of the His tag) was 8.7 kDa. Although oxidized CP12-2 behaves as a protein of 29 kDa in size exclusion chromatography (7Marri L. Trost P. Pupillo P. Sparla F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), MALS-QELS analysis of the protein eluted from the size exclusion column yielded a molecular mass of 9 ± 1 kDa, conclusively demonstrating that under native conditions, CP12-2 is a monomer (Table 1).TABLE 1Determination of molecular mass (m) and hydrodynamic radii (RH) of purified single proteins and reconstituted complexes by MALS-QELSSampleCalculatedMeasuredmRHaThe theoretical hydrodynamic radius RH for a spherical protein of a given Mr was calculated on the basis of the empirical equation Mr = 4/3NA(RHf/f0)3/Vk, where NA is Avogadro's number, f/f0 is the ratio of frictional coefficients (set to 1.2 for spherical proteins), and Vk is the partial volume set to 0.73 for a spherical protein (45).mRHkDanmkDanmCP12-28.71.639 ± 1NAbThe experimental RH of CP12-2 was close to the lower detection limit of the QELS module.A4-GAPDH148.8cSince chromatographic runs were performed in the presence of 0.2 mm NAD, molecular masses were calculated on the assumption that each A4-GAPDH tetramer bound four NAD molecules.4.21146 ± 23.9 ± 0.3PRK77.63.3985 ± 73.3 ± 0.3(A4-GAPDH) + (CP12-2)166.2cSince chromatographic runs were performed in the presence of 0.2 mm NAD, molecular masses were calculated on the assumption that each A4-GAPDH tetramer bound four NAD molecules.,dCalculated molecular mass for a binary complex with stoichiometry (A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2.4.36170 ± 144.3 ± 0.5(A4-GAPDH) + (CP12-2) + (PRK)487.7cSince chromatographic runs were performed in the presence of 0.2 mm NAD, molecular masses were calculated on the assumption that each A4-GAPDH tetramer bound four NAD molecules.,eCalculated molecular mass for a ternary complex with stoichiometry ((A4-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)2-(PRK))2.6.25498 ± 67.0 ± 0.1a The theoretical hydrodynamic radius RH for a spherical protein of a given Mr was calculated on the basis of the empirical equation Mr = 4/3NA(RHf/f0)3/Vk, where NA is Avogadro's number, f/f0 is the ratio of frictional coefficients (set to 1.2 for spherical proteins), and Vk is the partial volume set to 0.73 for a spherical protein (45Michels J.

Open table in a new tab CP12-2 Redox Properties—To gain insight into the redox properties of CP12-2 cysteines, redox titrations were performed in the presence of DTNB as a probe to reveal free protein thiols under varying redox conditions. Fully reduced/oxidized samples were obtained following equilibration with 20 mm reduced or oxidized DTT, which was then removed by desalting. Although reduced CP12-2, whose amino acid sequence includes four Cys residues, was found by DTNB titration to contain four reactive thiols (4.5 ± 0.5), oxidized CP12-2 had none (–0.3 ± 0.1), indicating that both CP12-2 disulfides could be redox-titrated by DTT plus DTNB. Data from redox titrations of purified CP12-2 were therefore fitted to a Nernst equation for two different thiol/disulfide equilibria, equally contributing to the total redox response. At pH 7.9, the midpoint redox potentials (Em,7.9) of CP12-2 disulfides were estimated as –326 ± 2 and –352 ± 6 mV, respectively (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Redox ti"
https://openalex.org/W2127004079,"The MAPK-activated protein kinases belong to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Within this group, MK2, MK3, and MK5 constitute three structurally related enzymes with distinct functions. Few genuine substrates for MK5 have been identified, and the only known biological role is in ras-induced senescence and in tumor suppression. Here we demonstrate that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit Cα in PC12 cells results in transient nuclear export of MK5, which requires the kinase activity of both Cα and MK5 and the ability of Cα to enter the nucleus. Cα and MK5, but not MK2, interact in vivo, and Cα increases the kinase activity of MK5. Moreover, Cα augments MK5 phosphorylation, but not MK2, whereas MK5 does not seem to phosphorylate Cα. Activation of PKA can induce actin filament accumulation at the plasma membrane and formation of actin-based filopodia. We demonstrate that small interfering RNA-triggered depletion of MK5 interferes with PKA-induced F-actin rearrangement. Moreover, cytoplasmic expression of an activated MK5 variant is sufficient to mimic PKA-provoked F-actin remodeling. Our results describe a novel interaction between the PKA pathway and MAPK signaling cascades and suggest that MK5, but not MK2, is implicated in PKA-induced microfilament rearrangement.

A typical MAP kinase module acts through subsequent phosphorylation and activation of a MAP kinase kinase kinase, a MAP kinase kinase, and a MAP kinase. The MAP kinase may phosphorylate non-protein kinase substrates or yet other protein kinases, referred to as MAP-activating protein kinases (MAPKAPK) (1Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J.

Based on the sequence homology of the kinase domain, the MAPKAPK belong to the superfamily of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (6Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6353) Google Scholar). The mammalian MAPKAPK include the ribosomal S6-kinases (RSK1-4 or MAPKAPK1a-d), the mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSK1 and -2), the MAPK-interacting kinases (MNK1 and -2), and the MAPKAPK MK2, MK3, and MK5. MK2 was isolated 15 years ago in an attempt to identify protein kinases involved in adrenergic control of glycogen synthase activity, whereas MK3 was first described as a protein encoded by a gene located in the small cell lung cancer tumor suppressor gene region 3p21.3 (7Stokoe D.

The murine MAPKAPK5 (MK5) or its human homologue PRAK was originally described as a downstream target of p38 MAPK (9New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C.N. Han J.

All three kinases contain the same conserved regulatory phosphorylation site (Thr-182, Thr-222, and Thr-201, respectively). Despite their high similarity, gene deletion experiments reveal that these three kinases possess separate functions (11Gaestel M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

MK3 may be involved in transcription regulation through modulating the activity of the transcription factor E47 and the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group Bmi-1 protein. Moreover, MK3 may function as a tumor suppressor (19Neufeld B. Grosse-Wilde A. Hoffmeyer A. Jordan B.W. Chen P. Dinev D. Ludwig S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol.

The biological function of MK5 is poorly understood, as MK5 knock-out mice bred onto different backgrounds displayed either no obvious phenotype or embryonic lethality. The reason for this lethality, however, remains unknown. Furthermore, the atypical MAP kinases ERK3 and ERK4 are the only identified in vivo MK5-interacting partners, but the physiological relevance of the interaction remains elusive (11Gaestel M. Nat.

However, a recent study demonstrated that MK5 could phosphorylate p53 at serine 37 in vivo, that MK5 deficiency enhanced mutagen-induced skin carcinogenesis in mice, and that MK5-/- primary cells were more susceptible to oncogenic transformation. These findings point to a role for MK5 in tumor suppression (27Sun P. Yoshizuka N. New L. Moser B.A. Li Y. Liao R. Xie C. Chen J. Deng Q. Yamout M. Dong M.Q. Frangou C.G. Yates J.R. II I Wright P.E.

Our group, in collaboration with others, found that increased levels of ERK3 during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of PC12 cells was accompanied by increased MK5 activity, hence suggesting a role for MK5 in neuronal differentiation (24Seternes O.M.

Cyclic AMP functions as an intracellular second messenger to transmit extracellular signals, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, to the intracellular environment. The major target of cAMP is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a tetrameric holoenzyme that consists of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. After cAMP binds the R subunits, the C subunits dissociate and phosphorylate their substrates (28Skålhegg B. Taskén K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway regulates a variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, and gene transcription (reviewed in Refs. 29Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 30Howe A.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, NY2005: 41-78Google Scholar). To optimize the responsiveness to a wide variety of signals, the PKA pathway interacts with other signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathways. In fact, PKA has been shown to modulate the activity of several MAPK cascades (32Saxena M. Williams S. Taskén K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Delghandi M.P. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell.

Recently, the MAPKAP kinase, RSK1, was found to either bind the C or R subunit of PKA, depending on the phosphorylation status of RSK1, but the physiological relevance of this interaction is not completely understood (36Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A role for PKA in actin cytoskeletal changes is well illustrated, and it has been suggested that MK2/3/5 may be implicated in actin remodeling (reviewed in Refs. 11Gaestel M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar and 30Howe A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, whether there is a specific role for a certain MK in actin redistribution and whether PKA may recruit MKs to mediate actin rearrangement remains unsolved. This prompted us to examine whether MK5 might contribute in cAMP/PKA-provoked modification of the microfilament architecture in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. Our results demonstrate a new interaction between the cAMP/PKA and MK5 and recognize a novel role of MK5 as a mediator of cAMP-induced F-actin rearrangement.

The kinase-dead Cα L72H was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer (only one strand is shown): 5′-GAA-CAA-CTA-CGC-CAT-GCA-CAT-CTTAGA-CAA-G-3′. The expression plasmids for cytoplasmically located MK5 variants were generated by cloning the NES signal of the Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus into pEGFP-MK5. Tagging a protein with this sequence will direct it to the cytoplasm (40Thyssen G. Li T.H. Lehmann L. Zhuo M. Sharma M. Sun Z. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGAGACGCTCTACCACCGCTTGAGAGACTTACTCTTGACCGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CGGTCAAGAGTAAGTCTCTCAAGCGGTGGTAGAGCGTCT-3′ were ligated into the BspEI/Sac I sites of pEGFP-MK5, pEGFP-MK5 T182A, and pEGFP-MK5 L337A, respectively. To construct the RFP-Cα-NLS and RFP-Cα-NES expression plasmids, the BspEI and BamHI fragment of GPKAnls and GPKAnes, respectively, was ligated into the corresponding sites of pAsRed2-C1 (Clontech). The GPKAnls and GPKAnes plasmids were generously provided by Dr. S. H. Green (41Bok J. Zha X.M. Cho Y.S. Green S.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 777-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pCRE-LUC was from Clontech. All newly generated plasmids and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Phosphorylation of purified MK2 (Upstate/Millipore, Billerica, MA), MK5 (Upstate/Millipore), and ERK3 (24Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G.

The reaction was stopped in 4× LDS Sample buffer, and proteins were denatured at 70 °C for 10 min. The phosphorylation was analyzed on NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 200 V and then subjected to autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells, a kind gift from Dr. Jaakko Saraste (University of Bergen, Norway), and PKA-deficient PC12A123.7 cells (generously provide by Dr. J. Yao) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (110 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (110 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). HEK293 cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (catalog number 85120602; Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) and kept in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (110 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or using the Nucleofection kit (Amaxa) according to the manufacturers' instructions. We routinely obtained >75% transfection efficiency in the different cell lines with these transfection agents as judged by green fluorescent-positive cells when using the pEGFP plasmid as a marker. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—The NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, catalog number 78833) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blotting—For detection of co-immunoprecipitates and MK5, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and blotted onto a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunoblotting was performed by first blocking the membrane with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) containing 10% (w/v) dried skimmed milk for 1 h and probed either by 4D7, anti-PRAK, anti-MK2, anti-ERK2, anti-PKA cat. After four washes, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. Visualization of proteins was achieved by using CDP Star substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and Lumi-Imager F1 from Roche Applied Science. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa extracts were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.27 m sucrose, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 15,000 × g. Lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody for at least 1 h at 4 °C, before addition of 60 μl of slurry (i.e. 30 μl of protein G-agarose (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 30 μl lysis buffer) and incubated for an additional hour. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0. Twenty μl of 2× LDS sample buffer was added to the beads before denaturation at 70 °C for 10 min. The immunoprecipitates were either analyzed on Western blots or by means of kinase assays. Cell Staining and Microscopy—Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min with 4% formaldehyde. Next, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were preincubated with PBS containing 1% BSA for 20-30 min and stained with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (A12381; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and examined using confocal laser-scanning Zeiss LSM 510 META and Leica SP5 microscopes. Cell nuclei were visualized by DRAQ5 staining (Biostatus Ltd., Leicestershire, UK). We routinely examined 50 cells or more, and representative pictures are shown under the “Results.” Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells were plated 3 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were as described previously (42Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immune Complex Kinase Assay—For the immune complex kinase assays, HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding EGFP fusion proteins with wild-type MK5 or mutants and Cα. Corresponding empty vector control plasmids (pEGFP and pRcCMV, respectively) were used as control. As a positive control for the assay, cells were either transfected with pEGFP-MK5 L337A, encoding an activated MK5 variant, or pEGFP-MK5 plus expression plasmids for the activated MKK6 E/E mutant and p38β MAPK. MK5 fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-green fluorescent protein antibody, and the kinase activity was monitored against 30 μm PRAKtide substrate peptide at 30 °C for 20 min in 50 μl of buffer containing 40 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm cold ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Following incubation, 20-μl aliquots were spotted onto phosphocellulose disks (Upstate) and washed extensively with 1% phosphoric acid before measurement of radioactive incorporation by scintillation counting. Quantitation of F-actin—The amount of globular (G-actin) and filamentous actin (F-actin) was determined using the G-actin/F-actin in vivo assay kit from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were lysed, and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 37 °C. The supernatants contained G-actin, whereas the pellet contained F-actin. As a control, cell lysates are either treated with F-actin enhancing solution (phalloidin) or F-actin depolymerization solution (cytochalasin) before ultracentrifugation. The amount of G- and F-actin was determined by Western blotting using an anti-actin-specific antibody. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Validated MK5-directed siRNA, purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX), was transfected by Nucleofection (Amaxa) into PC12 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions using 100 μm siRNA/106 cells. The levels of MK5 protein in untreated and siRNA-treated cells were monitored 48 h after transfection by Western blotting using anti-PRAK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to verify the efficiency of reduction in MK5 expression. The cAMP/PKA Pathway Induces Nuclear Export of MK5—Both endogenous and ectopically expressed MK5 as green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-, cyan fluorescent protein-, and hemagglutinin-tagged proteins reside predominantly in the nucleus in different cells (23Schumacher S. Laass K. Kant S. Shi Y. Visel A. Gruber A.D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Hegge B. Johannessen M.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies have proven that the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway participates in actin remodeling and that MKs may regulate the cytoskeletal architecture through modulating the activity of cytoplasmic proteins involved in F-actin organization (reviewed in Refs. 11Gaestel M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar and 30Howe A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because the putative involvement of MK5 in stimulus-induced microfilament rearrangement raises the likelihood of cytoplasmic distribution of MK5, we tested whether activation of PKA triggered subcellular distribution of MK5 in PC12 cells. Thereto cells transfected with an expression plasmid for EGFP-MK5 fusion protein were treated with the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin. Consistent with previous findings of both ectopic and endogenous MK5, we observed MK5 mainly in the nucleus of unstimulated cells (23Schumacher S. Laass K. Kant S. Shi Y. Visel A. Gruber A.D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Hegge B. Johannessen M. Keyse S.M. Moens U. Mol. Cell.

A transient nuclear export of MK5 was observed in cells treated with forskolin, but not in control cells treated with the vehicle Me2SO. Increased cytoplasmic MK5 residence was observed 15 min after forskolin exposure and remained elevated for at least 1 h, after which EGFP-MK5 relocalized mainly to the nucleus. After 30 min of forskolin stimulation, the amount of cells displaying both nuclear and cytoplasmic EGFP-MK5 versus nuclear EGFP-MK5 alone increased from 6 to 84% (50 cells were counted). After 6 h, the subcellular distribution of MK5 was comparable with untreated cells (Fig. 1A). In 95% (±2%; 50 cells were counted in several independent experiments) of the Me2SO-treated cells, MK5 was predominantly nuclear. Forskolin treatment had no effect on the subcellular localization of the EGFP protein (results not shown). Endogenous MK5 was also exported from the nucleus in cells with activated PKA signaling pathway with the same kinetics as EGFP-MK5 (Fig. 1B). These findings confirm that MK5 and EGFP-MK5 fusion protein behave identically in their subcellular redistribution in response to forskolin. Monitoring the amount of MK5 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction of untreated and forskolin-treated cells confirmed an increased nuclear export of MK5 after forskolin exposure. A 55% decrease of nuclear MK5 was observed after 30 min of forskolin treatment, whereas a 41% increase in cytoplasmic MK5 was monitored in forskolin-exposed cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we tested whether overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA tagged with a nuclear localization signal (Cα-NLS) was sufficient to induce nuclear export of MK5. Similar to forskolin-exposed cells, MK5 was located in the cytoplasm of cells that ectopically expressed Cα-NLS (supplemental Fig. S1). To elaborate the contribution of PKA in forskolin-induced nuclear export of MK5, we used PC12A123.7 cells, which are deficient in PKA (44Yao J. Erickson J.D. Hersch L.B. Traffic. 2004; 5: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). No subcellular redistribution of MK5 was monitored in these cells after forskolin treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway provokes nuclear export of MK5 in a time-dependent manner. The Catalytic Cα Subunit of PKA Phosphorylates MK5 and Increases the Kinase Activity of MK5—Previous studies by our group and others have shown that nuclear export of MK5 can be achieved by overexpression of the atypical MAP kinases ERK3 and ERK4. This nuclear exclusion requires the direct interaction between MK5 and ERK3 or ERK4 and leads to activation of MK5 (23Schumacher S. Laass K. Kant S. Shi Y. Visel A. Gruber A.D. Kotlyarov A.

https://openalex.org/W2099742433,"Contemporary researchers strive to understand complex physical phenomena that involve many constituents, may be influenced by numerous forces, and may exhibit unexpected or emergent behavior. Often such “complex systems“ are macroscopic manifestations of other systems that exhibit their own complex behavior and obey more elemental laws. This article proposes that areas of mathematics, even ones based on simple axiomatic foundations, have discernible layers, entirely unexpected “macroscopic” outcomes, and both mathematical and physical ramifications profoundly beyond their historical beginnings. In a larger sense, the study of mathematics itself, which is increasingly surpassing the capacity of researchers to verify “by hand,” may be the ultimate complex system."

Here we characterize a novel interaction between the Exo70 subunit of the exocyst and Snapin, a ubiquitous protein known to associate with at least two t-SNAREs, SNAP23 and SNAP25. The interaction between Exo70 and Snapin is mediated via an N-terminal coil-coil domain in Exo70 and a C-terminal helical region in Snapin. Exo70 competes with SNAP23 for Snapin binding, suggesting that Snapin does not provide a direct link between the exocyst and the SNARE complex but, rather, mediates cross-talk between the two complexes by sequential interactions. The insulin-regulated trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane serves to facilitate glucose uptake in adipocytes, and both SNAP23 and the exocyst have been implicated in this process. In this study, depletion of Snapin in adipocytes using RNA interference inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.

Temperature-sensitive mutations in each of these genes block secretion of invertase and accumulate membrane-bound organelles within the yeast cell. Six of the SEC genes, SEC3, SEC5, SEC6, SEC8, SEC10, and SEC15, encode subunits of an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein complex known as the exocyst. Two additional components, Exo70p and Exo84p, were subsequently biochemically purified in complex with the exocyst proteins (5Munson M. Novick P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 7Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similar to their yeast homologues, the mammalian exocyst proteins have been implicated in the transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (8Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C.

The exocyst complex has also been implicated in the trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane (9Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Among its proposed roles, the exocyst is thought to function as a vesicle tether at the plasma membrane and contribute to the specificity of membrane fusion (5Munson M. Novick P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the β-cell demonstrated that the exocyst regulates the ability of insulin granules to dock with the plasma membrane (10Tsuboi T. Ravier M.A. Xie H. Ewart M.A. Gould G.W. Baldwin S.A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25565-25570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Within the cell, each step of membrane trafficking is coupled to maintain the sequential nature and ensure the high fidelity of the process. Emerging evidence suggests a link between the membrane tethering and the SNARE-mediated docking/fusion steps (11Conibear E. Cleck J.N. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1610-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments in yeast are consistent with the SNAREs acting directly downstream of the exocyst. For example, overexpression of yeast Sec1p or the t-SNAREs Sso1p/Sso2p can bypass secretory blocks induced by mutations in the exocyst genes (13Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Wiederkehr A. De Craene J.O. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In yeast, the exocyst associates through Sec15p with the vesicle-bound Rab-GTPase Sec4p (7Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and acts as an effector for Sec4p during targeting of secretory vesicles to sites of exocytosis (15Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In addition, the exocyst interacts with the yeast Lgl homologue Sro7p and the t-SNARE Sec9p (16Novick P. Medkova M. Dong G. Hutagalung A. Reinisch K. Grosshans B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Sivaram M.V.S. Saporita J.A. Furgason M.L.M. Boettcher A.J. Munson M. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2005; 44: 6302-6311Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The above data highlight the involvement of multiple protein-protein interactions and the potential complexity of the coupling mechanism between tethering, docking, and fusion. Exo70 is a central component of the mammalian exocyst complex, demonstrating specific interactions with almost all of the other subunits, including Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, and Exo84 (18Matern H.T. Yeaman C. Nelson W.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Vega I.E. Hsu S.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exo70 has recently been implicated in GLUT4 trafficking through its association with the GTP-bound form of the Rho GTPase TC10 (9Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin was shown to cause an increase in the abundance of Exo70 at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, overexpression of an Exo70 mutant that interacts with TC10 specifically inhibited insulin-stimulated appearance of HA-GLUT4-GFP molecules at the plasma membrane, with no apparent effect on the trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Using RNA interference, a follow-up study showed that Exo70 is critical for insulin-regulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Inoue M. Chiang S.H. Chang L. Chen X.W. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, in both studies, the precise mechanism of Exo70 function was not defined. More recently, Exo70 has been demonstrated to interact with the Arp2/3 complex in an epidermal growth factor-dependent manner in HeLa cells. This interaction was essential for the formation of actin-based membrane protrusions and cell migration (21Zuo X.F. Zhang J. Zhang Y. Hsu S.C. Zhou D.G. Guo W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1383-U1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, epidermal growth factor stimulation resulted in recruitment of Exo70 to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with the observation in adipocytes. These studies suggest that growth factor signaling regulates Exo70 function, making Exo70 an interesting candidate for hormone-regulated exocytic events. To further investigate the functional role of Exo70 in GLUT4 trafficking, we set out to identify new Exo70 interacting proteins that may facilitate the tethering and docking of GLUT4 vesicles at the plasma membrane. Here we show that Exo70 interacts with Snapin. This observation is exciting, because Snapin has previously been shown to interact with SNAP23 (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a major t-SNARE regulating GLUT4 vesicle trafficking (23Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we provide evidence for a modulatory role for Snapin in GLUT4 trafficking, possibly by coordinating vesicle tethering and docking through sequential interactions with the exocyst and SNARE complexes. Antibodies—Rabbit and mouse anti-Exo70 antibodies were kindly provided by Charles Yeaman (University of Iowa) and Shu C. Hsu (Rutgers University), respectively. The remaining antibodies were commercially available and included rabbit anti-SNAP23 and rabbit anti-Snapin (Synaptic System), mouse anti-Sec6 and mouse anti-Sec8 (Stressgen), rabbit anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-Myc and rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-HA (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma), rabbit anti-14-3-3, and rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose was also from Sigma. Cell Culture—COS1, 293T, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293FT cells were purchased from Invitrogen, and 3T3-L1 murine fibroblasts were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Full-length rat Exo70 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBKT7 vector was a kind gift from Dr. Hugo Matern (Genentech, Inc.) and used as a bait to screen a mouse embryo Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech). The mated yeast cells were selected on SD minimal medium supplemented with appropriate autotrophic factors except for adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (QDO plates), and putative positive clones grown on QDO were assayed for LacZ activity according to the protocol provided with the Matchmaker kit (Clontech). Plasmids from LacZ activity-positive clones were extracted and sequenced. The interaction of these clones was then further confirmed by individually retransforming them back into Saccharomyces cerevisiae stain AH109 with rat Exo70 in pGBKT7 and selected as described above and subjected to a β-galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). DNA Constructs—Snapin and its deletion mutants (Snapin Δ1–12, Δ1–83, Δ120–136, Δ84–136, and Δ84–118) were cloned into either the pXJ40Myc (BamHI/XhoI) or the pXJ40FLAG (HindIII/XhoI) vector using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Snapin was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pET-28a to generate a His-tagged construct. Exo70 and its deletion mutants (Exo70 Δ384–653, Δ1–383, Δ100–384, and Δ100–653) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pDHAneo or the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (EcoRI/XhoI). Exo70 constructs with a C-terminal HA tag were cloned into pcDNA. The pRRL-PGK lentiviral expression vector was obtained from R. Hoeben (Leiden University Medical Center), and the packaging vectors pMDLg/pRRE (encoding gag/pol), pRSV-Rev (encoding rev), and pMD2.G (encoding VSV-G) were obtained from D. Trono (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne). The Gateway-compatible lentiviral destination vector pDEST/pRRL-PGK was constructed by subcloning the Gateway Reading Frame Cassette B (Invitrogen) into a unique HpaI site in the multiple cloning site of pRRL-PGK. Various Myc-Snapin deletions in pDEST/pRRL-PGK were obtained by first cloning into the Gateway entry vector MCS-pDONR221 (Invitrogen) followed by recombination into pDEST/pRRL-PGK using the Gateway LR clonase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transformed into One Shot Stbl3 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). The sequence of all cDNA constructs was verified. In Vivo Binding Assays—Appropriate combinations of plasmids were transfected into 293T or COS1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm for 20 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were then pre-cleared for 1 h with either protein A- or protein G-agarose beads. For immunoprecipitation of Myc- or HA-tagged proteins, the precleared lysates (500 μg of protein) were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Myc or rat anti-HA and then captured by protein A or protein G-agarose beads for 2 h. Total rabbit or mouse IgG served as a control. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins, precleared lysates were incubated with monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG beads for 2 h. Beads were then washed 5 times with lysis buffer. In Vitro Binding Assays—For GST pulldown experiments, 10 μg each of GST, Exo70-GST, or Exo70 Δ100–653-GST were first incubated with glutathione Sepharose-4B beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in GST binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h and then washed with GST binding buffer supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 twice. 10 μg of His-Snapin in lysis buffer was then added to each tube. After 2-h incubation, the beads were washed 4 times in lysis buffer and twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100. For the in vitro competition assays, 250 nm MBP-SNAP23 was first bound to amylose beads (Biolabs) in lysis buffer for 1 h. 500 nm His-Snapin was then added together with increasing amounts either of GST, GST-Exo70, or Exo70 (cleaved from GST using a thrombin digestion kit, Novagen). After a 3-h incubation, the amylose beads were washed four times, and bound proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Samples were kept a 4 °C during the manipulations, and buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cellular Fractionation—Fractionation of adipocytes was carried out as described (24Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on COS1 cells or lentivirus transduced 3T3-L1 adipocytes seeded on glass coverslips. Adipocytes were serumstarved for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and incubated in the absence or presence of 1 or 100 nm insulin for 20 min. Cells were then washed three times in cold PBS, fixed with 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, blocked in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin in PBS, and labeled with rabbit anti-Snapin and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies. Cells were subsequently labeled with appropriate Alexa-labeled antibodies. COS1 cells were fixed 24 h after transfection and labeled with monoclonal anti-Myc or Rabbit anti-HA antibody and appropriate secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted onto glass coverslides using Immuno-fluore mounting medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc.). Images were acquired and analyzed using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope and software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Lentivirus Production and Transduction of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Concentrated Myc-Snapin and GFP control lentivirus stocks were prepared as previously described (25Carlotti F. Bazuine M. Kekarainen T. Seppen J. Pognonec P. Maassen J.A. Hoeben R.C. Mol. Ther. 2004; 9: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Li M.J. Rossi J.J. RNA Int. 2005; 392: 218-226Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293FT cells were transfected at 70–90% confluency using calcium phosphate (26Li M.J. Rossi J.J. RNA Int. 2005; 392: 218-226Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One T150 flask was transfected with 26 μg of expression vector, 17.4 μg of pMDLg/pRRE (gag/pol) vector, 13.2 μg of pRSV-Rev (rev) vector, and 9.2 μg of pMD2.G (VSV-G) vector in 20 ml of culture medium. At 5–6 h post-transfection, medium was replaced with 12 ml of medium containing 6 mm butyric acid. Lentivirus was harvested at 24 h post-transfection. Supernatants containing the virus were collected, cleared by centrifugation (1,620 × g;10 min), and concentrated using Amicon Ultracel concentration tubes (Millipore, MA). For confocal microscopy and immunoblotting, 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown in 24-well plates and at day 6 of differentiation were incubated for 24 h with 200 μl of 10-fold concentrated GFP or Snapin lentivirus containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of culture medium. Experiments were performed at 5 days post-transduction. siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—Snapin siRNAs at a final concentration of 10 nm were transfected into mouse NIH3T3 cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen), and cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. For electroporation of selected siRNAs, 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 5 of differentiation were electroporated with either 20 nmol of control non-targeting siRNA or Snapin siRNA. Briefly, three 10-cm dishes of adipocytes were trypsinized and washed twice in PBS by resuspension and centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and this was divided between two 0.4-cm cuvettes (Bio-Rad) containing either control or Snapin siRNAs. Cells were electroporated by delivery of one 200 V/cm, 10-ms pulse using an ECM-830 electroporator (BTX Technologies, Inc., Holliston, MA). Cells were then transferred to gelatin-coated 12-well plates. At 72 h post electroporation, glucose uptake was measured, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-Snapin and as a control, rabbit anti-14-3-3 antibodies. Glucose Uptake Assays—2-[3H]Deoxyglucose uptake was measured in 12-well plates using siRNA-electroporated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as previously described (27Malide D. Ramm G. Cushman S.W. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of Snapin as an Exo70-binding Protein—To identify new effectors of the exocyst subunit Exo70, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library was performed using full-length rat Exo70 as bait. This screen identified 37 positive clones. Seven of these cDNA clones represented full-length mouse Snapin (accession number AF086838). The interaction between rat Exo70 and mouse Snapin in the yeast two-hybrid system was confirmed by the detection of X-α-galactosidase or β-galactosidase activity in plate (data not shown) or liquid (Fig. 1A) assays, respectively. Snapin Associates with the Exocyst Complex in Vivo—To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results and characterize the association between Snapin with Exo70 in vivo, HEK cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Snapin and HA-tagged Exo70, and their association was analyzed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitations with Myc antibody but not with control IgG pulled down HA-Exo70 (Fig. 1C). Likewise, Myc-Snapin was present in Exo70-HA immunoprecipitates. To explore the association of Snapin with endogenous Exo70, overexpressed Myc-Snapin was immunoprecipitated and bound endogenous Exo70 detected using anti-Exo70 antibodies. In addition to endogenous Exo70, at least two other components of the exocyst complex, Sec6 and Sec8, were coprecipitated with Myc-Snapin (Fig. 1B). The presence of other exocyst subunits in the precipitated complex was not analyzed, because antibodies to these other exocyst components were not readily available. To further confirm the association between Snapin and Exo70 established above, we analyzed the colocalization of Myc-Snapin and HA-Exo70 overexpressed in COS-1 cells by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was substantial colocalization between Myc-Snapin and HA-Exo70 in the perinuclear region of the cells as well as in punctate structures near the plasma membrane of cellular protrusions. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate an association of Snapin with the exocyst complex by a direct interaction with the Exo70 subunit. Exo70 Interacts with a Helical Domain in the C Terminus of Snapin—Snapin contains an N-terminal hydrophobic domain (amino acids 1–20) and two helical domains (amino acids 37–65 and 83–119), the second of which is the major binding site for SNAP23 (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To map the Exo70 binding domain in Snapin, a series of FLAG-Snapin truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 2A). These constructs were then coexpressed with Exo70-HA in COS-1 cells, and their interaction was monitored in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. As shown above for Myc-Snapin, FLAG-Snapin robustly interacted with Exo70-HA (Fig. 2B). N-terminal (FLAG-Snapin Δ1–21) or C-terminal (FLAG-Snapin Δ120–136) deletions in Snapin did not affect binding to Exo70. A mutant containing only the C terminus (FLAG-Snapin Δ1–83) could not be detected by immunoblotting probably due to instability of the truncated protein (data not shown and Ref. 22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Individual deletion of either the second helical domain (FLAG-Snapin Δ84–118) or the C terminus (FLAG-Snapin Δ84–136) revealed that the presence of the second helical domain is critical for binding to Exo70. Thus, the Exo70 binding domain in Snapin maps to the second helical domain and interestingly overlaps with the SNAP23 binding site (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Snapin Interacts with an N-terminal Coiled-coil Domain in Exo70—To delineate the Snapin binding domain in Exo70, a series of HA-Exo70 truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 3A) and coexpressed with FLAG-Snapin in COS1 cells for use in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3B, Snapin showed a robust interaction with the N-terminal half of Exo70 (HA-Exo70 Δ384–653), but little if any association with the C terminus (HA-Exo70 Δ1–383). Further dissection of the N-terminal half of Exo70 revealed an interaction exclusively with amino acids 1–99 (HA-Exo70 Δ100–653) and not 100–384 (HA-Exo70 Δ100–385) (Fig. 3B). The ability of the N terminus of Exo70 to directly interact with Snapin was confirmed in vitro using pulldown experiments with GST-Exo70 fusion proteins and purified His-tagged Snapin. There was a significant interaction between GST-Exo70 and His-Snapin (Fig. 3C), whereas no binding of His-Snapin was observed using GST alone. The GST-Exo70 Δ100–653 truncation mutant interacted with His-Snapin with a similar efficiency as full-length Exo70, confirming the importance of the N terminus of Exo70 for the interaction. These experiments confirm a direct interaction between Snapin and Exo70 and map the interaction domain in Exo70 to the N-terminal 99 residues. Interestingly, computational modeling of the Exo70 amino acid sequence revealed a putative coiled-coil domain within this region of the Exo70 N terminus. Exo70 and SNAP23 Compete for Binding to Snapin—Because Exo70 and SNAP23 apparently interact with an overlapping region in Snapin (see above, supplemental data, and Ref. 22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we determined if Exo70 and SNAP23 simultaneously bind to Snapin, or if their association with Snapin is mutually exclusive. For this purpose, equal amounts of MBP-SNAP23 immobilized on amylose beads were incubated with His-Snapin in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-Exo70, GST alone, or Exo70 cleaved from the GST moiety. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), the interaction between Snapin and SNAP23 was significantly reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of either GST-Exo70 or cleaved Exo70 but not GST alone. We have been unable to detect any significant interaction between Exo70 and SNAP23 (data not shown), consistent with the notion that Exo70 and SNAP23 compete for the same binding site in Snapin. Subcellular Distribution of Snapin—The Snapin-binding proteins Exo70 and SNAP23 have been shown to play a role in the final stages of GLUT4 trafficking (9Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 28Kawanishi M. Tamori Y. Okazawa H. Araki S. Skinoda H. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Snapin itself has been previously implicated in regulated exocytic events such as calcium-induced neurosecretion (29Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of Snapin in vesicle docking/fusion we next studied the role of Snapin in GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes. Snapin was readily detected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 5B) and was predominantly targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast to SNAP23, but similar to Exo70, Snapin was present in both low and high density membrane fractions (Fig. 5A) in adipocytes. Stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin, which results in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5A), did not affect the subcellular distribution of Snapin. As previously reported for the exocyst (9Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), an enrichment of Exo70 in the plasma membrane fraction was observed after insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Snapin Modulates Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Trafficking—To explore a possible functional role for Snapin in insulin-regulated GLUT4 vesicle trafficking, we next studied the effect of modulating Snapin expression on insulin action in adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with lentivirus expressing full-length Myc-Snapin. Despite some variability in Snapin expression between individual cells, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that >90% of the cells in the culture were expressing Myc-Snapin. Moreover, immunoblotting revealed a protein product of the expected size for Myc-Snapin in adipocytes (data not shown). The localization of Myc-Snapin was indistinguishable from the endogenous protein indicating that the protein was not vastly overexpressed using this approach (Fig. 5B). Cells overexpressing Myc-Snapin did not exhibit any impairment in insulin-stimulated glucose transport (data not shown). We also expressed a range of Snapin mutants in adipocytes using this same approach, but again we were unable to detect any impairment in insulin action (data not shown). We next examined the effects of reduced Snapin expression on insulin action using RNA interference. As shown in Fig. 6A, we identified four different siRNAs that efficiently reduced Snapin protein levels when transfected either individually or as a pool into either NIH3T3 or 3T3-L1 cells. The expression of control proteins, either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 14-3-3 was unaffected under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 6B, reduced Snapin expression had no effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in either the absence of insulin or in the presence of a maximum dose of insulin. However, at submaximal concentrations of insulin, where we observed an ∼2-fold effect of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in control cells, reduced Snapin expression resulted in a blunted response. These observations implicate a role for Snapin in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes likely by modulating the tethering or docking/fusion of GLUT4 containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. Snapin was originally identified in a human brain yeast two-hybrid screen as an SNAP25 interacting protein (29Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This initial study suggested Snapin was a neuronal-specific protein, because a Snapin-specific antibody was unable to detect Snapin in other tissues. It was later demonstrated by Northern blotting and subsequent Western blotting, that Snapin is ubiquitously expressed and in fact also can bind the SNAP25 homologue SNAP23 (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the latter study did not address the functional significance of the SNAP23 and Snapin interaction. In the present studies, Snapin was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an Exo70-binding protein. Snapin was shown to associate, through Exo70, with additional exocyst components, suggesting that it interacts with the native exocyst complex. Buxton and colleagues (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have previously shown that Snapin can also form a complex with SNAP23 and Syntaxin4 in vitro. This finding is interesting, because Snapin may represent a prime candidate for mediating or regulating exocyst and SNARE complex interactions. Because SNAP23 and Exo70 appear to bind Snapin in the same C-terminal portion, it is interesting to speculate that crosstalk between exocyst and SNARE complexes may be transferred by sequential binding to Snapin. In vivo binding experiments demonstrated that the Snapin interaction is mediated through the N-terminal 99 amino acids of Exo70. The crystal structure of yeast Exo70p was recently published (31Hamburger Z.A. Hamburger A.E. West A.P. Weis W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and sequence alignments suggest that the mammalian orthologues have similar structural domains. Exo70p consists of multiple helical bundles, which are divided into three domains to form an elongated structure. Interestingly, the first 99 amino acids are predominantly surface-exposed residues, which is consistent with them contributing to a protein interaction site. The N terminus of Exo70 also serves as the binding site for TC10, and overexpression of the N terminus of Exo70 (Exo70-N: amino acid 1–384) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was shown to inhibit fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane (9Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutant is thought to be due to competitive displacement of endogenous Exo70 for TC10 binding sites. Based on our findings, an alternative explanation is that the Exo70-N mutant competes for binding of Snapin on the plasma membrane. Experiments in chromaffin cells suggest a positive regulatory role for Snapin in exocytosis (30Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This study showed that Snapin is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, resulting in its enhanced affinity for SNAP25 and an increased association of synaptotagmin with SNARE complexes. Overexpression of a phosphomimetic Snapin mutant resulted in increased exocytosis of large dense core vesicles. Earlier studies demonstrated that overexpression of the C terminus of Snapin or injection of Snapin peptides corresponding to the SNAP25 binding site have a slight inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission (29Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this study, knockdown of Snapin caused a reduction in insulinstimulated glucose transport. This effect was only observed at submaximal insulin concentrations likely, because the knockdown of endogenous Snapin was incomplete. Snapin knockout mice have recently been described (32Tian J.H. Wu Z.X. Unzicker M. Lu L. Cai Q. Li C.L. Schirra C. Matti U. Stevens D. Deng C.X. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10546-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and consistent with our findings, Snapin was shown to have a modulatory role in neurosecretion, because the absence of Snapin resulted in significantly reduced exocytosis in embryonic chromaffin cells. We speculate that reduction of Snapin may impair the dialogue between the exocyst and SNARE complex assembly. We did not observe any consequence of over expression of Snapin or C-terminal truncation mutants on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes (data not shown). This may denote that these proteins were not expressed at sufficiently high levels to observe a phenotype. This interpretation is consistent with a more recent publication re-investigating the role of Snapin in neurosecretion (33Vites O. Rhee J.S. Schwarz M. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26251-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to the two prior studies, Vites and co-authors were unable to observe defects in synaptic transmission induced by Snapin mutant overexpression. The overexpression studies performed in the present studies, however, do not exclude a role for Snapin in GLUT4 trafficking, because it cannot be confirmed that overexpression of Snapin wt and/or mutants would have a dominant negative effect. The presence of the endogenous Snapin may be sufficient to allow normal GLUT4-trafficking events. Our data thus suggest that, although Snapin may not ultimately be required, it plays a positive role, possibly by regulating the fidelity of GLUT4 vesicle docking. Future work will elucidate the precise mechanism of action of Snapin in targeting, docking, or fusion of GLUT4 vesicles and explore the physiological role of Snapin in glucose homeostasis. The present studies have thus identified a novel interaction of Snapin with the exocyst and a novel modulatory role for Snapin in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 vesicle transport in adipocytes.

The Genesis Discovery mission returned independent samples of three types of solar wind produced by different solar processes that provide a check on possible isotopic variations, or fractionation, between the solar-wind and solar-surface material. At a high level of precision, we observed no significant inter-regime differences in 20 Ne/ 22 Ne or 36 Ar/ 38 Ar values.

We have for the first time studied the physiological role of these proteins in CFTR regulation in native tissue by determining CFTR-dependent chloride current in NHERF-1- and NHERF-2-deficient mice. The cAMP- and cGMP-activated chloride current and the basal chloride current in basolaterally permeabilized jejunum were reduced by ∼30% in NHERF-1-deficient mice but not in NHERF-2-deficient mice. The duodenal bicarbonate secretion was affected in a similar way, whereas no significant differences in CFTR activity were observed in ileum. CFTR abundance as determined by Western blotting was unaltered in jejunal epithelial cells and brush border membranes of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 mutant mice. However, semi-quantitative detection of CFTR by confocal microscopy showed that the level of apically localized CFTR in jejunal crypts was reduced by ∼35% in NHERF-1-deficient and NHERF-1/2 double deficient mice but not in NHERF-2 null mice. Together our results indicate that NHERF-1 is required for full activation of CFTR in murine duodenal and jejunal mucosa and that NHERF-1 affects the local distribution of CFTR in or near the plasma membrane. These studies provide the first evidence in native intestinal epithelium that NHERF-1 but not NHERF-2 is involved in the formation of CFTR-containing functional complexes that serve to position CFTR in the crypt apical membrane and/or to optimize its function as a cAMP- and cGMP-regulated anion channel.

Science. 1992; 256: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). CFTR is the major cAMP- and cGMP-activated anion transporter in various epithelia including intestinal crypt cells, where it is essential for electrolyte and fluid secretion, as is apparent from the occurrence of life-threatening intestinal obstruction in ∼10% of newborn cystic fibrosis patients. On the other hand, overstimulation of CFTR by bacterial enterotoxins causes secretory diarrhea, leading to the death of millions of children per year in the developing world (2Field M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).The C terminus of CFTR can bind to several PDZ domain-containing proteins (3Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules that bind to short stretches of amino acids, usually at the extreme C terminus of their target proteins. Most PDZ domain proteins contain more than one PDZ domain or other protein-interacting modules, thereby facilitating the formation of macromolecular complexes, which is important for targeting, trafficking, and multi-protein complex formation of their binding partners.Several studies have indicated that binding of CFTR to members of the NHERF family of PDZ domain proteins may be important for regulation of activity and for maintaining correct localization in the apical membrane where the NHERF proteins as well as CFTR are localized. Three of the four members of the NHERF family of PDZ proteins present in the intestinal brush border are known to bind to CFTR (5Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Thelin W.R. Hodson C.A. Milgram S.L. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NHERF-1 (also named NHERF and EBP50) and NHERF-2 (also named E3KARP, SIP-1, and TKA-1) share a structural homology; they contain tandem PDZ domains and a C-terminal ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding domain, which anchors the proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. PDZK1 (also known as CAP70, NaPi-CAP1, and more recently as NHERF-3) contains four PDZ domains but no ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding domain (7Raghuram V. Hormuth H. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These roles include: 1) increasing cAMP-dependent activation of CFTR by positioning the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the vicinity of CFTR where it can efficiently phosphorylate its substrate (11Sun F.

This corresponds to the mechanism whereby NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 facilitate formation of a NHE3/NHERF/ezrin/cAMP-dependent protein kinase complex, which is required for inhibition of NHE3 (Na+/H+ exchanger 3) (9Donowitz M.

All of the previous studies were performed using cell culture systems expressing different amounts and members of the NHERF family proteins (endogenously or using overexpressing systems) or recombinant proteins (e.g. C-terminally truncated CFTR or CFTR fragments), which may have contributed to the different outcomes of similar experiments.To further investigate the role of the NHERF proteins as regulators of CFTR in a physiological context and to study the functions of the isoforms separately, we have studied CFTR regulation in native intestinal epithelia from mice lacking NHERF-1, NHERF-2, or both. We demonstrate that NHERF-1, but not NHERF-2, is essential for full activation of transepithelial chloride and bicarbonate secretion by cAMP and cGMP and that the immunostaining intensity of CFTR in the jejunal crypts of NHERF-1 deficient mice is reduced.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Using a previously described retroviral trapping method (23Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), Lexicon Genetics generated NHERF-2-deficient mice using Omnibank clone OST2298. The retroviral gene trap cassette pVICTR22, containing an optimal splice acceptor sequence that causes mis-splicing of the targeted gene and puromycin resistance as a selectable marker was found to be inserted 157 bp 3′ of the second exon (see Fig. 1A). The mice were genotyped by two-allele three-primer PCR, using genomic DNA isolated from tail clips; primers 1 (5′-TTCTATAAGCCTCCATTTCCTCT-3′) and 3 (5′-CCCACCCCCATCGCTGCTC-3′) were used for detection of the wild type (WT) allele. Primer 2 (5′-GCGCCAGTCCTCCGATTGA-3′) is complementary to a sequence in the 5′ long terminal repeat of the retroviral insert and serves to amplify the mutant allele in combination with primer 1. PCR of tail clips was performed using 0.4 μm of each primer, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs (Promega), 0.3 units of RedTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma), and the supplied buffer. The sizes of the PCR products were 303 bp for the wild type and 231 bp for the mutant allele (see Fig. 1C).NHERF-1-deficient mice were originally generated at the Duke University Medical Center and have been described before (24Shenolikar S.

NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 mice were backcrossed for at least five generations into the FVB/n genetic background. Furthermore, NHERF-1-deficient mice were crossed with NHERF-2-deficient mice and with mice carrying a targeted disruption in the CFTR gene described previously (also from the FVB genetic background) (25Ratcliff R. Evans M.J. Cuthbert A.W. MacVinish L.J. Foster D. Anderson J.R. Colledge W.H. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous reports (24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the viability and fertility of female NHERF-1 null mice was not different from wild type, probably because of breeding into the FVB/n genetic background.The mice were housed in the animal facilities of the Erasmus Medical Centre of Rotterdam and the Medical School of Hannover under standardized light and climate conditions and ad libitum access to water and chow. All of the animal experiments were approved by the Dutch Animal Welfare Committee and followed the protocols at the Hannover Medical School and the local authorities for the regulation of animal welfare (Regierungspräsidium). Both male and female animals were used for studies at 12-20 weeks of age. The mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100 and 20 mg/kg respectively, intraperitoneally) and euthanized by cervical dislocation after removal of tissue.Bioelectric Measurements—Short circuit currents (Isc) of muscle-stripped ileal and jejunal sheets mounted in Ussing chambers were measured as described previously (26Vaandrager A.B. Bajnath R. Groot J.A. Bot A.G. De Jonge H.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G958-G965PubMed Google Scholar). Transepithelial PD was clamped at 0 mV, and Isc was measured using a DVC-1000 voltage/current clamp (World Precision Instruments), digitized by a Digidata 1320, and analyzed using Axo-Scope 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). After stabilization of the base-line current or the previous response the following agents were added: 8-Br-cGMP (serosal, 200 μm), forskolin (serosal, 10 μm), and d-glucose (mucosal, 10 mm). To determine whether the observed changes in the NHERF-1-deficient mice (see “Results”) were the direct consequence of reduced CFTR activity or whether NHERF-1 deficiency affects activity of basolateral ion transporters and/or the driving force for chloride secretion, the basolateral membrane was permeabilized to monovalent ions using nystatin during the Isc measurements (27Bijvelds M.J. Jorna H. Verkade H.J. Bot A.G. Hofmann F. Agellon L.B. Sinaasappel M. de Jonge H.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G870-G879Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After stabilization of the base-line current, an inward transepithelial chloride gradient was generated by iso-osmotic replacement of chloride in the serosal bath by mannitol. The ionophore nystatin was added at the serosal side at 0.36 g/ml. Forskolin (serosal, 10 μm) and glucose (mucosal, 10 mm) were subsequently added after stabilization of the current.Bicarbonate Secretion—Isolated proximal duodenum was stripped of external serosal and muscle layers. Duodenal mucosa was mounted in a gas-lifted Ussing chamber and maintained at 37 °C. The mucosal side was bathed with unbuffered bicarbonate-free Ringer's solution, and the serosal side was bathed with buffered gassed Ringer's solution (pH 7.4) containing 22 mm HCO-3. Under control of a pH-stat system (PHM290, pH-Stat Controller, Radiometer Copenhagen), the luminal pH was maintained at 7.4 by continuous infusion of 1 mm HCl. The amount infused/time unit was used to quantitate HCO-3 secretion (μmol·cm-2·h-1). After measuring basal secretion for 30 min, forskolin (10 μm) or 8-Br-cGMP (200 μm) was added at the serosal side, and changes in bicarbonate secretion were determined during a 40-min period.Isolation of Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Brush Border Membrane Vesicles (BBMVs)—Mechanical high frequency vibration was used to isolate epithelial cells from mouse jejunum in isotonic buffer as described before (28Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pohler D. Hausler C. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). BBMVs were isolated from epithelial cell homogenates by differential magnesium precipitation (29Van Dommelen F.S. Hamer C.M. De Jonge H.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Epithelial tissue and BBMVs were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and homogenized by brief sonication on ice. The protein concentrations were determined using the RC DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—For quantitative analysis of the relevant proteins in epithelial cells and BBMVs, samples from at least two mice were pooled. Crude extracts from other tissues were prepared by snap-freezing and homogenization in Laemmli sample buffer (containing Complete protease inhibitor) followed by brief sonication on ice. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protean nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience Hybond-P) or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 2.5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used were anti-CFTR antibody R3195 (dilution 1:1000) (30French P.J. van Doorninck J.H. Peters R.H. Verbeek E. Ameen N.A. Marino C.R. de Jonge H.R. Bijman J. Scholte B.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), anti-NHERF-1 antibody (dilution 1:3000) (31Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J.

An antibody against PDZK1 was generated in rabbit against a peptide (amino acids 339-354 of mouse PDZK1), and serum was affinity-purified on peptide-bound agarose beads. The signal on Western blots was completely blocked by the peptide (0.5 mm; data not shown). After incubation with primary antibody and washing, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences; dilution, 1:3000) was employed for detection of all primary antibodies except anti-actin, which was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE International; dilution, 1:5000). The secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico substrate; Pierce) by exposing to light sensitive imaging film (Biomax MR film; Kodak). The imaged bands were quantified using a calibrated GS-800 densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Quantity-one software (version 4.2.1; Bio-Rad).Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 μm) from mice of different genotypes were prepared on the same slide. After deparaffinization with xylene and treatment with 0.01 m sodium citrate solution, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.6% H2O2 and 0.12% sodium azide. Sections were incubated with anti-CFTR (R3195, 1:100) or anti-NHERF-1 (1:500) antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% bovine albumin for 1.5 h at room temperature. The sections stained with monoclonal anti-villin antibody (Santa Cruz; SC-58897; dilution, 1:50) were incubated overnight. The slides were subsequently incubated for 2 h with fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody and/or Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:100, both secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence micrographs were captured using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with a 25 milliwatt argon laser. Fluorescence emission after excitation (488 nm for CFTR, 543 nm for villin) was detected using 10×/0.3 or 40×/1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion lenses, a dichroic beam splitter reflecting 488-nm excitation light, and a 505-530 bandpass emission filter (560-615 nm for villin). The images were scanned using a 75-μm pinhole. Initial analysis of images was performed double-blind by at least two investigators. For (semi)quantification of signal from jejunal crypts, images from longitudinal sections at Z-steps of 0.5 μm were analyzed by determining total background-subtracted fluorescent signal using KS400 Zeiss software. The same threshold was utilized for all images from one slide. Three individual crypts from three age- and sex-matched mice of each genotype were analyzed.Data Analysis—The data are the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was established using Student's unpaired two-tailed t test.RESULTSGeneration and Characterization of NHERF-2-deficient Mice—NHERF-2-deficient mice were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Insertion of the retroviral cassette resulted in a complete absence of NHERF-2 protein in all tissues studied (kidney, lung, stomach, heart, brain, and colon; a representative example of a Western blot is shown in Fig. 1B). NHERF-2 null mice developed normally and were born at Mendelian ratios. They showed no obvious alterations in gross morphology, body size, and fertility. No abnormal behavior or signs of distress were apparent. Histological analysis of various tissues (lung, kidney, jejunum, ileum and colon, and nasal and tracheal epithelium) displayed comparable morphology in wild type and NHERF-2-deficient mice (data not shown).cAMP- and cGMP-dependent Activation of CFTR-mediated Ion Transport in NHERF-1- and NHERF-2-deficient Mice—Several studies using cultured cells have indicated an important role for the NHERF proteins in the activation of CFTR (10Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). By using mice deficient in NHERF-1, NHERF-2, or both, we were able to analyze native epithelia ex vivo, avoiding potential artifacts introduced by using overexpression systems or recombinant proteins. First, cAMP- and cGMP-activated CFTR transepithelial short circuit currents (Isc) were measured in mice of the different genotypes. As shown in Fig. 2A (panel 1), the response to the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin was significantly reduced in jejunum of NHERF-1-deficient mice (34% reduction, p < 0.05), whereas the response in NHERF-2-deficient mice was not altered. The response to forskolin in NHERF-1/2 double deficient mice was reduced by 37% (p < 0.05) compared with wild type. Thus, additional absence of NHERF-2 did not result in a stronger effect or different characteristics of transepithelial current in response to cAMP, suggesting that an absence of NHERF-1 was not compensated by NHERF-2.FIGURE 2Ex vivo CFTR-mediated short circuit current (Isc) measurement in Ussing chambers using jejunal (A, panels 1-3) and ileal (B, panels 1-3) tissue. Activation of short circuit current by forskolin (10 μm)(panels 1), 8-Br-cGMP (200 μm)(panels 2), and glucose (10 mm)(panels 3) was measured in WT and NHERF-1-deficient (N1-/-), NHERF-2-deficient (N2-/-), NHERF-1/2 double deficient (N1/2-/-), and NHERF-1/CFTR double deficient (N1/CFTR-/-) mice. The data represent average values from at least seven mice/genotype and are expressed as the means ± S.E. Forskolin-stimulated Isc is significantly reduced in jejunum of NHERF-1- and NHERF-1/2-deficient mice, but not in NHERF-2 null mice. The near absence of CFTR activity in NHERF-1/CFTR double deficient mice shows that no alternative anion channel is active in NHERF-1 null mice. Stimulation of Isc by glucose showed full preservation of this marker of villus function in the NHERF-1- and NHERF-2-deficient mice. The glucose-stimulated Isc was actually slightly higher in the jejunum from NHERF-1/2-deficient mice (25%) compared with wild type mice (A, panel 3). Identical experiments were performed using ileal intestinal epithelial tissue (B, panels 1-3). ns, not significant. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We subsequently examined whether cGMP-dependent regulation of CFTR was affected similarly. As shown in a previous study, cGMP-dependent inhibition of another intestinal ion transporter in the apical membrane, NHE3, is selective in its requirement for the NHERF proteins in comparison with cAMP-dependent inhibition. Whereas NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 were interchangeable as mediators of cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3, only NHERF-2 could act as a cofactor for cGMP-mediated inhibition (33Cha B. Kim J.H. Hut H. Hogema B.M. Nadarja J. Zizak M. Cavet M. Lee-Kwon W. Lohmann S.M. Smolenski A. Tse C.M. Yun C. de Jonge H.R. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16642-16650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results show that CFTR activation by cAMP and cGMP in the jejunum was reduced to a similar extent in NHERF-1-deficient mice (Fig. 2). Stimulation of Isc by the membrane-permeable analog 8-Br-cGMP was significantly decreased (31%, p < 0.05) in NHERF-1-deficient mice as compared with wild type, whereas no change was observed in NHERF-2-deficient mice. Again, the phenotype of NHERF-1/2 null mice was similar to that of NHERF-1-deficient mice (32% reduction in Isc compared with NHERF-2 deficient mice, p < 0.05).To compare the relative functional quality of the various sheets of muscle-stripped epithelia, stimulation of the short circuit current by glucose (monitoring sodium transport mediated by the Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1) was determined as a measure for CFTR-independent electrogenic transport. The response to glucose was not significantly different in mice lacking NHERF-1 or NHERF-2, with the exception of the NHERF-1/2 double-mutant mice, in which the response in jejunum was increased by 25% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A, panel 3).An identical series of experiments was performed using ileal tissue. In contrast to jejunum, the response to forskolin or 8-Br-cGMP was not significantly reduced in epithelium from ileum of mice lacking NHERF-1, NHERF-2, or both (Fig. 2B). Finally, the glucose-stimulated Isc was not affected by NHERF-1 or NHERF-2 deficiency (Fig. 2A, panel 3).To test whether cAMP- and cGMP-dependent responses in NHERF-1-deficient mice were entirely CFTR-dependent, as they are in wild type mice, short circuit current measurements were performed in mice lacking both NHERF-1 and CFTR. As shown in Fig. 2, the response to forskolin and 8-Br-cGMP was completely abolished in both jejunum and ileum of these mice, demonstrating that the currents measured in NHERF-1 null mouse intestine were fully CFTR-mediated and that no compensatory anion channel is active. Altogether, these results demonstrate that NHERF-1, but not NHERF-2, is required for full cAMP- and cGMP-dependent activation of CFTR-dependent anion transport in jejunum but not in ileum.The reduced forskolin-and 8-Br-cGMP-activated CFTR-dependent chloride current in NHERF-1 null mice could either result from a direct effect on the amount and/or gating of CFTR in the apical membrane or by reduction of the required driving force for chloride secretion, which is generated by several basolateral ion transport proteins (34Barrett K.E. Keely S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 535-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To discriminate between these possibilities, nystatin was used to permeabilize the basolateral membrane during short circuit current measurements. First, an inwardly directed chloride gradient was generated by iso-osmotic replacement of chloride to mannitol at the serosal side. Subsequent permeabilization of the basolateral membrane to m"

In a previous study, we demonstrated in kidney proximal cells that the TASK2 channel was involved in the K+ efflux that occurred during regulatory volume decrease. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the TASK2 channel in the regulation of AVD and apoptosis phenomenon. For this purpose renal cells were immortalized from primary cultures of proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) from wild type and TASK2 knock-out mice (task2-/-). Apoptosis was induced by staurosporine, cyclosporin A, or tumor necrosis factor α. Cell volume, K+ conductance, caspase-3, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were monitored during AVD. In wild type PCT cells the K+ conductance activated during AVD exhibited characteristics of TASK2 currents. In task2-/- PCT cells, AVD and caspase activation were reduced by 59%. Whole cell recordings indicated that large conductance calcium-activated K+ currents inhibited by iberiotoxin (BK channels) partially compensated for the deletion of TASK2 K+ currents in the task2-/- PCT cells. This result explained the residual AVD measured in these cells. In both cell lines, apoptosis was mediated via intracellular ROS increase. Moreover AVD, K+ conductances, and caspase-3 were strongly impaired by ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, the main K+ channels involved in staurosporine, cyclosporin A, and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced AVD are TASK2 K+ channels in proximal wild type cells and iberiotoxin-sensitive BK channels in proximal task2-/- cells.

Like many epithelial cells, renal cells are capable of regulating their volume in response to variations in external osmotic pressure (1Coca-Prados M. Anguita J. Chalfant M.L. Civan M.M. Am. J.

Briefly, cells respond to an increase in medium osmolarity by a process referred to as regulatory volume increase, whereas cells respond to the dilution of external medium by a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) 2The abbreviations used are:RVDregulatory volume decreaseAVDapoptotic volume decreaseChTxcharybdotoxinIbTXiberiotoxinSTSstaurosporineCsAcyclosporin ATNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αROSreactive oxygen speciescarboxy-H2DCFDA(5-and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateTEAtetraethylammoniumNACN-acetylcysteine. 2The abbreviations used are:RVDregulatory volume decreaseAVDapoptotic volume decreaseChTxcharybdotoxinIbTXiberiotoxinSTSstaurosporineCsAcyclosporin ATNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αROSreactive oxygen speciescarboxy-H2DCFDA(5-and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateTEAtetraethylammoniumNACN-acetylcysteine. (4Pedersen S.F. Mills J.W. Hoffmann E.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A variety of transport pathways have been implicated in both processes and result in rapid water flux across the plasma membrane, which causes cells to recuperate their initial volume correspondingly (5Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Along the proximal tubule, the cells are submitted to hypotonic shock because water accompanies the transport of ions by membrane co-transports. In response to this osmotic stress, the proximal cells undergo a RVD process that is characterized by an exit of Cl- and K+ ions, which finally drives water efflux (6Knoblauch C. Montrose M.H. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C252-C259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, changes in cell volume are not only due to variation in medium osmolarity. It is now well established that the initial process leading toward apoptotic cell death is coupled to normotonic cell shrinkage (7Maeno E. Ishizaki Y. Kanaseki T. Hazama A. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9487-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), called apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). The proximal tubule is a major site of agent-induced nephrotoxicity (drugs, heavy metals, hypoxia etc.), which can induce AVD and lead to cell death by apoptosis. It is therefore interesting to understand the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. As in RVD, the changes in cell volume during AVD are the consequence of an exit of Cl- and K+ from the cells, and the question arises as to whether the Cl- and the K+ currents are driven by the same type of channels (8Okada Y. Maeno E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The AVD-induced Cl- channel has been identified as a volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying Cl- channel in both HeLa cells and cardiomyocytes treated with staurosporine (9Shimizu T. Numata T. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6770-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Okada Y. Shimizu T. Maeno E. Tanabe S. Wang X. Takahashi N. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 209: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This channel shares many properties with the Cl- channel that are induced in RVD in mouse proximal cells (5Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of this Cl- channel is not fully elucidated, but the literature data converges toward the conclusion that this Cl- channel type is probably ubiquitously expressed in animal cells (7Maeno E. Ishizaki Y. Kanaseki T. Hazama A. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9487-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). By contrast, the molecular identity of the K+ channel involved in both AVD and RVD is still under discussion because different candidates have been proposed depending on the tissue under study (8Okada Y. Maeno E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Burg E.D. Remillard C.V. Yuan J.X. J. Membr.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that TASK2 channels were expressed in kidney proximal cells. These channels were involved in the K+ and Cl- efflux that occurred during RVD. TASK2 belongs to the family of two pore domains K+ channels. Interestingly, Trimarchi et al. (13Trimarchi J.R. Liu L. Smith P.J. Keefe D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C588-C594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that two-pore domain K+ channels underlie K+ efflux during AVD in mouse embryos. Based on these observations, it was reasonable to postulate that TASK2 K+ channels could also be involved in the regulation of AVD and apoptosis in the proximal tubules. Thus, the present study addresses the role of TASK2 in apoptosis induced by staurosporine. In a large variety of cells, staurosporine is known to induce apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated pathway and to increase oxidative stress by the production of ROS generated by the mitochondria (9Shimizu T. Numata T. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6770-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Gil J. Almeida S. Oliveira C.R. Rego A.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1500-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In proximal cells, this mitochondrial mechanism may be the predominant mode of inducing apoptosis in the presence of many nephrotoxic agents (19Thevenod F.

Therefore, the staurosporine-induced apoptosis is a useful model to assess the role of ion channels in controlling apoptosis in renal cells. The present study was conducted on proximal tubule cell lines originating from wild type and task2-/- mice. In wild type mice, we demonstrated that staurosporine-induced AVD was mainly associated with the activity of TASK2 K+ channels. Surprisingly, staurosporine-induced AVD persisted in the task2-/- proximal cell line and could be controlled by a Ca2+-activated K+ channel that is sensitive to iberiotoxin. regulatory volume decrease apoptotic volume decrease charybdotoxin iberiotoxin staurosporine cyclosporin A tumor necrosis factor-α reactive oxygen species (5-and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate tetraethylammonium N-acetylcysteine regulatory volume decrease apoptotic volume decrease charybdotoxin iberiotoxin staurosporine cyclosporin A tumor necrosis factor-α reactive oxygen species (5-and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate tetraethylammonium N-acetylcysteine Transformation of Primary Cultures with pSV3 neo and Culture Protocol—The primary cell culture technique has been described in detail in previous studies (22Belfodil R. Barriere H. Rubera I. Tauc M. Poujeol C. Bidet M. Poujeol P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F812-F828Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-day-old primary cultures of S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules from wild type and task2-/- mice were transfected with pSV3 neo using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). After 48 h, selection of the clones was performed by the addition of G418 (500 μg/ml). Culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12, Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) containing 250 μg/ml G418, 15 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), growth factors (23Barriere H. Rubera I. Belfodil R. Tauc M. Tonnerieux N. Poujeol C. Barhanin J. Poujeol P. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193: 153-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and 1% FCS was changed every day. Resistant clones were isolated, subcultured, and used after 10 trypsinization steps. Immortalized proximal wild type and task2-/- cell lines were grown on collagen-coated supports (35-mm Petri dishes) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in the culture medium described above. Apoptosis Induction—Apoptosis was induced by staurosporine (STS, 1 μm), cyclosporin A (CsA, 25 μm), or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, 0.5 ng/ml) in proximal wild type and task2-/- cell lines that were maintained in serum and growth factor-free culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, Sigma) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Staurosporine (STS) and cyclosporin A (CsA) were dissolved in Me2SO. The quantity of Me2SO added to the incubation solutions never exceeded 0.1%. Control experiments were performed by incubating the cells with 0.1% Me2SO only. Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was measured using colorimetric assays (CaspACE™ assay system, colorimetric, Promega). The activity was assayed in triplicate or quadruplicate on protein extracts obtained after lysis of transformed proximal wild type and task2-/- cells. As indicated by the supplier, the involvement of other related proteases was excluded by observing the difference between color intensity in the absence and presence of a specific caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-VAD). The absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an Automated Microplate Reader ELX-800 (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Apoptotic Cell Counts—STS-induced apoptosis was studied in wild type and task2-/- cell lines. Cells were grown in 35-mm Petri dishes. After an appropriate incubation with the apoptosis inductor (STS), living cells were carefully washed with fresh culture medium and incubated 10 min in the presence of Hoechst-33258 (50 μm) and propidium iodide (1 μm). Digital micrographs were successively taken at 455 nm for Hoechst-33258 and 585 nm for propidium iodide. Afterward, the cell preparation was washed and stained with orcein solution (250 mg of orcein, 2 ml of ethanol 70%, 150 μl of HCl, 12 n). Micrographs of orcein-stained cells were then taken. Thus in a given culture, the same zone was visualized after individual staining with Hoechst-33258, propidium iodide, and orcein. Apoptotic cells were counted by comparing the three stains. A cell was considered apoptotic only if the nucleus was not stained by propidium iodide and presented chromatin condensation with visible apoptotic bodies. The counts of apoptotic nuclei were performed directly on the digital micrographs. Between 100 and 200 cells were scored by three different observers who were blinded to the culture conditions. The numbers of cells with DNA condensation and propidium iodide staining were expressed as the percentage of total cells. Cell Volume Measurement—Cell volume was measured by an electronic sizing technique using a CASY 1 cell counter (SCHÁRFE SYSTEM®). Briefly, proximal wild type and task2-/- cells that were exposed to different treatments (STS, CsA, or TNF-α) were rapidly trypsinized (1 times for 45 s), and cell volume measurement was performed just after suspending the cells in Casyton® solution (NaCl isotonic solution). Electrophysiological Studies—Whole cell currents were performed on cultured proximal wild type and task2-/- cells grown on 35-mm Petri dishes maintained at 37 °C for the duration of the experiments. The ruptured whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used. Patch pipettes (2- to 4-megaohm resistance) were made from borosilicate capillary tubes (1.5 mm outer diameter, 1.1 mm inner diameter; Fisher Manufacturing) using a two-stage vertical puller (model PP 830, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were observed using an inverted microscope; the stage of the microscope was equipped with a water robot micromanipulator (model WR 89, Narishige). The patch pipette was connected via an Ag-AgCl wire to the head stage of a patch amplifier (model VP 500, Biologic). The membrane was ruptured by additional suction to achieve the conventional whole cell configuration. Settings available on the amplifier were used to compensate for cell capacitance. The series resistances were not compensated, but experiments in which the series resistance was higher than 20 megaohms were discarded. The offset potentials between both electrodes were zeroed before sealing, and the liquid junction potential was measured experimentally prior to each experiment and corrected accordingly (measured junctions potentials were 11.34 ± 0.79 mV for K+ conductance experiments). Solutions were perfused in the extracellular bath using a four-channel glass pipette, with the tip placed as close as possible to the clamped cell. Voltage-clamp commands, data acquisition, and data analysis were controlled via the VP 500 amplifier connected to a computer. The whole cell currents resulting from voltage stimuli were sampled at 2.5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Cells were held at -50 mV, and 400-ms pulses from -100 to +120 mV were applied in 20-mV increments. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 100 K-gluconate, 25 KHCO3, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with 1 n KOH), 5 MgATP, and 0 or 30 EGTA (Pos = 300 milliosmole/kg of H2O). To avoid spontaneous activation of volume-sensitive K+ currents, the bath solution was slightly hyperosmotic and contained (in mm): 110 NMDG-Cl, 5 glucose, 5 potassium gluconate, 1 CaCl2, 1 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with 1 n HCl), and 100 mannitol (Pos = 330-340 milliosmole/kg of H2O). Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—Levels of cellular oxidative stress were measured using the fluorescent probe (5-and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA). Carboxy-H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable indicator for ROS that becomes spontaneously fluorescent when the acetate groups are removed by intracellular esterases and cell oxidation. This probe is trapped mainly in the cytoplasm and is oxidized by several ROS, most notably hydrogen peroxide. Briefly, proximal wild type and task2-/- cells were incubated in Petri dishes at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of carboxy-H2DCFDA (10 μm) and gently washed in serum-free culture medium. Two experimental protocols were developed to measure the fluorescence increase according to the time kinetic leading to ROS increase. For rapid kinetic (less than 1 h), cells were rapidly trypsinized (×10 for 45 s) and incubated in the absence or presence of either STS (1 μm) or NAC (N-acetylcysteine, 10 mm) or both substances. Variations of fluorescence of the cell suspension were measured every 2 min using a Genius Spectrofluorimeter (SAFAS, Monaco) at 538 nm. For long time kinetic (experiments performed in the presence of TNF-α), the ROS production was monitored by using fluorescent video microscopy. Briefly, proximal cell lines grown in 35-mm Petri dishes were incubated in the presence of carboxy-H2DCFDA (10 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were gently washed and incubated in an isotonic serum-free medium containing 30 mm HEPES in the absence or presence of TNF-α. The variation of fluorescence was measured every 15 min (during 24 h) at 538 nm. Data are expressed as the fluorescence ratio F/F0, where F is the relative fluorescence intensity measured every 15 min and F0 the relative fluorescence intensity measured at t = 0. The mean values of ROS production were obtained from analysis of 18-25 cells in each culture. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in cells grown in Petri dishes and loaded for 45 min at room temperature in the presence of fura 2-AM (2 μm) and pluronic acid (0.01%). The cells were washed with a NaCl solution containing in mm, 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 5 glucose, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were successively excited at 350 and 380 nm and the paired images were digitized. Each raw image was the result of an integration of four to five frames averaged four times. The acquisition rate was one image every 10 s. For each monolayer, [Ca2+]i was monitored in 18-20 random cells. The equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used to calculate [Ca2+]i from the dual wavelength-to-fluorescence ratio. Chemical Compounds—STS (Sigma) and CsA (Sigma) were prepared in Me2SO and used at final concentrations of 1 and 25 μm, respectively. TNF-α (Sigma) was prepared in distilled water and used at a final concentration of 0.5 ng/ml. Clofilium was prepared at 10 mm in a solution containing 50% Me2SO, 50% water. Clofilium and CsA were a gift from Dr. Barhanin (UMR CNRS 6097). Stock solutions of xanthine (50 mm) and xanthine oxidase (50 milliunits ml-1) were prepared and kept at +5 °C and -20 °C, respectively. The fluorescent probe carboxy-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes) was used at 10 μm (stock solution at 10 mm in Me2SO). Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes) was dissolved at 3 mm in Me2SO and added to the loading solution at a final concentration of 2 μm, along with 0.01% pluronic acid. NAC (10 mm), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 1 mm), charybdotoxin (ChTX, 10 nm), and iberiotoxin (IbTX, 100 nm) were obtained from Sigma. Induction of Caspase-3 Activation and Chromatin Condensation by STS in Wild Type and task2-/- Proximal Cell Lines—Previous experiments performed on proximal cell lines have established a crucial role for the TASK2 K+ channel in the regulatory volume decrease during hypotonic shock. Furthermore, a specific cell volume decrease (AVD) is generally observed during apoptosis process. In the present study, the involvement of TASK2 channels during chemically induced apoptosis was investigated. For this purpose, proximal cell lines from wild type and task2-/- mice were exposed to STS (1 μm) for 6 h, and the caspase-3 activity was determined. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, STS exposure induced a strong increase in caspase-3 activity in wild type cells. Interestingly, this increase was ∼2-fold higher than that observed in task2-/- cells (Fig. 1A). This suggests that TASK2 channels were involved in the STS-induced apoptotic process. The STS-induced caspase-3 activation was significantly inhibited by clofilium, high [K+]e, or external acidic pH confirming the involvement of TASK2 (these effectors have already been shown to inhibit TASK2 K+ currents). In these cells, the potent blocker of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, IbTX, did not affect the STS-induced caspase-3 activation. Surprisingly, the addition of STS still enhanced the level of caspase-3 in task2-/- cells. As expected, this moderate increase was not modified by the addition of clofilium or by the acidification of the external pH. However, the application of IbTX or high [K+]e abolished STS-induced caspase-3 activation. These results suggested that, in task2-/- cells, the STS-induced caspase-3 activation could be driven by an IbTX-sensitive K+ channel. To verify these observations, the apoptosis phenomenon was also assessed on the basis of morphological criteria. Wild type and task2-/- cell lines were stained with Hoescht-33258 and propidium iodide to selectively distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic cells. Under control conditions, the nuclei of wild type cells excluded propidium iodide and exhibited a normal morphology with Hoescht-33258 diffusely labeling the normal chromatin. In sharp contrast, after STS exposure (1 μm, 8 h), Hoescht-33258 staining revealed that several cells exhibited very intense staining of condensed and fragmented chromatin and were not stained with propidium iodide, indicating preservation of the plasma membrane integrity. The condensation and fragmentation of DNA clearly show that STS induced apoptosis. Less than 8.9 ± 1.2% of the total cells exhibited propidium iodide-labeled nuclei. These morphological characteristics could also be observed independently with orcein staining: control cells (without STS) did not exhibit chromatin condensation. By contrast, a dense and thin crown of nuclear coloration, typical of chromatin condensation, could be observed after STS exposure. Hoescht-33258 and orcein staining (data not shown) on STS-treated task2-/- cells revealed a significant decrease of condensed and fragmented chromatin figures as compared with wild type cells. On the basis of these morphological criteria, the number of apoptotic cells was determined in both cell lines. Fig. 1B shows the percentage of apoptotic cells determined after 4, 6, or 8 h in the presence STS (1 μm). In both cell lines, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased significantly with the time of incubation. At each time (4, 6, and 8 h), the percentage of apoptotic cells was higher in wild type than in task2-/- cell lines. At 8 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells reached 40.2 ± 5.2% in wild type cell lines but only 19.9 ± 4.4% in task2-/- cell lines. At the same time (8 h), the percentage of necrotic cells reached 33.4 ± 4.2% in the task2-/- cell but only 10.1 ± 4.1% in wild type cells (Fig. 1C). STS-induced AVD in Proximal Cell Lines—To check whether the STS-induced apoptotic process was related to an AVD phenomenon, the time course of relative cell volume variation during STS treatment was measured in proximal cell lines from wild type and task2-/- mice. In both cell lines, cell shrinkage started as early as 1 h after STS exposure (1 μm, Fig. 2A). Six h after application of STS, the relative mean cell volume decreased by 34.2 ± 2.6% in wild type cell lines but only by 20.2 ± 4.5% in task2-/- cell lines. The STS-mediated AVD was then studied in the presence of clofilium, ChTX, high [K+]e, or IbTX. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, in wild type cell lines, the STS-induced AVD was strongly inhibited by clofilium, high [K+]e but not by ChTX or IbTX. Moreover, AVD was completely blocked by the acidification of the external solution (Fig. 2B). In task2-/- cell lines, the moderate STS-induced AVD was inhibited by ChTX, IbTX, or high [K+]e and was insensitive to clofilium or external acidic pH (Fig. 2C). STS Activates Two Different Types of K+ Currents in Wild Type and task2-/- Proximal Cell Lines—The above experiments suggested the involvement of the TASK2 channel in the AVD process in wild type proximal cells. Whole cell experiments were then performed to further analyze the nature of the K+ conductance triggered by STS exposure. Fig. 3A illustrates the K+ currents recorded in wild type proximal cells before the addition of STS, the voltage step protocol elicited small outwardly rectifying currents. The corresponding I/V curve (Fig. 3B) indicated a reversal potential of -71.5 ± 5 mV and a maximal slope conductance (calculated between +80 and +120 mV) of 3.3 ± 0.7 nS (n = 15). STS exposure induced a large increase of the outward currents, with a maximal slope conductance of 20.3 ± 1.4 nS (n = 15) without significant modification of the reversal potential (-74.3 ± 3 mV). To determine the possible role of cytosolic Ca2+ in the development of STS-induced currents, experiments were performed using a pipette solution containing the Ca2+ chelating agent EGTA (30 mm) to greatly reduce the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. In 100% of the cells tested, the STS-induced conductance was not modified. These STS-activated K+ currents were inhibited by clofilium (10 μm, maximal slope conductance 3.5 ± 0.8 nS, n = 15). Fig. 3C showed the mean currents recorded at +100 mV under different experimental conditions; the STS-induced currents exhibited no sensitivity to TEA, IbTX, or ChTX but were strongly reduced in the presence of clofilium or when perfusing an acidic external bath solution (pH 6). These characteristics tightly correspond to TASK2 K+ conductance. Whole cell experiments were also performed in the task2-/- cell line to better characterize the IbTX-sensitive K+ permeability involved in the residual AVD described in Fig. 2, A-C. Fig. 3D illustrates the K+ currents recorded in task2-/- proximal cells before and after STS exposure. Without STS, the voltage step protocol elicited small outwardly rectifying K+ currents (maximal slope conductance = 2.6 ± 1.3 nS, Erev = -69.2 ± 2.5 mV, n = 16, Fig. 3E). STS exposure significantly increased the outward currents, which reached a maximal conductance of 15.6 ± 2.3 nS (Erev =-70.2 ± 2.5 mV, n = 16) without significant change of the reversal potential. These STS-induced K+ conductances were inhibited by the addition of ChTX or IbTX to the external solution. Experiments were also performed using pipette solution containing Ca2+ chelating agent EGTA (30 mm) to greatly reduce the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. In 100% of the cells tested, the STS-induced conductance was completely blocked (n = 5). As shown in Fig. 3F, the mean STS-induced K+ currents (measured at +100 mV) exhibited a different pharmacological profile as compared with wild type cells; they were inhibited by TEA, IbTX, and ChTX but remained insensitive to clofilium or perfusion with an acidic external bath solution (pH 6). These pharmacological properties of K+ channel were analyzed in both cell types using the highest currents recorded in the presence of STS. Thus, the mean currents recorded at +100 mV were smaller in task2-/- cells (986 ± 23 pA, n = 16) than in wild type cells (1315 ± 36 pA, n = 15). Fig. 3G further illustrates this difference by showing the distribution of the STS-induced current recorded in wild type and task2-/- cell lines. The individual records were arranged in 5 arbitrary groups ac"

An extracellular RG lyase YesW from saprophytic Bacillus subtilis is a member of polysaccharide lyase family 11 and cleaves glycoside bonds in polygalacturonan as well as RG type-I through a β-elimination reaction. Crystal structures of YesW and its complex with galacturonan disaccharide, a reaction product analogue, were determined at 1.4 and 2.5Å resolutions with final R-factors of 16.4% and 16.6%, respectively. The enzyme is composed of an eight-bladed β-propeller with a deep cleft in the center as a basic scaffold, and its structural fold has not been seen in polysaccharide lyases analyzed thus far. Structural analysis of the disaccharide-bound YesW and a site-directed mutagenesis study suggested that Arg-452 and Lys-535 stabilize the carboxyl group of the acidic polysaccharide molecule and Tyr-595 makes a stack interaction with the sugar pyranose ring. In addition to amino acid residues binding to the disaccharide, one calcium ion, which is coordinated by Asp-401, Glu-422, His-363, and His-399, may mediate the enzyme activity.

Plant cell wall degradation is essential for plant pathogenic and saprophytic microbes to invade plants. The plant cell wall mainly consists of polysaccharides and proteins, with polysaccharides being more abundant. These polysaccharides are divided into three groups, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin (1Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Pectin is more soluble in water than cellulose and hemicellulose, suggesting that this polysaccharide is the preferred target for plant-associated microbes. Pectin is further divided to three regions, i.e. polygalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan type-I (RG-I), 2The abbreviations used are:RGrhamnogalacturonanGalAd-galacturonic acidPLpolysaccharide lyaseSADsingle-wavelength anomalous diffractionr.m.s.d.root mean square deviations. 2The abbreviations used are:RGrhamnogalacturonanGalAd-galacturonic acidPLpolysaccharide lyaseSADsingle-wavelength anomalous diffractionr.m.s.d.root mean square deviations. and rhamnogalacturonan type-II (RG-II). In pectin molecules, polygalacturonan is present as a linear backbone, and RG-I and RG-II are attached to the backbone as branched chains (2Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 418-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McNeil M. Darvill A.G. Fry S.C. Albersheim P. Annu. Rev.

RG-I is a polymer with a disaccharide-repeating unit consisting of l-rhamnopyranose and d-galacto-pyranouronic acid (GalA) as a main chain, and arabinans and galactans are attached to the main chain (5McNeil M. Darvill A.G. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 1128-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RG-II has a backbone of polygalacturonan, and its side chains consist of a complex of ∼30 monosaccharides, including rare sugars such as apiose and aceric acid (6O'Neill M.A. Warrenfeltz D. Kates K.

These plant cell wall polysaccharides become substrates to be degraded through reactions of polysaccharide hydrolases and/or lyases produced by plant pathogenic and saprophytic microbes. Hydrolases cleave glycoside bonds in polysaccharides via hydrolysis, and lyases do so by β-elimination reactions (7Davies G. Henrissat B.

However, little information is available on the degradation of RG regions by microbes except for Aspergillus species (21de Vries R.P. Visser J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

We identified the degradation pathway for the RG-I region in saprophytic Bacillus subtilis (24Ochiai A. Itoh T. Kawamata A. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Appl. Environ.

Ochiai A. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RG lyases are responsible for cleaving α-1,4 bonds of the RG-I main chain through a β-elimination reaction (Fig. 1A), and unsaturated RG hydrolases act on the unsaturated RG saccharides produced through the reactions of RG lyases.Carbohydrate-active enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, glycosyl transferases, and carbohydrate esterases are categorized into over 200 families based on amino acid sequences in the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) data base (26Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). Lyases are classified into 18 polysaccharide lyase (PL) families (Table 1). Polysaccharide lyases commonly recognize uronic acid residues in polysaccharides, catalyze β-elimination, and produce unsaturated saccharides with C=C double bonds at nonreducing terminal uronate residues. These characteristics of lyases indicate that they share common structural features determining uronate recognition and reaction manner (β-elimination). Crystal structures of polysaccharide lyases in 11 families have been determined thus far (Table 1), and structure and function relationships of enzymes such as lyases for pectate, pectin, alginate, chondroitin, hyaluronan, and xanthan are being analyzed (15Yoder M.D. Jurnak F.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although its structure and function relationship remains to be clarified. Family PL-11 RG lyases Rgl11A from Cellvibrio japonicus (34McKie V.A. Vincken J.P. Voragen A.G. van den Broek L.A. Stimson E. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), Rgl11Y from Clostridium cellulolyticum (35Pages S. Valette O. Abdou L. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4727-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and YesW and YesX from B. subtilis (24Ochiai A. Itoh T. Kawamata A. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 3803-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been characterized enzymatically, but no structural analysis of these enzymes has, to our knowledge, been reported. Because family PL-11 enzymes show no significant homology to other proteins, including polysaccharide lyases, their structural fold exhibits a novel type that has not been observed in polysaccharide lyases analyzed so far. Structural analysis of family PL-11 lyases is expected to clarify their structure and function relationships, i.e. mechanisms for substrate recognition, catalytic reaction, and their physiological functions in bacterial infection and/or saprophytic processes in relation to plants.Herein we report the determination of the three-dimensional structure of family PL-11 YesW, and its complex with a reaction product analogue by x-ray crystallography, and identification of the active site of the enzyme and amino acid residues responsible for substrate recognition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—RG-I (from potatoes) and polygalacturonan (from citrus pectin) were purchased from Megazyme. Pectin was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical and pectic acid from Lancaster Synthesis. Galacturonan disaccharide (GalA-GalA) was purchased from Sigma. The disaccharide is similar to a reaction product (ΔGalA-GalA) released from polygalacturonan by YesW but has no C=C double bond in the molecule. Ni2+-Chelating Sepharose™ Fast Flow and HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ (200 pg) were purchased from GE Healthcare.Assays for Enzymes and Proteins—RG lyase YesW was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in a reaction mixture (1 ml) consisting of 0.5 mg/ml RG-I, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 2 mm CaCl2. Activity was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 235 nm arising from the double bond formed in the reaction products. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce an increase of 1.0 in absorbance at 235 nm per minute by using a cuvette with a light path 1 cm long. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Protein Expression and Purification—Protein expression and purification were conducted as described previously (24Ochiai A. Itoh T. Kawamata A. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 3803-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Ochiai A. Yamasaki M. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, YesW expressed in Escherichia coli cells was purified by two-step column chromatography, i.e. Ni2+-Chelating Sepharose™ Fast Flow and HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ (200 pg). The N-terminal 37 amino acid residues published in the DNA/protein data base (YesW, 620 amino acid residues, GenPept accession no. CAB12524) are excised as a signal peptide in E. coli cells (37Ochiai A. Yamasaki M. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme (64 kDa) with a specific activity of 200 units/mg consists of 591 amino acid residues, including the C-terminal histidine tag sequence (8 amino acid residues, LEHHHHHH) derived from the expression vector, pET21b (Novagen).Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction—After concentration by ultrafiltration using Centriprep (Millipore), purified YesW (24 mg/ml) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 m NaCl was crystallized at 20 °C by sitting-drop vapor diffusion using Linbro tissue-culture plates and micro-bridges (Hampton Research) (37Ochiai A. Yamasaki M. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reservoir solution volume in each well was 1 ml, and the droplet was prepared by mixing 5 μl of the protein solution with 5 μl of the reservoir solution. A crystal suitable for x-ray analysis was obtained after microseeding by using a reservoir solution consisting of 55% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.4). To obtain a derivative for phasing, the YesW crystal was soaked at 20 °C for 3 h in a reservoir solution containing 20 mm KAuCl4. The YesW crystal was also soaked at 20 °C for 20 h in a sugar solution containing 1.5 m GalA-GalA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), and 2 mm CaCl2 to prepare the enzyme-sugar complex. The native crystal of YesW on a nylon loop (Hampton Research) was placed directly in a cold nitrogen-gas stream at -173 °C, and x-ray diffraction images of the crystal were collected at -173 °C under the nitrogen-gas stream with a Jupiter 210 charge-coupled device detector and synchrotron radiation of wavelength 0.8000 Å at the BL-38B1 station of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). During data collection for single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) analysis using the crystal derived with Au3+, the synchrotron radiation wavelength was adjusted to 1.0357 Å. The wavelength for SAD data collection was defined from x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurement of the derivative crystal. The 720 diffraction images (total, 720°) from the derivative crystal with 1.0° oscillation were collected as a consecutive series of datasets. After 360 images were collected, the crystal was vertically translated by 0.5 mm along the long axis to reduce radiation damage. Diffraction data for native and derivative crystals were processed using the HKL2000 program package (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction images from the YesW-GalA-GalA complex crystal were collected at 4 °C with a Bruker Hi-Star multiwire area detector using CuKα radiation generated by a MacScience M18XHF rotating-anode generator, and diffraction data were processed with the SADIE and SAINT programs based on manuals provided by Bruker.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of YesW was solved by SAD using the Au3+ derivative crystal. Au3+ sites and initial phasing were determined by using the SOLVE program (39Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Density modification (solvent flattening and histogram matching) and automatic model building were done by the DM (40Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) and ARP/wARP programs (41Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), respectively, in the CCP4 program package. The Coot program (42Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar) was used for manual modification of the initial model. The 50.0- to 1.40-Å resolution dataset was truncated with the CCP4 program package and used for subsequent refinement. Initial rigid body refinement and several rounds of restrained refinement against the dataset were done using the Refmac5 program (43Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar). Water molecules were incorporated where the difference in density exceeded 3.0 σ above the mean and the 2Fo - Fc map showed a density of over 1.0 σ. At this stage, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol molecules and ions were included in the calculation and refinement continued until convergence at 1.4-Å resolution (R = 16.4, Rfree = 18.2%). A crystal soaked with galacturonan disaccharide was isomorphous with the crystal used for the native set. An Fo - Fc map (contoured at 3.0 σ) at 2.5-Å resolution was obtained using reflection data for the sugar-soaked crystal, and the phase was calculated from the final sugar-free YesW model. The structure of the enzyme-sugar complex was refined using the Coot program with the parameter file for GalA at the PRODRG site. Protein models were superimposed and their root-mean-square-deviations (r.m.s.d.) were determined with the LSQKAB program (44Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2308) Google Scholar), a part of CCP4 (45Collaborative Acta Crystallogr..Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Final model quality was checked with PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Ribbon plots were prepared using the MOLSCRIPT (47Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (48Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar), or PyMOL 3W. L. DeLano (2004) The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA. programs. Coordinates used in this report were taken from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (50Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26649) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—To replace Lys-535, Arg-452, Tyr-595, Asp-401, Glu-422, His-363, and His-399 by Ala, Ala, Phe, Asn, Gln, Ala, and Ala, respectively, we constructed YesW mutants using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid pET21b-YesW (24Ochiai A. Itoh T. Kawamata A. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 3803-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template, and the following oligonucleotides were used as primers: K535A, sense (5′-GCGGCTAACAACGGCACAGCAGCAACACCAACGCTTCAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CTGAAGCGTTGGTGTTGCTGCTGTGCCGTTGTTAGCCGC-3′); R452A, sense (5′-GCCGGCAAGGATGTAGGCGCGGGAATGGCTGCTGATATTG-3′) and antisense (5′-CAATATCAGCAGCCATTCCCGCGCCTACATCCTTGCCGGC-3′); Y595F, sense (5′-TGGCAAAATATCGCCTTTAACCAGCCGCCGCAC-3′) and antisense (5′-GTGCGGCGGCTGGTTAAAGGCGATATTTTGCCA-3′); D401N, sense (5′-GCTTAGGCCATGGGAATGCCCTCCATACAGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCTGTATGGAGGGCATTCCCATGGCCTAAGC-3′); E422Q, sense (5′-GAGGTGTTTCAAGTTCATCAGGACAAAAATGCAAAATACGGC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCCGTATTTTGCATTTTTGTCCTGATGAACTTGAAACACCTC-3′); H363A, sense (5′-GCCGGACAGGGGAATGCCAACCTGAGCATCGCG-3′) and antisense (5′-CGCGATGCTCAGGTTGGCATTCCCCTGTCCGGC-3′); H399A, sense (5′-GACCGGCTTAGGCGCTGGGGATGCCCTCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAGGGCATCCCCAGCGCCTAAGCCGGTC-3′) (mutations are underlined). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing with an automated DNA sequencer (Model 377, Applied Biosystems). Expression and purification of the mutants were conducted by the same procedures as for wild-type YesW.Enzyme Kinetics—For determining kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) with various substrates, appropriate concentrations of RG-I, pectin, pectic acid, and polygalacturonan were used. Vmax and Km were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation with KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhasing and Structure Determination—As is the case with the native crystal, the Au3+ derivative YesW crystal belongs to space group P21 with unit cell parameters of a = 56.9 Å, b = 104.9 Å, c = 99.6 Å, and β = 96.5°. Two molecules are present in an asymmetric unit. For phasing by SAD analysis, 720 diffraction images were collected at up to 1.9-Å resolution from this derivative crystal and processed at a high redundancy of 14.0 with separate Friedel pairs. Data collection statistics are shown in Table 2. The initial phase was determined at 0.333 figure-of-merit by the SOLVE program. The phase was improved greatly, and the figure-of-merit increased to 0.836 after density modifications such as solvent flattening and histogram matching with the DM program. The initial model was built to consist of 1,137 amino acid residues with side chains by the ARP/wARP program. Subsequent modification of the initial model through manual modeling and refinement contributed to the protein model with 1,166 amino acid residues except for the C-terminal histidine tag sequence. After initial rigid body refinement, the model was refined against the 50.0- to 1.40-Å resolution dataset. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 2.Refined Model Quality—The refined model includes 1,166 amino acid residues, 1,329 water molecules, 11 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol molecules, and 20 calcium ions for two YesW molecules, designated molecules A and B, in an asymmetric unit. All amino acid residues except for the C-terminal regions corresponding to the histidine tag sequence (LEHHHHHH) could be assigned well in the 2Fo - Fc map. The final overall R-factor for the refined model was 16.4% with 217,773 unique reflections within a 28.4- to 1.40-Å resolution range. The final overall free R-factor calculated with randomly selected 5% reflection was 18.2%. Based on theoretical curves in the plot calculated according to Luzzati (51Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar), the absolute positional error was estimated to be 0.14 Å at a resolution of 1.40 Å. Ramachandran plot analysis (52Sibanda B.L. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), in which the stereochemical correctness of the backbone structure is indicated by (φ, ψ) torsion angles (53Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar), shows that 89.2% of non-glycine residues lie within the most favored and 9.8% in additionally allowed regions. Five residues, Asn-152, Ala-327, Asn-490, Ser-506, and Ala-594, in each molecule (A and B) fell into generously allowed regions. One cis-peptide was observed between Glu-248 and Pro-249 residues. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2.Overall Structure—The overall structure (Fig. 2, A and B) and topology of the secondary structure elements (Fig. 2C) indicate that RG lyase YesW consists of an N-terminal β-sheet domain and an eight-bladed β-propeller domain. The N-terminal β-sheet domain consists of 75 amino acid residues from Val-50 to Trp-124 and is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets consisting of eight β-strands, S2, amino acid residues 81-82; S3, 73-78; S4, 103-110; S5, 113-114; S6, 92-95; S7, 57-61; S8, 50-54; and S9, 121-124. The β-propeller domain consists of 489 amino acid residues from Tyr-128 to Asn-616 constituting eight blades (A-H) subsequent to the N-terminal β-sheet domain. All blades except for blades A and G consist of four main antiparallel β-strands constituting a single β-sheet and show the classic “W” topology. Blade A consists of a β-strand (SA4, 128-132) subsequent to the N-terminal β-sheet domain and four C-terminal β-strands, SA5, 528-529; SA1, 540-542; SA2, 551-556; and SA3, 561-565. Helix H4, 533-535, is inserted between SA5 and SA1, and two helices, H5, 578-580, and H6, 582-590, are connected to SA3. Prior to the N-terminal β-sheet domain, a single β-strand (S1, 39-40) together with a C-terminal β-strand (S10, 617-618) constitutes a β-sheet. Blades B-H are located concentrically at equal intervals; blade B (SB1, 149-157; SB2, 166-173; SB3, 189-193; SB4, 199-204; SB5, 146-147; and SB6, 139-140), blade C (SC1, 219-221; SC2, 230-235; SC3, 267-272; and SC4, 278-283), blade D (SD1, 305-310; SD2, 318-323; SD3, 330-337; and SD4, 340-348), blade E (SE1, 366-368; SE2, 377-380; SE3, 383-385; and"

https://openalex.org/W2012505810,"Ionizing radiation (IR) is known to impair learning by suppressing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. However, in a mature nervous system, IR-induced functional alterations that are independent of neurogenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of IR on a food-NaCl associative learning paradigm of adult Caenorhabditis elegans that does not undergo neurogenesis. We observed that a decrease in chemotaxis toward NaCl occurs only after combined starvation and exposure to NaCl. Exposure to IR induced an additional decrease in chemotaxis immediately after an acute dose in the transition stage of the food-NaCl associative learning. Strikingly, chronic irradiation induced negative chemotaxis in the exposed animals, i.e., the primary avoidance response. IR-induced additional decreases in chemotaxis after acute and chronic irradiation were significantly suppressed in the gpc-1 mutant, which was defective in GPC-1 (one of the two gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric G-protein). Chemotaxis to cAMP, but not to lysine and benzaldehyde, was influenced by IR during the food-NaCl associative learning. Our novel findings suggest that IR behaves as a modulator in the food-NaCl associative learning via C. elegans GPC-1 and a specific neuronal network and may shed light on the modulatory effect of IR on learning."
