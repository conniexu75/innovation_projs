https://openalex.org/W2058699421,"The recently isolated sex attractant of the female American cockroach elicits an electical response in the antennae of males, females, and mymphs of this species. These electroantennograms are known to be summated receptor (generator) potentials of many olfactory sensillae stimulated simultaneously. Many other odorous substances also elicit such responses in the cockroach antenna."

The effectiveness of the somatic tissues concerned with food assimilation and utilization was altered. The folic acid antagonist, methotrexate, inhibits developing gametes directly, so that differential destruction of gametes and death of zygotes occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2002135529,"Cross-striated muscle fibers may contract reversibly to less than 30 percent of their rest length and it is not easy to reconcile this fact with the sliding filament model of muscular contraction. The mechanism of supercontraction has been studied in fibrils obtained from the giant muscle fibers of the barnacle Balanus nubilus. They were examined by phase-contrast light microscopy and electron microscopy. Contraction beyond the 50-percent stage was found to be achieved largely by the passage of thick filaments through the Z-disks, which are perforated. The overlap of thick filaments from adjacent sarcomeres causes the appearance of the contraction bands about the Z-disks. Subsequent contraction is associated with a folding and loose coiling, but not a shortening, of the thick filaments."

https://openalex.org/W2045266161,"The diffusion of oxygen labeled with oxygen-18 through cores of wet soil increased significantly when roots of growing corn seedlings penetrated the cores. The increase was small or absent when roots grew through a layer of soft wax or a layer of water-saturated 0.5-mm glass beads, indicating that the diffusion increase was a joint effect of the roots and airfilled pores in the soil. A possible mechanism is suggested."
