https://openalex.org/W1969792498,"Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, is localized in the vesicles containing catecholamine in sympathetic nerves. This enzyme is released with norepinephrine when the nerves to the guinea pig vas deferens are stimulated in vitro, and the amount of enzyme discharged increases as the length of stimulation periods increases. The amount of DBH released is proportional to the amount of norepinephrine released, and the ratio of norepinephrine to DBH discharged into the incubation medium is similar to that in the soluble portion of the contents of the synaptic vesicles from the vas deferens. These data are compatible with the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and DBH from symnpathetic nerves by a process of exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969334153,"The worldwide pattern of movement of DDT residues appears to be from the land through the atmosphere into the oceans and into the oceanic abyss. Calculations based on the fragmentary data available on. rates of movement and sizes of various pools of DDT residues lead to the conclusion that concentrations in the atmosphere and in the mixed layer of the oceans lag by only a few years behind the amounts of DDT used annually throughout the world. A model suggests that maximum concentrations of DDT residues occurred in air in 1966 and will occur in the mixed layer of the oceans in 1971. The biota probably contains in total less than 1/30 of 1 year's production of DDT during the mid-1960's, a very small amount in proportion to the total potentially available. The reason for the biota's failure to absorb larger quantities and to be affected much more severely is unclear. The analysis suggests that mere good fortune has protected man and the rest of the biota from much higher concentrations, thus emphasizing the need to determine the details of the movement of DDT residues and other toxins through the biosphere and to move swiftly to bring world use of such toxins under rational control based on firm knowledge of local and worldwide cycles and hazards."

https://openalex.org/W1504301999,"Histones have been analyzed by use of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. A standard curve of histone mobility versus the logarithm of molecular weight was obtained and it was found to be different from the standard protein curve commonly used for molecular weight determination with this technique. One histone fraction (the lysine-rich histone) consists of two groups of molecules differing in molecular weight by approximately 1000. All the other histone fractions are homogenous with respect to molecular weight. The molecular weights of lysine-rich histones vary somewhat in different phylogenetic orders whereas the molecular weights of the other histones are constant in all vertebrates with the sole exception of histone F2b which has a somewhat smaller molecular weight in fish. The observations are correlated with recent observations on the mobility of these histones in a pH 2.7 electrophoretic system in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (Panyim, S., Bilek, D. and Chalkley, R., J. Biol. Chem., 246, 4206 (1971))."

The amount of stage 4 sleep decreases as subject's age increases and as time asleep increases. Longer periods of wakefulness before sleep result in greater amounts of stage 4 sleep in the first 3 hours of sleep. Sleep periods that begin at times other than the regular onset time tend to produce less stage 4 sleep; this decrease suggests a circadian effect."
https://openalex.org/W2171010994,"Abstract The A protein of lactose synthetase has been purified from bovine skim milk. After chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and cellulose phosphate, the active fractions were purified to constant specific activity by chromatography on columns of α-lactalbumin attached covalently to Sepharose. The A protein was bound specifically to this column in buffers containing glucose and was eluted by omitting glucose from the developing buffer. These highly purified preparations are inactivated easily but can be stabilized by N-acetylglucosamine or by bovine serum albumin. The final preparation was shown to be homogeneous by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, by ultracentrifugal analysis, and by gel filtration on 4% Agarose in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The fully denatured enzyme was found to have a molecular weight between 40,000 and 44,000, values in good agreement with a molecular weight of 42,900, which was estimated for the native enzyme by sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. These molecular weight measurements suggest that the enzyme is not composed of subunits. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses indicate that the enzyme is a glycoprotein with about 12% by weight carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W1590420180,"Abstract The specific radioactivity of free leucine has been measured in rat liver at various times after the injection of labeled leucine. The results of these measurements have served to calculate the effect of leucine reutilization on a previous measurement of the apparent turnover rate of catalase with labeled leucine as precursor. This effect was found to account entirely for the difference between the half-life of catalase observed in these experiments (3.5 days) and that determined with δ-aminolevulinate as precursor or by indirect methods (1.5 days). It is shown that in general, when the specific radioactivity of proteins is measured between 1 and 10 days after the injection of labeled leucine, all proteins with half-lives between 0.1 and 2 days will show apparent half-lives between 3 and 4 days. The limitations of using leucine for studies on protein turnover are discussed, and some suggestions are made for optimizing the design of such experiments."

This results in a fraction that contains two types of bundles of filaments but few other constituents. The filaments are stable over a wide range of temperatures and at both low and high ionic strength. Their density and their resistance to digestion by ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease indicate that they are primarily protein. The molecular weight of the subunit is approximately 60,000.

https://openalex.org/W1675134876,"Abstract Mutational studies and amino acid sequence analysis were used to identify the initiating methionyl codon AUG as an essential element at the beginning of the genetic message for iso-1-cytochrome c in yeast. Nine cy1 mutants completely lack iso-1-cytochrome c as a result of mutations at one end of the CY1 gene. Amino acid sequence changes of iso-1-cytochrome c from 45 intragenic revertants of these mutants were determined. No sequence changes occurred in 21 of the revertants and the changes in the rest were additions or deletions at the NH2 terminus. The additions were either Met-Ile-, Met-Leu-, Met-Arg-, or in one case, both Met- Val- and Val-. The additions were all alike in the revertants of any cy1 mutant. The deletions were always losses of the first four residues of the protein, Thr-Glu-Phe-Lys-. Normal amounts of iso-1-cytochrome c occurred in all of the revertants except those containing the short protein, which contained only 51% of the normal amount. The nine cy1 mutants had incurred single base pair substitutions at the three nucleotides immediately preceding the codon for the NH2-terminal threonine. The essential, initial triplet is the methionyl codon, AUG. Its conversion to codons for isoleucine, leucine, arginine, or valine prevents the formation of the protein. Reversions either reverse the original substitutions, leading to the normal protein, or generate new methionine codons at the left of the original AUG position, producing the long proteins, or they convert the normal lysine 4 codon to AUG, creating the short protein. A methionine aminopeptidase is proposed to exist, which cleaves methionine efficiently from Met-Thr- and Met-Ala- bonds, less efficiently from Met-Val- bonds, and not at all from Met-Leu, Met-Ile-, and Met-Arg- bonds. The cy1 initiator mutants were used to demonstrate that ethyl methanesulfonate induces the transition G·C → A·T at a frequency at least 100 times greater than it causes the transversions A·T → T·A and G·C → T·A and one or more unidentified base pair exchanges to G·C. The function of the essential AUG triplet is presumed to be initiation of translation. This function is not provided by at least 35 of the 64 nucleotide triplets; notably it is not provided by GUG. The amount of iso-1-cytochrome c in yeast is under the control of the rate of initiation of translation, which may be reduced or remain unaltered following mutational relocation of the initiator codon."
https://openalex.org/W1563291525,"Abstract The elucidation of the number of reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2)-binding sites in bacterial luciferase is of fundamental importance for understanding the mechanism of the bioluminescent reaction. At present, knowledge concerning the binding sites is meager, primarily due to difficulty in maintaining FMNH2 in a reduced state at very low concentrations. In the present studies this difficulty has been circumvented, permitting us to elucidate the order of the bioluminescent reaction with respect to FMNH2 and the dissociation constant of the FMNH2-enzyme complex. Of particular importance was the fact that enzymatic measurements could be made not only at extremely low FMNH2 concentrations (10-9 m), but also at very high enzyme concentrations, even higher than the substrate concentration or the value for the dissociation constant for the FMNH2-enzyme complex (8 x 10-7 m). Under these conditions, the Michaelis-Menten equation is not directly applicable and the relative velocity of the reaction (v/Vmax) depends on the concentration of substrate-binding sites. Consequently, it was possible to elucidate the number of FMNH2-binding sites directly from kinetic data. These results show that bacterial luciferase possesses only a single FMNH2-binding site and consequently eliminate reaction mechanisms involving 2 FMNH2 molecules. Since the oxidation of a single FMNH2 molecule would not be adequate energetically for the emission of a quantum of light at 490 nm, additional energy-yielding steps must be required in the bacterial bioluminescent reaction."

Incubations of [9-2H2]- and [10-2H3]decanoic acids followed by mass spectrometric analyses of the products showed that the hydroxylations occurred with loss of 1 hydrogen atom from the carbon hydroxylated. The two hydroxylations at carbon 9 both proceeded stereospecifically with retention of the absolute configuration. Significant isotope effects were present in the formation of d-9- and l-9-hydroxydecanoic acids from [9-2H2]decanoic acid.

https://openalex.org/W1571328268,"Abstract The human retinol-binding protein (RBP) is shown to exist in two main physiological forms each of which displays electrophoretic heterogeneity. Only one of the two RBP components contains vitamin A. The retinol-containing RBP species is under physiological conditions firmly bound to thyroxine-binding prealbumin. The protein complex thereby formed is the actual vitamin A carrier normally encountered in plasma. The vitamin A-free form of RBP is unable to bind prealbumin. The difference in the affinity of the two RBP species for prealbumin made it possible to separate them by chromatography on a Sepharose gel to which prealbumin had been covalently attached. Differences in conformation between the two RBP components were established by physical-chemical, chemical, and immunological techniques. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis both species of RBP exhibited multiple bands. The studies revealed that the variations in electrophoretic mobility could be ascribed to differences in the content of vitamin A, in the number of amide groups, and in the sequence of the COOH-terminal amino acid residues. Hence, it was found that the vitamin A-containing form of RBP had an additional residue of arginine compared to the form lacking the vitamin. This result, obtained by amino acid analysis, was confirmed by peptide mapping, which revealed an arginine-stainable spot present only in the vitamin A-containing species. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequences in the two RBP species were -Lys-Arg-OH and -Lys-OH, respectively. The loss of 1 amino acid residue from the vitamin A-free species obviously causes a conformational change which is not compatible with the binding to prealbumin. Vitamin A per se is not a prerequisite for the binding of RBP to prealbumin since it was shown that RBP from which the vitamin had been extracted retained its affinity for prealbumin. The data obtained in this study strongly suggest that the species devoid of both vitamin A and the COOH-terminal arginine is a catabolite of RBP."

https://openalex.org/W1518948065,Abstract A method of evaluating the iodine distribution in thryroglobulin has been developed. It is based on the increase in density that occurs when iodine is incorporated into proteins. Resolution of iodinated species is obtained by equilibrium centrifugation in a 34.5% (w/w) RbCl density gradient (isopycnic centrifugation) in either the analytical or preparative ultracentrifuge. The equilibrium in 34.5% RbCl of a human thyroglobulin preparation which contained almost no iodine was studied. A molecular weight of 6.3 x 105 and a density of 1.314 ± 0.001 g per cm3 were determined for this preparation. The increase in density of iodinated thyroglobulin was proportional to the amount of iodine incorporated. A computer analysis has been developed to determine the iodine distribution. The theoretical curves fit the data with high precision. Preparative gradient equilibrium centrifugation of radiolabeled thyroglobulin in 34.5% RbCl was also evaluated. Radioiodine was incorporated into thyroglobulin which was less dense than the unlabeled molecules. The density of newly synthesized l-[U-14C]valine thyroglobulin was less dense than that of radioiodine-labeled protein. It appears that synthesis and iodination of thyroglobulin are controlled by different metabolic processes.

The major enzyme form, isomerase a, was purified to constant specific activity and appeared homogeneous by chromatography, electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation. The minor enzyme forms, isomerases b and c, were also prepared in high purity in limited quantity. Isomerases a, b, and c differed slightly in their charge properties (isoelectric points at pH 9.2, 9.1, and 9.0, respectively) but were indistinguishable on the basis of molecular size. Sedimentation velocity and partial specific volume measure of isomerase a yielded values of s20, w = 7.0 S and 0.745 cm3 per g. Molecular weight of the native enzyme was 125,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis with dissociation induced by denaturing agents yielding two subunits of identical or similar size. Isomerase a was distinguishable from b and c on the basis of a lesser Km for fructose 6-phosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1597714326,"Abstract The activity of Vibrio cholerae sialidase was studied as a function of the physical state of ganglioside substrate. This study provides a model for the interaction of end group hydrolases with highly polar anionic complex lipids. Sialyl groups of gangliosides are hydrolyzed by Vibrio sialidase whether the substrate is in disperse or in micellar form. The action of Vibrio sialidase on gangliosides appears, in this regard, to differ from the reported action of other end group hydrolases on complex lipids. Ultracentrifugal analyses indicate that a substantial proportion of sialidase in aqueous buffer adheres to and can be precipitated with ganglioside micelles, but the enzyme remains in solution in the presence of monodisperse substrate, as does monodisperse substrate alone. The effect upon the activity of a large total surface area of susceptible sialyl groups in the aggregated ganglioside substrate seems to almost compensate for the lower number of diffusing particles for this form. Regular dependence of initial velocity on substrate concentration is observed for both the micellar and submicellar substrate. Km below the critical micelle concentration (1 x 10-4 m) is roughly one-fifth the apparent Km for the substrate above the critical micelle concentration (5 x 10-4 m). The effect of hydrogen ion concentration on initial reaction velocity differs for aggregated (micellar) and disperse (submicellar) substrate. Above the pH optimum, enzymatic activity toward both substrate forms decreases very moderately with increasing pH, and there is a small increase in Km. Below the pH optimum, Km remains relatively invariant with decreasing pH. Although the substrate is strongly anionic at all pH values studied, there is no evidence that combination with the substrate affects the degree of ionization of any catalytic group on the enzyme. Minor loss of enzymatic activity occurs with the submicellar substrate below the pH optimum. However, great loss is observed for the micellar substrate when pH is decreased below the optimum. Mathematical analysis of the pH effect suggests that no single titratable functional group on the enzyme is involved in its catalytic activity. A noncompetitive time-dependent inhibitory effect is exerted by the micellar substrate at high concentration. The initial velocity of the enzymatic hydrolysis of sialyl groups of gangliosides can be increased to double the highest value obtainable with pure substrate by the admixture of nonsialyl lipid, e.g. lecithin. For this lipid plus gangliosides, there is a critical mixing ratio of unity for optimal activation. Activation of the sialyl residues of the aggregated substrate may be the result of spacing by the nonsialyl lipids. Properties of gangliosides when tested as substrates for soluble Vibrio sialidase may reflect properties of the sialyl groups of these glycosphingolipids in native neuronal plasma membranes."

Five major cystine peptides were oxidized with performic acid and the cysteic acid fragments were separated by chromatography on Dowex 50-X2 and by high voltage paper electrophoresis. The cysteic acid peptides were located in the amino acid sequence of the inhibitor (Greene, L. J., and Bartelt, D. C., J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1594175305,"Abstract The regulation of the fate of acetyl units derived from the β-oxidation of l(-)-palmitylcarnitine was studied using isolated rat liver mitochondria. Citrate synthesis from acetyl-CoA was dependent upon the concentration of l-malate, the immediate precursor of oxalacetate in this system. The independence of the rate of citrate formation on the means used to stimulate respiration, e.g. ADP for coupled mitochondria and p-trifluoromethoxphenyl hydrazone of carbonyl cyanide (FCCP) for uncoupled mitochondria, indicated that the mitochondrial citrate synthase was insensitive to the energy charge of the mitochondria. Various concentrations of externally added ATP inhibited both the rates of oxygen consumption and citrate formation but caused little alteration in the ratio of these two rates indicating that citrate synthase was insensitive to the added nucleotide. An effort was made to assess the effect of changes in the intramitochondrial ATP level on the formation of citrate. Using 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone plus rotenone to stimulate respiration and to maintain a high intramitochondrial ATP level, linear rates of citrate formation and oxygen consumption were obtained. Addition of oligomycin caused a marked fall in ATP, no change in the rate of oxygen consumption, and no change in the rate of citrate formation suggesting that changes in the intramitochondrial ATP level did not effect a release of an inhibition of the citrate synthase. Addition of FCCP to this system caused a precipitous fall in ATP and an immediate and complete inhibition of citrate formation indicating an interruption in energized substrate transport into the mitochondria. Inclusion of the inhibitor, malonate, in the incubation medium of a citrate-synthesizing system prevented the formation of citrate when the mitochondria were coupled. Malonate seemed to compete with l-malate for entry into the mitochondria. Malonate did not prevent citrate formation in uncoupled mitochondria indicating that a relatively low level of uncoupler enhanced the permeability of the mitochondria for anionic substrates. Positive correlations were observed between the oxidation-reduction state of the mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides or the rate of respiration and the rate of citrate formation in an uncoupler titration and in a potassium concentration using valinomycin-treated mitochondria. It is concluded that the rate of citrate synthesis in isolated liver mitochondria depends mainly on the availability of the two substrates of the citrate synthase reaction, acetyl-CoA and oxalacetate."

A 3–8 S fraction was prepared from the soluble extract of rat thyroid glands incubated in vitro with radioactive amino acids ([3H]leucine and [14C]isoleucine) or carbohydrates ([3H]- or [14C]mannose and [3H]- or [14C]galactose) or both. From this fraction three components were purified. Two of them, homogeneous by ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic criteria, had sedimentation rates of 6 S and 7 S and molecular weights close to 112,000 and 186,000, respectively. The molar ratios of labeled leucine to isoleucine incorporated into the 6 S and 7 S fractions were the same as those found in 19 S thyroglobulin and in its 12 S subunit. Both the 6 S and 7 S protein units were quantitatively precipitated by anti-rat thyroglobulin antibodies. Double labeling with [3H]leucine and 14C-carbohydrates demonstrated that mannose is present in the fully assembled 19 S and 12 S proteins as well as on the slower sedimenting 6 S and 7 S units, whereas galactose is incorporated only after the formation of the fully assembled stable thyroglobulin molecule. It is concluded that the 6 S and 7 S labeled proteins, which contain only part of the carbohydrate moiety of thyroglobulin, participate in the structure of newly formed unstable 19 S molecules and may represent intermediates during the assembly process of the elementary polypeptide chains of thyroglobulin."

https://openalex.org/W1569199986,"Abstract Two labeled peptides were found in tryptic digests of NaB3H4-reduced, performic acid-oxidized Pseudomonas putida β2 subunit. These two pyridoxyl peptides were identical except for the presence or absence of an NH2-terminal arginyl residue. The tryptic peptides which comprise the two halves of the pyridoxal phosphate-binding segment were isolated from digests of nonreduced, performic acid-oxidized protein. The primary structure deduced for this region of the protein is: [see PDF for sequence]."
https://openalex.org/W1531318195,"Abstract During the binding of oxygen to the artificial intermediate of saturation of hemoglobin, α2+cnβ2, a significant change in the interactions between the two β subunits is observed. The same change in interaction is found both in the presence and absence of the hemoglobin effector 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG). The observed change in β-β interactions even in the absence of DPG suggests that contacts between the two β chains contribute to cooperativity as well as a bridge formed by the DPG molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1547253726,"Abstract The kinetics of the deamination of 5'-adenosine monophosphate by rabbit muscle adenylate deaminase has been studied over a wide range of substrate and enzyme concentrations at pH 6.5. The kinetics in the presence of concentrations of the cationic activator K+ of 0.1 m or higher appears to be of normal Michaelis-Menten character, except that the apparent enthalpy of activation has the unusually high value of 19 kcal mole-1. At low K+ concentrations, the apparent specific activity of the enzyme depends on the concentrations of substrate, K+, and enzyme. In the absence of K+, a lag phase in the deamination reaction, observable by the stopped flow technique, indicates activation by substrate with an apparent second order rate constant of 7000 m-1 sec-1 at 25°. It is shown that a quantitatively consistent interpretation of all the data presented in this paper can be based on the allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J.-P., J. Mol. Biol., 12, 88 (1965)), with the assumption that the enzyme is composed of six or more identical subunits. Equally satisfactory interpretations could undoubtedly be based on other models for apparent allosteric effects which have been proposed by other authors. A decrease in specific activity observed at very low enzyme concentrations, also in the absence of K+, suggests that the enzyme undergoes dissociation, with only the intact oligomer having catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1554696862,"Abstract Crystalline, chromatographically homogeneous dl-4,5-trans-dehydrolysine (dehydrolysine) was synthesized. The dehydrolysine specifically competitively inhibited the activation of [14C]lysine with transfer RNA and lysyl synthetase prepared from whole chick embryo. The dehydrolysine had little effect when tested with other amino acids. The Km for lysine was 21 µm and the Ki for dehydrolysine was 639 µm. When embryonic chick tibia were incubated with dehydrolysine for 5 to 22 hours they incorporated the dehydrolysine into protein at a linear rate. From the amino acid analysis of the tibiae incubated with 4.6 mm dehydrolysine it appeared that there was nearly complete replacement of lysine by dehydrolysine in the newly synthesized protein. This was confirmed by experiments in which tibiae were incubated with 14C-amino acids in the presence and absence of dehydrolysine. As the concentration of dehydrolysine in the incubation medium was increased there was a progressive decrease in the incorporation of [14C]lysine so that at 4.6 mm dehydrolysine there was 79% inhibition. A much smaller decrease in the incorporation of [14C]proline, [14C]glycine, [14C]alanine, or a mixture of 14C-amino acids was observed in the presence of dehydrolysine. Incubation of the cartilage with [14C]lysine or [14C]proline indicated that the lysine and proline still incorporated into collagen in the presence of dehydrolysine were hydroxylated to a normal extent. Thus collagen molecules containing a normal amount of trans-hydroxyproline but a greatly reduced amount of hydroxylysine and glycosylated hydroxylysine were synthesized. Autoradiographs indicated that the collagen containing dehydrolysine was not extruded into the extracellular matrix at a normal rate. It seems unlikely that this effect is due simply to the presence of dehydrolysine in the collagen since this analogue probably would not alter the collagen conformation. It appears therefore that a normal level of hydroxylysine is a necessary but not sufficient condition for normal extrusion."
https://openalex.org/W1488477792,"Abstract Pooled α1-acid glycoprotein, isolated from mixed, normal human plasma, was subjected to specific fragmentation with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) followed by reduction and carboxymethylation. Subsequent gel filtration permitted isolation of four fragments from this pooled glycoprotein. The amino acid sequences of two of these fragments, designated CNBr-III and CNBr-IV, were elucidated. Comparison of these two sequences with that of a carboxyl-terminal CNBr fragment (CNBr-II), established earlier, indicated that CNBr-III corresponds to the amino-terminal 45 residues of CNBr-II, whereas CNBr-IV was found to correspond to the remaining, i.e. carboxyl-terminal portion of CNBr-II. It is extremely interesting to note that while CNBr-III was shown to possess 11 amino acid replacements and, thus, the polypeptide section that includes CNBr-II and CNBr-III is referred to as the variable region, CNBr-IV was devoid of amino acid substitutions and, hence, the sequence of the pooled protein that is common to CNBr-III and CNBr-IV is referred to as the constant region. For this comparison CNBr-II, which possessed no amino acid substitutions, served as reference. Homology of these three CNBr-fragments with the L and H chain of the IgG immunoglobulins and with the α chain of haptoglobin suggests that α1-acid glycoprotein and the immunoglobulins probably evolved from a common ancestral gene."

Range straggling, creation of secondary particles, electron pickup, and the effects of inhomogeneous absorbers were analyzed in terms of cell survival. Depth-survival plots for typical irradiations provide substantial encouragement for the investigation of these beams for biomedical applications in which localized tissue destruction is desired."

https://openalex.org/W2090269553,"Saenger et al. (Letters, 19 Mar.) argue that hyperthyroidism per se is responsible for the statistically significant increase in leukemia death rate which they observed in a combined group of 18,379 radioiodine-treated (RAI) and 10,731 surgery-treated (SUR) hyperthyroid patients (1 ). For the years 1946 to 1964 this increase amounted to 1.5 times the expected death rate calculated on the basis of the experience of the U.S. general population. I have examined the origins of this increase by comparing observed numbers of leukemia deaths in each patient group with the corresponding expected numbers calculated on the basis of U.S. age-, sex-, year-specific leukemia death rates (2). The results show that the excessive leukemia death rate is largely confined (i) to patients who were over 50 years of age at the time of treatment; (ii) to patients with the acute rather than the chronic form of the disease; and (iii) to the RAI rather than the SUR group. Moreover, in RAI patients there is a statistically significant excess of acute leukemia deaths (2) occurring between ages 50 and 79 (namely, 9 observed versus 3.6 expected; P = .01); whereas, in SUR patients, although there is an excess of such deaths between ages 50 and 79 (4 observed versus 2.5 expected), the excess is not statistically significant (3)."
