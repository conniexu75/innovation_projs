https://openalex.org/W2016452703,"By means of an indirect immunofluorescence technique with the use of monoclonal antibodies, the location of the presumptive auxin transport carrier of pea stem tissue was identified in the plasma membranes at the basal ends of parenchyma cells sheathing the vascular bundles. The results represent what is believed to be the first direct evidence for the hypothesized basal efflux carrier conferring polarity to auxin transport in plant stems."
https://openalex.org/W2064644937,"Blood residues from several animal species have been discovered on the surfaces of chert, basalt, and obsidian prehistoric tools (1000 to 6000 years old) from open-air sites along the western coast and in the northern boreal forest of Canada. A screening test has been developed to detect residual blood. Hemoglobin has been crystallized from the residues, and the species of origin determined."
https://openalex.org/W1990322073,"It was discovered that replacement of the alpha-hydrogens of tyramine and tryptamine by deuterium produces a marked intensification of the blood pressure effects and nictitating membrane contraction normally produced by these amines. The results are interpreted on the basis of kinetic isotope effects at the level of monoamine oxidase and clearly establish the importance of this enzyme in the limitation of responses when tyramine and tryptamine are involved. The observed deuterium isotope effects with alpha,alpha-bisdeuterotyramine (alpha,alpha-D(2)-tyramine) have been reproduced with only one of the optical isomers of monodeuterotyramine. This establishes that the enzyme displays a high degree of optical specificity. The use of l-bisdeuteronorepinephrine revealed that norepinephrine cannot be attacked by the enzyme at the effector cell level."
https://openalex.org/W2001235511,"Pollen of the primitive angiosperm family Winteraceae has been discovered in the Aptian-Albian of Israel, extending the fossil record of this phylogenetically important family of flowering plants from the uppermost Upper Cretaceous back some 40 million years to the upper Lower Cretaceous. This appears to represent the earliest known record of a magnolialean angiosperm family and is convincing evidence for the existence in the Early Cretaceous of an extant family of angiosperms."
https://openalex.org/W1999200696,"The conventional hypothesis of gametophytic self-incompatibility in the angiosperms involves one to four multiallelic incompatibility loci and the positive inhibition of incompatible pollen tubes. However, this concept does not accommodate recent experimental data indicating that there may be many loci. An alternative hypothesis which incorporates many loci and complementary pollen-style interactions suggests that there may be no S gene, as previously thought, and that gametophytic self-incompatibility is perhaps merely one aspect of extensive pollen-style interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2063079873,"Quantization of the Hall effect is one of the most surprising discoveries in recent experimental solid-state research. At low temperatures and high magnetic fields the ratio of the Hall voltage to the electric current in a two-dimensional system is quantized in units of h/e(2), where h is Planck's constant and e is the electronic charge. Concomitantly, the electrical resistance of the specimen drops to values far below the resistances of the best normal metals."
https://openalex.org/W2099163641,"Antigenically similar chitin-binding lectins are present in the embryos of wheat, barley, and rye, members of the Triticeae tribe of the grass family (Gramineae). However, the lectins display different localization patterns in these embryos. Lectin is absent from the coleoptile of barley but is present in the outer surface cells of this organ in wheat and in both inner and outer surface cells of rye coleoptiles. All three cereals contain lectin at the periphery of embryonic roots. Similar lectins were not detected in oats and pearl millet, members of other tribes of the Gramineae. Rice, a species only distantly related to wheat, contains a lectin that is antigenically similar to the other cereal lectins and located at the periphery of embryonic roots and throughout the coleoptile."
https://openalex.org/W1984752462,"The weight of sand, coral scrapings, algal fragments, and other calcareous materials which pass through the intestines of reef fishes was calculated on a hectare-per-year basis. It was found that browsing omnivorous reef fishes which rely, in part, on a plant diet ingested and redeposited at least 2300 kg of such material on a 1-hectare study reef near Bermuda. Reasons are presented why this estimate, certainly in order of magnitude, should be applicable to coral reefs in general."
https://openalex.org/W1973696845,"To determine whether the number of species in a biota is in equilibrium requires a colonization model. In a simple Markov model, each species' extinction and immigration probabilities are estimated independently from available data. For one inland and two island avifaunas, a simulation with these probabilities shows that the trajectories of species richness through time do not manifest the regulatory tendencies expected if species interactions cause species richness to be continuously redressed toward an equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2055558529,"A morphologically modern human skeleton from Sunnyvale, California, previously dated by aspartic acid racemization to be approximately 70,000 years old and by uranium series isotopic ratios to be 8300 and 9000 years old, appears to be younger when dated by the carbon-14 method. Four carbon-14 determinations made by both decay and direct counting on three organic fractions of postcranial bone support a middle Holocene age assignment for the skeleton, probably in the range of 3500 to 5000 carbon-14 years before the present. This dating evidence is consistent with the geologic, archeological, and anthropometric relationships of the burial as well as previously determined carbon-14 determinations on associated materials."

https://openalex.org/W2027673870,"When the body temperature of pentobarbitalized dogs was lowered, by surface-immersion technique, to 27 degrees -26 degrees C, elevations in serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase were found only after a period of prolonged hypothermia (12 hours). When the animals were rewarmed, serum levels returned to normal. Histologic study of organs rich in glutamic oxalacetic transaminase revealed no necrosis. The cause for the elevations is not known, although increased membrane permeability secondary to prolonged cold may be a factor."
https://openalex.org/W2054093840,"Our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Milky Way has undergone considerable revision during the past few years. The Galaxy is larger and much more massive than was previously supposed; the newly discovered mass consists of nonluminous matter which is likely to be the dominant form of matter in the universe. New analyses of the atomic hydrogen gas show that the disk of the Galaxy is about twice as extended as was previously thought. Beyond the sun, the gas is concentrated in large-scale, coherent spiral arms indicative of a regular four-armed spiral pattern. The outer edge of the disk has a remarkable scalloping."
https://openalex.org/W2065979387,"The procedures tested to attempt to reactivate carbon-hydrogen bonds in completely saturated organic compounds are discussed. Saturated hydrocarbons appear in petroleum, coal, in synthetic fuels produced by liquefaction of coal and other fossil fuels, and in synthetic fuels produced by Fisher-Tropsch chemistry from syngas. Their potential use as feedstocks for the chemical industry requires that the hydrocarbons be functionalized. The use of transition-metal complexes for the 'activation' process is discussed."
