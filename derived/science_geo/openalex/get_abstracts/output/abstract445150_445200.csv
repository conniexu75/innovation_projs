We found a widespread disruption in miRNA expression during colorectal tumorigenesis using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis; of the 161 miRNAs altered in colorectal cancer compared with normal adjacent tissue samples, miR-31 was the most significantly dysregulated. We identified candidate targets of miR-31 using bioinformatics approaches and validated RAS p21 GTPase activating protein 1 (RASA1) as a direct target. First, we found an inverse correlation between miR-31 and RASA1 protein levels in vivo. Second, in vitro evidence demonstrated that RASA1 expression was significantly decreased by treatment with pre-miR-31-LV, whereas anti-miR-31-LV treatment increased RASA1 protein levels. Third, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-31 directly recognizes a specific location within the 3′-untranslated region of RASA1 transcripts. Furthermore, the biological consequences of miR-31 targeting RASA1 were examined by the cell proliferation assay in vitro and by the immunodeficient mouse xenograft tumor model in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-31 plays a significant role in activating the RAS signaling pathway through the inhibition of RASA1 translation, thereby improving colorectal cancer cell growth and stimulating tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2132428704,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in many cellular functions, including protein folding and Ca2+ homeostasis. The ability of cells to respond to the ER stress is critical for cell survival, and disruption in such regulation can lead to apoptosis. ER stress is accompanied by alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, and the ER Ca2+ store depletion by itself can induce ER stress and apoptosis. Despite that, the ER Ca2+ leak channels activated in response to the ER stress remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that ER Ca2+ depletion during the ER stress occurs via translocon, the ER protein complex involved in translation. Numerous ER stress inducers stimulate the ER Ca2+ leak that can be prevented by translocon inhibitor, anisomycin. Expression of GRP78, an ER stress marker, increased following treatment with puromycin (a translocon opener) and was suppressed by anisomycin, confirming a primary role of translocon in ER stress induction. Inhibition of ER store depletion by anisomycin significantly reduces apoptosis stimulated by the ER stress inducers. We suggest that translocon opening is physiologically modulated by GRP78, particularly during the ER stress. The ability to modulate the ER Ca2+ permeability and subsequent ER stress can lead to development of a novel therapeutic approach.—Hammadi, M., Oulidi, A., Gackière, F., Katsogiannou, M., Slomianny, C., Roudbaraki, M., Dewailly, E., Delcourt, P., Lepage, G., Lotteau, S., Ducreux, S., Prevarskaya, N., Van Coppenolle, F.

https://openalex.org/W2058357630,"There has been much recent interest in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling through one of its receptors, LPA1, in fibrotic diseases, but the mechanisms by which LPA-LPA1 signaling promotes pathological fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated. Using a mouse peritoneal fibrosis model, we demonstrate central roles for LPA and LPA1 in fibroblast proliferation. Genetic deletion or pharmacological antagonism of LPA1 protected mice from peritoneal fibrosis, blunting the increases in peritoneal collagen by 65.4 and 52.9%, respectively, compared to control animals and demonstrated that peritoneal fibroblast proliferation was highly LPA1 dependent. Activation of LPA1 on mesothelial cells induced these cells to express connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), driving fibroblast proliferation in a paracrine fashion. Activation of mesothelial cell LPA1 induced CTGF expression by inducing cytoskeleton reorganization in these cells, causing nuclear translocation of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A and MRTF-B. Pharmacological inhibition of MRTF-induced transcription also diminished CTGF expression and fibrosis in the peritoneal fibrosis model, mitigating the increase in peritoneal collagen content by 57.9% compared to controls. LPA1-induced cytoskeleton reorganization therefore makes a previously unrecognized but critically important contribution to the profibrotic activities of LPA by driving MRTF-dependent CTGF expression, which, in turn, drives fibroblast proliferation.—Sakai, N., Chun, J., Duffield, J. S., Wada, T., Luster, A. D., Tager, A. M. LPA1-induced cytoskeleton reorganization drives fibrosis through CTGF-dependent fibroblast proliferation. FASEB J. 27, 1830–1846 (2013). www.fasebj.org"

https://openalex.org/W2086959974,"Staphylococcus aureus infections present an enormous global health concern complicated by an alarming increase in antibiotic resistance. S. aureus is among the few bacterial species that express nitric-oxide synthase (bNOS) and thus can catalyze NO production from l-arginine. Here we generate an isogenic bNOS-deficient mutant in the epidemic community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) USA300 clone to study its contribution to virulence and antibiotic susceptibility. Loss of bNOS increased MRSA susceptibility to reactive oxygen species and host cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides, which correlated with increased MRSA killing by human neutrophils and within neutrophil extracellular traps. bNOS also promoted resistance to the pharmaceutical antibiotics that act on the cell envelope such as vancomycin and daptomycin. Surprisingly, bNOS-deficient strains gained resistance to aminoglycosides, suggesting that the role of bNOS in antibiotic susceptibility is more complex than previously observed in Bacillus species. Finally, the MRSA bNOS mutant showed reduced virulence with decreased survival and smaller abscess generation in a mouse subcutaneous infection model. Together, these data indicate that bNOS contributes to MRSA innate immune and antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Future development of specific bNOS inhibitors could be an attractive option to simultaneously reduce MRSA pathology and enhance its susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) generates NO through bacterial NO synthase (bNOS).Results: Loss of bNOS increases MRSA sensitivity to host neutrophils, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides, and cell envelope-active antibiotics.Conclusion: bNOS influences MRSA disease pathology.Significance: Future development of bNOS-specific inhibitors could provide dual activities to reduce MRSA pathology and increase antibiotic effectiveness.

Mammalian NO production is regulated by the activity of NO synthase (NOS)4Pant K. Bilwes A.M. Adak S. Stuehr D.J. Crane B.R.

The three mammalian NOS isoforms have two catalytic domains, an oxygenase domain and a reductase domain, responsible for binding the substrate arginine and co-factors, respectively. NO production has been implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, including host innate immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens (1Wink D.A. Hines H.B. Cheng R.Y. Switzer C.H. Flores-Santana W. Vitek M.P. Ridnour L.A. Colton C.A. Nitric oxide and redox mechanisms in the immune response.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2011; 89: 873-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, genome sequencing has revealed the existence of mammalian NOS homologues in a limited number of prokaryotic organisms, principally Gram-positive bacteria (2Gusarov I. Starodubtseva M. Wang Z.Q. McQuade L. Lippard S.J. Stuehr D.J. Nudler E. Bacterial nitric-oxide synthases operate without a dedicated redox partner.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13140-13147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Structural analysis has shown that bacterial NOS (bNOS) enzymes are highly similar to the oxygenase domain of mammalian NOS (3Bird L.E. Ren J. Zhang J. Foxwell N. Hawkins A.R. Charles I.G.

Nitrosyl-heme structures of Bacillus subtilis nitric oxide synthase have implications for understanding substrate oxidation.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2537-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but lack a corresponding reductase domain. Nonetheless, bNOS can efficiently generate NO from l-arginine by hijacking alternate cellular redox partners (2Gusarov I. Starodubtseva M. Wang Z.Q. McQuade L. Lippard S.J. Stuehr D.J. Nudler E. Bacterial nitric-oxide synthases operate without a dedicated redox partner.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13140-13147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Bacterial NO production contributes to Bacillus anthracis virulence by enhancing resistance to oxidative stress (6Shatalin K. Gusarov I. Avetissova E. Shatalina Y. McQuade L.E. Lippard S.J. Nudler E. Bacillus anthracis-derived nitric oxide is essential for pathogen virulence and survival in macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13855-13860Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and to virulence of the plant pathogen Streptomyces turgidiscabies by nitrating and activating a phytotoxin (8Kers J.A. Wach M.J. Krasnoff S.B. Widom J. Cameron K.D. Bukhalid R.A. Gibson D.M. Crane B.R. Loria R. Nitration of a peptide phytotoxin by bacterial nitric oxide synthase.Nature. 2004; 429: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies demonstrate a link between NO and bacterial antibiotic resistance. First, Gusarov et al. (9Gusarov I. Shatalin K. Starodubtseva M. Nudler E. Endogenous nitric oxide protects bacteria against a wide spectrum of antibiotics.Science. 2009; 325: 1380-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) found that endogenous NO production through bNOS protects the producing bacterium against various antibiotics, either through chemical modification of the agent or by counteracting the increased levels of intracellular oxidative stress induced by bactericidal drugs. In a complementary fashion, exposure to exogenous NO protects both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria from aminoglycoside toxicity by limiting drug uptake (10McCollister B.D. Hoffman M. Husain M. Vázquez-Torres A. Nitric oxide protects bacteria from aminoglycosides by blocking the energy-dependent phases of drug uptake.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive human pathogen causing a wide spectrum of clinical disease, ranging from minor skin infections to severe invasive conditions such as pneumonia, sepsis, and endocarditis. Recently, marked increases in infections by antibiotic (methicillin)-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have occurred in both hospital and community settings, posing a grave challenge to the public health. Epidemic strains of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) such as the USA300 clone can produce severe disease even in previously healthy individuals (11DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Kreiswirth B.N. Chambers H.F. Community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Lancet. 2010; 375: 1557-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 12Tenover F.C. Goering R.V. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300. Origin and epidemiology.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2009; 64: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), reflecting a formidable capacity of the pathogen to evade normal host innate immune clearance (13Voyich J.M. Braughton K.R. Sturdevant D.E. Whitney A.R. Saïd-Salim B. Porcella S.F. Long R.D. Dorward D.W. Gardner D.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Musser J.M. DeLeo F.R. Insights into mechanisms used by Staphylococcus aureus to avoid destruction by human neutrophils.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3907-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A key element of innate defense against invasive pathogens such as S. aureus is the function of neutrophils (14Mölne L. Verdrengh M. Tarkowski A.

Res. 2008; 150: 278-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through respiratory burst is a central element of normal neutrophil killing activity, as evidenced by the marked susceptibility of patients with genetic defects in NADPH oxidase (chronic granulomatous disease) to recurrent severe S. aureus infections (17van den Berg J.M. van Koppen E. Ahlin A. Belohradsky B.H. Bernatowska E. Corbeel L. Español T. Fischer A. Kurenko-Deptuch M. Mouy R. Petropoulou T. Roesler J. Seger R. Stasia M.J. Valerius N.H. Weening R.S. Wolach B. Roos D. Kuijpers T.W. Chronic granulomatous disease. The European experience.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In addition, inflammatory activation of leukocytes results in inducible NOS (iNOS) induction and release of NO, which has a direct inhibitory activity against several bacterial species, and participates in downstream reactions with different ROS to produce synergistic antibacterial effects (1Wink D.A. Hines H.B. Cheng R.Y. Switzer C.H. Flores-Santana W. Vitek M.P. Ridnour L.A. Colton C.A. Nitric oxide and redox mechanisms in the immune response.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2011; 89: 873-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Nonoxidant mechanisms also contribute to bacterial killing, for example cationic antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) stored in neutrophil granules that target and disrupt bacterial membrane integrity (18Soehnlein O. Direct and alternative antimicrobial mechanisms of neutrophil-derived granule proteins.J. Mol. Med. 2009; 87: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). S. aureus has evolved multifaceted resistance mechanisms to neutrophil killing that contribute to its invasive disease potential. For example, ROS activity is mitigated by the S. aureus enzyme catalase (19Mandell G.L. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro and in vivo studies with emphasis on staphylococcal-leukocyte interaction.J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Park B. Nizet V. Liu G.Y. Role of Staphylococcus aureus catalase in niche competition against Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2275-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the carotenoid pigment of the bacterium (21Liu G.Y. Essex A. Buchanan J.T. Datta V. Hoffman H.M. Bastian J.F. Fierer J. Nizet V. Staphylococcus aureus golden pigment impairs neutrophil killing and promotes virulence through its antioxidant activity.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). S. aureus can also tolerate severe nitrosative stress and high NO concentrations, because of adaptive metabolic responses including induction of the flavohemoprotein Hmp (22Richardson A.R. Dunman P.M. Fang F.C. The nitrosative stress response of Staphylococcus aureus is required for resistance to innate immunity.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and l-lactate dehydrogenase (23Richardson A.R. Libby S.J. Fang F.C. A nitric oxide-inducible lactate dehydrogenase enables Staphylococcus aureus to resist innate immunity.Science. 2008; 319: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Relative insensitivity of S. aureus to cathelicidin action is promoted by cationic cell wall modifications (24Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Götz F.

S. aureus expresses a bNOS enzyme, but its potential contribution to bacterial immune and antibiotic resistance has not been tested. To assess the role of MRSA bNOS in these processes, we couple targeted mutagenesis with in vitro and in vivo assays of bacterial-host interaction and antibiotic susceptibility. Our analysis was conducted using a representative isolate of the epidemic USA300 CA-MRSA strain, the most common agent of serious bacterial infections in recent epidemiologic surveillance in the United States (12Tenover F.C. Goering R.V. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300. Origin and epidemiology.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2009; 64: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). S. aureus strain UAMS1182 is a community-acquired USA300 MRSA strain. Bacteria were cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) under shaking conditions or on TSB agar at 37 °C. Plasmid expression of pNOS or empty vector control was achieved using 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. All of the experiments were performed with USA300 MRSA WT and ΔNOS mutant strain containing the empty vector control as an appropriate comparison for experiments using the complemented strain. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:30 in fresh TSB and grown to exponential phase A600 = 0.4 (2 × 108 CFU/ml), unless otherwise indicated. Similar growth kinetics were observed for all strains under the assay conditions used (data not shown). Markerless precise allelic replacement of S. aureus bNOS was performed using PCR-based methods as described (28Bae T. Schneewind O. Allelic replacement in Staphylococcus aureus with inducible counter-selection.Plasmid. 2006; 55: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) with minor changes. Primer sequences were based on the published USA300 FPR3757 (29Diep B.A. Gill S.R. Chang R.F. Phan T.H. Chen J.H. Davidson M.G. Lin F. Lin J. Carleton H.A. Mongodin E.F. Sensabaugh G.F.

Complete genome sequence of USA300, an epidemic clone of community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Lancet. 2006; 367: 731-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Briefly, 828 bp of sequence immediately upstream of nos was amplified with primers NOS-UpF+attB1, 5′-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctggcaacatattcgtctccataagt-3′, and NOS-UpR, 5′-gcatatgctacacctctactaacttacaacacctcgctttatattatag-3′, and 743 bp immediately downstream of nos amplified with the primers NOS-DownF, 5′-ctataatataaagcgaggtgttgttagttagtagaggtgtagcatatgc-3′, and NOS-DownR+attB2, 5′-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtcggttgtaattgcagaatcagcctg-3′. The NOS-upR and NOS-downF primers were constructed with ∼25-bp 5′ overhangs for the opposite flanking region. The upstream and downstream PCR products were fused in a second round of PCR using primers NOS-UpF+attB1 + NOS-downR+attB2 and subcloned into the temperature-sensitive vector pKOR1 using BP clonase reaction (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pKOR1-ΔNOS was first passed through S. aureus RN4220, before electroporation into strain UAMS1182. Precise in-frame allelic replacement of the nos gene was established by a two-step process of temperature shifting and antisense counterselection (28Bae T. Schneewind O. Allelic replacement in Staphylococcus aureus with inducible counter-selection.Plasmid. 2006; 55: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. For complementation analysis, bNOS was PCR-amplified from the UAMS1182 chromosome using NOS-FL-F, 5′-gcggaattcatgtaatttaaagaggctcaagc-3′, and NOS-FL-R, 5′-gcgggatccttaatgatggaaagggcagtgg-3′, and cloned into shuttle expression vector pDC123 (30Chaffin D.O.

Blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in Gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoZ) expression.Gene. 1998; 219: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pNOS. Bacteria were grown to logarithmic phase in TSB and then transferred into phosphate buffer (45 mm, 80 mm K2HPO4, 4 mm Na3C6H5O7) with 5 mm Arg + 0.8% glucose and incubated for 10 min. A NO-reactive fluorescent probe (CuFL) (31Lim M.H. Lippard S.J. Fluorescent nitric oxide detection by copper complexes bearing anthracenyl and dansyl fluorophore ligands.Inorg. Chem. 2006; 45: 8980-8989Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was prepared just prior to use by mixing FL and CuCl2 in a 1:1 ratio and then added to the cells to a final concentration of 20 μm (2Gusarov I. Starodubtseva M. Wang Z.Q. McQuade L. Lippard S.J. Stuehr D.J. Nudler E. Bacterial nitric-oxide synthases operate without a dedicated redox partner.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13140-13147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Twenty minutes later, fluorescence and bright field images of bacteria treated with the NO-detecting probe were taken by digital camera attached to an Axio microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.). Bacteria were grown to logarithmic phase in TSB, and 5 × 106 bacteria were incubated with 0.2% H2O2 at 37 °C in 250 μl in a 96-well microplate. Samples were diluted in PBS and plated on TSB agar for enumeration of surviving bacteria at the indicated time points. The first dilution contained 2,500 units/ml of catalase (Sigma) to quench residual H2O2. For exogenous NO rescue experiments, bacteria were pretreated with 500 μm of methylamine hexamethylene NONOate (Sigma) for 3 min before adding bacteria to wells that contained H2O2. The NO donor was present for the duration of the assay at 50 μm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were performed by broth microdilution. Vancomycin MIC and daptomycin MIC assays were performed in TSB and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (50 mg/liter Ca2+ + 12.5 mg/liter Mg2+). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted in fresh TSB and grown to logarithmic phase at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. The culture was pelleted and resuspended to A600 = 0.4 in PBS. The bacteria were diluted in the appropriate broth, and 5 × 105 CFU were added to a 96-well test plate in triplicate containing different concentration of vancomycin (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) or daptomycin. The test plate containing the antibiotic dilutions and target bacteria was incubated at 37 °C for 18–20 h. MIC was determined to be the lowest concentration of antibiotic that inhibited bacterial growth as determined by turbidometric assessment at A600. Daptomycin time kill assays were similarly performed in triplicate in 96-well plates containing 5 × 105 bacteria and 2 μg/ml daptomycin in a total volume of 250 μl. Samples were taken every hour, and viability was determined by dilution plating. Growth curves in the presence of daptomycin were performed in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth and 2 μg/ml daptomycin at 37 °C under shaking conditions. Optical density was measured every 30 min at 600 nm. We also used growth inhibition (Bioscreen C MBR machine) and killing assays to determine sensitivity to several ribosomally active, generally bacteriostatic antibiotics, including the aminoglycosides gentamicin and streptomycin and the oxazolidinone linezolid. Briefly, bacteria were grown overnight in TSB containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The next day the bacteria were regrown to A600 = 0.4 in TSB, washed, and resuspended in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. Bacteria (5 × 105 CFU) were added to Bioscreen Honeycomb plates in a total volume of 200 μl of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth containing different concentrations of the indicated antibiotic. Growth was determined by measuring A600 every 15 min for 18 h. As a measurement of antibiotic inhibition, the percentage of maximum growth compared with conditions without antibiotic was calculated using the following formula: A600 at 18 h with antibiotic/A600 at 18 h without antibiotic × 100%. Bacterial killing assays were performed to verify the antibiotic sensitivity by quantifying bacterial survival through serial dilution plating using a similar set up as described for daptomycin. SOD activity was determined by negative staining on native polyacrylamide gels (32Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Superoxide dismutase. Improved assays and an assay applicable to acrylamide gels.Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9843) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in TSB, and samples were collected every hour. Pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml lysostaphin; Sigma), followed by repeated freeze thawing until complete lysis. The cell debris was separated from the soluble fraction by centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 rpm) at 4 °C. The samples were normalized according to the total protein concentration and resolved on 10% nondenaturing PAGE. The SOD activity was visualized by negative staining by the nitroblue tetrazolium method. Additionally, SOD enzymatic activity was measured using a colorimetric assay (Cayman Chemical). Log phase grown bacteria were resuspended to 2 × 106 CFU/ml in assay buffer (PBS containing 20% TSB and 50 mm NaHCO3), and 25 μl of this suspension was added to 225 μl containing 16 μm murine cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide in assay buffer. The test plate was incubated at 37 °C, and samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h to quantify surviving CFU by serial dilution plating. To test AMP degradation by S. aureus supernatants, S. aureus cultures were grown overnight in TSB containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Supernatants were collected by filter sterilization using a 0.22 μm filter. 18 μl of supernatant was incubated with 32 μm AMP for the indicated time points in a 37 °C water bath. The samples were run under reducing conditions on 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen) with MES running buffer (Invitrogen) and stained with SimplyBlue Safestain (Invitrogen) to visualize AMP degradation. Overnight bacterial cultures were grown to A600 = 0.4 in RPMI 1640 at 37 °C + 5% CO2 without shaking and diluted with assay medium (RPMI 1640 containing 2% nuclease-free heat-inactivated (70 °C, 30 min) FCS) (33von Köckritz-Blickwede M. Nizet V. Innate immunity turned inside-out. Antimicrobial defense by phagocyte extracellular traps.J. Mol. Med. 2009; 87: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) to the desired concentration. Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors using the PolymorphPrepTM system (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) and resuspended in assay medium. The neutrophils were seeded in 48-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/250 μl of medium/well and prestimulated with 25 nm PMA for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. For extracellular killing, cytochalasin D was added together with PMA at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. 250 μl of bacterial suspension was added directly to PMA-stimulated PMN at a multiplicity of infection of 2. The plates were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 8 min and further incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2. After 30 or 90 min, neutrophils were lysed using 0.025% Triton X-100, and the surviving bacteria were quantified by serial dilution plating. The neutrophils were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated glass cover slides (5 × 105 cells/12 mm/1.5 glass slides), pretreated with PMA, and infected at an multiplicity of infection of 2 as described above. After 30 min of infection, a Live/Dead BacLightTM bacterial viability kit (Invitrogen) was used to determine the viability of NET-entrapped S. aureus entrapped by fluorescence microscopy. After staining as recommended by the manufacturer, the cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed three times, and mounted onto glass slides with ProlongGold with DAPI (Invitrogen). Mounted samples were examined using an inverted confocal laser scanning two-photon microscope Olympus Fluoview FV1000 with FluoviewTM spectral scanning technology (Olympus). Viable (green) versus dead (red) bacteria, which were entrapped by NETs (blue, DAPI-stained), were counted from a minimum of four images of three individual experiments. Bone marrow cells were flushed from tibias and femurs of 6–10-week old C57bl6 mice (Charles River) in RPMI and cultured for 7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM + 20% FBS + 20% L-929 cell conditioned medium. Adherent macrophages were lifted in ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, pelleted, and seeded into 24-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well in DMEM/10% FBS. 16 h after seeding, the wells were inoculated with 0.2 ml of DMEM/FBS containing PBS-washed bacteria grown to mid-log phase in TSB (A600 = 0.4), at multiplicity of infection of 1. The plates were centrifuged at 1,600 rpm for 5 min, incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h, and treated with 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) for 30 min to kill noninternalized bacteria. The wells were then rinsed twice in DPBS and reconstituted with 0.9 ml of DMEM and 10% FBS. Enumeration of surviving bacteria was performed at 0 h (immediately post-gentamicin), 3 h, and 6 h, as follows. 0.25% Triton X-100 was added to wells to lyse macrophages by trituration, and serial dilutions were plated to enumerate CFU. Intracellular survival was calculated as the percentage of bacteria remaining at 3 or 6 h compared with 0 h CFU. MRSA were grown to mid-log phase in TSB (A600 = 0.4), washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in PBS. Shaved 7-week-old female C57bl6 mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and injected in the mid-left flank in 100 μl containing ∼1.3 × 107 CFU. Abscesses were photographed daily, and the area was quantified using Image J. Abscess area was defined as the zone of leukocytic infiltration including the contained zone of dermonecrosis. On day 3, abscesses were excised and homogenized in PBS prior to serial dilution and drop plating. Abscess burden was calculated as abscess area × CFU/g. In a co-infection experiment, equal numbers (8 × 106 CFU) of WT and ΔNOS mutant MRSA were injected into the same site on a single mouse; lesions were excised after 3 days, and the ratio of WT to mutant CFU recovered was calculated for each mouse. The data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software). For H2O2, antibiotic, AMP, and neutrophil killing assays data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison correction after log transformation. Analysis of the mouse in vivo challenge experiments was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Human blood collection and neutrophil isolation studies were performed under approved protocols of the University of California, San Diego Human Research Protection Program. The mouse infection studies were performed under"

https://openalex.org/W2166375615,"Most neurodegenerative diseases are linked to aberrant accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins. Among them, Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat stretch in the N terminus of the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT), which gets cleaved and aggregates in the brain. Recently established human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived HD neurons exhibit some disease-relevant phenotypes and provide tools for HD research. However, they have limitations such as genetic heterogeneity and an absence of mHTT aggregates and lack a robust neurodegeneration phenotype. In addition, the relationship between the phenotype and mHTT levels has not been elucidated. Herein, we present a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived HD neuronal model expressing HT-Texon1 fragments, which addresses the deficiencies enumerated above. The wild-type and HD lines are derived from an isogenic background and exhibit insoluble mHTT aggregates and neurodegeneration. We also demonstrate a quantitative relationship between neurodegeneration and soluble monomeric (but not oligomeric or aggregated) mHTT levels. Reduction of ~10% of mHTT is sufficient to prevent toxicity, whereas ~90% reduction of wild-type HTT is safe and well-tolerated in these cells. A known HD toxicity modifier (Rhes) showed expected rescue of neurodegeneration. Therefore, the hESC-derived neuronal models complement existing induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal models and provide valuable tools for HD research.—Lu, B., Palacino, J.

https://openalex.org/W2023580202,"The agents of leptospirosis, a zoonosis with worldwide distribution, are pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. The leptospiral life cycle involves transmission via fresh water and colonization of the renal tubules of their reservoir hosts. Infection of accidental hosts, including humans, may result in life-threatening sequelae. Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs), particularly those with surface-exposed regions, play crucial roles in pathogen virulence mechanisms and adaptation to environmental conditions, including those found in the mammalian host. Therefore, elucidation and characterization of the surface-exposed OMPs of Leptospira spp. is of great interest in the leptospirosis field. A thorough, multi-pronged approach for assessing surface exposure of leptospiral OMPs is essential. Herein, we present evidence for a sub-surface location for most or all of the major leptospiral lipoprotein, LipL32, based on surface immunofluorescence utilizing three different types of antibodies and four different permeabilization methods, as well as surface proteolysis of intact and lysed leptospires. We reevaluate prior evidence presented in support of LipL32 surface-exposure and present a novel perspective on a protein whose location has been misleading researchers, due in large part to its extraordinary abundance in leptospiral cells."
https://openalex.org/W2100032230,"Objective There is emerging evidence from animal studies suggesting a key role for methylation in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. However, to date, very few studies have investigated the role of methylation in the development of human hypertension, and none has taken a genome-wide approach. Based on the recent studies that highlight the involvement of inflammation in the development of hypertension, we hypothesize that changes in DNA methylation of leukocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Method & Results We conducted a genome-wide methylation analysis on 8 hypertensive cases and 8 normotensive age-matched controls aged 14–23 years and performed validation of the most significant CpG sites in 2 genes in an independent sample of 36 hypertensive cases and 60 normotensive controls aged 14–30 years. Validation of the CpG sites in the SULF1 gene was further conducted in a second replication sample of 36 hypertensive cases and 34 controls aged 15.8–40 years. A CpG site in the SULF1 gene showed higher methylation levels in cases than in healthy controls in the genome-wide step (p = 6.2×10−5), which was confirmed in the validation step (p = 0.011) for subjects ≤30 years old but was not significant for subjects of all ages combined (p = 0.095). Conclusion The identification of a difference in a blood leukocyte DNA methylation site between hypertensive cases and normotensive controls suggests that changes in DNA methylation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The age dependency of the effect further suggests complexity of epigenetic regulation in this age-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W2129349289,"Acylcarnitines are commonly used in the diagnosis of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation disorders (mFAODs). It is generally assumed that this plasma acylcarnitine profile reflects the mitochondrial accumulation of acyl-CoAs. The identity of the enzymes and the mitochondrial and plasmalemmal transporters involved in the synthesis and export of these metabolites have remained undefined. We used lentiviral shRNA to knock down the expression of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) in control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)-, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-, and plasmalemmal carnitine transporter (OCTN2)-deficient human fibroblasts. These cell lines, including mock-transduced controls, were loaded with decanoic acid and carnitine, followed by the measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium. In control fibroblasts, MCAD knockdown markedly increased the production of octanoylcarnitine (3-fold, P<0.01). OCTN2-deficient cell lines also showed extracellular accumulation of octanoylcarnitine (2.8-fold, P<0.01), suggesting that the cellular export of acylcarnitines does not depend on OCTN2. In contrast, in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells, the accumulation of octanoylcarnitine in the medium did not significantly increase in the MCAD knockdown. Similar results were obtained using pharmacological inhibition of CPT2 in fibroblasts from MCAD-deficient individuals. This shows that CPT2 and CACT are crucial for mitochondrial acylcarnitine formation and export to the extracellular fluids in mFAOD."
https://openalex.org/W1988049214,"Epigenetic changes are a potential mechanism contributing to race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health. However, there is scant evidence of the race/ethnic and socioeconomic patterning of epigenetic marks. We used data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Stress Study (N = 988) to describe age- and gender-independent associations of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) with methylation of Alu and LINE-1 repetitive elements in leukocyte DNA. Mean Alu and Line 1 methylation in the full sample were 24% and 81% respectively. In multivariable linear regression models, African-Americans had 0.27% (p<0.01) and Hispanics 0.20% (p<0.05) lower Alu methylation than whites. In contrast, African-Americans had 0.41% (p<0.01) and Hispanics 0.39% (p<0.01) higher LINE-1 methylation than whites. These associations remained after adjustment for SES. In addition, a one standard deviation higher wealth was associated with 0.09% (p<0.01) higher Alu and 0.15% (p<0.01) lower LINE-1 methylation in age- and gender-adjusted models. Additional adjustment for race/ethnicity did not alter this pattern. No associations were observed with income, education or childhood SES. Our findings, from a large community-based sample, suggest that DNA methylation is socially patterned. Future research, including studies of gene-specific methylation, is needed to understand better the opposing associations of Alu and LINE-1 methylation with race/ethnicity and wealth as well as the extent to which small methylation changes in these sequences may influence disparities in health."
https://openalex.org/W2065889524,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. mTOR is frequently activated in human cancers and is a commonly sought anticancer therapeutic target. However, whether the human mTOR gene itself is a proto-oncogene possessing tumorigenicity has not been firmly established. To answer this question, we mutated evolutionarily conserved amino acids, generated eight mutants in the HEAT repeats (M938T) and the FAT (W1456R and G1479N) and kinase (P2273S, V2284M, V2291I, T2294I, and E2288K) domains of mTOR, and studied their oncogenicity. On transient expression in HEK293T cells, these mTOR mutants displayed elevated protein kinase activities accompanied by activated mTOR/p70S6K signaling at varying levels, demonstrating the gain of function of the mTOR gene with these mutations. We selected P2273S and E2288K, the two most catalytically active mutants, to further examine their oncogenicity and tumorigenicity. Stable expression of the two mTOR mutants in NIH3T3 cells strongly activated mTOR/p70S6K signaling, induced cell transformation and invasion, and remarkably, caused rapid tumor formation and growth in athymic nude mice after subcutaneous inoculation of the transfected cells. This study confirms the oncogenic potential of mTOR suggested previously and demonstrates for the first time its tumorigenicity. Thus, beyond the pivotal position of mTOR to relay the oncogenic signals from the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in human cancer, mTOR is capable potentially of playing a direct role in human tumorigenesis if mutated. These results also further support the conclusion that mTOR is a major therapeutic target in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1995582167,"Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. SIK2 has been shown to function in the insulin-signaling pathway during adipocyte differentiation and to modulate CREB-mediated gene expression in response to hormones and nutrients. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of SIK2 kinase activity remains largely elusive. Here we report a dynamic, post-translational regulation of its kinase activity that is coordinated by an acetylation-deacetylation switch, p300/CBP-mediated Lys-53 acetylation inhibits SIK2 kinase activity, whereas HDAC6-mediated deacetylation restores the activity. Interestingly, overexpression of acetylation-mimetic mutant of SIK2 (SIK2-K53Q), but not the nonacetylatable K53R variant, resulted in accumulation of autophagosomes. Further consistent with a role in autophagy, knockdown of SIK2 abrogated autophagosome and lysosome fusion. Consequently, SIK2 and its kinase activity are indispensable for the removal of TDP-43Δ inclusion bodies. Our findings uncover SIK2 as a critical determinant in autophagy progression and further suggest a mechanism in which the interplay among kinase and deacetylase activities contributes to cellular protein pool homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2062631072,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide. During tumorigenesis, tumor suppressor and cancer-related genes are commonly silenced by aberrant DNA methylation in their promoter regions. Zebularine (1-(β-(D)-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one) acts as an inhibitor of DNA methylation and exhibits chemical stability and minimal cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explore the effect and possible mechanism of action of zebularine on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. We demonstrate that zebularine exhibits antitumor activity on HepG2 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, however, it has little effect on DNA methylation in HepG2 cells. On the other hand, zebularine treatment downregulated CDK2 and the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and upregulated p21(WAF/CIP1) and p53. We also found that zebularine treatment upregulated the phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). These results suggest that the p44/42 MAPK pathway plays a role in zebularine-induced cell-cycle arrest by regulating the activity of p21(WAF/CIP1) and Rb. Furthermore, although the proapoptotic protein Bax levels were not affected, the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 level was downregulated with zebularine treatment. In addition, the data in the present study indicate that inhibition of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is involved in inducing apoptosis with zebularine. These results suggest a novel mechanism of zebularine-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis via a DNA methylation-independent pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2066268056,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays an essential role in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) mediated by the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. DNA-PK is a holoenzyme consisting of a DNA-binding (Ku70/Ku80) and catalytic (DNA-PKcs) subunit. DNA-PKcs is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is recruited to DSBs via Ku70/80 and is activated once the kinase is bound to the DSB ends. In this study, two large, distinct fragments of DNA-PKcs, consisting of the N terminus (amino acids 1-2713), termed N-PKcs, and the C terminus (amino acids 2714-4128), termed C-PKcs, were produced to determine the role of each terminal region in regulating the activity of DNA-PKcs. N-PKcs but not C-PKcs interacts with the Ku-DNA complex and is required for the ability of DNA-PKcs to localize to DSBs. C-PKcs has increased basal kinase activity compared with DNA-PKcs, suggesting that the N-terminal region of DNA-PKcs keeps basal activity low. The kinase activity of C-PKcs is not stimulated by Ku70/80 and DNA, further supporting that the N-terminal region is required for binding to the Ku-DNA complex and full activation of kinase activity. Collectively, the results show the N-terminal region mediates the interaction between DNA-PKcs and the Ku-DNA complex and is required for its DSB-induced enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2135445808,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), which is mainly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the membrane-bound component p22PHOX and the cytosolic partners NOX organizer 1 (NOXO1), NOX activator 1 (NOXA1), and Rac1. Contrary to that of its phagocyte counterpart NOX2, the molecular basis of NOX1 regulation is not clear. Because NOXO1 lacks the phosphorylated region found in its homolog p47PHOX, the current view is that NOX1 activation occurs without NOXO1 phosphorylation. Here, however, we demonstrate that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulates NOXO1 phosphorylation in a transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 epithelial cell model via protein kinase C and identify Ser-154 as the major phosphorylated site. Endogenous NOXO1 from T84 colon epithelial cells was also phosphorylated, suggesting that NOXO1 phosphorylation is physiologically relevant. In transfected HEK-293 cells, PMA-induced phosphorylation on Ser-154 enhanced NOXO1 binding to NOXA1 (+97%) and to the p22PHOX C-terminal region (+384%), increased NOXO1 colocalization with p22PHOX, and allowed optimal ROS production by NOX1 as demonstrated by the use of S154A and S154D mutants compared with that by wild-type NOXO1 (P<0.05). Pulldown experiments revealed that phosphorylation on Ser-154 was sufficient to markedly enhance NOXO1 binding to NOXA1, which in turn acts as a molecular switch, allowing optimal interaction of NOXO1 with p22PHOX. This study unexpectedly revealed that full assembly and activation of NOX1 is a tightly regulated process in which NOXO1 phosphorylation on Ser-154 is the initial trigger.—Debbabi, M., Kroviarski, Y., Bournier, O., Gougerot-Pocidalo, M.-A., El-Benna, J., Dang, P.M.-C.

The triple deficient (UNC93B1 mutant) mice have a functional single point mutation in the UNC93B1 that results in non-functional TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9. Herein, we demonstrate that UNC93B1 mutant mice, in the C57BL/6 (resistant) genetic background, are highly susceptible to Leishmania major infection. Enhanced swelling of the footpad was associated with high levels of interleukin 10, decreased levels of interferon γ, and increased parasitism. None of the single TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 knock-out (KO) mice resemble the UNC93B1 mutant phenotype upon infection with L. major. Whereas the double TLR7/TLR9 KO showed a partial phenotype, the triple TLR3/TLR7/TLR9 KO mice were as susceptible as the UNC93B1 mutant mice, when infected with Leishmania parasites. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with either anti-interleukin 10 receptor monoclonal antibody or recombinant interleukin 12 restored a robust anti-parasite TH1 response and reverted the susceptible phenotype of UNC93B1 mutant mice.

Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria that can trigger inflammatory responses. In contrast to lipopolysaccharide, little is known on the effects of AMPK activation in LTA-triggered innate immune responses. Here, we studied the potency of AMPK activation to reduce LTA-induced inflammation in vitro and in lungs in vivo. Activation of AMPK in vitro reduced cytokine production in the alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S. In vivo, AMPK activation reduced LTA-induced neutrophil influx, as well as protein leak and cytokine/chemokine levels in the bronchoalveolar space.

https://openalex.org/W2154681278,"Mutations in the human SEPN1 gene, encoding selenoprotein N (SepN), cause SEPN1-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM) characterized by muscle weakness, spinal rigidity, and respiratory insufficiency. As with other members of the selenoprotein family, selenoprotein N incorporates selenium in the form of selenocysteine (Sec). Most selenoproteins that have been functionally characterized are involved in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, with the Sec residue located at their catalytic site. To model SEPN1-RM, we generated a Sepn1-knockout (Sepn1(-/-)) mouse line. Homozygous Sepn1(-/-) mice are fertile, and their weight and lifespan are comparable to wild-type (WT) animals. Under baseline conditions, the muscle histology of Sepn1(-/-) mice remains normal, but subtle core lesions could be detected in skeletal muscle after inducing oxidative stress. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channels showed lower sensitivity to caffeine in SepN deficient myofibers, suggesting a possible role of SepN in RyR regulation. SepN deficiency also leads to abnormal lung development characterized by enlarged alveoli, which is associated with decreased tissue elastance and increased quasi-static compliance of Sepn1(-/-) lungs. This finding raises the possibility that the respiratory syndrome observed in patients with SEPN1 mutations may have a primary pulmonary component in addition to the weakness of respiratory muscles."

Although its function in RNA splicing for effective cell cycle progression and genome stability was recently unveiled, other mechanisms of SON functions remain unexplored. Here, we report that SON regulates GATA-2, a key transcription factor involved in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation. SON is highly expressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and leukemic blasts. SON knockdown leads to significant depletion of GATA-2 protein with marginal down-regulation of GATA-2 mRNA. We show that miR-27a is up-regulated upon SON knockdown and targets the 3'-UTR of GATA-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells. Up-regulation of miR-27a was due to activation of the promoter of the miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster, suggesting that SON suppresses this promoter to lower the microRNAs from this cluster. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role of SON in microRNA production via regulating the transcription process, thereby modulating GATA-2 at the protein level during hematopoietic differentiation."

Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, with poorly defined pneumonia epidemiology.We followed a birth cohort of 955 refugee infants, born over a one-year period, until two years of age. Clinical and radiographic pneumonia were diagnosed according to WHO criteria. Detailed characteristics were collected to determine risk factors for clinical, radiological and multiple episodes of pneumonia. Investigations were taken during a pneumonia episode to help determine or to infer an aetiological diagnosis.The incidence of clinical pneumonia was 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.75) episodes per child year (/CY) and of radiological primary endpoint pneumonia (PEP) was 0.22/CY (95% CI 0.20-0.24). The incidence of pneumonia without severe signs was 0.50/CY (95% CI 0.48-0.53), severe pneumonia 0.15/CY (95% CI 0.13-0.17) and very severe pneumonia 0.06/CY (0.05-0.07).

The risk of a child having >1 episode of pneumonia was increased by having a shorter distance to the next house (IRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.00, p = 0.04). Infants were at risk of having an episode of PEP if there was a shorter distance from stove to bed (IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99, p = 0.03).

By taking advantage of a simple yet well characterized Escherichia coli system, we can easily manipulate the lipid composition in genetically altered strains to determine the in vivo involvement of individual lipids in such complex processes as folding, structure, and function of membrane proteins (2.Dowhan W.

However, in vivo studies cannot distinguish between effects due to direct lipid-protein interactions and secondary effects due to alterations in other cellular processes. Although the effects of changes in phospholipid headgroup composition can be monitored using the above strains, the effects of changes in both fatty acid and headgroup composition are more clearly observable in in vitro studies. On the other hand, in vitro studies of membrane proteins are often compromised by artifacts due to the necessity of removing membrane proteins from their nature lipid environment, the ineffectiveness of detergents as a substitute for lipids, or the use of unnatural lipid environments. Therefore, a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies is required to more precisely determine the role or site of action of lipids in a particular process.

In addition, there is a strong correlation between the presence of PE, proper folding of P7, and the ability of LacY to mediate uphill transport (9.Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W.

A polytopic membrane protein displays a reversible topology dependent on membrane lipid composition.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Previous studies established that PC supports proper topological organization of LacY in proteoliposomes (20.Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Topology of polytopic membrane protein subdomains is dictated by membrane phospholipid composition.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but not uphill transport by LacY (13.Chen C.C.

Unfortunately, the recognition by mAb 4B1, which only recognizes properly oriented and functional protein, was not tested in these in vitro studies. Because phosphatidylserine supports uphill transport and progressive methylation of the amine of PE resulted in a parallel decrease in the level of uphill transport observed in vitro, it was suggested that an ionizable amine was required to support uphill transport (13.Chen C.C. Wilson T.H. The phospholipid requirement for activity of the lactose carrier of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The failure of PC to substitute for PE in the case of LacY as well as several other secondary transporters has led to the general conclusion that an ionizable lipid amine may be either involved directly in the transport mechanism or required for proper assembly. However, LacY expressed in mutant cells in which PE was replaced by either PC or GlcDAG displayed either a high level of or a lower but significant level of uphill transport, respectively, suggesting no requirement for an ionizable amine in support of uphill transport. LacY in these cells was also properly oriented in the membrane and recognized by mAb 4B1 (10.Bogdanov M. Heacock P. Guan Z. Dowhan W. Plasticity of lipid-protein interactions in the function and topogenesis of the membrane protein lactose permease from Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15057-15062Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All in vitro reconstitution studies employed either PC from soybeans, which is highly enriched in unsaturated fatty acids, or synthetic dioleoyl-PC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPC). Because PC and PE synthesized by E. coli are primarily saturated in the 1-position and unsaturated in the 2-position (10.Bogdanov M. Heacock P. Guan Z. Dowhan W. Plasticity of lipid-protein interactions in the function and topogenesis of the membrane protein lactose permease from Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15057-15062Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the failure of PC to support uphill transport in vitro might have been due to the fatty acid composition of PC used rather than a difference in headgroup chemistry between PC and PE, as was previously concluded (13.Chen C.C. Wilson T.H. The phospholipid requirement for activity of the lactose carrier of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or differences in the physical properties between PC and PE. Because a combined study in which both headgroup and fatty acid composition of lipids are simultaneously varied in vivo is not feasible, the resolution of this discrepancy was addressed by additional in vitro reconstitution experiments. More precise understanding of the lipid requirement for uphill transport will further define the nature of lipid-protein interactions that determine native structure and function of LacY and other membrane proteins. In addition, reliance solely on in vivo results does not rule out indirect pleiotropic effects of lipids on the membrane protein insertion/assembly machinery or molecular chaperones. Particularly in eukaryotic systems, the systematic alteration of membrane lipid composition in vivo is not possible, so that a clear demonstration of the validity of in vitro approaches reflecting in vivo physiological function of lipids is required. Building on our earlier work on in vivo lipid-assisted membrane protein folding, we report an in vitro comparative study of the lipid-dependent topogenesis, folding, and function of LacY using (i) substituted cysteine accessibility method to assess TM orientation (27.Bogdanov M.

Our results demonstrate that the phospholipid headgroup and the fatty acid composition play a crucial role in determining the proper orientation, folding, and function of LacY and that their involvement in these events after reconstitution into proteoliposomes mirrors results obtained in vivo. The close correlation between effects of lipids on LacY observed in vitro with the effects observed in vivo further supports a direct effect of membrane lipid composition on LacY properties rather than an indirect effect on the membrane protein assembly machinery or other cellular factors.

The first such system was discovered on the F plasmid of Escherichia coli, consisting of two short linked genes, ccdB and ccdA (1.Ogura T. Hiraga S. Mini-F plasmid genes that couple host cell division to plasmid proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 4784-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). From these, ccdB codes for the toxic peptide CcdB. If, upon cell division, daughter cells become plasmid-free, these become inhibited and eventually die, caused by the depletion of CcdA antitoxin, which has a shorter half-life than CcdB (2.Jaffé A. Ogura T. Hiraga S. Effects of the ccd function of the F plasmid on bacterial growth.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A very similar observation was made by Gerdes et al. (3.Gerdes K. Rasmussen P.B. Molin S. Unique type of plasmid maintenance function: postsegregational killing of plasmid-free cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 3116-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) for maintenance of the E. coli plasmid R1, except that the antitoxin turned out to be an antisense RNA (asRNA). In the R1 TA system, the mRNA encoding the toxin hok (for host killing) is stable, whereas the asRNA sok (for suppressor of killing), which normal prevents translation of hok, is rapidly turned over and needs to be synthesized continuously. In the case of plasmid loss, the stable toxin mRNA hok becomes translated in the daughter cells, and the effect is similar as in the ccdB/ccdA system (4.Gerdes K. Helin K. Christensen O.W. L⊘bner-Olesen A. Translational control and differential RNA decay are key elements regulating postsegregational expression of the killer protein encoded by the parB locus of plasmid R1.J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because both systems prevent the growth of plasmid-free cells, the underlying mechanism has also been called “post-segregational killing.” toxin-antitoxin antisense RNA rapid amplification of cDNA ends transcriptional start site(s) nucleotide(s) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside antisense. Since the initial discovery, bioinformatics and experimental approaches have identified a wide variety of potential TA systems in various groups of bacteria. Mechanistically, at least five groups of TA systems can be differentiated. TA systems classified as type I employ small RNA or asRNA, rather than a small protein, as the antidote molecule (5.Fozo E.M. Makarova K.S. Shabalina S.A. Yutin N. Koonin E.V. Storz G. Abundance of type I toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria: searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3743-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In many cases, the RNA component is not easily identified due to the variability among such RNA antidotes. However, there is at least one common denominator among these RNA antidotes; they repress the expression of proteins that are very frequently under 60 amino acids in length, are highly hydrophobic, and are toxic at high levels. Mechanistically, the antidote effect is achieved by base pairing across the ribosome binding site of the toxin mRNA, leading to a block in translation, and frequently, rapid mRNA degradation. In type III TA systems, the antitoxin RNA inhibits the protein toxin by binding (6.Blower T.R. Pei X.Y. Short F.L. Fineran P.C. Humphreys D.P. Luisi B.F. Salmond G.P. A processed noncoding RNA regulates an altruistic bacterial antiviral system.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7.Blower T.R. Short F.L. Rao F.

Identification and classification of bacterial Type III toxin-antitoxin systems encoded in chromosomal and plasmid genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 6158-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and in type IV systems, the protein antitoxin interferes with binding of the toxin to its target (8.Masuda H. Tan Q. Awano N. Wu K.P. Inouye M. YeeU enhances the bundling of cytoskeletal polymers of MreB and FtsZ, antagonizing the CbtA (YeeV) toxicity in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 84: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). TA systems of type V were recently characterized as systems in which the toxin mRNA is degraded by the antitoxin protein (9.Wang X. Lord D.M. Cheng H.Y. Osbourne D.O. Hong S.H. Sanchez-Torres V. Quiroga C. Zheng K. Herrmann T. Peti W. Benedik M.J. Page R. Wood T.K. A new type V toxin-antitoxin system where mRNA for toxin GhoT is cleaved by antitoxin GhoS.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The TA systems that are probably most frequent are of type II. These are characterized by peptide antitoxins binding and inhibiting the toxin directly (10.Van Melderen L. Saavedra De Bast M. Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems: more than selfish entities?.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000437Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Based on the known protein sequences, Pandey and Gerdes (11.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) analyzed 126 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes (16 archaea and 110 bacteria) for the presence of type II TA systems and found 671 TA loci belonging to seven different classes. The work by Pandey und Gerdes (11.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) revealed that although most plasmids are likely to encode at least one TA system, the vast majority of TA systems are encoded at loci distributed throughout the chromosomal DNA. These findings and the observation that some TA systems are activated in response to environmental stress have led to the idea that TA systems not necessarily have functions only in maintaining certain genetic elements but may contribute to an enhanced stress resilience of the bacterial cell (12.Magnuson R.D. Hypothetical functions of toxin-antitoxin systems.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In a more recent study, 750 complete genomes of archaea and bacteria were surveyed for the presence of type II TA systems, and an impressive number of 6797 TA pairs and a total of 51,319 putative toxin and antitoxin genes were identified (13.Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of type 2 toxin-antitoxin systems and related mobile stress response systems in prokaryotes.Biol. Direct. 2009; 4: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These include 175 individual toxin and antitoxin genes and 30 TA pairs in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (from here on “Synechocystis”). The most current update can be obtained in the Toxin-Antitoxin Database (TADB), where 10,753 type II TA gene pairs are listed within 1240 prokaryotic genomes (14.Shao Y. Harrison E.M. Bi D. Tai C. He X. Ou H.Y. Rajakumar K. Deng Z. TADB: a web-based resource for Type 2 toxin-antitoxin loci in bacteria and archaea.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D606-D611Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), including 37 TA pairs in Synechocystis. Because cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes that directly convert solar energy into biomass using oxygenic photosynthesis, these are of tremendous relevance for primary carbon fixation in many ecosystems and of rising biotechnological relevance and promise for the production of biofuels (15.Hess W.R. Cyanobacterial genomics for ecology and biotechnology.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2011; 14: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the only cyanobacterial TA system that has been experimentally characterized thus far is the chromosomally located relNE (ssr1114/slr0664) TA system of Synechocystis and its proteolytic regulation by ATP-dependent proteases (16.Ning D. Ye S. Liu B. Chang J. The proteolytic activation of the relNEs (ssr1114/slr0664) toxin-antitoxin system by both proteases Lons and ClpP2s/Xs of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.Curr. Microbiol. 2011; 63: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For a better understanding of TA system functions, it is of uttermost importance which cellular processes and structures become targeted by the respective toxin. The main processes affected by the toxic component of type II TA systems so far identified are translation, DNA replication, and DNA metabolism, whereas interference with membrane organization and function is supposed to be frequent in the case of type I systems (5.Fozo E.M. Makarova K.S. Shabalina S.A. Yutin N. Koonin E.V. Storz G. Abundance of type I toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria: searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3743-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It appears likely that additional processes become affected by some of the TA systems not experimentally studied so far. With regard to the molecular mechanisms of type II toxins, most information has been gained for the seven TA families defined by Pandey and Gerdes (11.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The well explored CcdB (TA pair CcdB/CcdA) and ParE toxins (ParD/ParE) are inhibitors of DNA gyrase (17.Jiang Y. Pogliano J. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. ParE toxin encoded by the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 is an inhibitor of Escherichia coli gyrase.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 18.Van Melderen L. Molecular interactions of the CcdB poison with its bacterial target, the DNA gyrase.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that abrogate cell reproduction by blocking DNA replication. The cellular target of CcdB is the DNA gyrase subunit GyrA. Binding has two possible outcomes; besides an inhibition of DNA supercoiling, the more severe result is that the enzyme within the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex becomes permanently locked in this state, leading to DNA double-strand breaks (18.Van Melderen L. Molecular interactions of the CcdB poison with its bacterial target, the DNA gyrase.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, mRNA-specific endonuclease activity appears as the most common activity of type II toxins. These toxins are also termed interferases (19.Christensen-Dalsgaard M. Overgaard M. Winther K.S. Gerdes K. RNA decay by messenger RNA interferases.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 447: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20.Yamaguchi Y. Inouye M. mRNA interferases, sequence-specific endoribonucleases from the toxin-antitoxin systems.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 85: 467-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HigB falls in this category (21.Christensen-Dalsgaard M. Gerdes K. Two higBA loci in the Vibrio cholerae superintegron encode mRNA cleaving enzymes and can stabilize plasmids.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but interferases of the widespread RelE and MazF family are particularly well studied. RelE cleaves mRNAs in the ribosomal A site (22.Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. The bacterial toxin RelE displays codon-specific cleavage of mRNAs in the ribosomal A site.Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), whereas MazF cleaves single-stranded RNAs sequence specifically at ACA sites (23.Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. MazF cleaves cellular mRNAs specifically at ACA to block protein synthesis in Escherichia coli.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) or is even more selective, cleaving at UACAU, as in the case of the Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus equorum MazF toxins (24.Rothenbacher F.P. Suzuki M. Hurley J.M. Montville T.J. Kirn T.J. Ouyang M. Woychik N.A. Clostridium difficile MazF toxin exhibits selective, not global, mRNA cleavage.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Schuster C.F. Park J.H. Prax M. Herbig A. Nieselt K. Rosenstein R. Inouye M. Bertram R. Characterization of a mazEF toxin-antitoxin homologue from Staphylococcus equorum.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Among studied TA systems, the VapBC family constitutes the most frequent, diverse, and complex class. Toxins belonging to this family possess a PIN domain (homologues of the “pilT N”-terminal domain). VapC-1 from Haemophilus influenzae shows an endoribonucleolytic activity (26.Daines D.A. Wu M.H. Yuan S.Y. VapC-1 of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is a ribonuclease.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5041-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and vapBCLT2 and vapBCpMYSH from Salmonella LT2 and Shigella plasmid pMYSH6000 inhibit translation due to the RNase activity encoded by the respective toxin gene (27.Winther K.S. Gerdes K. Ectopic production of VapCs from Enterobacteria inhibits translation and trans-activates YoeB mRNA interferase.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 918-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the biological function and molecular targets of the diverse vapBC loci abundant in various other bacteria are not yet known. In addition to its single chromosome, seven plasmids have been identified in Synechocystis. The chromosomal reference sequence of Synechocystis was determined as early as 1996 (28.Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T.

Sequence determination of the entire genome and assignment of potential protein-coding regions (supplement).DNA Res. 1996; 3: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the sequences of the large plasmids were reported in 2003 (29.Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Shimpo S. Yamada M. Tabata S. Structural analysis of four large plasmids harboring in a unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.DNA Res. 2003; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas the three small plasmids had already been sequenced before (30.Xu W. McFadden B.A. Sequence analysis of plasmid pCC5.2 from cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 that replicates by a rolling circle mechanism.Plasmid. 1997; 37: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31.Yang X.

There are no genes on these seven plasmids known to have essential cellular functions. Nevertheless, the presence of all seven plasmids was verified during a recent resequencing study (33.Trautmann D. Voß B. Wilde A. Al-Babili S. Hess W.R. Microevolution in cyanobacteria: Re-sequencing a motile substrain of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.DNA Res. 2012; 19: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting the activity of efficient mechanisms for the maintenance of these plasmids. The plasmid pSYSA is a major defense plasmid because it encodes all components of three independent CRISPR systems, 3Scholz, I., Lange, S. J., Hein, S., Hess, W. R., and Backofen, R.

Due to two deletions in the repeat-spacer arrays of the CRISPR system in the Synechocystis substrain PCC-M used here, the total length of plasmid pSYSA is only 100,749 bp (GenBankTM accession number CP003267 and Trautmann et al. (33.Trautmann D. Voß B. Wilde A. Al-Babili S. Hess W.R. Microevolution in cyanobacteria: Re-sequencing a motile substrain of Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803.DNA Res. 2003; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Among the 103 genes annotated on plasmid pSYSA are at least 12 genes coding for six different type II TA systems. Here we present a molecular characterization of the sll7003/ssl7004 TA system and demonstrate that at least four more TA systems encoded on plasmid pSYSA are functional. Construction and propagation of plasmids pQE70::toxin, pBAD::antitoxin, and pET28::ssl7004 were conducted in host strain E. coli TOP10F′ (Invitrogen). Expression of recombinant toxin and antitoxin proteins was carried out in the expression strain E. coli M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen) and BL21 RosettaTM (DE3) (Novagen). E. coli strains were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium at 37 °C with shaking. Protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (final concentration 0.1 mm) and l-arabinose (final concentration 0.2%). Antibiotics were added as needed at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Each toxin was cloned into the expression vector pQE70 (Qiagen). For sll7003, the ATG codon was shifted as no clones were obtained when using the pQE70 ATG codon and optimized Shine-Dalgarno region, likely due to leaky expression. The ampicillin resistance gene of expression vector pBAD/Myc-His B (Invitrogen) was exchanged with the chloramphenicol or streptomycin resistance gene, respectively, resulting in plasmids pBAD_Cm and pBAD_Strep. Antitoxins were cloned into these vectors. Antitoxin gene ssl7004 was also cloned in expression vector pET28a (Novagen). All oligonucleotides with engineered restriction sites and plasmids are given in supplemental Table S1. E. coli M15 pQE70::toxin pBAD::antitoxin strains were inoculated and grown for several hours at 37 °C with shaking in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. These cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.1 in fresh LB medium also containing the appropriate antibiotics. Inducers IPTG and arabinose were added from the start or at an A600 ∼0.18. Cultures expressing only toxin, only antitoxin, both proteins, and no protein were set up in duplicates and monitored for growth by measuring A600 in 15-min intervals (VICTOR3TM multilabel plate reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Overnight cultures of E. coli M15 pQE70::sll7003 and E. coli BL21(DE3) pET28::ssl7004 were diluted in 1 liter of LB respectively and grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Overexpression of Sll7003(His)6 and Ssl7004(His)6 was induced by adding IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. Protein purification was executed as described before (38.Stazic D. Lindell D. Steglich C. Antisense RNA protects mRNA from RNase E degradation by RNA-RNA duplex formation during phage infection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 4890-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. For inhibition of proteases, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) were used. Wash buffer B composition was changed to 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole (pH adjusted to 8.0 using NaOH). In vitro transcription for 16 S rRNA was realized with the MEGAscript® kit (Invitrogen), whereas for the smaller 127-nt RNA fragment, antisense to gene sll0406 and its complement the MEGAshortscriptTM kit (Invitrogen) was employed. PCR products containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence were used as templates, and transcription was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, including the optional DNase treatment and phenol/chloroform extraction. For the fluorescence assays, we employed the RNaseAlertTM (Integrated DNA Technologies) detection system, which uses a fluorescence-quenched oligonucleotide probe as substrate that emits a fluorescent signal after nuclease degradation. The substrate was incubated at 30 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 100 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT for 10–15 min before the addition of protein. Fluorescence was measured every minute with the VictorTM multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm. To avoid evaporation during the measurement, samples were covered with 30 μl of RNase-free immersion oil. Magnesium dependence was tested with 8.5 pmol of substrate, 250 ng of Sll7003 toxin, and 60 mm EDTA. Antitoxin protection was tested with 5.8 pmol of substrate, 250 ng of Sll7003, and ∼200 ng of Ssl7004. Each experiment was assayed in technical replicates. Purified Sll7003 and Ssl7004, 100–250 ng of each, were incubated with 400 ng of 16 S rRNA or 300 ng of sll0406, sll0406-as, or duplex sll0406 sense-antisense in vitro transcripts at 30 °C for 30–120 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 100 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT.

Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to electrophoretic separation on 6–10% 7 m urea polyacrylamide gels (6 mA, 1.5–2.5 h). Duplex RNA formation was achieved as described in Stazic et al. (38.Stazic D. Lindell D. Steglich C.

The reaction mixture was complemented with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 0.1 mm DTT. In vitro transcribed full-length 16 S rRNA and a 127-nt-long sll0406-asRNA fragment were incubated with purified Sll7003 protein. Cleavage products were analyzed by 5′ and/or 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). 5′-RACE was performed following Steglich et al. (39.Steglich C. Futschik M.E. Lindell D. Voss B. Chisholm S.W.

The 16 S rRNA in vitro transcript was treated with DNase (2 units of Turbo DNase, Invitrogen) and tobacco acid pyrophosphorylase (1 unit/1 mg of RNA; Epicenter). RNA was incubated with elution buffer and purified protein Sll7003 for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation at each time. A synthetic RNA oligonucleotide (3 pmol) (supplemental Table S1) was ligated to Sll7003-treated RNA (320 ng) and, as a control, to mock-treated RNA using T4 RNA ligase (Fermentas; 3 units/100 ng of RNA) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linker reactions with no oligonucleotide were performed as controls. For reverse transcription, linked RNA and controls were preincubated with reverse transcription primer (1 μm final) at 65 °C for 5 min followed by 42 °C for 10 min before incubation with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and a solution of all four dNTPs (0.5 mm each) in the provided reaction. Incubation was carried out at 42 °C for 2 h with a final inactivation step at 95 °C for 5 min. cDNA was amplified by PCR using an RNA oligonucleotide-specific primer (0.2 μm) and several gene-specific primers (0.2 μm) binding to different positions within the 16 S rDNA. Primers are given in supplemental Table S1. Amplified PCR fragments that appeared specific for the Sll7003-treated sample were gel-excised and cloned into the pJET plasmid (Fermentas). After transformation into E. coli Top10F′, plasmid inserts were amplified by colony PCR and sequenced. In vitro transcripts were treated with DNase (2 units of Turbo DNase, Invitrogen), purified with phenol/chloroform, and incubated with elution buffer and purified protein Sll7003 for 30 min at 37 °C.

Integration of retroviral DNA into the host cell genome is an essential step in viral replication catalyzed by the viral integrase (IN) 3The abbreviations used are: INintegraseSAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringWAXSwide angle x-ray scatteringNTDN-terminal domainCTDC-terminal domaincorecatalytic core domainASVavian sarcoma virusPFVprototype foamy virusEDC1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimideSECsize exclusion chromatographyBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. protein (for a recent review, see Ref. 1.Craigie R. The molecular biology of HIV integrase.Future Virol. 2012; 7: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The integration reaction takes place in two temporally and spatially separated steps known, respectively, as 3′-processing and end joining (or strand transfer). In the first step a di- or trinucleotide is hydrolytically removed from each viral DNA end, exposing 3′-hydroxyl groups of invariant CA dinucleotides. In the second step the two processed viral DNAs are joined to host DNA in a concerted cleavage and ligation reaction. The functional nucleoprotein complex that includes two viral DNA ends and a multimer containing at least four IN monomers is known as an intasome (2.Hare S. Gupta S.S. Valkov E. Engelman A. Cherepanov P. Retroviral intasome assembly and inhibition of DNA strand transfer.Nature. 2010; 464: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The pathway by which intasomes are assembled from apoIN proteins is unknown. In the absence of the viral DNA substrate, soluble full-length IN proteins from different viruses can exist as monomers, dimers, or tetramers at similar concentrations. For example at ∼1–4 mg/ml, the prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN is a monomer; avian sarcoma virus (ASV) IN is a dimer, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) IN is a tetramer. Furthermore, the three domains of IN proteins, the N-terminal domain (NTD), catalytic core domain (core), and C-terminal domain (CTD), play important roles in the conformational dynamics and multimerization of the apo-protein that are not fully understood. integrase small angle x-ray scattering wide angle x-ray scattering N-terminal domain C-terminal domain catalytic core domain avian sarcoma virus prototype foamy virus 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide size exclusion chromatography 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. We recently employed small and wide angle x-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) in combination with chemical cross-linking to elucidate the full-length architecture of the apoIN monomer and dimer of ASV (3.Bojja R.S. Andrake M.D. Weigand S. Merkel G. Yarychkivska O. Henderson A. Kummerling M. Skalka A.M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 17047-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We showed that the ASV IN dimer derives its stability from interactions of the NTD of one monomer with the CTD and core of the second monomer and from CTD-CTD contacts between the monomers; core-core interactions are only observed in tetramers. We called this unique and unexpected architecture a reaching dimer (illustrated in Fig. 1, right). We also found that the substitution of a single hydrophobic residue at an interaction hotspot in the CTD-CTD interface was sufficient to disrupt the reaching dimer and noted that a similar hydrophobic hotspot could be predicted for other retroviral IN proteins, including that of HIV. The arrangement of monomers in the ASV IN reaching dimer structure resembles that of the inner dimer of the PFV intasome that engages the viral and target DNA substrates and catalyzes the concerted joining reaction. We, therefore, proposed a dual role for hydrophobic residues in the CTD hotspot; that is, DNA binding and reaching dimer stabilization in the absence of DNA, and binding to the non-cleaved strand of viral DNA (3.Bojja R.S. Andrake M.D. Weigand S. Merkel G. Yarychkivska O. Henderson A. Kummerling M. Skalka A.M.

To test the generality of reaching dimer assembly and to gain further insight into the modes of assembly of apoIN, we analyzed the solution structure of HIV IN using approaches that proved successful with the ASV IN protein. X-ray scattering experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories, 5ID-D beamline, Chicago, IL. Data were collected either directly from the homogeneous protein solutions or with protein fractions that were eluted at 600 μl/min from a Tricorn column (SuperdexTM 200, 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) immediately upstream of the SAXS flow cell. In the latter case, because the proteins were eluting at high concentrations, 3 scans at the retention time were averaged at an interval of 14 s. Specific details concerning protein expression and purification, experimental setup, data collection, fitting, and shape modeling are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Tag-less HIV IN proteins were buffer-exchanged by dialysis in 0.1 m MES-HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 6.0, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 20% glycerol (4.Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Zero-length cross-linking procedure with the use of active esters.Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). For wild type HIV IN cross-linking, a 1:1 mixture of unlabeled and isotopically labeled protein (final concentration 450 nm) was equilibrated overnight (5.Kessl J.J. Eidahl J.O. Shkriabai N. Zhao Z. McKee C.J. Hess S. Burke Jr., T.R. Kvaratskhelia M. An allosteric mechanism for inhibiting HIV-1 integrase with a small molecule.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and freshly prepared 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethyaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; Pierce) bifunctional zero-length cross-linker was added at increasing concentrations. After 5–10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by addition of 20 μl of 1 m mercaptoethanol and then left on ice for 60 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove unwanted aggregates, the supernatant fractions were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. The reactants were then precipitated with acetone and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. For HIV IN F181T cross-linking at 25 μm or 250 nm concentration, the mixture of 1:1 unlabeled and isotopically labeled IN was first treated with 10 mm EDTA for 10–15 min on ice, and then dialyzed on ice in 0.1 m MES-HCl 1 m NaCl, pH 6.0, 20% glycerol supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 20 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ZnSO4. After 60 min to allow for refolding of the NTD, the mixture was dialyzed in 0.1 m MES, pH5.8, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 20% glycerol. Cross-linking of the IN F181T mixtures was as described for wild type IN. The cross-linked products were separated by electrophoresis in denaturing NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels using MES running buffer and Coomassie Blue stain. Sample recovery was only slightly diminished by acetone precipitation. The dimer bands from all EDC reactions were excised, trypsin-digested, and analyzed for cross-links by mass spectrometry as described previously (3.Bojja R.S. Andrake M.D. Weigand S. Merkel G.

To model the flexible HIV F181T IN dimer interface, we used HADDOCK docking (Guru Interface) (6.de Vries S.J. van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. The HADDOCK web server for data-driven biomolecular docking.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) together with SAXS-driven refinement parameters and distance constraints from the mass spectrometric analysis of the protein chemical cross-linking. Starting models for docking were based on homology with the model of the ASV IN dimer (3.Bojja R.S. Andrake M.D. Weigand S. Merkel G. Yarychkivska O. Henderson A. Kummerling M. Skalka A.M.

Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and cross-linking residues were defined to have a proximity of ∼4 Å between each pair. Based on the flexibilities of the IN domains, docking was grouped into three classes that satisfied the identified chemical cross-links. Structures were selected for further refinement based on the HADDOCK score, and models were clustered with a cutoff root mean square of 10 Å that satisfied the SAXS maximum distance (Dmax). All the final models from each group that have a maximum dimension equivalent to experimental SAXS data were compared using CRYSOL analysis fit (ATSAS) (10.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Determination of domain structure of proteins from x-ray solution scattering.Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). In addition, P(r) functions were plotted for each model and compared with the experimental data to assess the quality of the dock model using the Igor Pro package (Irena macro) (11.Ilavsky J. Jemian P.R. Irena: tool suite for modeling and analysis of small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 347-353Crossref Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). HIV IN is notoriously difficult to maintain at moderate to high concentration because of its tendency to aggregate. After investigating a variety of buffer conditions we, as others (12.Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Bushman F.D. Engelman A. A rapid in vitro assay for HIV DNA integration.Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), found that solubility and stability could be optimized by the inclusion of 1 m urea during protein purification. Analysis of wild type HIV IN (8 μm) by CD spectroscopy revealed no significant differences in the α-helical structural elements of the protein in the region of interest (218–223 nm) in the presence of 0–1 m urea; denaturation was not detected until the urea concentration reached 2 m or higher (Fig. 2A). In addition, our enzymatic assays showed that single viral DNA end processing and joining activities were unaffected in the presence of 1 m urea; concerted integration into a target DNA was unaffected by 250 mm urea, and this activity was still detectable in 1 m urea (Fig. 2, B–D). We concluded from these results that HIV IN retains its native structure in the presence of this chaotropic reagent at concentrations employed in our biophysical analyses. Static and dynamic light scattering analyses were used to determine molecular mass and to gauge the homogeneity of our HIV IN protein preparations. We observed that wild type HIV IN exhibited properties expected of a homogeneous tetramer in the presence of 250 mm and 1 m urea at protein concentrations in the 1–2 mg/ml range (Table 1). In contrast, the protein appeared to be a mixture of tetramers and larger aggregates at similar concentrations in the absence of urea (data not shown).TABLE 1Light scattering data for wild type HIV IN and derivativesProtein[Protein]aProtein concentration in mg/ml, measured using molar extinction coefficient of the respective IN protein.MW-IbApparent molecular mass (MW-I) was determined by static light scattering and calculated using DynaPro Version 5 software.ScPercentage standard deviation, S.PDdThe % polydispersity of the sample was determined using a cumulants analysis.Pd-DePolydispersity index.CommentRhfHydrodynamic radius, Rh, of the apparent multimer calculated from differential coefficient of the Stokes Einstein equation.mg/mlkDa%%%ÅHIV-1 IN wild type1.631677.75610Tetramer62HIV-1 IN wild type + Mg2+1.581324.24511Tetramer65HIV-1 IN wild type + EDTA (SEC)1.2507.37710Dimer43HIV-1 IN D64N2.481492.22918Tetramer70HIV-1 IN D64N + Mg2+2.41563.53027Tetramer76HIV-1 IN F181T1.56812579Dimer46HIV-1 IN F181T + Mg2+1.2760.85319Dimer44HIV-1 IN F181A3.2645.45711Dimer44HIV-1 IN F181G2.31168.55711Mixture57HIV-1 IN E11K1.85769.54426Dimer60a Protein concentration in mg/ml, measured using molar extinction coefficient of the respective IN protein.b Apparent molecular mass (MW-I) was determined by static light scattering and calculated using DynaPro Version 5 software.c Percentage standard deviation, S.d The % polydispersity of the sample was determined using a cumulants analysis.e Polydispersity index.f Hydrodynamic radius, Rh, of the apparent multimer calculated from differential coefficient of the Stokes Einstein equation. Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated that in the absence of DNA, full-length ASV IN forms two distinct subunit interfaces. A reaching dimer interface is stabilized by CTD-CTD interactions and interactions of the NTD from one monomer with the CTD and core domain of the second monomer. A second interface stabilized by core-core domain interactions is observed in ASV IN tetramers, which we and others have shown are required for catalysis of concerted integration but not 3′-end processing of viral DNA (3.Bojja R.S. Andrake M.D. Weigand S. Merkel G. Yarychkivska O. Henderson A. Kummerling M. Skalka A.M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 17047-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV, Neamati and co-workers (13.Al-Mawsawi L.Q. Hombrouck A. Dayam R. Debyser Z.

A symmetric region of the HIV-1 integrase dimerization interface is essential for viral replication.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e45177Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have noted that a four-tiered π interaction among several conserved hydrophobic amino acids at the core-core interface (Trp-132, Met-178, Phe-181, Phe-185) is likely to be critical for its stability. Although molecular masses were not determined for proteins with non-conservative substitutions of these residues, these authors showed that such changes resulted in loss of the single end-joining activity of HIV IN but had less effect on 3′ end-processing, as might be expected for some capacity to form dimers (15.Faure A. Calmels C. Desjobert C. Castroviejo M. Caumont-Sarcos A. Tarrago-Litvak L. Litvak S. Parissi V.

Chem. 2006; 281: 22707-22719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By analogy with ASV IN, we hypothesized that substitution of one or more of these conserved hydrophobic residues in the HIV IN core domain might block formation of tetramers but not reaching dimers. To test this idea, we introduced three independent, non-conservative substitutions for residue Phe-181 in wild type HIV IN and analyzed these proteins by dynamic light scattering. The results showed that the HIV IN derivatives with either threonine (1.2 mg/ml) or alanine (3.2 mg/ml) at position 181 were, indeed, homogenous dimers in the presence of 1 m urea; the protein that contained glycine (2.3 mg/ml) at this position had properties expected for a mixture of dimers and tetramers (Table 1). Our enzymatic assays showed that the IN F181A derivative was essentially inactive for 3′ end-processing, but F181T and F181G retained ∼12% of the catalytic rate exhibited by wild type HIV IN (Fig. 3A). Partial processing activity for the F181G substitution was reported previously (13.Al-Mawsawi L.Q. Hombrouck A. Dayam R. Debyser Z. Neamati N. Four-tiered π interaction at the dimeric interface of HIV-1 integrase critical for DNA integration and viral infectivity.Virology. 2008; 377: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the HIV IN protein can form partially active dimers when core-core interactions are disrupted. The NTD of HIV IN contains a conserved Zn2+ binding motif (HH-CC), and the presence of this ion is required for conformational integrity of this domain (17.Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield P. Craigie R. Domains of the integrase protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 responsible for polynucleotidyl transfer and zinc binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18.Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K.

Grandgenett D.P. The HIV-1 integrase monomer induces a specific interaction with LTR DNA for concerted integration.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 9788-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As the reaching dimer of ASV IN is stabilized by interactions of the NTD with the core and CTD of the second IN monomer, we reasoned that disruption of the NTD structure would prevent formation of an HIV IN reaching dimer but not a dimer formed by core-core interactions (illustrated in Fig. 1, left). To remove the NTD-bound Zn2+ ion, wild type HIV-1 IN (1.5 mg/ml) was dialyzed overnight in our standard buffer (including 1 m NaCl and 1 m urea) supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and then concentrated to 5 mg/ml. A sample of this protein was then applied to a SEC column that had been pre-equilibrated with the same EDTA-supplemented buffer. A homogeneous peak of protein was eluted from this column with retention time (24.3 min) expected for a dimer. The F181T derivative eluted as a dimer in SEC (24.75 min) in the absence of EDTA treatment. When the IN F181T was treated with EDTA and chromatographed in the presence of EDTA, its retention time was 26.2 min, consistent with a monomer. Light scattering analysis of untreated IN F181T and EDTA-treated wild type IN confirmed that both were dimers (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). These results support the hypothesis that destabilization of the NTD by removal of Zn2+ ion leads to disruption of the reaching dimer interface but will allow core-core stabilized dimers to assemble. Further support for this interpretation comes from the demonstration by Hare et al. (20.Hare S. Di Nunzio F. Labeja A. Wang J. Engelman A. Cherepanov P. Structural basis for functional tetramerization of lentiviral integrase.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that an E11K substitution, which disrupts a salt bridge between the NTD and Lys-186, results in a shift in the equilibrium of multimeric forms of full-length wild type HIV-I IN from tetramers to a dimer-monomer mixture. Our light scattering data, at higher concentrations (Table 1), also revealed dimers, and an expected reduction in enzymatic activity of this derivative is illustrated by analysis of 3′ processing (Fig. 3B). The homogeneous preparations of wild type HIV IN tetramers and derivative dimers were next analyzed by SAXS at protein concentrations ranging from ∼1 to 2 mg/ml. A summary of the SAXS-determined parameters and apparent multimeric state of each of the proteins analyzed is provided in Table 2.

Open table in a new tab The scattering profiles for wild type HIV IN and the F181T and E11K dimers are shown in Fig. 4A; their pair distance distribution P(r) functions using data to a qmax of 0.4 Å−1 revealed no major deviations in the Dmax as a function of concentration in the range of 1–1.5 mg/ml (Fig. 4B). SAXS scattering parameters for IN F181T, either as a stock preparation or from direct analysis of a size exclusion column fraction (SEC-SAXS), show average Rg values of 33–36 Å, and Dmax values of 107–113 Å, respectively, whereas the E11K protein showed an Rg of 39 Å and Dmax of 124 Å. An Rg of 40 Å and Dmax of 117 Å were obtained with the wild type HIV IN. The SAXS derived I(0) value for the wild type HIV IN tetramer, is approximately twice that observed for both dimers (Table 2). The similar values of I(0) for F181T and E11K proteins indicate that both contain the absolute mass expected of an HIV IN dimer (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). However, the significant differences in the Dmax and Rg values of F181T and E11K dimers are indicative of distinct assemblies; that is, a compact dimer in the case of F181T and a more extended dimer for E11K. SAXS envelopes for these proteins were derived using GASBOR modeling (Fig. 4C). We note that the dimensions of the HIV F181T IN dimer are similar to those of the reaching dimer of full-length ASV IN (3.Bojja R.S. Andrake M.D. Weigand S. Merkel G. Yarychkivska O. Henderson A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 17047-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with minor differences in the contours of the envelopes. Furthermore, the Dmax of 117 Å observed for the HIV IN tetramer is only slightly larger than that of the F181T dimer, whereas the volume calculated for the tetramer is approaching twice that of the F181T dimer (Table 2). The envelope derived for E11K is larger than that of F181T and the shape is longer than either the wild type tetramer or the F181T dimer with a distinct contour and narrower ends. As the enzymatic activities of HIV IN are highly cofactor-dependent, we asked if the presence of Mg2+ would alter the overall architecture of the protein in solution. These experiments included wild type IN, a D64N derivative that cannot bind the metal cofactor at the active site, and the F181T dimer. The results from light scattering studies indicated that the size of these three proteins was not altered significantly in the presence of Mg2+ (Table 1). Comparison of the SAXS parameters in the absence or presence of the metal showed minor variations in the Dmax values but no drastic change in the Rg values (Table 2). P(r) functions for wild type IN and the D64N derivative in the absence and presence of Mg2+ are shown in Fig. 5. As"
https://openalex.org/W2049787302,"Foragers facilitate horizontal pathogen transmission in honey bee colonies, yet their systemic immune function wanes during transition to this life stage. In general, the insect immune system can be categorized into mechanisms operating at both the barrier epithelial surfaces and at the systemic level. As proposed by the intergenerational transfer theory of aging, such immunosenescence may result from changes in group resource allocation. Yet, the relative influence of pathogen transmission and resource allocation on immune function in bees from different stages has not been examined in the context of barrier immunity. We find that expression levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in honey bee barrier epithelia of the digestive tract do not follow a life stage-dependent decrease. In addition, correlation of AMP transcript abundance with microbe levels reveals a number of microbe-associated changes in AMPs levels that are equivalent between nurses and foragers. These results favor a model in which barrier effectors are maintained in foragers as a first line of defense, while systemic immune effectors are dismantled to optimize hive-level resources. These findings have important implications for our understanding of immunosenescence in honey bees and other social insects."
https://openalex.org/W2117457484,"von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is an ultralong, concatameric, and adhesive glycoprotein. On short time scales, adhesiveness for platelets is activated by elongation of VWF by altered hydrodynamics at sites of hemostasis. Over longer time scales, the length of VWF is regulated by ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), cleavage by which in the VWF A2 domain is dependent on elongational force. Patients with von Willebrand disease type 2A present with increased bleeding due to mutations within the VWF A2 domain that enhance cleavage. We tested using temperature and force the hypothesis that von Willebrand disease mutations disrupt A2 force sensing by destabilizing the folded state. Mutations R1597W, M1528V, and E1638K reduced A2 thermal stability by 10-18 °C. M1528V and E1638K showed a marked further decrease in stability upon calcium removal. In contrast, R1597W, which resides within the A2 calcium-binding loop, exhibited similar stability in the presence and absence of calcium. Using single molecule optical tweezers and R1597W, we measured the force dependence of unfolding and refolding kinetics. In the presence of calcium, the R1597W mutation slowed the rate of refolding but had no effect on unfolding. The three mutations highlight the calcium-binding loop (R1597W), the hydrophobic core around the vicinal disulfide (M1528V), and hydrogen bonds to the α4-less loop (E1638K), as structural features critically important to the function of A2 as a force sensor in regulating thrombogenic activity in the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W1992517455,"The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is a replicative helicase, which is essential for chromosome DNA replication. In recent years, the identification of a novel MCM-binding protein (MCM-BP) in most eukaryotes has led to numerous studies investigating its function and its relationship to the MCM complex. However, the mechanisms by which MCM-BP functions and associates with MCM complexes are not well understood; in addition, the functional role of MCM-BP remains controversial and may vary between model organisms. The present study aims to elucidate the nature and biological function of the MCM-BP ortholog, Mcb1, in fission yeast. The Mcb1 protein continuously interacts with MCM proteins during the cell cycle in vivo and can interact with any individual MCM subunit in vitro. To understand the detailed characteristics of mcb1+, two temperature-sensitive mcb1 gene mutants (mcb1ts) were isolated. Extensive genetic analysis showed that the mcb1ts mutants were suppressed by a mcm5+ multicopy plasmid and displayed synthetic defects with many S-phase-related gene mutants. Moreover, cyclin-dependent kinase modulation by Cig2 repression or Rum1 overproduction suppressed the mcb1ts mutants, suggesting the involvement of Mcb1 in pre-RC formation during DNA replication. These data are consistent with the observation that Mcm7 loading onto replication origins is reduced and S-phase progression is delayed in mcb1ts mutants. Furthermore, the mcb1ts mutation led to the redistribution of MCM subunits to the cytoplasm, and this redistribution was dependent on an active nuclear export system.

Significance: This study presents the first evidence of MCM-BP function during prereplicative complex formation. Genome integrity depends on successful and faithful DNA replication, which relies on the concerted activity of multiple replication proteins. The temporal and spatial regulation of DNA replication and the cell cycle control system ensure a single round of replication of chromosome DNA during every cell cycle. The initiation of DNA replication in all eukaryotes involves the assembly of a prereplicative complex (pre-RC) 2The abbreviations used are: pre-RCprereplicative complexpre-ICpreinitiation complexMCMminichromosome maintenanceMCM-BPMCM-binding proteinHUhydroxyureaMMSmethylmethane sulfonateCPTcamptothecinDBDDNA-binding domainADactivation domainDSBdouble-stranded DNA breakCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseGINSTetrameric complex composed of Sld5, Psf1, Psf2, Psf3 (Go-Ichi-Ni-San). at the replication origins in G1 phase and the subsequent activation of the pre-RC to the preinitiation complex (pre-IC) at the onset of S-phase. The replication origins are recognized by the origin recognition complex and become a platform for the recruitment of Cdc6 (called Cdc18 in fission yeast) and Cdt1-bound double hexamers of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex to form the pre-RC (reviewed in Ref. 1.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The Mcm complex. Unwinding the mechanism of a replicative helicase.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 652-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Upon entry into S-phase, this complex is activated by the S-phase-specific kinase, Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinase. The Mcm2–7 complex serves as a platform to recruit Cdc45 and GINS, thereby converting the pre-RC into the pre-IC. Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinase phosphorylates several of the Mcm2–7 proteins and triggers the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to form the Cdc45·MCM·GINS complex. Cdc45·MCM·GINS complex formation then induces the helicase activity of the Mcm2–7 complex, promoting the unwinding of the double-stranded DNA at the origin of DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 2.Remus D.

The Mcm2–7 hexamer complex is an evolutionarily conserved DNA helicase, which is essential for both the initiation of chromosome DNA replication and elongation (3.Bell S.P. Dutta A. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 4.Diffley J.F. Regulation of early events in chromosome replication.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Mcm2–7 proteins are members of the AAA+ ATPase family of proteins and share a region of homology that encompasses the ATPase motif, referred to as the MCM box (1.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The Mcm complex. Unwinding the mechanism of a replicative helicase.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 652-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 5.Forsburg S.L. Eukaryotic MCM proteins. Beyond replication initiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The MCM box harbors distinct motifs, including Walker A, Walker B, and an arginine finger. The canonical MCM complex consists of the six subunits of Mcm2–7 and is assembled by the binding of one MCM arginine finger to the P-loop within the Walker A motif of another MCM subunit to form the ATP binding site. This hexameric ring is formed by two subcomplexes; the heterodimer is formed by Mcm3 and Mcm5 (Mcm3-5), and the trimeric MCM core complex is formed by Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 (Mcm4-6-7). Mcm2 connects these two subcomplexes to form the Mcm2–7 hexamer complex (6.Davey M.J. Indiani C. O'Donnell M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2491-2498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mcm2–5 is thought to act as the gate of the ring structure, the site at which the ring structure opens to encircle DNA (9.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm6/2 and Mcm5/3 ATPase active sites contribute to the function of the putative Mcm2–7 “gate”.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6078-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although a great deal of evidence indicates the importance of the Mcm2–7 complex in DNA replication, there are still unanswered questions concerning the functional role(s) of the MCM proteins. For example, the relationship between the Mcm4-6-7 core helicase and the larger Mcm2–7 hexamer is not understood. It is also unclear why MCM proteins are abundant and exceed the number of replication origins. In fission yeast, a reduction in MCM protein levels causes genome instability due to replication fork collapse and DNA damage (10.Bailis J.M. Luche D.D. Hunter T. Forsburg S.L.

Reduced dosage of a single fission yeast MCM protein causes genetic instability and S phase delay.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 559-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human cells, excess chromatin-loaded MCM complexes are important under conditions of replicative stress, where they activate dormant origins to ensure that DNA replication continues when the replication forks stall (12.Ge X.Q. Jackson D.A. Blow J.J.

Mice expressing hypomorphic Mcm2 (Mcm2IRESCreERT2) or Mcm4 (Mcm4Chaos3) show lower levels of Mcm2–7 loading onto DNA, exhibit replicative stress even under unchallenged conditions, and have a high incidence of cancer (14.Kawabata T.

In addition, some MCM subunits appear to play additional roles that are independent of DNA replication (16.Ferguson R.L. Pascreau G. Maller J.L.

Although the primary focus of the study of MCM proteins has been to identify the function of the canonical MCM complex, several MCM-related complexes have also been characterized (19.Maiorano D. Lutzmann M. Méchali M. MCM proteins and DNA replication.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Two additional MCM family members, Mcm8 and Mcm9, which contain an MCM box, were identified in higher eukaryotes (20.Yoshida K.

Cell. 2012; 47: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MCM-binding protein (MCM-BP) was first identified as a protein that strongly associates with human MCM proteins. Tandem affinity purification with tagged human MCM core subunits recovers both MCM-BP and MCM proteins (26.Sakwe A.M. Nguyen T. Athanasopoulos V. Shire K. Frappier L. Identification and characterization of a novel component of the human minichromosome maintenance complex.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3044-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MCM-BP is conserved in most eukaryotes (except budding yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans) and has only limited homology to MCM proteins. Following the first identification in humans, several studies aimed to characterize and elucidate the functions of MCM-BP. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that human MCM-BP interacts with all MCM subunits, except Mcm2; conversely, Mcm2 fails to recover MCM-BP (26.Sakwe A.M. Nguyen T. Athanasopoulos V. Shire K. Frappier L. Identification and characterization of a novel component of the human minichromosome maintenance complex.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3044-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of interaction between MCM-BP and MCM subunits was observed in Xenopus laevis (27.Nishiyama A. Frappier L. Méchali M. MCM-BP regulates unloading of the MCM2–7 helicase in late S phase.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that an alternative MCM complex is formed when Mcm2 is replaced by MCM-BP. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MCM-BP ortholog, ETG1, was identified as an E2F target. The interaction between ETG1 and Mcm2–7 was confirmed by tandem affinity purification with tagged ETG1 (28.Takahashi N. Lammens T. Boudolf V. Maes S. Yoshizumi T. De Jaeger G. Witters E. Inzé D. De Veylder L. The DNA replication checkpoint aids survival of plants deficient in the novel replisome factor ETG1.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1840-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, mcb1+ (the fission yeast MCM-BP ortholog) is an essential gene, and its deletion results in gradual cell cycle arrest with a cdc (cell division cycle) phenotype. Overexpression of the Mcb1 protein or Mcb1 inactivation in temperature-sensitive mcb1 mutants induces DNA damage and G2 checkpoint activation (29.Ding L. Forsburg S.L.

Purification and functional inactivation of the fission yeast MCM(MCM-BP) complex.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 3850-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In human cells, the depletion of MCM-BP also leads to centrosome amplification and abnormal nuclear morphology, which may be due to G2 DNA damage checkpoint activation (31.Jagannathan M. Sakwe A.M.

The loss of A. thaliana ETG1 leads to reduced DNA replication, activation of the G2 checkpoint, and reduced sister chromatid cohesion (28.Takahashi N. Lammens T. Boudolf V. Maes S. Yoshizumi T.

The Xenopus MCM-BP appears to play a role in unloading MCM complexes from chromatin after DNA synthesis (27.Nishiyama A. Frappier L. Méchali M. MCM-BP regulates unloading of the MCM2–7 helicase in late S phase.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the depletion of human MCM-BP not only increases the levels of chromatin-associated MCM proteins at the end of S-phase but also leads to a similar increase in soluble levels of MCM proteins throughout S-phase (31.Jagannathan M.

Nguyen T. Frappier L. The MCM-associated protein MCM-BP is important for human nuclear morphology.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The fission yeast Mcb1 is widely distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and is bound to chromatin (29.Ding L. Forsburg S.L. Schizosaccharomyces pombe minichromosome maintenance-binding protein (MCM-BP) antagonizes MCM helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 32918-32930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, Xenopus MCM-BP is imported into the nucleus just before the dissociation of Mcm2–7 from chromatin near the end of S-phase. These differences in the localization of MCM-BP may affect other functions associated with the MCM complex proteins. Furthermore, human MCM-BP interacts with Dfp4, the regulatory component of the Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinase, as well as with MCM complex components, suggesting that MCM-BP may affect DNA replication, at least in part by regulating MCM phosphorylation by Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinase (33.Nguyen T. Jagannathan M. Shire K. Frappier L. Interactions of the human MCM-BP protein with MCM complex components and Dbf4.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35931Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, the functions of MCM-BP in DNA replication have been extensively studied; however, the mechanisms by which MCM-BP functions and associates with MCM complexes are not well understood, and the functional role of MCM-BP is controversial and may vary among model organisms. To address these remaining questions, the functional roles of MCM-BP were examined by genetic analysis of temperature-sensitive mutants in fission yeast. Tight genetic links between mcb1+ and mcm5+ were identified. The mcb1ts mutants displayed synthetic defects with many S-phase-related gene mutants, and the temperature sensitivity of mcb1ts mutants was suppressed by CDK modulation upon Cig2 repression or Rum1 overexpression, suggesting the involvement of Mcb1 in pre-RC formation during DNA replication. In fact, S-phase progression was delayed in mcb1ts mutant cells, and loading of Mcm7 onto the replication origins during pre-RC formation was reduced. Furthermore, mcb1ts mutations caused most MCM proteins to exit the nucleus, which was partially rescued by mcm5+ overexpression. All of these results strongly indicate the importance of Mcb1 protein in promoting efficient pre-RC formation. This is the first report showing the involvement of MCM-BP in pre-RC formation during DNA replication. Under “Discussion,” we shall discuss the role of MCM-BP in regulating MCM function(s) during DNA replication in the context of these results. The fission yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Standard growth media and the general biochemical and genetic methods used for fission yeast were described previously (34.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). Fission yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in YES medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, and supplements) unless indicated otherwise. Geneticin (G418, 100 μg/ml; Sigma), hygromycin (150 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science), or nourseothricin (clonNAT, 200 μg/ml; Werner Bioagents) was added as required. Hydroxyurea (HU; Sigma), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS; Wako), and camptothecin (CPT; Sigma) were used at the indicated concentrations. For the induction of expression from the nmt1 promoter, cells were grown at 30 °C in the presence of 5 μm thiamine to repress the nmt1 promoter until mid-log phase and then washed twice with fresh medium and further incubated for 20 h. Tetrad dissection was performed using a Singer Instrument micromanipulator system. To create the mcb1 gene mutants, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was used to mutate the indicated site(s) on a plasmid. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The designed mutations were introduced into the wild-type strain using PCR to insert a 5× FLAG epitope at the C terminus and mark the allele with the kanMX6 gene, as described by Krawchuk and Wahls (35.Krawchuk M.D. Wahls W.P. High-efficiency gene targeting in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a modular, PCR-based approach with long tracts of flanking homology.Yeast. 1999; 15: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Introduction of the designed mutations into the mcb1 gene on the wild-type chromosome was confirmed by colony PCR, followed by direct sequencing of the PCR product. The expression of the mutated Mcb1 protein tagged with the 5× FLAG epitope was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Exchange of the kanMX6 marker in existing strains with natMX6, which gives rise to resistance to the antibiotic clonNAT, was performed as described by Sato et al. (36.Sato M. Dhut S. Toda T. New drug-resistant cassettes for gene disruption and epitope tagging in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Yeast. 2005; 22: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Yeast strains carrying the cold-sensitive nda3-KM311 mutation in the β-tubulin gene (37.Hiraoka Y. Toda T. Yanagida M. The NDA3 gene of fission yeast encodes β-tubulin.

Cell cycle progression was followed by flow cytometry. To test the response to temperature, HU, CPT, or MMS, the fission yeast strains were grown on YES plates at 25 °C for 2–3 days. The cells were serially diluted (5-fold) and then spotted onto YES plates containing 5–10 μm CPT, 5–10 mm HU, or 0.005% MMS. The plates were then incubated at the indicated temperatures for 3–6 days. Cells were fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight and then rehydrated in 50 mm sodium citrate. RNA was removed with 100 μg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 2 h prior to staining with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide as described previously (38.Sabatinos S.A. Forsburg S.L.

Mitochondrial growth and DNA synthesis occur in the absence of nuclear DNA replication in fission yeast.J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur instrument and Macintosh BD CellQuestTM software. Cells expressing Mcm2-GFP, Mcm3-GFP, Mcm4-GFP, Mcm5-RFP, Mcm6-GFP, Mcm7-GFP, Rad22-YFP, or Rhp54-GFP (grown in EMM5S medium at the indicated temperatures) were harvested and suspended in Milli-Q water. The cells were then treated with DAPI (Dojindo) at room temperature to visualize DNA. The GFP, RFP, YFP, and DAPI signals were detected using a fluorescent microscope (BX51; Olympus). Images were obtained using a CCD camera (DP71; Olympus) and processed using Photoshop (Adobe) software. The Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech) was used for the yeast two-hybrid assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated proteins were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-DBD) on the pGBKT7 plasmid or to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-AD) on the pGAD-GH or pGAD424 plasmid and expressed in the AH109 reporter strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Full-length mcb1+ cDNA was cloned into pET28a for expression as a T7-His6-tagged protein. pRSFDuet-1-swi6 (a gift from J. Nakayama) was used for expression of His6-tagged Swi6 as a negative control. Full-length mcm2–7 cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-KG vectors for expression as GST-tagged fusion proteins. T7-His6-tagged Mcb1 and His6-tagged Swi6 were expressed in Escherichia coli KRX (Promega) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). GST-tagged fusion proteins (GST and GST-Mcm2–7) were expressed in E. coli KRX and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). For the in vitro pull-down assay, GST-tagged fusion proteins specifically bound to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with purified T7-His6-tagged Mcb1 or His6-tagged Swi6 for 1 h at 4 °C. To test the interaction, T7-His6-tagged Mcb1 or His6-tagged Swi6 was pulled down by GST-tagged proteins. For the semi-in vitro pull-down assay, E. coli soluble crude lysates expressing the T7-His6-Mcb1, T7-His6-Mcb1L254P, or T7-His6-Mcb1L363P protein, respectively, were used instead of purified T7-His6-Mcb1. Fission yeast whole-cell extracts were prepared by the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method. Briefly, the cell pellets (2 × 108 cells) were suspended in 100 μl of 20% TCA and disrupted with glass beads using Micro Smash (MS-100; Tomy Seiko). Cell lysates were collected, and beads were washed twice in 100 μl of 5% TCA. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Then 2× SDS sample buffer was added, followed by 2 m Tris until the color of the suspension turned from yellow to blue. Samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and cleared by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, whole-cell extracts were prepared using the boiling method, as described previously (40.Takeda T. Ogino K. Matsui E. Cho M.K. Kumagai H. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H.

Here, we examined the potential role of mitochondria in homeostasis of nickel in the roots of nickel hyperaccumulator plant Alyssum murale. We evaluated the biochemical basis of nickel tolerance by comparing the role of mitochondria in closely related nickel hyperaccumulator A. murale and non-accumulator Alyssum montanum. Evidence is presented for the rapid and transient influx of nickel in root mitochondria of nickel hyperaccumulator A. murale. In an early response to nickel treatment, substantial nickel influx was observed in mitochondria prior to sequestration in vacuoles in the roots of hyperaccumulator A. murale compared with non-accumulator A. montanum. In addition, the mitochondrial Krebs cycle was modulated to increase synthesis of malic acid and citric acid involvement in nickel hyperaccumulation. Furthermore, malic acid, which is reported to form a complex with nickel in hyperaccumulators, was also found to reduce the reactive oxygen species generation induced by nickel. We propose that the interaction of nickel with mitochondria is imperative in the early steps of nickel uptake in nickel hyperaccumulator plants. Initial uptake of nickel in roots results in biochemical responses in the root mitochondria indicating its vital role in homeostasis of nickel ions in hyperaccumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1992943862,"Pneumonic tularemia is caused by inhalation of Francisella tularensis, one of the most infectious microbes known. We wanted to study the kinetics of the initial and early interactions between bacterium and host cells in the lung. To do this, we examined the infection of A549 airway epithelial cells with the live vaccine strain (LVS) of F. tularensis. A549 cells were infected and analyzed for global transcriptional response at multiple time points up to 16 h following infection. At 15 min and 2 h, a strong transcriptional response was observed including cytoskeletal rearrangement, intracellular transport, and interferon signaling. However, at later time points (6 and 16 h), very little differential gene expression was observed, indicating a general suppression of the host response consistent with other reported cell lines and murine tissues. Genes for macropinocytosis and actin/cytoskeleton rearrangement were highly up-regulated and common to the 15 min and 2 h time points, suggesting the use of this method for bacterial entry into cells. We demonstrate macropinocytosis through the uptake of FITC-dextran and amiloride inhibition of Francisella LVS uptake. Our results suggest that macropinocytosis is a potential mechanism of intracellular entry by LVS and that the host cell response is suppressed during the first 2-6 h of infection. These results suggest that the attenuated Francisella LVS induces significant host cell signaling at very early time points after the bacteria's interaction with the cell."

Here, we show that in mice with systolic HF post-myocardial infarction, the myogenic tone of third-order mesenteric resistance vessels is increased, the vascular smooth muscle (VSM) membrane potential is depolarized by ~20 mV, and vessel wall intracellular [Ca(2+)] is elevated relative to that in sham-operated control mice. Despite the increased [Ca(2+)], the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs), mediated by large conductance, Ca(2+)-activated BK channels, were reduced by nearly 80% (P<0.01) and 25% (P<0.05), respectively, in HF. The expression of the BK α and β1 subunits was reduced in HF mice compared to controls (65 and 82% lower, respectively, P<0.01). Consistent with the importance of a reduction in BK channel expression and function in mediating the HF-induced increase in myogenic tone are two further findings: a blunting of paxilline-induced increase in myogenic tone in HF mice compared to controls (0.9 vs. 10.9%, respectively), and that HF does not alter the increased myogenic tone of BK β1-null mice. These findings identify electrical dysregulation within VSM, specifically the reduction of BK currents, as a key molecular mechanism sensitizing resistance vessels to pressure-induced vasoconstriction in systolic HF."
https://openalex.org/W2060864715,"Autotrophic members of the Sulfolobales (crenarchaeota) use the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle to assimilate CO2 into cell material. The product of the initial acetyl-CoA carboxylation with CO2, malonyl-CoA, is further reduced to malonic semialdehyde by an NADPH-dependent malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR); the enzyme also catalyzes the reduction of succinyl-CoA to succinic semialdehyde onwards in the cycle. Here, we present the crystal structure of Sulfolobus tokodaii malonyl-CoA reductase in the substrate-free state and in complex with NADP(+) and CoA. Structural analysis revealed an unexpected reaction cycle in which NADP(+) and CoA successively occupy identical binding sites. Both coenzymes are pressed into an S-shaped, nearly superimposable structure imposed by a fixed and preformed binding site. The template-governed cofactor shaping implicates the same binding site for the 3'- and 2'-ribose phosphate group of CoA and NADP(+), respectively, but a different one for the common ADP part: the β-phosphate of CoA aligns with the α-phosphate of NADP(+). Evolution from an NADP(+) to a bispecific NADP(+) and CoA binding site involves many amino acid exchanges within a complex process by which constraints of the CoA structure also influence NADP(+) binding. Based on the paralogous aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase structurally characterized with a covalent Cys-aspartyl adduct, a malonyl/succinyl group can be reliably modeled into MCR and discussed regarding its binding mode, the malonyl/succinyl specificity, and the catalyzed reaction. The modified polypeptide surrounding around the absent ammonium group in malonate/succinate compared with aspartate provides the structural basis for engineering a methylmalonyl-CoA reductase applied for biotechnical polyester building block synthesis."

Crystallographic studies of APSK from Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the presence of a regulatory intersubunit disulfide bond (Cys86–Cys119). The reduced enzyme displayed improved catalytic efficiency and decreased effectiveness of substrate inhibition by APS compared with the oxidized form. Here we examine the effect of disulfide formation and the role of the N-terminal domain on nucleotide binding using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and steady-state kinetics. Formation of the disulfide bond in A. thaliana APSK (AtAPSK) inverts the binding affinities at the ATP/ADP and APS/PAPS sites from those observed in the reduced enzyme, consistent with initial binding of APS as inhibitory, and suggests a role for the N-terminal domain in guiding nucleotide binding order. To test this, an N-terminal truncation variant (AtAPSKΔ96) was generated. The resulting protein was completely insensitive to substrate inhibition by APS. ITC analysis of AtAPSKΔ96 showed decreased affinity for APS binding, although the N-terminal domain does not directly interact with this ligand. Moreover, AtAPSKΔ96 displayed reduced affinity for ADP, which corresponds to a loss of substrate inhibition by formation of an E·ADP·APS dead end complex. Examination of the AtAPSK crystal structure suggested Arg93 as important for positioning of the N-terminal domain. ITC and kinetic analysis of the R93A mutant also showed a complete loss of substrate inhibition and altered nucleotide binding affinities, which mimics the effect of the N-terminal deletion.

https://openalex.org/W2067875615,"Recent evidence associates prostate cancer with high cholesterol levels, with cholesterol being an important raw material for cell-growth. Within the cell, cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by two master transcription factors: sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) and liver X receptor (LXR). We previously showed that the androgen receptor, a major player in prostate cell physiology, toggles these transcription factors to promote cholesterol accumulation. Given that prostate cancer therapy targets the androgen receptor, selecting for cells with altered androgen receptor activity, how would this affect SREBP-2 and LXR activity? Using a novel prostate cancer progression model, we explored how this crosstalk between the androgen receptor and cholesterol homeostasis changes during prostate cancer development.Firstly, we characterised our progression model, which involved 1) culturing LNCaP cells at physiological testosterone levels to generate androgen-tolerant LNCaP-305 cells, and 2) culturing LNCaP-305 with the anti-androgen casodex to generate castration-resistant LNCaP-364 cells. This progression was accompanied by upregulated androgen receptor expression, typically seen clinically, and a reduction in androgen receptor activity. Although this influenced how SREBP-2 and LXR target genes responded to androgen treatment, cellular cholesterol levels and their response to changing sterol status was similar in all LNCaP sub-lines.Overall cholesterol homeostasis is unaffected by changing androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells. This does not negate the relationship between androgens and cholesterol homeostasis, but rather suggests that other factors compensate for altered androgen receptor activity. Given that cholesterol regulation is maintained during progression, this supports the growing idea that cholesterol metabolism is a suitable target for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987082297,"Vaccinia VH1-related (VHR) is a dual specificity phosphatase that consists of only a single catalytic domain. Although several protein substrates have been identified for VHR, the elements that control the in vivo substrate specificity of this enzyme remain unclear. In this work, the in vitro substrate specificity of VHR was systematically profiled by screening combinatorial peptide libraries. VHR exhibits more stringent substrate specificity than classical protein-tyrosine phosphatases and recognizes two distinct classes of Tyr(P) peptides. The class I substrates are similar to the Tyr(P) motifs derived from the VHR protein substrates, having sequences of (D/E/ϕ)(D/S/N/T/E)(P/I/M/S/A/V)pY(G/A/S/Q) or (D/E/ϕ)(T/S)(D/E)pY(G/A/S/Q) (where ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid and pY is phosphotyrosine). The class II substrates have the consensus sequence of (V/A)P(I/L/M/V/F)X1-6pY (where X is any amino acid) with V/A preferably at the N terminus of the peptide. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggest that the class II peptides bind to VHR in an opposite orientation relative to the canonical binding mode of the class I substrates. In this alternative binding mode, the Tyr(P) side chain binds to the active site pocket, but the N terminus of the peptide interacts with the carboxylate side chain of Asp(164), which normally interacts with the Tyr(P) + 3 residue of a class I substrate. Proteins containing the class II motifs are efficient VHR substrates in vitro, suggesting that VHR may act on a novel class of yet unidentified Tyr(P) proteins in vivo."

Significance: Phosphodeoxyribosyltransferases open the road to new deoxyribonucleotides synthetic pathways. DNA in all known living organisms is synthesized from deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the precursor substrates that are condensed by DNA polymerase enzymes, releasing pyrophosphate as co-product. No exception to this biosynthetic scheme was ever encountered in nature, whether nucleoside triphosphates are condensed onto a DNA template acting as co-catalyst, an RNA template, or no template at all. The pyrimidine and purine base moieties attached to the common triphosphodeoxyribosyl moiety of dNTPs are not universally conserved in nature. In addition to the four canonical dNTPs, four noncanonical dNTPs bearing an exotic pyrimidine and one bearing an exotic purine are condensed by bacterial viruses (1Kirnos M.D. Khudyakov I.Y.

The demand for purified deoxyribonucleotides is high, for example, for DNA synthesis (PCR or DNA microarrays) and reverse transcription in vitro in academic research and medical diagnosis. It extends to numerous nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that are used for DNA mutagenesis or labeling, as well as mechanistic probes to study nucleotide metabolic enzymes. In parallel, these modified precursors are also used as antibiotics, antiviral, and anticancer agents. The diversification of the “bio-compatible nucleotides” is also a field in expansion with the development of synthetic biology as illustrated by the development of new functional base pairs (3Benner S.A.

Methods for chemical synthesis of nucleotides are evolving, but nucleotides are still difficult to make, isolate, and characterize (7Burgess K. Cook D. Syntheses of nucleoside triphosphates.Chem.

Modern trends in biotechnology and application.Mendeleev Commun. 2011; 21: 57-68Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have been developed using whole cells or coupled enzymes, but the available repertoire of enzymes is still limited. The enzymatic synthesis of pure 2′-deoxyribonucleotides and the metabolic engineering for producing such compounds is hindered by the intricacy of biosynthesis and salvage pathways, upstream and downstream of the DNA polymerization step. Each nucleobase A, C, G, and T is indeed processed separately by highly discriminating enzymes that phosphorylate nucleoside monophosphates into diphosphates. In addition, nucleotide reductases are required to convert the ribose moiety of RNA precursors into the deoxyribose moiety of DNA building blocks (rNDP into dNDP or rNTP into dNTP, depending on nucleotide reductase families) through a cumbersome and fragile free radical mechanism (9Nordlund P. Reichard P. Ribonucleotide reductases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The natural design of this complex metabolic machinery is to prevent the generation of unwanted rNTPs and dNTPs and their incorporation into RNA and DNA. We sought to bypass this intricacy and expand DNA chemistry by elaborating an enzyme that would transfer 5′-phosphorylated deoxyribose between any two nucleobases (N and N′), canonical or synthetic, e.g., dN − (P)x + N′ ⇌ N + dN′ − (P)x, where x stands for 0, 1, 2, or 3. We proceeded using a structure-based and stepwise approach to build a chimera from two distantly related enzymes: a nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.6) (NDT)2 from lactobacilli and a 5′-monophosphate-2′-deoxyribonucleoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.-) from rat (Rcl) (Fig. 1). Although their sequences are globally dissimilar (∼18% of sequence identity), these two proteins, whose oligomerization states differ (NDT is an hexamer, and Rcl is a dimer in solution), adopt the same Rossmann fold (Fig. 2A), and they share a common catalytic triad. Both enzymes hydrolyze their substrates via the formation of a deoxyribose (5-phosphate)-enzyme covalent intermediate (10Doddapaneni K. Zahurancik W. Haushalter A. Yuan C. Jackman J. Wu Z.

These structural and functional features are in agreement with Rcl and NDT diverging from a common enzyme ancestor with broader substrate specificity.FIGURE 2A, overlay of the dimeric structures of Rcl (Protein Data Bank code 2KLH; green) and NDT (Protein Data Bank code 1F8Y; blue).

Variants S92 and R13 S92 were obtained by using plasmid pET24a NDT as DNA template and oligonucleotides D92S and D92S and f13R, respectively, using the QuikChange® Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For variants S92 S123, R13 S92 S123, R13 S92 T123, R13 G92 T93 S123, R13 Q91 G92 T93 S123, Q13 S92 S123, and Q13 Q91 S92 S123, oligonucleotide N123S-, N123T-, G92 T93-, E91Q-, f13Q-, E91Q-, and T7 prom and oligonucleotide N123S, N123T, G92 T93, E91Q, f13Q, E91Q, and T7 term were used in two separate PCRs using plasmids pET24a NDT S92, pET24a NDT R13 S92, pET24a NDT R13 S92 S123, pET24a NDT R13 G92 T93 S123, pET24a NDT S92 S123, and pET24a NDT Q13 S92 S123 as DNA templates, respectively. The parameters used 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C; 25 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C; and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. The annealing temperature was dependent on the pairs of oligonucleotides used. Oligonucleotides T7prom and T7term were used in a second PCR using aliquots of the first one using the same parameters as above with the exception of an annealing temperature of 61 °C. For variant R13 G92 T93 S123 K157, oligonucleotides T7 prom and Y157K were used in a standard PCR using plasmid pET24a NDT R13 G92 T93 S123 as DNA template. The amplified DNA fragments were purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and then digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes over 2 h at 37 °C and repurified. Each PCR product was ligated with plasmid pET24a that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ligation mixtures were used to transform strain DH5α. Plasmids with the correct sequence were used to transform strain Bli5. Plasmids containing an insert of the correct size were sequenced at the Plateforme Génomique Pf1 at the Institut Pasteur. Those with the correct sequences were used to transform strain BLi5. 650 ml of 2× YT medium inoculated with an overnight culture of BLi5 containing any of the pET24a+PDT* was grown under agitation at 37 °C until A600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for 2.5 h. Bacteria were centrifuged, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, and broken by one passage through a French press at 14000 p.s.i. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The total proteins contained in the supernatant were separated by an anion exchange chromatography on a Hi Trap Q HP with a linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, at 2 ml min−1 for 100 min. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and precipitated at 4 °C by adding solid ammonium sulfate (0.6 mg/ml). The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended into 50 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, and purified on a Hi Load Superdex S200 column at 1 ml min−1. The purified proteins ran as a single band at ∼18 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weight and was >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by UV absorption at 280 nm using an ϵ280 = 34,380. The standard assay for the different NDTs consisted of 5–15 μg of NDT in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, 3 mm dNxP (dNMP, dNDP, or dNTP), and 1 mm base in a total volume of 50 μl. The assays were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The products of the reactions were analyzed every 7 min by rapid resolution high performance liquid chromatography using a reverse phase column (ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 2.1*50 mm 1.8 μm) with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and a linear gradient of 1–12% CH3CN (2–25% CH3CN or 1–90% CH3CN) in 20 mm triethylammonium acetate, pH 7.5, buffer for 7 min. The low resolution mass spectra of the newly synthesized deoxyribonucleotides were obtained on an Agilent 1200 series LC/MS 6120 quadrupole system using an atmospheric electrospray ionization system. Kinetic parameters kcat and Kmwere obtained by fitting the initial velocity at various substrate concentrations to a Michaelis-Menten equation using the software KaleidaGraph. Crystal growth conditions were screened using cations, anions, and AmSO4 kits from Qiagen. Crystallization was then optimized in medium concentration of NH4SO4 (∼1.2 m) in 0.1 m HEPES at pH 7.7, in the presence of glycerol and/or small PEGs (e.g., 2% PEG400). Co-crystallization with ATP or CMP was also attempted. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected from frozen single crystals at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France, Beamline ID29) and processed with the programs MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.

The refined model and structure factors have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Biology under the following accession number: Protein Data Bank code 4HX9. Once a crystal structure of a mutated NDT was made available, we used it to model the other variants to analyze the docking of nucleotides. Three-dimensional models were built using @TOME-2 (20Pons J.L. Labesse G. @TOME-2.

Three-dimensional conformation of the desired deoxynucleosides/deoxynucleotides (adenosine and cytosine series) were extracted from Pubchem (21Wang Y. Xiao J. Suzek T.O. Zhang J. Wang J. Bryant S.H.

The results will be described elsewhere.3 To have a deoxyribosyltransferase with the broadest substrate specificity, we attempt to reconstruct the hypothetical common ancestor to Rcl and NDT by phylogenetic means using the software PAML 4.3 (PMID:17483113). The resurrected proteins were poorly soluble and inactive (not shown), so an alternative approach was to compare the sequences and structures of NDT and Rcl to create a chimera with the desired activities. NDT was chosen as a starting template because its transferase activity was more interesting from the synthetic point of view because it exchanges deoxyribose between pyrimidines and purines and, vice versa, between two pyrimidines and to a lesser extent between two purines. Furthermore, it tolerates substitutions on the base. The idea was to keep intact the catalytic core while reshaping the substrate specificity. First, two amino acids, Asp92 and Asn123 of NDT, were substituted to neutral and smaller serines. In wtNDT, these aspartate and asparagine interact with the 5′-OH group of 5-methyl-2′-deoxypseudouridine (Fig. 2B) by forming hydrogen bonds and prevent entrance of a larger and negatively charged phosphate group. At equivalent positions in the active site of Rcl, two serines (Ser87 and Ser117, respectively) were found (Fig. 2B). These changes confer to the NDT single mutant D92S (hereafter PDTM1, for phosphodeoxyribosyltransferase monophosphate) and the double mutant D92S,N123S (PDTM2) the ability to transfer deoxyribose 5-phosphate between cytosine and adenine, although with a low efficiency (Table 1). Overlay of the active sites of Rcl and NDT also predicts a steric clash between f13 and an incoming phosphate group (Fig. 2B). Upon substitution of Phe13 to the positively charged arginine (to give PDTM3 from PDTM1 or PDTM4 from PDTM2), the deoxyribose 5-phosphate transferase activity between C and A is enhanced by a factor of 50. Finally, we also substituted the Phe13 by a polar but neutral glutamine (PDTM5) leading to significant improvements in activity (Table 1). The phosphodeoxyribosyltransferase activity is not restricted to cytosine as donor and to adenine as acceptor (Table 2). PDTM3 is also able to transfer deoxyribose 5-phosphate between A and C and between C and T but with 2- and 4-fold lower activity than between C and A. All mutants transfer also deoxyribose 5-phosphate between A and G, whereas the reaction is almost undetectable when hypoxanthine is the acceptor base in agreement with previous observations showing that the deoxyribose transfer activity of NDT between a purine and hypoxanthine is low (23Kaminski P.A. Functional cloning, heterologous expression, and purification of two different N-deoxyribosyltransferases from Lactobacillus helveticus.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14400-14407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PDTM4 is twice more active than PDTM3, whatever the couple of bases tested. In contrast, PDTM5 transfers deoxyribose 5-phosphate efficiently between C and A and between A and C but is much less active for the transfer from C to T. Both PDTM4 and PDTM5 are much more active with the couple A and G than PDTM3. This improvement is mainly due to a better affinity for dCMP, the Km for dCMP varying from 22 mm (PDTM3) to 11 or 12 mm (PDTM4 and PDTM5, respectively) (Table 3).TABLE 2Specific activities of alignment-based PDT variants in the presence of different purines and pyrimidines as donors and acceptors of deoxyribose 5-phosphateReactionsaEnzymesbwtNDTPDTM1PDTM2PDTM3PDTM4PDTM5PDTT0PDTT1PDTT2dCMP + A D dAMP + C0.11.81.779.717029646.378286dAMP + C D dCMP + A34.777.620623.7531dCMP + T D dTMP + C18.2521.7<0.1<0.11.1dGMP + A D dAMP + G8.55781493250dAMP + Hx D dIMP + A2<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1dCDP + A D dADP + C<0.13166dADP + C D dCDP + A128dCDP + U D dUDP + Cc68dGDP + A D dADP + G1533dADP + Hx D dIDP + A<0.1<0.1dCTP + A D dATP + C<0.11051dATP + C D dCTP + A115dCTP + T D dTTP + C11.4dGTP + A D dATP + G2536dATP + Hx D dITP + A<0.1<0.1a The donor concentration was 3 mm, and the acceptor concentration was 1 mm.b The NDT and PDT sequences are: NDT, Phe13-Glu91-Asp92-Val93-Asn123-Tyr157; PDTM1, Ser92; PDTM2, Ser92-Ser123; PDTM3, Arg13-Ser92; PDTM4, Arg13-Ser92-Ser123; PDTM5, Gln13-Ser92-Ser123; PDTT0, Arg13-Gly92-Thr93-Ser123; PDTT1, Arg13-Gly92-Thr93-Ser123-Lys157; and PDTT2, Arg13-Gln91-Gly92-Thr93-Ser123.c U was used as acceptor base instead of T.

At least five different concentrations of dCMP, dCDP, and dCTP were used. The kcat (s−1) was calculated assuming a molecular mass of 108 kDa for each mutant. The better affinity of PDTM4 and PDMT5 over PDTM3 confirms the predicted contact involving the 5′ position of the ligand and the residue occupying the position 123 and the requirement for additional space to accommodate the phosphate group. Surprisingly, the mutant PDTM4 and PDTM5, differing by the nature of the residue at position 13 (arginine versus glutamine), show distinct specificity in the type of nucleobases to transfer. The arginine side chain was expected to mainly stabilize the negatively charged phosphate group, whereas the glutamine was predicted to point into the active site and stabilize the entering ligand through hydrogen bonding. Although the arginine is supposed to have little contact with the incoming nucleobase, the glutamine may contact it. In such a case the hydrophobic nature of the 5-position (methyl in thymine) may disfavor the transfer from C to T. In agreement, 5-halogenated uracils are better incorporated (see below; Table 4).TABLE 4Specific activities of PTM4, PDTM5, and PDTT2 variants in the presence of different donors and nucleoside analogues as acceptors of deoxyribose 5-phosphate or deoxyribose 5-triphosphate At this stage we reasoned that we should try to build a larger phosphate binding site and take advantage of the macrodipole of the central helix bearing the common catalytic glutamate (Glu98 in NDT) as observed in the Rcl-GMP complex (24Yang Y. Padilla A. Zhang C. Labesse G. Kaminski P.A. Structural characterization of the mammalian deoxynucleotide N-hydrolase Rcl and its stabilizing interactions with two inhibitors.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A more drastic reshaping of the active site was attempted by replacing the two amino acids, Asp and Val, with Gly and Thr at positions 92 to 93 (PDTT0) to remove a negatively charged residue and simultaneously make the backbone amide groups more accessible to better accommodate a phosphate group. Subsequently, in the context of the variant PDTT0 (PDTT for phosphodeoxyribosyltransferase triphosphate), we either added another positively charged residue (mutation Y157K; named PDTT1) or removed a negative charge (E91Q; PDTT2) to favor further the entrance of nucleotides. To track possible structural rearrangements induced by the mutations, several variants (PDTM1, PDTM4, and PDTT2) were tested for crystallization. Crystals of the apo form of PDTM1 and PDTT2 were obtained, and the structures were solved by molecular replacement. The crystals of PDTM1 diffracted at best to 3.5 Å, and the resulting structure appeared identical to the parent one and was not further refined. Conversely, the structure of PDTT2 could be refined to 2.7 Å. This crystal possesses a large unit cell that is composed of on"
https://openalex.org/W1994456824,"Control of plasma cholesterol levels is a major therapeutic strategy for management of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) levels decreases morbidity and mortality, this therapeutic intervention only translates into a 25-40% reduction in cardiovascular events. Epidemiological studies have shown that a high LDL-c level is not the only risk factor for CAD; low HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) is an independent risk factor for CAD. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the major protein component of HDL-c that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from tissues to the liver for excretion. Therefore, increasing ApoA-I levels is an attractive strategy for HDL-c elevation. Using genome-wide siRNA screening, targets that regulate hepatocyte ApoA-I secretion were identified through transfection of 21,789 siRNAs into hepatocytes whereby cell supernatants were assayed for ApoA-I. Approximately 800 genes were identified and triaged using a convergence of information, including genetic associations with HDL-c levels, tissue-specific gene expression, druggability assessments, and pathway analysis. Fifty-nine genes were selected for reconfirmation; 40 genes were confirmed. Here we describe the siRNA screening strategy, assay implementation and validation, data triaging, and example genes of interest. The genes of interest include known and novel genes encoding secreted enzymes, proteases, G-protein-coupled receptors, metabolic enzymes, ion transporters, and proteins of unknown function. Repression of farnesyltransferase (FNTA) by siRNA and the enzyme inhibitor manumycin A caused elevation of ApoA-I secretion from hepatocytes and from transgenic mice expressing hApoA-I and cholesterol ester transfer protein transgenes. In total, this work underscores the power of functional genetic assessment to identify new therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W1985696995,"Conditionally active proteins regulated by a physiological parameter represent a potential new class of protein therapeutics. By systematically creating point mutations in the catalytic and linker domains of human MMP-1, we generated a protein library amenable to physiological parameter-based screening. Mutants screened for temperature-sensitive activity had mutations clustered at or near amino acids critical for metal binding. One mutant, GVSK (Gly159 to Val, Ser208 to Lys), contains mutations in regions of the catalytic domain involved in calcium and zinc binding. The in vitro activity of GVSK at 37 °C in high Ca2+ (10 mm) was comparable with MMP-1 (wild type), but in low Ca2+ (1 mm), there was an over 10-fold loss in activity despite having similar kinetic parameters. Activity decreased over 50% within 15 min and correlated with the degradation of the activated protein, suggesting that GVSK was unstable in low Ca2+. Varying the concentration of Zn2+ had no effect on GVSK activity in vitro. As compared with MMP-1, GVSK degraded soluble collagen I at the high but not the low Ca2+ concentration. In vivo, MMP-1 and GVSK degraded collagen I when perfused in Zucker rat ventral skin and formed higher molecular weight complexes with α2-macroglobulin, an inhibitor of MMPs. In vitro and in vivo complex formation and subsequent enzyme inactivation occurred faster with GVSK, especially at the low Ca2+ concentration. These data suggest that the activity of the human MMP-1 mutant GVSK can be regulated by Ca2+ both in vitro and in vivo and may represent a novel approach to engineering matrix-remodeling enzymes for therapeutic applications. Conditionally active proteins regulated by a physiological parameter represent a potential new class of protein therapeutics. By systematically creating point mutations in the catalytic and linker domains of human MMP-1, we generated a protein library amenable to physiological parameter-based screening. Mutants screened for temperature-sensitive activity had mutations clustered at or near amino acids critical for metal binding. One mutant, GVSK (Gly159 to Val, Ser208 to Lys), contains mutations in regions of the catalytic domain involved in calcium and zinc binding. The in vitro activity of GVSK at 37 °C in high Ca2+ (10 mm) was comparable with MMP-1 (wild type), but in low Ca2+ (1 mm), there was an over 10-fold loss in activity despite having similar kinetic parameters. Activity decreased over 50% within 15 min and correlated with the degradation of the activated protein, suggesting that GVSK was unstable in low Ca2+. Varying the concentration of Zn2+ had no effect on GVSK activity in vitro. As compared with MMP-1, GVSK degraded soluble collagen I at the high but not the low Ca2+ concentration. In vivo, MMP-1 and GVSK degraded collagen I when perfused in Zucker rat ventral skin and formed higher molecular weight complexes with α2-macroglobulin, an inhibitor of MMPs. In vitro and in vivo complex formation and subsequent enzyme inactivation occurred faster with GVSK, especially at the low Ca2+ concentration. These data suggest that the activity of the human MMP-1 mutant GVSK can be regulated by Ca2+ both in vitro and in vivo and may represent a novel approach to engineering matrix-remodeling enzymes for therapeutic applications. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)3 are characterized by their dependence on zinc and calcium for activity. The MMPs along with the reprolysins, ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase), serralysins, and astacins, comprise the metzincin subfamily of metalloproteases (1Gill S.E. Parks W.C. Extracellular Matrix Degradation.Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany. 2011; Google Scholar). Although MMPs are capable of effecting the turnover and degradation of proteins that compose the extracellular matrix, there are a large number of non-extracellular matrix proteins including cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, tyrosine kinase receptors, and MMPs themselves that are processed by MMPs (2Butler G.S. Overall C.M. Updated biological roles for matrix metalloproteinases and new “intracellular” substrates revealed by degradomics.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10830-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As expected by the plethora of substrates, MMP activity is an important component of many diverse physiological processes including wound healing, bone remodeling, organogenesis, and inflammation. However, MMP activity is also associated with various pathological conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disease, and fibrosis (1Gill S.E. Parks W.C. Extracellular Matrix Degradation.Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany. 2011; Google Scholar, 3Hadler-Olsen E. Fadnes B. Sylte I. Uhlin-Hansen L. Winberg J.O.

Roles of matrix metalloproteinases in cancer progression and their pharmacological targeting.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The majority of MMP proteins are composed of a prodomain, catalytic domain, and hemopexin domain. The prodomain contains the consensus sequence PRCXXPD, which serves an autoinhibitory function by utilizing the cysteine residue to coordinate to the Zn2+ molecule located in the active site of the catalytic domain (5Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. The cysteine switch: a principle of regulation of metalloproteinase activity with potential applicability to the entire matrix metalloproteinase gene family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain contains three conserved histidine residues in the consensus sequence HEXGHXXGXXH that ligate the active site Zn2+ (6Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöckler W. Astacins, serralysins, snake venom, and matrix metalloproteinases exhibit identical zinc-binding environments (HEXXHXXGXXH and Met-turn) and topologies and should be grouped into a common family, the ‘metzincins‘.FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). This interaction maintains the enzyme in an inactive state until removal of the prodomain either by proteolysis or by destabilization renders the protein active (7Nagase H. Activation mechanisms of matrix metalloproteinases.Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). The hemopexin domain is located C-terminal of the conserved methionine turn (6Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöckler W. Astacins, serralysins, snake venom, and matrix metalloproteinases exhibit identical zinc-binding environments (HEXXHXXGXXH and Met-turn) and topologies and should be grouped into a common family, the ‘metzincins‘.FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and facilitates substrate recognition. Other protein-protein interactions mediated by the hemopexin domain are important for enzyme activation, localization, internalization, and degradation (8Overall C.M. Molecular determinants of metalloproteinase substrate specificity: matrix metalloproteinase substrate binding domains, modules, and exosites.Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interstitial collagenase, also known as MMP-1, was originally identified in 1962 based on its activity during tadpole tail morphogenesis (9Gross J. Lapiere C.M. Collagenolytic activity in amphibian tissues: a tissue culture assay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1962; 48: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Native collagen types I, II, and III are proteolyzed by MMP-1 at the peptide bond between Gly775-Ile776 or Gly775-Lys776, resulting in the generation of the distinctive three-quarter and one-quarter fragments (10Welgus H.G. Kobayashi D.K. Jeffrey J.J. The collagen substrate specificity of rat uterus collagenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14162-14165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These fragments denature into gelatin at physiological temperatures and are further degraded by other MMPs and proteases. In addition to the active site zinc, a second zinc molecule is bound in the catalytic domain and serves a structural function. In addition to zinc, three calcium molecules bind to the catalytic domain and one binds to the hemopexin domain (Ref. 11Maskos K. Crystal structures of MMPs in complex with physiological and pharmacological inhibitors.Biochimie. 2005; 87: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and references therein). The calcium molecules have also been shown to play an important role in domain stabilization and in the regulation of catalytic activity (12Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. The function of Ca+ in the action of mammalian collagenases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Housley T.J. Baumann A.P. Braun I.D. Davis G.

As expected, the amino acids important for the binding of the zinc and calcium molecules within the catalytic domain are highly conserved among MMP family members (11Maskos K. Crystal structures of MMPs in complex with physiological and pharmacological inhibitors.Biochimie. 2005; 87: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The process of protein evolution has the potential to enhance or modify the pre-existing properties of an enzyme to tailor them toward a specific need (15Tawfik D.S. Chap R. Eshhar Z.

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For example, a protein may be evolved to have activity only in a particular physiological microenvironment. These unique microenvironments can be defined by differences in pH, temperature, ion concentration, oxidation state, and other physiological parameters. Recent advances in high throughput protein mutagenesis make possible the construction of comprehensive libraries of protein variants that can be screened for conditional activity under defined physiological conditions. We have generated such a library of human MMP-1 protein variants by systematically mutating the catalytic and linker domains of the protein. Here we report on the creation of a human MMP-1 protein whose activity can be modulated by the concentration of Ca2+. The ability to control the in vivo activity of MMP-1 may provide a unique approach to creating matrix-remodeling enzymes for therapeutic applications such as fibrotic diseases. A comprehensive positional evolution (CPETM, BioAtla) library of single point mutants in the catalytic domain and linker region of MMP-1 was created. The library contained 15 random amino acid variants at each of the 178 amino acids mutated (from Phe81 to Ala258). Potential single amino acid mutants were screened (as described below) against fluorogenic peptide substrate IX (Mca-K-P-L-G-L-Dpa-A-R-NH2, (R&D Systems (17Neumann U. Kubota H. Frei K. Ganu V. Leppert D. Characterization of Mca-Lys-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, a fluorogenic substrate with increased specificity constants for collagenases and tumor necrosis factor converting enzyme.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 328: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)) for decreased catalytic activity at 37 °C relative to 25 °C and for sufficient protein expression. Wild type and mutant MMP-1 cDNAs derived from the comprehensive positional evolution process were transformed in BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) in 96-well plates (Falcon). Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (EMD Biosciences), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The periplasmic protein fraction was then isolated by incubating the cells in OS buffer (osmotic shock, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) with 0.5 mg/ml of DNase, RNase, and lysozyme (EMD Biosciences). The cells were centrifuged after the addition of cold water, and the supernatant containing the periplasmic protein fraction was transferred to 96-well plates. MMP-1 protein in the supernatants was activated with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma) at either 25 °C or 37 °C. Activity was measured using the fluorogenic peptide assay as described below at both 25 °C and 37 °C. All activity screens were performed in duplicate. Multiple mutants with a single amino acid change were obtained that met the selection criteria. The mutant that exhibited the most temperature sensitivity was G159V. Protein expression of this mutant was, however, poor. Another mutant, S208K, did not exhibit temperature sensitivity but did express protein at high levels. Therefore the two mutations were combined to make a double mutant, GVSK,4 which expressed protein at levels sufficient to pursue further studies. Wild type and mutant MMP-1 cDNAs were subcloned into pET26b vectors (EMD Biosciences) for protein expression. Transformed BL21(DE3) bacteria were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 25 °C. The next morning, the bacteria were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in OS (osmotic shock) buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 25 units/ml Benzonase (Sigma) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. An equal volume of cold water was added and incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. The clarified supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (3000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C) and incubated with a 20% volume (v/v) of Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore), combined with a filtered Q-Sepharose wash and loaded onto a 5-ml SP Sepharose fast flow column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with a 0–70% gradient (Buffer A: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2; Buffer B: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2). Peak fractions were pooled, diluted 8-fold in Buffer A, and reloaded onto the column. After the second elution, peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex 200 10 × 300-mm column (GE Healthcare) in Buffer A. Peak fractions were again pooled and concentrated, and the concentration of the purified protein was determined. Purified full-length MMP-1 was activated by proteolytic cleavage using immobilized trypsin. 200 μl of trypsin immobilized on beaded agarose (Pierce) was washed with 1 ml of TCN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl) three times. The trypsin beads were then mixed with 1 ml of purified MMP-1 (∼3 mg/ml) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rotation. Beads were separated from the activated protein by using a Zeba desalt spin column (Thermo Scientific). The concentration of the activated protein was determined, and the activity was assessed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE analysis and the in vitro MMP-1 peptide activity assay. Purified MMP-1, GVSK, or perfusate samples were incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrate IX and assayed for activity. Purified MMP-1 or MMP-1 from a perfusate sample was diluted in TCN buffer (1 or 10 mm CaCl2) to a concentration of 1 μg/ml. A series of seven, 3-fold serial dilutions was then made from this starting concentration. 100 μl of each sample was then added to a 96-well FLUOTRAC 200 black plate (Greiner Bio-One) containing 5 μl of the fluorogenic substrate (final concentration of 200 μm). Plates were read using the SpectraMax M3 fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. Each sample was measured in duplicate, and the activity was calculated by averaging the readings for each sample within the linear range of the assay. Alternatively, activated MMP-1 or GVSK was diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in TCN buffer (1 or 10 mm CaCl2) containing 10% Zucker rat serum in a final volume of 120 μl. The samples were incubated for various times at 25 °C. After the incubation, 95 μl of each sample was added to a 96-well FLUOTRAC 200 black plate containing 5 μl of the fluorogenic substrate (final concentration of 100 μm). The plates were read, and the activity was calculated as described above. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Purified MMP-1 and GVSK, at a concentration of 5 nm, were incubated with a series of 2-fold dilutions (0.95–62 μm final concentration) of fluorogenic peptide substrate IX in TCNB buffer (TCN buffer with 0.05% Brij-35 for protein stabilization at low protein concentrations) with either 1 mm or 10 mm CaCl2. 100 μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C in a 96-well FLUOTRAC 200 black plate. Plates were read using the SpectraMax M3 fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. The conversion factor was obtained by incubation of substrate IX with 0.25 μm MMP-1 for 24 h at 37 °C. Hydrolysis rates were obtained from fluorescence versus time plots using data points from the linear portion of the curve. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain hydrolysis rates in μm s−1. Kinetic parameters were obtained by Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes-Woolf analysis. Each experiment was performed three times, and each sample was assayed in duplicate. MMP-1 and GVSK at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml were preincubated for 2 h at either 25 °C or 37 °C in TCN buffer containing either 1 mm or 10 mm CaCl2. Fluorescein-labeled collagen isolated from calf skin (Elastin Products) was diluted 10-fold in the two TCN buffers to a final concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. After the preincubation, 45 μl of the diluted collagen was mixed with 5 μl of enzyme, and the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. The digestion reactions were stopped with the addition of gel sample buffer and were heated for 5 min at 99 °C prior to 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Gels were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. The in vivo activity of MMP-1 and GVSK were assayed by perfusing the enzyme in the ventral skin of Zucker rats. All animals were treated in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. The ventral surface of ∼6–12-month-old male Zucker rats (Harlan Laboratories) was shaved, and then 1 ml of TCN buffer (1 or 10 mm CaCl2) containing 1 μg/ml rHuPH20 (recombinant human PH20 hyaluronidase, Halozyme Therapeutics) and 2.5 μg/ml epinephrine (Sigma) was perfused (PHD 2000 infuse/withdraw, Harvard Apparatus) at a rate of 0.12 ml/min at up to five different sites. After 10 min, 1 ml of MMP-1 or GVSK at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in TCN buffer (1 or 10 mm CaCl2) was perfused at a rate of 0.12 mg/ml. At various time points after the completion of the second perfusion, 1-cm full thickness biopsies of the treated sites were taken and fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma) for histological analysis. Perfusate that collected in the area vacated by the biopsied tissue was transferred with a pipette to Eppendorf tubes and kept at −20 °C until further analysis. ∼4 μg of each perfusate sample (∼5–20 μl) was mixed with gel sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 99 °C prior to electrophoresis. Samples were analyzed by either 8% or 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The blots were blocked for 30 min with 1% milk in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (EMD Chemicals)). After three PBST washes, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:1000 dilutions of either a rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen I antibody (Abcam) or a goat anti-human MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems). After washing with PBST, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either an anti-goat or an anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:2000 dilution (Calbiochem). After washing with PBST, the blots were developed using the TMB insoluble reagent (Calbiochem). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, ∼12 μg of total protein from the rat perfusates (∼15–30 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of an anti-rat α2-macroglobulin rabbit antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International) and brought to a final volume of 200 μl with PBST. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, 40 μl of protein A/G beads (Pall Scientific) was added and incubated with rotation for 3 h at room temperature. Each sample was then washed four times with 1 ml of PBST, and 30 μl of gel sample buffer was added. The samples were heated for 5 min at 99 °C, electrophoresed on a 4–20% gel, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was probed with the anti-human MMP-1 antibody as described above. The concentration of MMP-1 and GVSK from the rat perfusates was determined by ELISA. 96-well 4HBX plates (Immulon) were coated with 100 μl/well of an anti-human MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems) at 1 μg/ml in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the plates were washed five times with 300 μl/well of PBS and blocked with 200 μl/well of PBST (0.05% Tween 20, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Purified human MMP-1 (R&D Systems) standards were prepared by diluting into PBST at an initial concentration of 200 μg/ml. A series of six 3-fold dilutions was prepared from this starting concentration. Perfusate samples were initially diluted 1:100, and six 3-fold dilutions were prepared from this initial dilution. 100 μl/well of each dilution was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with 300 μl/well of PBST and incubated with 100 μl/well of a biotin-conjugated anti-human MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems) at 0.25 μg/ml in PBST for 2 h at room temperature. After another wash step, the plates were incubated with 100 μl/well of 1 μg/ml streptavidin-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After the final wash, 100 μl/well of SureBlue TMB microwell peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) was added to develop the reaction. After ∼5 min, 100 μl/well of TMB stop solution (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) was added to stop the reaction, and the plates were read using the SpectraMax M3 fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm. Each perfusate sample was assayed in duplicate, and the concentration was calculated by averaging the readings for each sample within the linear range of the assay. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. 8 μm frozen sections were prepared from a human keloid biopsy. Sections on slides were covered with 150 μl of either 10 mm TCN buffer or 1.6 mg/ml GVSK in 10 mm TCN buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. Sections were then fixed for 5 min with 10% neutral buffered formalin (VWR International) at room temperature. The slides were subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed by light microscopy. Micrographs were taken with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope using Spot software version 4.6 (Spot Imaging Solutions). To create conditionally active mutants of MMP-1, a comprehensive library of single point mutants in the catalytic and linker domain was generated. 15 amino acid variants of 178 amino acids beginning at Phe81 and ending with Ala258 were made. These mutations corresponded to the N-terminal amino acid in the activated protein after cleavage of the prodomain to the final amino acid of the linker domain (18Iyer S. Visse R. Nagase H. Acharya K.R. Crystal structure of an active form of human MMP-1.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As a first screen for conditional activity, over 2600 mutated proteins were assayed for decreased catalytic activity at 37 °C relative to 25 °C. 26 single amino acid mutants meeting this requirement were obtained. Although a small number of mutations were at or near residues involved in Zn2+ binding (catalytic or structural), the majority of these point mutations were located in amino acids that were either directly involved or adjacent to amino acids that participate in the coordination of two of the three calcium molecules (Calcium 1 and Calcium 3) of the catalytic domain (11Maskos K. Crystal structures of MMPs in complex with physiological and pharmacological inhibitors.Biochimie. 2005; 87: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Iyer S. Visse R. Nagase H. Acharya K.R. Crystal structure of an active form of human MMP-1.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results led us to examine the effects that the concentration of Ca2+ and Zn2+ would have on the in vitro and in vivo activity of these mutants. A representative mutant, GVSK, which has a glycine to valine mutation at amino acid 159, a residue directly involved in Ca2+ coordination, and a serine to lysine mutation at amino acid 208, a residue adjacent to an amino acid involved in the binding of the catalytic Zn2+ molecule (18Iyer S. Visse R. Nagase H. Acharya K.R. Crystal structure of an active form of human MMP-1.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was chosen for further characterization. To generate activated wild type MMP-1 (henceforth referred to as MMP-1) and GVSK protein, the full-length purified proteins were incubated with immobilized trypsin. The trypsin activation of proMMP-1 resulted in the removal of the prodomain and a change in apparent molecular mass from 57 kDa to ∼43 kDa (Fig. 1A). In addition to the activated protein, there were two other proteins (near the 22 kDa marker) which, based on N-terminal sequencing, were determined to be the catalytic and hemopexin domains (data not shown). These were probably generated by autocleavage in the linker region (19Clark I.M. Cawston T.E. Fragments of human fibroblast collagenase. Purification and characterization.Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Once activated, MMP-1 was assayed against a fluorogenic peptide substrate to determine its activity. Activated MMP-1 exhibited extensive activity against the peptide substrate and was ∼78 times more active than the full-length, unactivated protein (Fig. 1B), indicating that the change in the molecular weight of the protein correlated with increased activity. The activation of the GVSK mutant was essentially identical to the wild type protein (data not shown). The in vitro catalytic activity of activated MMP-1 and GVSK against a fluorescent peptide substrate was first assayed as a function of Ca2+ concentration to determine whether the mutations in GVSK had an effect on activity. The proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h at 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm Ca2+. At 10 mm Ca2+, a concentration sufficient for maximal activity (12Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. The function of Ca+ in the action of mammalian collagenases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the activity of MMP-1 was higher than the activity of GVSK, indicating that the mutations had decreased the specific activity of GVSK (Fig. 2). With decreasing concentrations of Ca2+, the in vitro catalytic activity of MMP-1 was essentially unaffected. In contrast, at 2 mm Ca2+, the activity of GVSK had decreased 3-fold as compared with its activity at 10 mm. As the concentration was further decreased to 1 mm, the activity had decreased ∼10-fold (Fig. 2). However, when incubated at 25 °C, GVSK lost less than half of its activity, suggesting that temperature and Ca2+ concentration both had an effect on activity (data not shown). To ascertain whether the calcium sensitivity of GVSK was attributable to one of the two mutations, the activated single mutants GV and SK were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 1 and 10 mm Ca2+ and assayed for activity against the fluorescent peptide substrate. Analogous to MMP-1, the activity of SK was similar at both 1 mm and 10 mm Ca2+ (data not shown). In contrast, the activity of GV was decreased ∼4-fold in 1 mm Ca2+ as compared with its activity in 10 mm Ca2+ (data not shown). These data suggest that the calcium sensitivity of GVSK is due to the Gly159 to Val mutation. These results were not surprising as residue 159 is directly involved in Ca2+ coordination. The effect of Zn2+ concentration on the in vitro catalytic activity of activated GVSK and MMP-1 was examined next. The proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with either 1 μm or 10 μm Zn2+ in TCN buffer (1 and 10 mm Ca2+). No difference in the in vitro activity of MMP-1 or GVSK was observed as a function of the Zn2+ concentration in either the 1 mm or 10 mm Ca2+ TCN buffer (data not shown). As a result of these findings, the effect of the Zn2+ concentration on GVSK activity was not pursued further. To determine whether the decreased activity of GVSK in 1 mm Ca2+ was due to changes in the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, the Km and kcat were determined for both GVSK and MMP-1 at the low and high calcium concentrations. The Km and kcat of MMP-1 in either 1 mm or 10 mm Ca2+ were essentially identical"
