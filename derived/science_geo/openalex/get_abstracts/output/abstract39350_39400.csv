https://openalex.org/W2000024512,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is an intracellular second messenger that activates transcription of many cellular genes. A palindromic consensus DNA sequence, TGACGTCA, functions as a cAMP-responsive transcriptional enhancer (CRE). The CRE binds a cellular protein of 38 kD in placental JEG-3 cells. A placental lambda gt11 library was screened for expression of specific CRE-binding proteins with the CRE sequence as a radioactive probe. A cDNA encoding a protein of 326 amino acids with the binding properties of a specific CRE-binding protein (CREB) was isolated. The protein contains a COOH-terminal basic region adjacent to a sequence similar to the ""leucine zipper"" sequence believed to be involved in DNA binding and in protein-protein contacts in several other DNA-associated transcriptional proteins including the products of the c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun oncogenes and GCN4. The CREB protein also contains an NH2-terminal acidic region proposed to be a potential transcriptional activation domain. The putative DNA-binding domain of CREB is structurally similar to the corresponding domains in the phorbol ester-responsive c-jun protein and the yeast transcription factor GCN4."
https://openalex.org/W2013357966,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type III (HTLV-III) was recently identified as the probable etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Here it is shown that, in human T-cell lines infected with HTLV-III, gene expression directed by the long terminal repeat sequence of this virus is stimulated by more than two orders of magnitude compared to matched uninfected cells. The rate of transcription of the HTLV-III long terminal repeat is more than 1000 times that of the SV40 early promoter in one infected cell line. Thus, HTLV-III, like HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the bovine leukemia virus, is characterized by trans-activation of transcription in infected cells. The efficiency of trans-activation in the case of HTLV-III may account, at least in part, for the virulent nature of HTLV-III infection."

https://openalex.org/W2001486328,"A human CSF-1 receptor containing an ""activating"" mutation in its extracellular domain (serine for leucine 301) induced morphologic transformation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in mouse NIH 3T3 cells. A second regulatory mutation within the receptor's intracytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail (phenylalanine for tyrosine 969) augmented transforming efficiency but was itself insufficient to induce transformation. Like the v-fms oncogene product, receptors bearing the activating mutation retained high-affinity binding sites for CSF-1 but were retarded in transport to the cell surface and were phosphorylated on tyrosine in the absence of ligand. Although the activating mutation does not affect the CSF-1 binding site in the receptor extracellular domain, it must induce a conformational change that mimics the effect of ligand binding, resulting in CSF-1-independent signals for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1588572292,"Cross-linking of 125I-nerve growth factor (NGF) to PC12 cells with the photoreactive heterobifunctional agent N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate results in the labeling of two major bands with Mr 158,000 and 100,000 and a minor band with Mr 225,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions. Binding of 125I-NGF to and cross-linking into all these species is abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled NGF but not in the presence of unlabeled epidermal growth factor, insulin, or bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. When PC12 cells with bound 125I-NGF are incubated in excess unlabeled NGF at 0 degree C prior to cross-linking, only the Mr 158,000 species remains. In addition, binding of 125I-NGF to the Mr 158,000 complex is trypsin-resistant, whereas binding to the Mr 100,000 complex is not. These experiments identify the Mr 158,000 species as the slow NGF-receptor complex (chase stable at 0 degree C) and the smaller Mr 100,000 species as the fast NGF-receptor complex (trypsin sensitive). Furthermore, 125I-NGF bound to the former but not to the latter species is displaced by very-low concentrations of NGF, showing that at least a significant fraction of the high-molecular-weight slow receptor is also a high-affinity receptor. This identification is supported by the finding that chick sensory neurons which possess both high- and low-affinity receptors exhibit two major labeled bands with Mr 145,000 and 105,000 as a result of cross-linking with 125I-NGF, whereas a cell population enriched in non-neuronal cells, which possess only low-affinity receptors, exhibits only the Mr 105,000 component. A shift in molecular weight of both species after pretreatment with neuraminidase indicates that both complexes contain sialoglycoproteins and rules out the possibility that differences in sialic acid content are responsible for the difference in molecular weight of the two complexes. The relative amount of the labeling of these two complexes is not affected by the presence of protease inhibitors nor by a variation of 5000-fold in cross-linker concentration. These results place some limits on possible models for the NGF receptors and their interconversion."
https://openalex.org/W1481497040,"Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is a differentiation factor that causes the Mullerian duct to regress during the development of the male reproductive tract. The active form is a disulfide-linked dimer consisting of two identical 70-kDa subunits. Recently, the amino acid sequence for MIS was deduced from its gene sequence and revealed that the carboxyl-terminal region shares homology with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Since TGF-beta is produced as a large latent precursor that requires proteolytic activation for activity, we sought to determine if MIS might undergo a similar processing event. Here we demonstrate that typically 5 to 20% of the protein in MIS preparations is cleaved at a site 109 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. Concurrent cleavages from both chains of the MIS dimer produces a 25-kDa TGF-beta-like fragment and a high molecular mass complex derived from the amino terminus of the protein. Although the two fragments are noncovalently linked, they remain tightly associated after cleavage, and thus are structurally organized like TGF-beta within its precursor. The same cleavage products also can be generated by limited proteolysis with plasmin, which provides a simple method for converting the entire preparation into the cleaved form. The plasmin-digested MIS is fully active in the organ culture assay."
https://openalex.org/W1549576466,"The role of Ca2+ in the generation of inositol phosphates was investigated using rat pancreatic islets after steady state labeling with myo-[2-3H]inositol. Depolarizing K+ concentrations (24 mM) evoked early (2 s) increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4) as measured by high performance anion-exchange chromatography. The increase in Ins-1,4,5-P3 was transient and was followed by a more pronounced rise in Ins-1,3,4-P3. These effects were dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ but were not secondary to release of either neurotransmitters or metabolites of arachidonic acid. K+ also promoted the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) and of the other phosphoinositides. Glucose (16.7 mM) was less marked in its effects but still promoted rapid increases in Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (2 s) and Ins-1,4,5-P3 (10 s) and a slower rise in Ins-1,3,4-P3 (30 s). The levels of all three metabolites rose steadily over 10 min stimulation. These responses to glucose could be largely, although not entirely, inhibited by depletion of extracellular Ca2+ or by Ca2+ channel blockade with verapamil (20 microM). Carbamylcholine (0.5 mM) was the most potent stimulus used evoking early rises in Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (2 s) followed by Ins-1,3,4-P3 (10 s), effects which were only partially dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The results suggest that a Ca2+-mediated PtdIns-4,5-P2 hydrolysis accounts for most of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 generated in response to glucose but not carbamylcholine. In addition, glucose may exert effects on inositol phosphate metabolism which are Ca2+ independent."
https://openalex.org/W2109358961,"Neuronal interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components are crucial for axon growth and guidance during development and nerve regeneration. Laminin (LN), a prominent ECM glycoprotein, promotes neuronal survival and axon growth. To identify neuronal receptors for LN, we looked for cell surface proteins on the neuronal cell line B50 that bind LN. An integrin , dimeric receptor was identified and purified using lectin and LN affinity chromatography. The purified integrin contains two subunits with M,s of 200 K and 120 K that bind LN specifically in the presence, but not the absence, of divalent cations (Ca2+/Mg2+ or Ca2+/Mn2+). The Mr 120 K protein was identified as the rat integrin β1 subunit using two β1 subunit-specific antibodies, and was shown to form a noncovalent complex with the Mr 200K putative α subunit. Since neurons and neuronal cell lines express similar integrin β1,-class heterodimers that mediate attachment and process outgrowth on LN, the M, 200K/120K complex identified here is likely to be an important laminin receptor used by neurons. This integrin may also mediate binding to LN by many nonneuronal cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1550019326,"Abstract The GTPase activity of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Gs) of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase was investigated using purified rabbit hepatic Gs and either [alpha-32P]- or [gamma-32P] GTP as substrate. The binding of [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) was used to quantitate the total concentration of Gs. 1) GTPase activity was a saturable function of the concentration of GTP, with Km = 0.3 microM. MgCl2 monotonically increased the activity. The maximum observed turnover number was about 1.5 min-1. 2) During steady-state hydrolysis, 20-40% of total Gs could be trapped as a Gs-GDP complex and 1-2% could be trapped as Gs-GTP. The hydrolysis of Gs-GTP to Gs-GDP occurred with t 1/2 less than or equal to 5 s at 30 degrees C and t 1/2 approximately 1 min at 0 degrees C. Hydrolysis of Gs-GTP was inhibited by 1.0 mM EDTA in the absence of added Mg2+. 3) The rate of formation of Gs-GDP and the initial GTPase rate varied in parallel as functions of the concentrations of either GTP or MgCl2 (above 0.1 mM Mg2+). The ratio of the rate of accumulation of Gs-GDP to the GTPase rate was constant at 0.3-0.4. 4) The rate of dissociation of assayable Gs-GDP was biphasic. The initial phase accounted for 60-80% of total assayable Gs-GDP and was characterized by a t 1/2 of about 1 min. 5) Lubrol 12A9 potently inhibited the GTPase reaction and the dissociation of Gs-GDP in parallel, and inhibition of product release may account for the inhibition of steady-state hydrolysis. 6) The beta and gamma subunits of Gs markedly inhibited the dissociation of GDP from Gs in contrast to their ability to stimulate the dissociation of GTP gamma S. 7) GDP, GTP gamma S, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) competitively inhibited the accumulation of Gs-GDP. GTP gamma S and Gpp(NH)p inhibited the GTPase reaction noncompetitively, GDP displayed mixed inhibition, and Pi did not inhibit. These data are interpretable in terms of the coexistence of two specific mechanistic pathways for the overall GTPase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1486183250,"To investigate the mechanisms by which inositol phosphates regulate cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), we injected Xenopus oocytes with inositol phosphates and measured Ca2+-activated Cl- currents as an assay of [Ca2+]c. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) injection (0.1-10.0 pmol) induced an initial transient Cl- current (I1) followed by a second more prolonged Cl- current (I2). Both currents were Ca2+-dependent, but the source of Ca2+ was different. Release of intracellular Ca2+ stores produced I1, whereas influx of extracellular Ca2+ produced I2; Ca2+-free bathing media and inorganic calcium channel blockers (Mn2+, Co2+) did not alter I1 but completely and reversibly inhibited I2. Injection of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolite, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) (0.2-10.0 pmol) generated a Ca2+-dependent Cl- current with superimposed current oscillations that resulted from release of intracellular Ca2+, not Ca2+ influx. Injection of the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 metabolite, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (10.0 pmol), or the synthetic inositol trisphosphate isomer, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (1.0-10.0 pmol), mimicked the effect of Ins(1,4,5)P3, stimulating an I1 resulting from release of intracellular Ca2+ and an I2 resulting from influx of extracellular Ca2+. The results indicate that several inositol trisphosphate isomers stimulate both release of intracellular Ca2+ and influx of extracellular Ca2+. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 also stimulated release of intracellular Ca2+, but it was neither sufficient nor required for Ca2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1589587808,"Washes and extracts of frozen and fresh cattle retina contain a water-soluble high-molecular-weight, retinoid-binding protein that is distinct from three other retinoid-binding proteins previously isolated from this tissue. The protein can be purified to apparent homogeneity from retinal homogenates by a combination of gel filtration, lectin, and ion-exchange chromatography. Overestimation of the protein molecular weight was observed in several systems involving migration of the protein through a porous network. The approximate molecular weight obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 140,000, a value consistent with those reported by other laboratories. However, a more detailed analysis using the method of Ferguson revealed the protein to behave anomalously relative to several proteins used as sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis standards. The apparent radius of the native protein, estimated from calibrated gel filtration, corresponded to a globular protein with a molecular weight of 240,000-280,000, suggesting that the protein was a dimer. However, when the molecular weight of native interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) was determined by a method with no shape dependence, sedimentation equilibrium, a value of 131,700 +/- 3,900 g/mol, was obtained. Sedimentation equilibrium in a dissociating solvent (6 M guanidine HCl) yielded a molecular weight of the smallest component of 120,100 +/- 2,300 g/mol. The similarity of values for the denatured and native molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium demonstrates that the protein is a monomer. In further support of this, no evidence for a dimer was observed in cross-linking experiments with dimethyl suberimidate. The sedimentation coefficient (S0(20),w = 5.73 +/- 0.15 S) and molecular weight from sedimentation equilibrium were employed to calculate the frictional coefficient and Stokes radius of IRBP (f/f0 = 1.64, Rs = 55 A). The high value of f/f0 of the protein provides a reasonable explanation for the over-estimation of the molecular weight of native IRBP on gel filtration. Approximately 2 mol of exogenous all-trans- or 11-cis-retinol were bound per mol of protein (131,000). Approximately 7% of the binding sites were saturated with endogenous ligand (11-cis-retinol, 88%; all-trans-retinol, 12%) following isolation from partially bleached cattle eyes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1523064851,"Fibronectin is organized into disulfide cross-linked, insoluble pericellular matrix fibrils by fibroblasts in vitro. Two sites, the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-containing cell attachment domain and a site located in the first 70 kDa of fibronectin, are required for matrix assembly. The first 70 kDa of fibronectin contain two structural motifs termed type I and type II homologies, which are repeated nine and two times, respectively. Previous work has implicated the amino-terminal region and the carboxyl terminus containing three type I repeats in matrix assembly, suggesting that type I repeats possess binding activity essential for fibronectin matrix assembly. To test this hypothesis, we developed a sensitive capture immunoassay to quantify insoluble matrix fibronectin and tested a panel of fibronectin fragments, containing all of the type I repeats found in the intact protein, for their ability to inhibit matrix assembly. Only fragments containing the first five type I repeats inhibited fibronectin matrix assembly, although sequences carboxyl-terminal to this domain enhanced this activity. Additional evidence for the specific recognition of the amino-terminal type I repeats by matrix assembling cells was found when the reversible, detergent-sensitive binding of a 125I-labeled fragment containing the first five type I repeats (29 kDa) to cell monolayers was studied. Only monolayers of cell lines that incorporate fibronectin into a fibrillar matrix specifically bound 125I-labeled 29 kDa. Binding of the radiolabeled amino-terminal fragment to matrix-forming cells was inhibited by unlabeled fragments containing the first five type I repeats but not by unlabeled fragments containing the remaining seven type I repeats. Matrix assembly is therefore not a generalized property of type I repeats. Rather, a critical site is located within the first 29 kDa of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1564457890,"Immunochemical, chromatographic, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis studies suggest that immunologically related but distinct cyclic GMP phosphodiesterases are present in rod and cone outer segments of the retina. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that one monoclonal antibody (ROS-1) recognized a determinant present in both rod and cone outer segments, while another monoclonal antibody (ROS-2) only recognized rod outer segments. At least two peaks of phosphodiesterase activity could be separated by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography of retinal extracts. Both peaks were recognized by ROS-1. None of the first peak and only 80% of the second broad peak of activity were recognized by ROS-2. High-performance liquid chromatography profiles from human fovea and several other types of cone-enriched retina showed that most of the activity was contained in the first peak, suggesting that this activity was derived from cone outer segments. Conversely, the phosphodiesterase in rod-enriched preparations migrated predominately in the second peak. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicated that this first peak contained a single large immunoreactive polypeptide (alpha') that migrated with the same mobility as a phosphorylase b standard and was distinct from the more rapidly migrating large immunoreactive polypeptides (alpha and beta) present in a broad second peak. The second peak could be further separated into a first part that contained a doublet of two immunoreactive polypeptides (alpha and beta) that migrated faster than phosphorylase b and a later part that contained only the most rapidly migrating polypeptide (beta). All of the peaks could be activated by histone or transducin:GTP, implying that all contained a small 11-kDa inhibitory subunit (gamma) of the enzyme. Since the larger (alpha') and smaller (beta) immunoreactive polypeptides could be completely separated from the alpha polypeptide and from each other, yet still retain the ability to be activated by histone or transducin, the data suggest that only a single species of polypeptide-inhibitor complex (e.g. alpha' gamma, alpha gamma, or beta gamma) was required for histone or transducin:GTP activation."
https://openalex.org/W1533088771,"A simple procedure is described for the preparation of photosystem I (PSI) particles from Triton X-100-solubilized thylakoid membranes of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus 6301. The purified PSI complex contained the full complement of antenna chlorophylls, 130 +/- 5/P700, displayed the electron paramagnetic resonance signals characteristic of iron-sulfur centers X, A, and B, and had a protein/chlorophyll ratio of 2.9. Determination of the polypeptide composition, utilizing a uniformly 14C-labeled complex, showed that it contained polypeptides of 70, 18, 17.7, 16, and 10 kDa, in a molar ratio of 4.0:0.7:1.0:0.5:1.6. The relative amount of the lower molecular weight polypeptides showed progressive decrease with increase in Triton X-100 concentration and time of exposure to detergent. Consequently, it is proposed that in vivo the composition of the complex is [70 kDa]4 [18 kDa]1 [17.7 kDa]1 [16 kDa]1 [10 kDa]2. Relative to 130 mol of chlorophyll a, the PSI complex contained 16 mol of carotenoids, 13.7 +/- 1.0 g atoms of Fe, and 12.2 +/- 1.1 g atoms of labile sulfide. The properties of complexes fully depleted of the low-molecular weight polypeptides by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate or with proteinase K are also described."
https://openalex.org/W2060871332,SV40-transformed simian cells that permit temperature-dependent regulation of vector DNA replication were isolated and characterized. These cell lines (ts COS cells) produce high levels of thermolabile large T antigen under the transcriptional control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. The ts COS cell lines can complement SV40 A gene mutants and support replication of SV40-origin containing vectors at 33 degrees C but not at 40 degrees C. It should now be possible to regulate the copy number of transfected plasmid DNA's and also maintain selectable vector sequences either as integrated DNA or as autonomously replicating episomes by modulating T antigen activity in ts COS cells.
https://openalex.org/W1483532109,"When treated with formaldehyde, serum albumin is known to be taken up and degraded by sinusoidal liver cells via adsorptive endocytosis. The present study aimed at characterization and identification of the membrane-associated receptor on rat sinusoidal liver cells. Kinetic studies of binding of 125I-labeled formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (125I-f-Alb) with the membranes of sinusoidal liver cells demonstrated the presence of specific, high-affinity, saturable membrane-bound receptors with an apparent Kd = 8 micrograms of f-Alb/ml and the optimal pH at around 8.0. The 125I-f-Alb binding to the membranes was not inhibited by either native albumin, asialofetuin, methylamine-treated alpha 2-macroglobulin, mannan, or immune complexes. The binding process exhibited independence of calcium and susceptibility both to heat treatment and to destruction by proteases. The binding was inhibited by concanavalin A and the inhibition was effectively reversed by the presence of alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, a haptenic inhibitor for this lectin, indicating the glycoprotein nature of the receptor. The binding protein was extracted from the membrane preparations with octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and immunoprecipitated by anti-ligand antibody as a complex with the ligand. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate revealed two polypeptide chains with molecular weights of approximately 53,000 and 30,000, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1600572106,"During the initial pairing events in the transfer of a strand from a linear duplex to a homologous single-stranded circular DNA by the recA and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins of Escherichia coli, two types of structure are formed that are distinguishable by their stability in the presence of protein denaturants. One type which is resistant to 5.2 M guanidinium chloride is most likely a D-loop that depends only on heteroduplex base pairing for its stability. These D-loops form rapidly when the ends of the linear duplex are homologous with the single-stranded DNA but do not form when the ends are heterologous. The second type appears to require protein, in addition to base pairing, for stability since it is rapidly dissociated by treatment with 5.2 M guanidinium chloride. These unstable structures form even when the ends of the duplex are not homologous with the circular single-stranded DNA. The stability and topological properties of the stable and unstable structures are consistent with those of plectonemic and paranemic joints, respectively (Bianchi, M., Das Gupta, C., and Radding, C. M. (1983) Cell 34, 931-939). The plectonemic joints can be generated in situ from paranemic joints by the addition of a restriction enzyme that cleaves in the region of homology, thus producing free homologous ends. Omission of single-stranded DNA-binding protein results in a large decrease in the rate of formation of both paranemic and plectonemic joints."
https://openalex.org/W1600603285,A series of plasmids containing different segments of the v-abl oncogene have been constructed to express different portions of the v- abl protein in bacteria. The tyrosine kinase activity of these proteins was determined by an in vitro assay employing histones or angiotensin II as substrates for the v-abl-encoded tyrosine kinase. These experiments show that the 5'-1.2 kilobases of v-abl is necessary and sufficient to produce an active tyrosine kinase which is functional as a monomeric soluble protein. The kinase-coding region corresponds to the minimal region of v-abl required for the transformation of fibroblasts. The kinase-coding region also coincides with the conserved protein sequences which are found in other tyrosine kinases. A compact domain of the v-abl protein including this kinase-coding region can accumulate to high levels in bacteria. The C-terminal region of the v- abl protein is not needed for the kinase activity and is rapidly degraded in bacteria.
https://openalex.org/W1635379617,"Electron paramagnetic resonance absorption spectrum of ferric cytochrome c peroxidase exhibited a mixture of high- and low-spin compounds. The principal values and the eigenvectors of the g-tensor for the low-spin species were determined by single-crystal EPR spectroscopy at 77 K. The powder EPR spectra of the peroxide compound, Compound ES, were measured at S-, X-, and Q-band microwave frequencies. Careful examination at 77 K showed a narrow free radical-like signal at g = 2.004 with hyperfine structures accompanied by a broad signal spreading on both low- and high-field sides. Single-crystal EPR analyses of Compound ES clearly demonstrated that there exist at least two different radical species: one is isotropic with hyperfine structure at g = 2.004 and the other exhibits an axially symmetric signal at 5 K and broad signal centered at g = 2.004 at 77 K, respectively. The principal values and the eigenvectors of the g-tensor for the axially symmetric signal were determined: g(parallel) = 2.034 and g(perpendicular) = 2.006, 1.999. The orientation of the unique axis (g(parallel)) was found to be identical to that of the heme normal. A new radical signal with complicated hyperfine structures in the g = 2.004 region was observed upon illumination of Compound ES at both 5 and 77 K. The photoinduced species grew effectively by the illumination light around 500 nm. On warming to -80 degrees C, the photoinduced signal was reversibly brought back to the original radical species of Compound ES via an intermediate species. From these results, we have proposed the possible sites for the free radical centers in Compound ES."
https://openalex.org/W2009232246,"Crithidia fasciculata, a nonpathogenic relative of the leishmanial and trypanosomal pathogens of humans and animals, showed a 3'-ribonucleotidase activity similar to that in Leishmania donovani. The level of 3'-nucleotidase activity in Crithidia was regulated by the availability of purines in the culture medium. Specifically, organisms obtained from culture medium depleted of purines contained elevated levels of enzyme activity compared to those grown in complete medium. The 3'-nucleotidase, located at the cell surface, may serve as a first step in purine salvage for these protozoa, which are unable to synthesize the purine ring de novo."
https://openalex.org/W1599380410,"In order to define the DNA sequence requirements for rho-dependent transcription termination, we have constructed and analyzed two classes of mutants affecting the cro-tR1 region of phage lambda: one class contains progressively larger deletions in the region upstream of the rho-dependent terminator tR1, and the other consists of small insertions or deletions generated by the linker scanning procedure. We show that rho-dependent termination at lambda tR1 in vitro requires contribution from sequences far upstream of the sites of termination. No single linker scanning mutant completely abolishes transcription termination, indicating that there exists no unique sequence that serves as an obligatory rho utilization site. Our results suggest that rho can interact with a large portion of the RNA transcript, including sequences that would be translated in vivo. Moreover, rho action appears to require a minimal transcript length, about 150-190 nucleotides for the tR1 termination sites. We also examine the effect of the auxiliary transcription factor NusA on transcription of these mutants, and we provide support for the proposal that specific effects of NusA on transcription termination require a sequence known as boxA (Olson, E.R., Flamm, E.L., and Friedman, D.I. (1982) Cell 31, 61-70)."
https://openalex.org/W1545759261,"The iron-controlled fepA and fes-entF transcripts from the Escherichia coli enterobactin gene complex are expressed divergently from a limited genetic region, thereby suggesting the existence of a single, possibly overlapping promoter junction for these genes. The nucleotide sequence of a 1,997-base pair HpaI fragment specific for this genetic region allowed for the identification of an 1,122-base pair open reading frame as the previously uncharacterized fes gene. Its product, Fes (approximately Mr 42,573) plays an essential but as yet ambiguous role in the release of ferric iron from the ligand. An additional small open reading frame of 216 nucleotides (encoding a potential product of calculated Mr 8,271) was also identified between fes and entF. A portion of the remaining nucleotide sequence defined a 320-base pair control region for both the fepA and fes-entF messages. Primer extension analyses placed the major in vivo transcription initiation sites to within 18 nucleotides of one another, thereby revealing a novel, extensively overlapping bidirectional promoter as well as long dual leader transcripts. This promoter region contains multiple overlapping nucleotide stretches which show strong homology to the consensus Fur repressor-binding sequence, forms of which are found in all E. coli iron-regulated promoters characterized to date."
https://openalex.org/W1555122234,"Chemically modified proteins such as acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) and formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (f-Alb) infused intravenously are known to undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis by sinusoidal liver cells, major intravascular scavenger cells in vivo. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether the endocytic uptake of acetyl-LDL and f-Alb is mediated by the same receptor or not. Experiments on the binding of 125I-acetyl-LDL to isolated rat liver sinusoidal cells revealed the presence of a specific, high-affinity, saturable, membrane-associated receptor with an apparent Kd = 7 micrograms of the ligand at 0 degrees C. Unlabeled acetyl-LDL effectively inhibited 125I-f-Alb binding to the cells. By contrast, the binding of 125I-acetyl-LDL to the cells was affected neither by unlabeled f-Alb nor by the antibody raised against the f-Alb receptor. These results indicate that the scavenger receptors for these two ligands are distinct from each other but similarly sensitive to polyanionic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1498121949,"The amino acid sequence of the ubiquinone binding protein (QP-C) in the cytochrome bc1 region of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain was determined by analysis of peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage and staphylococcal protease digestion of succinylated derivatives. It was found to consist of 110 amino acid residues and its amino terminus to be blocked by an acetyl group, as determined by mass spectrometry of the amino-terminal peptide and a comparison with peptides chemically synthesized on high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of this ubiquinone binding protein including the acetyl group was calculated to be 13,389. The predicted secondary structure of QP-C has alpha-helical content of about 50% and QP-C was classified as an all-alpha or alpha + beta protein. This is the first report describing the amino acid sequence of the ubiquinone binding protein. A comparison of this sequence with that of the 14-kDa subunit of the yeast ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex from the nucleotide sequence showed these two sequences to be quite similar."
https://openalex.org/W1592552223,"Neurotensin binding sites in rat brain synaptic membranes were specifically and covalently labeled by two methods. In the first, a photoreactive and highly radioactive analogue of neurotensin, 125I-labeled azidobenzoyl[Trp11]neurotensin, was synthesized and used to photoaffinity label neurotensin receptors. In the second, the reversible association between neurotensin receptors and 125I-labeled[Trp11]neurotensin, a radioactive but nonphotoreactive analogue of neurotensin, was made irreversible by means of disuccinimidyl suberate, a bifunctional cross-linking reagent. Analysis of synaptic membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed that using both methods the same two protein bands with apparent molecular weights of 49,000 and 51,000 were specifically labeled. Identical results were obtained with or without reduction of the photolabeled membranes by beta-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis. Variation of the ligand concentration did not modify the relative labeling intensities of the two bands, indicating that the high- and low-affinity neurotensin binding sites previously detected in rat brain synaptic membranes have similar molecular structures. These results indicate that neurotensin receptors in rat brain may be composed of two different protein subunits with similar molecular weight of about 50,000, that are linked together by noncovalent bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1550131933,"Treatment of an end-labeled DNA restriction fragment with the nonprotein chromophore of neocarzinostatin induced lesions which, after treatment with endonuclease IV or putrescine, were expressed as site-specific double-strand breaks. Analysis of the termini at cleavage sites in each strand showed that the neocarzinostatin-induced lesions consisted of an apurinic/apyrimidinic site plus a closely opposed break in the complementary strand. The break always occurred opposite the base two positions upstream from the apurinic/apyrimidinic site and had the 3′-phosphate and 5′-aldehyde termini characteristic of neocarzinostatin-induced breaks. This positioning suggests that neocarzinostatin simultaneously attacks two DNA sugars on opposite edges of the minor groove. The sequence specificity for formation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites with closely opposed breaks reflected that of neocarzinostatin-induced mutagenesis. The potent mutagenicity of these lesions may be attributable to the presence of closely opposed damage in both DNA strands."

https://openalex.org/W1581317797,"Secretory vesicles from the neurohypophysis have a transmembrane electron carrier very similar to that found in adrenal medullary chromaffin granules. Two different tests show that ascorbic acid contained in the vesicles will reduce an external electron acceptor. First, reduction of cytochrome c or ferricyanide in the medium by a neurosecretory vesicle suspension can be followed spectrophotometrically. Second, the membrane potential (inside positive) generated by electron transfer can be monitored using the membrane potential-sensitive optical probe Oxonol VI. As in chromaffin granules, this electron transfer is probably mediated by cytochrome b561. It may function to regenerate internal ascorbic acid and to provide reducing equivalents needed by the intravesicular amidating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1589101447,"Exposure of A-431 cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) results in a rapid enhancement (approximately 10-fold) of cytosolic serine protein kinase activity. The increase in serine kinase activity may be detected using a number of peptide and protein substrates. Enhancement of kinase activity occurs within 1 min of exposure of the cells to EGF and reaches a maximum in 5 min. Similar results were obtained with a variety of cell lines. We have partially purified the EGF-activated kinase from A-431 cells. It has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa by gel filtration. One distinguishing property of the enzyme is its sensitivity to inhibition by micromolar quantities of polyarginine; polylysine has no effect. The EGF-activated kinase is unaffected by cyclic nucleotides, Ca2+/calmodulin, Ca2+/diolein/phosphatidylserine, or heparin. The enhancement of cytosolic serine kinase activity in A-431 cells appears to be an early event in cell activation by a number of biological response modifiers including EGF, bradykinin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and histamine."
https://openalex.org/W1527149838,"A membrane-associated receptor involved in a specific uptake of formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (f-Alb) was purified from rat livers by Triton X-100 solubilization of a 105,000 X g membrane preparation and affinity chromatography on an f-Alb-Sepharose column. The purified receptor exhibited Mr = 125,000, consisting of two noncovalently linked glycoprotein components with Mr = 53,000 and Mr = 30,000, respectively. Incubation of 125I-receptor with f-Alb, but not with native albumin, resulted in a marked shift of pI value from 5.9 to 5.1, reflecting the presence of a specific ligand-receptor interaction. The receptor incorporated into liposomes displayed a saturable binding to 125I-f-Alb and the binding was effectively replaced by the presence of unlabeled f-Alb, with binding parameters being similar to those obtained from 125I-f-Alb binding to the sinusoidal liver cell membrane (Horiuchi, S., Takata, K., and Morino, Y. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 475-481). Reaction of anti-f-Alb receptor antibody with extracts of sinusoidal cells resulted in a specific precipitation of two proteins whose molecular weights were identical to those for the purified receptor. The anti-receptor IgG fraction effectively blocked 125I-f-Alb binding to the sinusoidal cell membranes. These results indicate that the purified protein represents the membrane-associated receptor which is presumably involved in a specific uptake of this ligand from the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1577142257,"Hepatocytes from rats deprived of food for 48 h synthesized glucose and urea from glutamine at a rate which, at pH 7.3, was markedly stimulated (175-250%) by dibutyryl cAMP, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine, in agreement with previous investigators. These effectors also stimulated respiration, elevating ATP production by the amount required for the increase in glucose and urea synthesis. Both the basal and stimulated rates were strongly pH dependent with maxima in the region of pH 7.2-7.6 (urea synthesis) and 7.2-7.5 (glucose synthesis) and declined rapidly on either side of these pH values. The inhibitions at acid and alkaline pH were neither due to lack of energy nor to limitation in glutamine uptake. The intracellular concentrations of aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine were lower at pH 6.7 than at pH 7.3 and were differently affected by dibutyryl cAMP and phenylephrine at the two pH values investigated. When calcium was omitted from the suspending medium, the basal rates of glucose and urea production were decreased as was stimulation by the effectors, phenylephrine completely, and the others partially. The stimulations by phenylephrine and dibutyryl cAMP were additive under all conditions tested. The pattern of metabolite changes indicates that although both effectors stimulated glutaminase and increased supply of aspartate to the argininosuccinate synthetase, dibutyryl cAMP gave greater activation of glutaminase whereas the adrenergic agonists gave greater stimulation of later steps on the biosynthetic pathways. It may be physiologically important than at acid pH both ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis are severely suppressed and cannot be effectively stimulated by the major hormonal regulators of these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1503874006,"Abstract Stimulation of the CD3-T cell antigen receptor complex on T lymphocytes results in a rapid rise in intracellular calcium from both intra- and extracellular sources. The former is thought to be released from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to inositol trisphosphate, while the latter enters the cells through a membrane potential-sensitive transporter (Oettgen, H. C., Terhorst, C., Cantley, L. C., and Rosoff, P. M. (1985) Cell 40, 583-590). In this report we show that the stilbene disulfonate, DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), inhibited the ability of monoclonal anti-CD3 complex antibodies to stimulate an influx of calcium in the human T lymphocyte cell line, Jurkat. DIDS had no effect on either antibody binding to the receptor or receptor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover. The Ki was approximately 25 microM in the presence of extracellular Cl- and 10 microM when labeling was performed in the absence of Cl-, suggesting that DIDS was competing with Cl- for binding to the cell membrane. The reduced form of DIDS, dihydroDIDS, was only 50% as effective as DIDS itself, and the monoisothiocyanate stilbene, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyantostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, was totally ineffective, even to concentrations of 0.750 mM. Removal of extracellular Cl- also inhibited the antibody-stimulated influx of calcium. These data suggest that the function of the CD3-T cell receptor-activated calcium channel/transporter may be dependent on or regulated by extracellular Cl-."
https://openalex.org/W1503741798,"Two forms of cytochrome c-specific methyltransferases from Euglena gracilis were purified approximately 100- and 50-fold, respectively, using DEAE-cellulose and gel-filtration chromatography. The methylation product of enzyme I was identified as S-methylmethionine and that of enzyme II as NG-monomethylarginine. Both enzymes were located in the cytosol and exhibit maximum activity at pH 7.0. Among the various proteins tested as substrates, the enzymes were highly specific toward cytochrome c. Various types of histones, in particular, were not modified by either enzyme. The molecular weights of enzyme I and II were 28,000 and 36,000, respectively. Various S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine analogs were tested for their inhibitory activity toward the enzymes. Only the D- and L-isomers of S-adenosylhomocysteine and sinefungin were significantly inhibitory. The Ki values for S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine were 8.13 X 10(-6) and 1.17 X 10(-5) M for enzyme I and II, respectively. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed the methylation site of enzyme I to be the methionine residue at position 65 while that of enzyme II to be the arginine residue at position 38. The methylation of either methionine or arginine residues by enzyme I and II, respectively, lowers the isoelectric point (pI) of cytochrome c: 9.23, 9.33, and 10.06 for S-methylmethionine-, NG-monomethylarginine-modified, and unmodified cytochrome c, respectively."

The enhanced cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in hypothyroid membranes was nearly normalized by incubation with a 10-fold excess of cGMP. Preincubation of hypothyroid adipocytes with cGMP also restored to normal the blunted lipolytic response to micromolar concentrations of epinephrine. DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of detergent-solubilized membrane-bound cAMP phosphodiesterase showed a 2.5-fold enhancement in hypothyroid membranes of a form of the enzyme that was completely inhibited by cGMP; the enzymatic elution profiles of the soluble fractions showed no difference between normal and hypothyroid fat pads. The results suggest a possible regulatory role of cGMP in adipocytes in the hypothyroid state."

https://openalex.org/W1531069769,"We investigated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate metabolism in S49 mouse T-lymphoma cells synchronized in different phases of the cell cycle. S49 wild-type cultures enriched for G1 phase cells by exposure to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) for 24 h had lower dCTP and dTTP pools but equivalent or increased pools of dATP and dGTP when compared with exponentially growing wild-type cells. Release from Bt2cAMP arrest resulted in a maximum enrichment of S phase occurring 24 h after removal of the Bt2cAMP, and was accompanied by an increase in dCTP and dTTP levels that persisted in colcemid-treated (G2/M phase enriched) cultures. Ribonucleotide reductase activity in permeabilized cells was low in G1 arrested cells, increased in S phase enriched cultures and further increased in G2/M enriched cultures. In cell lines heterozygous for mutations in the allosteric binding sites on the M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, the deoxyribonucleotide pools in S phase enriched cultures were larger than in wild-type S49 cells, suggesting that feedback inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase is an important mechanism limiting the size of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools. The M1 and M2 subunits of ribonucleotide reductase from wild-type S49 cells were identified on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, but showed no significant change in intensity during the cell cycle. These data are consistent with allosteric inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase during the G1 phase of the cycle and release of this inhibition during S phase. They suggest that the increase in ribonucleotide reductase activity observed in permeabilized S phase-enriched cultures may not be the result of increased synthesis of either the M1 or M2 subunit of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1508249917,"Activation of in vitro transcription of otherwise inert DNA sequences by purified yeast RNA polymerase II has been observed following the introduction in closed DNA domains of fragments of various origin. This enhancer-like effect on the in vitro transcriptional capacity is only detected in negatively supercoiled DNA domains and is characterized for each chimaeric plasmid by the superhelical density (- sigma) at which a sharp transition toward activation takes place. We have analyzed the topological state (as defined by localization and evaluation of the relative occurrence of secondary structures sensitive to S1 endonuclease) of the activated closed domains as a function of the conditions that determine the transcriptional enhancer effect, i.e. superhelical density, size, and nature of the components of the domains. We observe that variations in transcriptional capacity coincide with a defined pattern of secondary structures. These observations support a cause-effect relation between topology and regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1628306305,"A library of Bacillus subtilis DNA in lambda Charon 4A (Ferrari, E., Henner, D.J., and Hoch, J.A. (1981) J. Bacteriol. 146, 430-432) was screened by an immunological procedure for DNA sequences encoding aspartokinase II of B. subtilis, an enzyme composed of two nonidentical subunits arranged in an alpha 2 beta 2 structure (Moir, D., and Paulus, H. (1977a) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4648-4654). A recombinant bacteriophage was identified that harbored an 18-kilobase B. subtilis DNA fragment containing the coding sequences for both aspartokinase subunits. The coding sequence for aspartokinase II was subcloned into bacterial plasmids. In response to transformation with the recombinant plasmids, Escherichia coli produced two polypeptides immunologically related to B. subtilis aspartokinase II with molecular weights (43,000 and 17,000) indistinguishable from those found in enzyme produced in B. subtilis. Peptide mapping by partial proteolysis confirmed the identity of the polypeptides produced by the transformed E. coli cells with the B. subtilis aspartokinase II subunits. The size of the cloned B. subtilis DNA fragment could be reduced to 2.9 kilobases by cleavage with PstI restriction endonuclease without affecting its ability to direct the synthesis of complete aspartokinase II subunits, irrespective of its orientation in the plasmid vector. Further subdivision by cleavage with BamHI restriction endonuclease resulted in the production of truncated aspartokinase subunits, each shortened by the same extent. This suggested that a single DNA sequence encoded both aspartokinase subunits and provided an explanation for the earlier observation that the smaller beta subunit of aspartokinase II was highly homologous or identical with the carboxyl-terminal portion of the alpha subunit (Moir, D., and Paulus, H. (1977b) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4655-4661). A map of the gene for B. subtilis aspartokinase II is proposed in which the coding sequence for the smaller beta subunit overlaps in the same reading frame the promoter-distal portion of the coding sequence for the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1550055168,"The gene coding for the subunits of aspartokinase II from Bacillus subtilis has been identified in a B. subtilis DNA library and cloned in a bacterial plasmid (Bondaryk, R. P., and Paulus, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 585-591). The introduction of a plasmid carrying the aspartokinase II gene into an auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain lacking all three aspartokinases restored its ability to grow in the absence of L-lysine, L-threonine, and L-methionine. The B. subtilis aspartokinase gene could thus be functionally expressed in E. coli and substitute for the E. coli aspartokinases. Measurement of aspartokinase levels in extracts of aspartokinaseless E. coli transformed with the B. subtilis aspartokinase II gene revealed an enzyme level comparable to that in a genetically derepressed B. subtilis strain. In spite of the high level of aspartokinase, the growth of the transformed E. coli strain was severely inhibited by the addition of L-lysine but could be restored by also adding L-homoserine. This apparently paradoxical sensitivity to lysine was due to the allosteric inhibition of B. subtilis aspartokinase II by that amino acid, a property which was also observed in extracts of the transformed E. coli strain. The synthesis and degradation of the aspartokinase II subunits were measured by labeling experiments in E. coli transformed with the B. subtilis aspartokinase II gene. In contrast to exponentially growing cells of B. subtilis which contained equimolar amounts of the aspartokinase alpha and beta subunits, the transformed E. coli strain contained a 3-fold molar excess of beta subunit. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the disproportionate level of beta subunit was not due to more rapid turnover of alpha subunit, both subunits being quite stable, but presumably to a more rapid rate of synthesis. After the addition of rifampicin, the synthesis of alpha subunit declined much more rapidly than that of beta subunit, indicating that the two subunits were translated independently from mRNA species that differ in functional stability. In conjunction with the results described in the preceding paper which demonstrated that the aspartokinase subunits are encoded by a single DNA sequence, these observations imply that the alpha and beta subunits of B. subtilis aspartokinase II are the products of in-phase overlapping genes."

The resultant hemepeptide (13-104)H is rather insoluble in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Analysis of the crystallographic model with the terminal segment removed as well as qualitative spectral analysis of a transiently soluble sample of (13-104)H suggests that the hemepeptide retains little of the conformation of the native protein. By contrast, hemepeptide (1-80)H obtained by deletion of the carboxyl terminus is quite soluble at neutral pH. Spectral and hydrodynamic measurements suggest that the heme is encapsulated in an apolar cluster stabilized in part by axial ligation of the heme iron."

Biol. Chem. 256, 12849-12856). Upstream from the transcription initiation point, a collection of three families of highly conserved repeated sequences were identified, which may play a role in the expression of this gene. One of these families, repeat II, which has 10 members repeated in tandem, was recently observed to be strikingly similar in sequence to the Escherichia coli catabolite regulatory protein recognition site. In order to determine if these sequences can serve as catabolite regulatory protein binding sites, direct binding experiments were undertaken using a combination of the gel electrophoretic mobility alteration assay (Fried, M. G., and Crothers, D. M. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 141-158) and DNA footprinting. DNA sequence-specific and cyclic AMP-dependent binding of catabolite regulatory protein to several of the apparent recognition sites has been demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1526803880,Restriction enzyme digestions of large scale DNA preparations often do not go to completion. This is due to product inhibition by the newly generated ends of the digested DNA. The addition of exogenous proteins that bind tightly to the free ends of DNA or to single-stranded DNA will relieve this inhibition. We show that a considerable savings on restriction nucleases can be attained by the addition of RNA polymerase or T4 gene 32 protein in stoichiometric amounts to the newly produced DNA ends.
