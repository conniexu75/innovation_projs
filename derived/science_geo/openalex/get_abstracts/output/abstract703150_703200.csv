https://openalex.org/W4307656504,"Abstract ATP-hydrolysis-coupled actin polymerization is a fundamental mechanism of cellular force generation 1–3 . In turn, force 4,5 and actin filament (F-actin) nucleotide state 6 regulate actin dynamics by tuning F-actin’s engagement of actin-binding proteins through mechanisms that are unclear. Here we show that the nucleotide state of actin modulates F-actin structural transitions evoked by bending forces. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of ADP–F-actin and ADP-P i –F-actin with sufficient resolution to visualize bound solvent reveal intersubunit interfaces bridged by water molecules that could mediate filament lattice flexibility. Despite extensive ordered solvent differences in the nucleotide cleft, these structures feature nearly identical lattices and essentially indistinguishable protein backbone conformations that are unlikely to be discriminable by actin-binding proteins. We next introduce a machine-learning-enabled pipeline for reconstructing bent filaments, enabling us to visualize both continuous structural variability and side-chain-level detail. Bent F-actin structures reveal rearrangements at intersubunit interfaces characterized by substantial alterations of helical twist and deformations in individual protomers, transitions that are distinct in ADP–F-actin and ADP-P i –F-actin. This suggests that phosphate rigidifies actin subunits to alter the bending structural landscape of F-actin. As bending forces evoke nucleotide-state dependent conformational transitions of sufficient magnitude to be detected by actin-binding proteins, we propose that actin nucleotide state can serve as a co-regulator of F-actin mechanical regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4307839767,"Abstract The vertebrate adaptive immune system modifies the genome of individual B cells to encode antibodies that bind particular antigens 1 . In most mammals, antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains that are generated sequentially by recombination of V, D (for heavy chains), J and C gene segments. Each chain contains three complementarity-determining regions (CDR1–CDR3), which contribute to antigen specificity. Certain heavy and light chains are preferred for particular antigens 2–22 . Here we consider pairs of B cells that share the same heavy chain V gene and CDRH3 amino acid sequence and were isolated from different donors, also known as public clonotypes 23,24 . We show that for naive antibodies (those not yet adapted to antigens), the probability that they use the same light chain V gene is around 10%, whereas for memory (functional) antibodies, it is around 80%, even if only one cell per clonotype is used. This property of functional antibodies is a phenomenon that we call light chain coherence. We also observe this phenomenon when similar heavy chains recur within a donor. Thus, although naive antibodies seem to recur by chance, the recurrence of functional antibodies reveals surprising constraint and determinism in the processes of V(D)J recombination and immune selection. For most functional antibodies, the heavy chain determines the light chain."
https://openalex.org/W4308485621,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of signalling receptors, as well as important drug targets, are known to activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)—a master regulator of cell proliferation and survival1. However, the precise mechanisms that underlie GPCR-mediated ERK activation are not clearly understood2–4. Here we investigated how spatially organized β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) signalling controls ERK. Using subcellularly targeted ERK activity biosensors5, we show that β2AR signalling induces ERK activity at endosomes, but not at the plasma membrane. This pool of ERK activity depends on active, endosome-localized Gαs and requires ligand-stimulated β2AR endocytosis. We further identify an endosomally localized non-canonical signalling axis comprising Gαs, RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, resulting in endosomal ERK activity that propagates into the nucleus. Selective inhibition of endosomal β2AR and Gαs signalling blunted nuclear ERK activity, MYC gene expression and cell proliferation. These results reveal a non-canonical mechanism for the spatial regulation of ERK through GPCR signalling and identify a functionally important endosomal signalling axis. β2-adrenergic receptor(β2AR) signalling induces ERK activity at endosomes, but not at the plasma membrane, and this activity is dependent on active, endosome-localized Gαs and requires ligand-stimulated β2AR endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W4307313713,"At the time of writing, nearly one hundred published studies demonstrate that beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation are negatively associated with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. These correlational findings are often interpreted as evidence that beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation are exogenous factors that shape human behavior, such as forgoing vaccination. This interpretation has motivated researchers to develop methods for ""prebunking,"" ""debunking,"" or otherwise limiting the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation online. However, the robust literatures on conspiracy theory beliefs, health behaviors, and media effects lead us to question whether beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation should be treated as exogenous to vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Employing U.S. survey data (n = 2,065) from July 2021, we show that beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation are not only related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal, but also strongly associated with the same psychological, social, and political motivations theorized to drive COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal. These findings suggest that beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation might not always be an exogenous cause, but rather a manifestation of the same factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy and refusal. We conclude by encouraging researchers to carefully consider modeling choices and imploring practitioners to refocus on the worldviews, personality traits, and political orientations that underlie both health-related behaviors and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation."
https://openalex.org/W4307313343,"The time-lapse system is a non-invasive method that enables a continuous evaluation through embryo development. Here, we examined the association between the morphokinetics of the developing embryo and the transcriptomic profile of the formed blastocysts. Bovine oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro; then, the putative zygotes were cultured in an incubator equipped with a time-lapse system. Based on the first-cleavage pattern, embryos were categorized as normal or abnormal (68.5±2.2 and 31.6±2.3%, respectively; P<0.001). A cleaved embryo was defined as normal when it first cleaved into two equal blastomeres; it was classified as synchronous or asynchronous according to its subsequent cleavages. An abnormal pattern was defined as direct, unequal, or reverse cleavage. Direct cleavage was classified as division from one cell directly into three or more blastomeres; unequal cleavage was classified as division that resulted in asymmetrically sized blastomeres; and reverse cleavage of the first division was classified as reduced number of blastomeres from two to one. Of the normally cleaving embryos, 60.2±3.1% underwent synchronous cleavage into 4, 8, and 16 blastomeres, and 39.7±3.1% cleaved asynchronously (P<0.001). The blastocyte formation rate was lower for the synchronously vs. the asynchronously cleaved embryos (P<0.03). The abnormally cleaved embryos showed low competence to develop to blastocysts, relative to the normally cleaved embryos (P<0.001). Microarray analysis revealed 895 and 643 differentially expressed genes in blastocysts that developed from synchronously and asynchronously cleaved embryos, respectively, relative to those that developed from directly cleaved embryos. The genes were related to the cell cycle, cell differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis. About 180 differentially expressed genes were found between the synchronously vs. the asynchronously cleaved embryos, related to metabolism and the apoptosis mechanism. We provide the first evidence indicating that an embryo's morphokinetics is associated with the transcriptome profile of the derived blastocyst, which might be practically relevant for the embryo transfer program."
https://openalex.org/W4307313453,"A great deal of understanding can be gleaned from direct observation of organismal growth, development, and behavior. However, direct observation can be time consuming and influence the organism through unintentional stimuli. Additionally, video capturing equipment can often be prohibitively expensive, difficult to modify to one’s specific needs, and may come with unnecessary features. Here, we describe PiSpy, a low-cost, automated video acquisition platform that uses a Raspberry Pi computer and camera to record video or images at specified time intervals or when externally triggered. All settings and controls, such as programmable light cycling, are accessible to users with no programming experience through an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Importantly, the entire PiSpy system can be assembled for less than $100 using laser-cut and 3D-printed components. We demonstrate the broad applications and flexibility of PiSpy across a range of model and non-model organisms. Designs, instructions, and code can be accessed through an online repository, where a global community of PiSpy users can also contribute their own unique customizations and help grow the community of open-source research solutions."
https://openalex.org/W4307309188,"Pachycetus paulsonii , Pachycetus wardii , and Antaecetus aithai are middle Eocene archaeocete whales found in Europe, North America, and Africa, respectively. The three are placed in the new basilosaurid subfamily Pachycetinae. Antaecetus is a new genus known from Egypt and Morocco, and the only pachycetine known from a substantial postcranial skeleton. The skull of A . aithai described here resembles that of Saghacetus osiris in size, but lacks the narrowly constricted rostrum of Saghacetus . Antaecetus is smaller than Pachycetus and its teeth are more gracile. Upper premolars differ in having two rather than three accessory cusps flanking the principal cusp. Pachycetines differ from dorudontines in having elongated posterior thoracic and lumbar vertebrae like those of Basilosaurus , but differ from basilosaurines and from dorudontines in having conspicuously pachyosteosclerotic vertebrae with dense and thickly laminated cortical bone surrounding a cancellous core. Pachycetinae are also distinctive in having transverse processes on lumbar vertebrae nearly as long anteroposteriorly as the corresponding centrum. We infer from their pachyosteosclerotic vertebrae that pachycetines were probably sirenian-like slow swimmers living in shallow coastal seas and feeding on passing fish and mobile invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W4307313464,"The objective of this study was to determine the rates of virological failure (VF) and HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) amongst adolescents on antiretroviral Therapy (ART). A retrospectively designed study was conducted in 10 healthcare centers for adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) in the two main cities of Cameroon (Yaoundé and Douala), from November 2018 to May 2019. Sociodemographic, clinical, therapeutic and laboratory parameters were collected from medical records. All enrolled ALHIV had viral load (VL) measurements following the national guidelines. All patients with a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml were called to perform genotyping tests. The chi-square test was used to determine the factors associated with VF. Out of the 1316 medical records of ALHIV, we included 1083 ALHIV having a VL result. Among them, 276 (25.5%) were experiencing VF, and VF was significantly higher in ALHIV with suboptimal adherence (p&lt;0.001), older adolescents (p&lt;0.05), those who lived outside the city where they were receiving ART (p&lt;0.006), severely immunocompromised (p&lt;0.01) and started ART at infancy (p&lt;0.02). Among the 45/276 (16.3%) participants with an available genotyping resistance testing (GRT) result, the overall rate of HIVDR was 93.3% (42/45). The most common mutations were K103N (n = 21/42, 52.3%) resulting in high-level resistance to Efavirenz and Nevirapine, followed by M184V (n = 20/42, 47.6%) and thymidine analog mutations (n = 15/42, 35.7%) associated with high-level resistance to Lamivudine and Zidovudine respectively. The high rate of VF and HIVDR among ALHIV regularly followed in health facilities in Cameroon highlights the need to develop interventions adapted to an adolescent-centered approach to preserve future ART options."
https://openalex.org/W4307313584,"Lead (Pb) isotopes provide a complementary method to other provenance tools for tracking the origin and movement of humans and animals. The method is founded in the geographic distribution of Pb isotope ratios. However, unlike the Sr isotope method that is closely linked to the lithology of underlying rocks, Pb more closely reflects the tectonic regimes. This makes it particularly pertinent to use in Britain as there is major tectonic boundary (the Iapetus Suture) that runs between Berwick-upon-Tweed and the Solway Firth providing a compositional boundary in Pb isotope domains that approximates to the geographic areas of Scotland versus England and Wales. Modern pollution makes it difficult to use modern floral or faunal samples to characterize biosphere variation, and so we use geological datasets to define isoscape variation and present the first Pb isotope map of Britain. We have validated the use of these data form biosphere studies using well provenanced samples. Reference fields of diagnostic compositions, are created in μ-T space and these have been used in a test case to assess the geographic origins of Neolithic animals in Great Britain."
https://openalex.org/W4307313315,"Background Depression is the most common mental health problem that affects women during pregnancy and after child-birth. Postpartum depression, in particular, has both short and long-term effects on the lives of mothers and children. Women’s health is a current global concern, but postpartum depression is a neglected issue in the maternal continuum of care and is rarely addressed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess postpartum depression and associated factors in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 1 st to 30 th , 2021 in Gondar city. A cluster sampling technique was employed to select 794 postpartum women. Data were entered by EPI DATA version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for further analysis. The multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with postpartum depression. The adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval at a p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to declare the level of significance. Results A total of 794 women were included in the analysis, giving a response rate of 98.5%. The prevalence of postpartum depression was 17.25% (95% CI: 14.5, 20.2). Younger maternal age (AOR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.23, 5.85), low average monthly income (AOR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.24, 5.91), low decision-making power (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI: 1.31, 3.18), low husband/partner involvement in MNCH care service (AOR = 2.34, 95%CI: 1.44, 3.81), unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 3.16 95% CI: 1.77, 5.62), and experience of intimate partner violence (AOR = 3.13; 95% CI: 1.96, 4.99) were significantly associated with increased odds of postpartum depression. Conclusion In this study, nearly 1/5 th of the study participants had postpartum depression. Thus, it is important to integrate maternal mental health services with the existing maternal health care services. It is also crucial to advocate the need for husband’s involvement in MNCH care services and ensure women’s decision-making power in the household. Moreover, community-based sexual and reproductive health education would be better to reduce risk factors of postpartum depression."
https://openalex.org/W4307313472,"Chemical and physical restraints are associated with harm in older adults, but our understanding of their use during acute care hospitalizations is limited.To (1) describe restraint use during acute care hospitalizations of older adults at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels and (2) describe between-hospital variability in restraint use.Retrospective cohort study with a time series analysis.Acute care hospital inpatients, aged 65 years or older, who were discharged from one of four Alberta hospitals or six Ontario hospitals in Canada, between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020.We used autoregressive linear models with restricted cubic splines to compare proportions of chemical restraint (that is, psychotropic medications, namely antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and trazodone) and physical restraint (e.g., mittens) use immediately after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with pre-pandemic levels. We describe between-hospital variability in restraint use using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and median odds ratios (OR).We included 71,004 hospitalizations. Adjusted for the prevalence of dementia and psychotic disorders, chemical restraint use increased in Ontario hospitals from a pre-pandemic average of 27.1% to 30.8% (p<0.001) before returning to pre-pandemic levels within eight weeks. Physical restraint orders in Ontario increased from 5.9% to 8.3% (p = 0.012) and remained elevated at eight weeks. No significant changes in restraint use were observed in Alberta. There was moderate between-hospital variability in chemical restraint use (ICC 0.041 and median OR 1.43). Variability in physical restraint use was higher (ICC 0.11 and median OR 1.83).The COVID-19 pandemic impacted in-hospital use of chemical and physical restraints among older adults in Ontario but not Alberta. Substantial differences in chemical and physical restraint use by region and hospital suggests there are opportunities to improve best practices in geriatric care. Future research must support implementation of evidence-informed interventions that standardize appropriate restraint use."
https://openalex.org/W4307313725,"With the development of convolutional neural networks, impressive success has been achieved in remote sensing image super-resolution. However, the performance of super-resolution reconstruction is unsatisfactory due to the lack of details in remote sensing images when compared to natural images. Therefore, this paper presents a novel multiscale convolutional sparse coding network (MCSCN) to carry out the remote sensing images SR reconstruction with rich details. The MCSCN, which consists of a multiscale convolutional sparse coding module (MCSCM) with dictionary convolution units, can improve the extraction of high frequency features. We can obtain more plentiful feature information by combining multiple sizes of sparse features. Finally, a layer based on sub-pixel convolution that combines global and local features takes as the reconstruction block. The experimental results show that the MCSCN gains an advantage over several existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity."
https://openalex.org/W4307348134,"The black soldier fly (BSF) is becoming a novel farm animal. BSF larvae can be reared on different substrates. Their performance is important but highly variable and different models have been employed to analyze their growth, so far without considering that metabolic rates, growth, and biochemical composition of the larvae are interrelated. This work develops a dynamic model, which describes general growth patterns of BSF larvae and predicts observed variability in larval performances. The model was tested against data from literature, which combines kinetic growth data with measurements of lipid or dry weight content, and CO2 production. The model combines the kinetics of the logistic model with principles from differential energy budget models and considers key events in larval life history, moulting and metamorphosis. Larvae are compartmentised into structural biomass, storage lipids, and a pool of assimilates. Feed assimilation is considered the overall rate limiting process and is reduced in relation to larval weight by a logistic function. A second logistic function further reduces the specific growth rate of structural biomass, causes imbalance between and feed assimilation and growth rates, and leaves a surplus of assimilates to be stored as lipids. Fluxes between compartments consider cost of synthesis of structural biomass and lipids, as well as maintenance. When assimilation falls below maintenance needs, storage lipids are recycled. The model is able to describe growth and lipid contents of BSF larvae reared on chicken feed, growth of feed limited BSF larvae, as well as growth, dry weight content, and CO2 production of BSF larvae reared on different substrate qualities and moisture contents. The model may be used for the analysis of growth and performance of BSF larvae under variable rearing conditions. It can deepen the analyses of experimental data and provide insight into the causes of variability of larval performances."
https://openalex.org/W4307656494,"Characterizing how variation in the tempo and mode of evolution has structured the phenotypic diversity of extant species is a central goal of macroevolution1-3. However, studies are typically limited to a handful of traits4-6, providing incomplete information. We analyse morphological diversification in living birds, an ecologically diverse group7, documenting structural scales from 'pan-skeletal' proportions down to the localized three-dimensional shape changes of individual bones. We find substantial variation in evolutionary modes among avian subgroups and among skeletal parts, indicating widespread mosaicism and possible differences in the structure of the macroevolutionary landscape across Earth's main environments. Water-linked groups, especially Aequorlitornithes (waterbirds), have repeatedly explored a large portion of their total morphospace, emphasizing variation in body proportions and in the shape of bones close to the body core, which are functionally related to the mechanics of locomotion8. By contrast, landbirds (Inopinaves) evolved distinct, group-specific body forms early in the aftermath of the K-Pg and subsequently emphasized local shape variation, especially in the head and distal limb bones, which interact more directly with the environment. Passerines, which comprise more than half of all bird species, show a conservative evolutionary dynamic that resulted in low disparity across all skeletal parts. Evidence for early establishment of the morphospace of living birds is clear for some skeletal parts, including beaks and the combined skeletal morphology. However, we find little evidence for early partitioning of that morphospace, contrary to more specific predictions of 'niche-filling' models1,9. Nevertheless, early divergence among broad environmental types may have caused an early divergence of evolutionary modes, suggesting an important role for environmental divergence in structuring the radiation of crown-group birds."
https://openalex.org/W4307309199,"Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) by O-GlcNAc globally rise during pressure-overload hypertrophy (POH). However, a major knowledge gap exists on the specific proteins undergoing changes in O-GlcNAc levels during POH primarily because this PTM is low abundance and easily lost during standard mass spectrometry (MS) conditions used for protein identification. Methodologies have emerged to enrich samples for O-GlcNAcylated proteins prior to MS analysis. Accordingly, our goal was to identify the specific proteins undergoing changes in O-GlcNAc levels during POH. We used C57/Bl6 mice subjected to Sham or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to create POH. From the hearts, we labelled the O-GlcNAc moiety with tetramethylrhodamine azide (TAMRA) before sample enrichment by TAMRA immunoprecipitation (IP). We used LC-MS/MS to identify and quantify the captured putative O-GlcNAcylated proteins. We identified a total of 700 putative O-GlcNAcylated proteins in Sham and POH. Two hundred thirty-three of these proteins had significantly increased enrichment in POH over Sham suggesting higher O-GlcNAc levels whereas no proteins were significantly decreased by POH. We examined two MS identified metabolic enzymes, CPT1B and the PDH complex, to validate by immunoprecipitation. We corroborated increased O-GlcNAc levels during POH for CPT1B and the PDH complex. Enzyme activity assays suggests higher O-GlcNAcylation increases CPT1 activity and decreases PDH activity during POH. In summary, we generated the first comprehensive list of proteins with putative changes in O-GlcNAc levels during POH. Our results demonstrate the large number of potential proteins and cellular processes affected by O-GlcNAc and serve as a guide for testing specific O-GlcNAc-regulated mechanisms during POH."
https://openalex.org/W4307313245,"We aimed to examine the association of CSF tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) with conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. At baseline, there were a total of 129 participants with MCI in this study. The association of CSF TNFα levels with the incidence of dementia were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders. Individuals were categorized into groups based on the CSF TNFα tertiles. Compared to the low group (the reference group), the intermediate group progressed more rapidly to dementia [HR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.15–4.1); p = 0.016] after adjusting for other covariates. However, the high group did not progress faster than the low group [HR (95% CI) = 1.5 (0.79–2.8); p = 0.214]. Our study suggested a potential non-relationship between CSF TNFα levels and the risk of development of dementia among MCI older people."
https://openalex.org/W4307313699,"The gut microbiome is an important factor in human health and disease. While preliminary studies have found some evidence that physical activity is associated with gut microbiome richness, diversity, and composition, this relationship is not fully understood and has not been previously characterized in a large, population-based cohort. In this study, we estimated the association between several measures of physical activity and the gut microbiota in a cohort of 720 Wisconsin residents. Our sample had a mean age of 55 years (range: 18, 94), was 42% male, and 83% of participants self-identified as White. Gut microbial composition was assessed using gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA extracted from stool. We found that an increase of one standard deviation in weekly minutes spent in active transportation was associated with an increase in alpha diversity, particularly in Chao1’s richness (7.57, 95% CI: 2.55, 12.59) and Shannon’s diversity (0.04, 95% CI: 0.0008, 0.09). We identified interactions in the association between Inverse Simpson’s diversity and physical activity, wherein active transportation for individuals living in a rural environment was associated with additional increases in diversity (4.69, 95% CI: 1.64, 7.73). We also conducted several permutational ANOVAs (PERMANOVA) and negative binomial regression analyses to estimate the relationship between physical activity and microbiome composition. We found that being physically active and increased physical activity time were associated with increased abundance of bacteria in the family Erysipelotrichaceae. Active transportation was associated with increased abundance of bacteria in the genus Phascolarctobacterium , and decreased abundance of Clostridium . Minutes in active transportation was associated with a decreased abundance of the family Clostridiaceae."
https://openalex.org/W4307313882,"Aphasia, the loss of language ability following damage to the brain, is among the most disabling and common consequences of stroke. Subcortical stroke, occurring in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and/or deep white matter can result in aphasia, often characterized by word fluency, motor speech output, or sentence generation impairments. The link between greater lesion volume and acute aphasia is well documented, but the independent contributions of lesion location, cortical hypoperfusion, prior stroke, and white matter degeneration (leukoaraiosis) remain unclear, particularly in subcortical aphasia. Thus, we aimed to disentangle the contributions of each factor on language impairments in left hemisphere acute subcortical stroke survivors. Eighty patients with acute ischemic left hemisphere subcortical stroke (less than 10 days post-onset) participated. We manually traced acute lesions on diffusion-weighted scans and prior lesions on T2-weighted scans. Leukoaraiosis was rated on T2-weighted scans using the Fazekas et al. (1987) scale. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans were evaluated for hyperintense vessels in each vascular territory, providing an indirect measure of hypoperfusion in lieu of perfusion-weighted imaging. We found that language performance was negatively correlated with acute/total lesion volumes and greater damage to substructures of the deep white matter and basal ganglia. We conducted a LASSO regression that included all variables for which we found significant univariate relationships to language performance, plus nuisance regressors. Only total lesion volume was a significant predictor of global language impairment severity. Further examination of three participants with severe language impairments suggests that their deficits result from impairment in domain-general, rather than linguistic, processes. Given the variability in language deficits and imaging markers associated with such deficits, it seems likely that subcortical aphasia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with distinct causes across individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4307314196,"Advances in animal biologging technologies have greatly improved our understanding of animal movement and distribution, particularly for highly mobile species that travel across vast spatial scales. Assessing the accuracy of these devices is critical to drawing appropriate conclusions from resulting data. While understanding the vertical dimension of movements is key to assessing habitat use and behavior in aerial species, previous studies have primarily focused on assessing the accuracy of biologging devices in the horizontal plane with far less emphasis placed on the vertical plane. Here we use an Unaccompanied Aircraft System (UAS) outfitted with a laser altimeter to broadly assess the accuracy of altitude estimates of three commonly used avian biologging devices during three field trials: stationary flights, continuous horizontal movements, and continuous vertical movements. We found that the device measuring barometric pressure consistently provided the most accurate altitude estimates (mean error of 1.57m) and effectively captured finer-scale vertical movements. Conversely, devices that relied upon GPS triangulation to estimate altitude typically overestimated altitude during horizontal movements (mean error of 6.5m or 40.96m) and underestimated amplitude during vertical movements. Additional factors thought to impact device accuracy, including Horizontal- and Position- Dilution of Precision and the time intervals over which altitude estimates were assessed, did not have notable effects on results in our analyses. Reported accuracy values for different devices may be useful in future studies of aerial species' behavior relative to vertical obstacles such as wind turbines. Our results suggest that studies seeking to quantify altitude of aerial species should prioritize pressure-based measurements, which provide sufficient resolution for examining broad and some fine-scale behaviors. This work highlights the importance of considering and accounting for error in altitude measurements during avian studies relative to the scale of data needed to address particular scientific questions."
https://openalex.org/W4307313174,"Negative air ions (NAIs) being bioactive and negative charged molecules may confer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. We assessed the effect of NAIs on two inflammatory diseases in animal models including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute lung injury (ALI) and wound healing in diabetic rats. We used intra-tracheal infusion of LPS to induce ALI and made a full-thickness cutaneous wound in streptozotocin-induced diabetic female Wistar rats. We evaluated NAIs effects on reactive oxygen species amount, leukocyte infiltration, wound healing rate, western blot, and immunohistochemistry in the lungs of ALI and skin sections of wounds. Our data found NAIs exposed saline displayed higher antioxidant activity vs. non-exposed saline. NAIs exposure did not significantly affect arterial blood pressure and respiratory frequency in control and LPS treated groups. LPS increased leukocyte infiltration, caspase 3/Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase-mediated apoptosis formation and decreased Beclin-1/LC3-II-mediated autophagy in lungs. NAIs exposure conferred pulmonary protection by depressed leukocyte infiltration and caspase 3/Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase mediated apoptosis and enhanced LC3-II-mediated autophagy in LPS induced ALI. NAIs treatment resulted in a significantly accelerated wound closure rate, decreased erythrocyte accumulation and leukocyte infiltration mediated oxidative stress and inflammation, and upregulated expression of skin collagen, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and factor transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) vs non-treated group. Based on these results, it is suggested that NAIs conferred a protection through the upregulating LC3-II-dependent autophagy mechanism and downregulating leukocyte infiltration mediated inflammation and caspase 3/Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase signaling in the LPS-treated ALI and promoted diabetic wound healing through the enhancing skin collagen synthesis, VEGFR-2 and TGF-β1 pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4307313258,"Cacao is a globally important crop with a long history of domestication and selective breeding. Despite the increased use of elite clones by cacao farmers, worldwide plantations are established mainly using hybrid progeny material derived from heterozygous parents, therefore displaying high tree-to-tree variability. The deliberate development of hybrids from advanced inbred lines produced by successive generations of self-pollination has not yet been fully considered in cacao breeding. This is largely due to the self-incompatibility of the species, the long generation cycles (3-5 years) and the extensive trial areas needed to accomplish the endeavor. We propose a simple and accessible approach to develop inbred lines based on accelerating the buildup of homozygosity based on regular selfing assisted by genome-wide SNP genotyping. In this study we genotyped 90 clones from the Brazilian CEPEC´s germplasm collection and 49 inbred offspring of six S1 or S2 cacao families derived from self-pollinating clones CCN-51, PS-13.19, TSH-1188 and SIAL-169. A set of 3,380 SNPs distributed across the cacao genome were interrogated on the EMBRAPA multi-species 65k Infinium chip. The 90 cacao clones showed considerable variation in genome-wide SNP homozygosity (mean 0.727± 0.182) and 19 of them with homozygosity ≥90%. By assessing the increase in homozygosity across two generations of self-pollinations, SNP data revealed the wide variability in homozygosity within and between S1 and S2 families. Even in small families (<10 sibs), individuals were identified with up to ~1.5 standard deviations above the family mean homozygosity. From baseline homozygosities of 0.476 and 0.454, offspring with homozygosities of 0.862 and 0.879 were recovered for clones TSH-1188 and CCN-51 respectively, in only two generations of selfing (81-93% increase). SNP marker assisted monitoring and selection of inbred individuals can be a practical tool to optimize and accelerate the development of inbred lines of outbred tree species. This approach will allow a faster and more accurate exploitation of hybrid breeding strategies in cacao improvement programs and potentially in other perennial fruit and forest trees."
https://openalex.org/W4307313273,"Topoisomerases are nuclear enzymes that get to the bottom of topological troubles related with DNA all through a range of genetic procedures. More and more studies have shown that topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage plays crucial roles in tumor cell death and carcinogenesis. There is however still a lack of comprehensive multi-omics studies related to topoisomerase family genes from a pan-cancer perspective.In this study, a multiomics pan-cancer analysis of topoisomerase family genes was conducted by integrating over 10,000 multi-dimensional cancer genomic data across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 481 small molecule drug response data from cancer therapeutics response portal (CTRP) as well as normal tissue data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Finally, overall activity-level analyses of topoisomerase in pan-cancers were performed by gene set variation analysis (GSVA), together with differential expression, clinical relevancy, immune cell infiltration and regulation of cancer-related pathways.Dysregulated gene expression of topoisomerase family were related to genomic changes and abnormal epigenetic modifications. The expression levels of topoisomerase family genes could significantly impact cancer progression, intratumoral heterogeneity, alterations in the immunological condition and regulation of the cancer marker-related pathways, which in turn caused the differences in potential drugs sensitivity and the distinct prognosis of patients.It was anticipated that topoisomerase family genes would become novel prognostic biomarkers for cancer patients and provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4307313385,"In order to shed light on unmeasurable real-world phenomena, we investigate exemplarily the actual number of COVID-19 infections in Germany based on big data. The true occurrence of infections is not visible, since not every infected person is tested. This paper demonstrates that coronavirus-related search queries issued on Google can depict true infection levels appropriately. We find significant correlation between search volume and national as well as federal COVID-19 cases as reported by RKI. Additionally, we discover indications that the queries are indeed causal for infection levels. Finally, this approach can replicate varying dark figures throughout different periods of the pandemic and enables early insights into the true spread of future virus outbreaks. This is of high relevance for society in order to assess and understand the current situation during virus outbreaks and for decision-makers to take adequate and justifiable health measures."
https://openalex.org/W4307313476,"The purpose of this study is to explore two concepts: first, the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast the base pressure (β) and wall pressure (ω) originating from a suddenly expanded flow field at subsonic Mach numbers. Second, the implementation of Garson approach to determine the critical operating parameters affecting the suddenly expanded subsonic flow process in the subsonic range. In a MATLAB environment, a network model was constructed based on a multilayer perceptron with an input, hidden, and output layer. The network input parameters were the Mach number (M), nozzle pressure ratio (η), area ratio (α), length to diameter ratio (γ), micro jet control (ϵ), and duct location to length ratio (δ). The network output included two variables; base pressure (β) and wall pressure (ω). The ANN was trained and tested using the experimental data. The experimental results found that micro-jet controls were successful in increasing the base pressure for low Mach numbers and high nozzle pressure ratios. It was also found that the wall pressure was same for with and without micro jet control. The ANN predicted values agreed well with the experimental values, with average relative errors of less than 5.02% for base pressure and 6.71% for wall pressure. Additionally, with a relative significance of 32% and 43%, the nozzle pressure ratio and duct location to length ratio had the highest influence on the base pressure and wall pressure, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ANN model is capable of accurately predicting the pressure results, enabling theoretical foundation for research into pressure distribution in aerodynamic systems."
https://openalex.org/W4307313919,"Planimetry is a reliable method for detecting and monitoring plaque. Until now, this method has mainly been applied to conventional-camera images, which is difficult and time-consuming in relation to the entire dentition. Today, 3D-intraoral-scans are well suited for imaging the entire dentition and are therefore an efficient and feasible alternative. 3D-intraoral-scans have already proven successful for the quantification of plaque based on a plaque index. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate whether images from 3D-intraoral-scans are also suitable for valid planimetric plaque measurements and monitoring; intraoral-camera images served as a reference. Twenty subjects (27.5±1.2 years) were included. Plaque was disclosed at three different time points: habitual plaque (T1), after 72 h without oral hygiene (T2) and after subsequent tooth brushing (T3) and quantified using 3D-intraoral-scans and intraoral-camera images (intraoral-camera CS 1500, intraoral-scanner CS 3600; Carestream Dental, Germany). The percentage of the plaque-covered surface of the total surface area (P%) was determined with a software specially programmed for this purpose using images from 3D-intraoral-scans of the oral and vestibular surfaces of the Ramfjord teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41, and 44); the intraoral-camera images of the vestibular surfaces of 16 and 36 served as reference. P% from images of the 3D-intraoral-scan and the intraoral-camera revealed a very good correlation (r = 0.876; p ≤ 0.001); the Bland-Altmann analysis showed a good agreement with no proportional and a very minor systematic bias with slightly higher values from images of the 3D-intraoral-scan. Further, P% measurements of the images of the 3D-intraoral-scan were able to detect changes in plaque levels, showing a 47% (p ≤ 0.001) increase in P% from T1 to T2 and a 43% (p ≤ 0.001) decrease after toothbrushing (T3). Planimetry using images of the 3D-intraoral-scan seems to be a suitable tool for whole mouth planimetry to record and monitor dental plaque."
https://openalex.org/W4307348089,"Here, we aimed to identify and characterize genomic regions that differ between Groningen White Headed (GWH) breed and other cattle, and in particular to identify candidate genes associated with coat color and/or eye-protective phenotypes. Firstly, whole genome sequences of 170 animals from eight breeds were used to evaluate the genetic structure of the GWH in relation to other cattle breeds by carrying out principal components and model-based clustering analyses. Secondly, the candidate genomic regions were identified by integrating the findings from: a) a genome-wide association study using GWH, other white headed breeds (Hereford and Simmental), and breeds with a non-white headed phenotype (Dutch Friesian, Deep Red, Meuse-Rhine-Yssel, Dutch Belted, and Holstein Friesian); b) scans for specific signatures of selection in GWH cattle by comparison with four other Dutch traditional breeds (Dutch Friesian, Deep Red, Meuse-Rhine-Yssel and Dutch Belted) and the commercial Holstein Friesian; and c) detection of candidate genes identified via these approaches. The alignment of the filtered reads to the reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) resulted in a mean depth of coverage of 8.7X. After variant calling, the lowest number of breed-specific variants was detected in Holstein Friesian (148,213), and the largest in Deep Red (558,909). By integrating the results, we identified five genomic regions under selection on BTA4 (70.2–71.3 Mb), BTA5 (10.0–19.7 Mb), BTA20 (10.0–19.9 and 20.0–22.7 Mb), and BTA25 (0.5–9.2 Mb). These regions contain positional and functional candidate genes associated with retinal degeneration (e.g., CWC27 and CLUAP1 ), ultraviole t protection (e.g., ERCC8 ), and pigmentation (e.g. PDE4D ) which are probably associated with the GWH specific pigmentation and/or eye-protective phenotypes, e.g. Ambilateral Circumocular Pigmentation (ACOP). Our results will assist in characterizing the molecular basis of GWH phenotypes and the biological implications of its adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W4307348120,"This paper proposes that elastic potentials, which may be rigorously formulated using the negative Gibbs free energy or the complementary strain energy density, may be used as the yield surface of elasto-plastic constitutive models. Thus, the yield surface may be assumed in some materials as an elastic potential surface for a specific level of critical complementary strain energy density. Traditional approaches, such as the total strain energy criterion, only consider second order terms, i.e., the elastic potential is centred at the origin of the current stress state. Here, first order terms are considered, and consequently, the elastic potential may be translated, which allows to reproduce the desired level of tension-compression asymmetry. The proposed approach only adds two additional parameters, e.g., uniaxial compressive and tensile yield limits, to the elastic ones. For linear elasticity, the proposed approach provides elliptical yield surfaces and shows a correlation between the shape of the ellipse and the Poisson's ratio, which agree with published experimental data for soils and metallic glasses. This elliptical yield surface also fits well experimental values of amorphous polymers and some rocks. Besides, the proposed approach automatically considers the influence of the intermediate stress. For non-linear elasticity, a wider range of elastic potentials, i.e., yield surfaces, are possible, such as distorted ellipsoids. For the case of incompressible non-linear materials, the yield surfaces are between von Mises and Tresca ones."
https://openalex.org/W4307501103,"Squamates (lizards and snakes) include more than 10,000 living species, descended from an ancestor that diverged more than 240 million years ago from that of their closest living relative, Sphenodon. However, a deficiency of fossil evidence1-7, combined with serious conflicts between molecular and morphological accounts of squamate phylogeny8-13 (but see ref. 14), has caused uncertainty about the origins and evolutionary assembly of squamate anatomy. Here we report the near-complete skeleton of a stem squamate, Bellairsia gracilis, from the Middle Jurassic epoch of Scotland, documented using high-resolution synchrotron phase-contrast tomography. Bellairsia shares numerous features of the crown group, including traits related to cranial kinesis (an important functional feature of many extant squamates) and those of the braincase and shoulder girdle. Alongside these derived traits, Bellairsia also retains inferred ancestral features including a pterygoid-vomer contact and the presence of both cervical and dorsal intercentra. Phylogenetic analyses return strong support for Bellairsia as a stem squamate, suggesting that several features that it shares with extant gekkotans are plesiomorphies, consistent with the molecular phylogenetic hypothesis that gekkotans are early-diverging squamates. We also provide confident support of stem squamate affinities for the enigmatic Oculudentavis. Our findings indicate that squamate-like functional features of the suspensorium, braincase and shoulder girdle preceded the origin of their palatal and vertebral traits and indicate the presence of advanced stem squamates as persistent components of terrestrial assemblages up to at least the middle of the Cretaceous period."
https://openalex.org/W4308485615,"Bestrophin-2 (BEST2) is a member of the bestrophin family of calcium-activated anion channels that has a critical role in ocular physiology1–4. Here we uncover a directional permeability of BEST2 to glutamate that heavily favours glutamate exit, identify glutamine synthetase (GS) as a binding partner of BEST2 in the ciliary body of the eye, and solve the structure of the BEST2–GS complex. BEST2 reduces cytosolic GS activity by tethering GS to the cell membrane. GS extends the ion conducting pathway of BEST2 through its central cavity and inhibits BEST2 channel function in the absence of intracellular glutamate, but sensitizes BEST2 to intracellular glutamate, which promotes the opening of BEST2 and thus relieves the inhibitory effect of GS. We demonstrate the physiological role of BEST2 in conducting chloride and glutamate and the influence of GS in non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells. Together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of glutamate release through BEST2–GS. Electrophysiological, structural and biochemical studies on the bestrophin-2 anion channel reveal asymmetric permeability to glutamate and show that it forms a cooperative machinery in complex with glutamine synthetase for glutamate release."
https://openalex.org/W4307313191,"Background Essential nutrition action(ENA) is a framework for managing advocacy, establishing a foundation, and implementing a comprehensive package of preventive nutritional activities. Essential Nutrition Actions study studies provide current information on each nutrition action, allowing health systems to focus more on nutrition, which is critical in tackling the ""double burden"" of malnutrition: underweight and overweight. Hence, this study aimed at assessing the level of ENA practice and its predictors among mothers of children aged 6 to 24 months in southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1 to 30, 2021 among randomly selected 633 mothers of children aged 6–24 months. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to access study participants. Data were collected by using a pretested, structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. To identify predictors of ENA practice, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used. The strength of the association was measured using an adjusted odds ratio with 95 percent confidence intervals. The statistical significance was declared at a p-value less than 0.05. Results A total of 624 participants took part in the study, with a response rate of 98.6%. The uptake of key ENA messages among mothers was measured using 27 items, and it was found to be 47.4% (95% CI: 43.8, 51.4). Complementary feeding was the commonest ENA message practiced by 66.7% of respondents, while prevention of iodine deficiency disorder was practiced by only 33.7% of respondents. Variables namely, mother’s education level of college and above [AOR: 3.90, 95% CI: 1.79, 8.51], institutional delivery [AOR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.17,6.49], having PNC service [AOR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.91, 4.57], being knowledgeable on ENA message [AOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.81, 3.26] and being a model household [AOR: 3.83,95% CI: 2.58, 5.69] were positively associated with a good uptake of key ENA messages. On the other hand, primiparity [AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.21,0.56] was identified as a negative predictor. Conclusion The overall practice of key Essential nutrition action messages in the study area was low as compared to studies. Stakeholders must step up their efforts to improve and hasten the utilization of maternal and child health services, especially institutional delivery and Postnatal care by focusing on uneducated women to promote compliance to key ENA messages. Furthermore, health workers need to focus on awareness-raising and model household creation."
https://openalex.org/W4307313234,"Plumbing work is more manually driven in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs), and the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among workers who engage in plumbing in LMICs may be worse than earlier reports from developed countries. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, pattern and risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among Nigerian plumbers. A total of 130 consenting plumber participated in this cross-sectional study. The Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire and the Job Factor Questionnaire were used to assess information on prevalence and pattern of WMSDs; and perceptions regarding work-related risks factors for WMSDs. Descriptive (mean, frequency, range, percentage and standard deviation) and inferential (Chi-square) statistics were used to analyze data. Alpha level was set at p<0.05. The mean age of the respondents is 36.56 ± 10.418 years. The mean years of experience and working hours per day are 14.15 ± 9.161 years and 8.28 ± 2.512 hours. Job characteristics were mostly installation of pipes and fixtures (99.2%), equipment and fixtures prior to installation (96.9%), and testing of plumbing system for leaks (88.5%). 12-month and 7-day prevalence of WMSDS were 84.6% and 50.8%. Low-back (63.8%), neck (55.4%) and knee (50%) were the most affected body sites. Having WMSDs limits normal activities involving the low-back (32.3%), knee (25.4%) and neck (23.8%). There was significant association between 12-month prevalence of WMSDs and use of saws and pipe cutters (χ2 = 4.483; p = 0.034), while sites of affectation had significant association with 12-month and 7-day prevalence of WMSDs (p<0.05) respectively. Nigerian plumbers have a high prevalence of WMSDs affecting most commonly the low back, neck and knee. Plumbing job factors pose mild to moderate risk to developing WMSDs, and use of saws and pipe cutters significantly influence WMSDs."
https://openalex.org/W4307313241,"To maintain the temperature and settlement stability of a subgrade, a combination of graded crushed rock layer and insulation layer may be applied to optimize pavement structures. This study verifies a proposed numerical model of pavement and subgrade design in permafrost regions and evaluates temperature and settlement characteristics at different particle size and thickness of graded crushed rock layer and different thickness and location of insulation layer. The results show that the temperature and settlement of the combination of graded crushed-rock layer and insulation layer decrease significantly as the particle diameter and thickness of graded crushed-rock layer increase, and vary little when the thickness of insulation layer is more than 0.15 m. The location of installation layer has significant influence on the temperature of the subbase layer, but has little influence on the temperature of the subgrade. The maximum settlement of the pavement structure and subgrade decreases when the installation layer varies from the top of the subbase layer to the bottom of the subbase layer. The optimal combination of graded crushed-rock layer and insulation layer is that the 0.15 m-thickness installation layer is at the bottom of the 0.50 m-thickness graded crushed-rock layer with the particle size of 6-8 cm. This study provides a theoretical basis for the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and safety management of airport runways in permafrost regions."
https://openalex.org/W4307313250,"Introduction Many developing countries have drastically imbalanced health systems in different regions. The COVID-19 outbreak posed a further challenge as hospital structures, equipped with doctors, critical care units and respirators, were not available to a sufficient extent in all regions. Objective This study is a descriptive study on the efficiency of Malaysian states in facing the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology The efficiency of all Malaysian states was measured using Data Envelopment Analysis in which each state’s Score of COVID Index (SCI) was quantified. The SCI of these states were then further compared between the year 2020 and 2021. A greater disparity would indicate a decline in the performance of a state over time, where nearly all the states in Malaysia experienced an increase in the score of COVID Index (SCI). Result This study found that the central region was the most affected, since all the three states in the region (Selangor, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, and Federal Territory of Putrajaya) showed a situation of inadequacy (SCI: &gt;0.75) due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion The ranking of Malaysia’s states according to their vulnerability to an outbreak of COVID-19 is vitally significant for the purposes of assisting the government and policymakers in planning their responses to the outbreak and ensuring that resources are distributed appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W4307313251,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing markedly in low- and middle-income countries where over three-quarters of global deaths occur due to non-communicable diseases. Unfortunately, these conditions are considered costly and often deprioritized in humanitarian settings with competing goals. Using a mixed methods approach, this study aimed to quantify the cost of outpatient treatment for uncomplicated type-1 (T1DM) and type-2 (T2DM) diabetes at a secondary care facility serving refugees in Kenya. A retrospective cost analysis combining micro- and gross-costings from a provider perspective was employed. The main outcomes included unit costs per health service activity to cover the total cost of labor, capital, medications and consumables, and overheads. A care pathway was mapped out for uncomplicated diabetes patients to identify direct and indirect medical costs. Interviews were conducted to determine inputs required for diabetes care and estimate staff time allocation. A total of 360 patients, predominantly Somali refugees, were treated for T2DM (92%, n = 331) and T1DM (8%, n = 29) in 2017. Of the 3,140 outpatient consultations identified in 2017; 48% (n = 1,522) were for males and 52% (n = 1,618) for females. A total of 56,144 tests were run in the setting, of which 9,512 (16.94%) were Random Blood Sugar (RBS) tests, and 90 (0.16%) HbA1c tests. Mean costs were estimated as: $2.58 per outpatient consultation, $1.37 per RBS test and $14.84 per HbA1c test. The annual pharmacotherapy regimens cost $91.93 for T1DM and $20.34 for T2DM. Investment in holistic and sustainable non-communicable disease management should be at the forefront of humanitarian response. It is expected to be beneficial with immediate implications on the COVID-19 response while also reducing the burden of care over time. Despite study limitations, essential services for the management of uncomplicated diabetes in a humanitarian setting can be modest and affordable. Therefore, integrating diabetes care into primary health care should be a fundamental pillar of long-term policy response by stakeholders."

The obtained nonlinear governing equations were dimensionless, which were expressed in finite difference form. The results indicated that an accurate numerical solution could be obtained within a reasonable calculation time by discretizing the reinforcement length into 300 units. Three new dimensionless interaction terms, namely, the relative stiffness α , relative displacement β , and relative interface shear stiffness η of the reinforcement-tailings interaction, were introduced. In addition, an estimation method based on the approximate value of the relative stiffness α of the reinforcement-soil interface in the low-tensile-force displacement range was proposed. The interface shear stress range according to parameters α , β , and η was parameterized, and the normalization relationship between the tensile force and pull-out end displacement was determined. The numerical values calculated by the model were compared with the pull-out test results, demonstrating that the proposed model can accurately predict the pull-out behavior of the extensible reinforcement."

We stratified by sex and used nonparametric regression to graph mean HRQoL in each dimension by BMI, WC, and WHR. We used ordinary least squares regression to estimate differences in each HRQoL dimension by categories of BMI, WC, and WHR adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking.Mean HRQoL was lowest for health perception (Males: 67.5 (SD = 15.9); Females: 66.7 (15.8)) and highest for role functioning (Males: 97.5 (12.9); Females: 97.4 (13.3)). Mean (SD) values of BMI, WC, and WHR were 22.1 (3.6), 84.8 cm (9.5), and 0.9 (0.1), respectively for males, and 23.7 (4.2), 86.5 cm (10.2), and 0.9 (0.1), respectively, for females. There was no evidence that higher BMI was associated with lower HRQoL. Adjusted mean social functioning was 4.92 (p = 0.076) higher for males with high BMI risk (8.6% prevalence) compared with acceptable BMI risk (50.3%). Mean social functioning was 3.61 (p = 0.012) and 5.48 (p = 0.017) lower for females with high WC (44.7%) and WHR (83.1%), respectively, compared with those with low WC (23.8%) and WHR (3.6%).

https://openalex.org/W4307313374,"Current understanding of sea turtle nesting, hatching, and emergence events has been largely limited to observable events on the surface of the sand, though recent approaches using audio or visual equipment have allowed scientists to better understand some underground nest phenomena. We used a technology-based approach to define motion-related Caretta caretta hatching and emergence nest events. We describe a novel low-cost, accelerometer-based system called TurtleSense that can detect movement and temperature within sea turtle nests remotely. TurtleSense is successfully able to specifically detect motion within sea turtle nests over the entire course of incubation. This system allows for the identification of infertile nests and the detection of four predictable sequential developmental activity patterns in viable nests, including a hatch and posthatch period, the timing of which can be used to tightly predict hatchling emergence events almost to the day. TurtleSense provides a much better understanding about what is happening in the nest before emergence and allows for the generation of a theory of the mechanism that triggers mass emergence. Our results suggest that motion plays a large role in hatchling communication and that the timing of emergence events may be related to the cessation of movement within the nest. Current management of sea turtle nesting events is primarily driven by counting the number of days since the nest was laid, with further safeguards placed at the nest upon subsequent visual observation of depression or emergence events. Use of TurtleSense technology can impact nest management and conservation efforts, allowing organizations to use this motion data to more tightly predict emergence dates for sea turtle hatchlings and to use viability data to inform nest management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4307313388,"During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several epidemiological measures, such as cumulative case-counts (CCC), incidence rates, effective reproduction numbers (Reff) and doubling times, have been used to inform the general public and to justify interventions such as lockdown. It has been very likely that not all infectious people have been identified during the course of the epidemic, which lead to incomplete case-detection. We compare CCC, incidence rates, Reff and doubling times in the presence of incomplete case-detection. For this, an infection-age-structured SIR model is used to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed by a lockdown in a hypothetical population. Different scenarios about temporal variations in case-detection are applied to the four measures during outbreak and lockdown. The biases resulting from incomplete case-detection on the four measures are compared in terms of relative errors. CCC is most prone to bias by incomplete case-detection in all of our settings. Reff is the least biased measure. The possibly biased CCC may lead to erroneous conclusions in cross-country comparisons. With a view to future reporting about this or other epidemics, we recommend including and placing an emphasis on Reff in those epidemiological measures used for informing the general public and policy makers."

TxCYC and TxHIK participated in a 6-month intervention of individualized home-based cycling/hiking exercise and a series of supervised group training sessions. Barriers and facilitators to physical activity (Barriers and Motivators Questionnaire) were measured at 12 months.Regarding PROs, except for reducing TxHIK stress levels, MVT induced no substantial intervention effects. For both TxCYC and TxHIK, between-group comparisons at baseline showed that physical activity, HRQOL, mental health, depressive symptomatology and stress were similar to those of HCON. In contrast, compared to TxCYC, TxHIK, and HCON, physical activity, HRQOL and mental health were lower in TxCON. TxCON also reported greater barriers, lower facilitators, and different priority rankings concerning physical activity barriers and facilitators.Barely any of the PROs assessed in the present study responded to Transplantoux's MVT exercise intervention. TxCON reported distinct and unfavorable profiles regarding PROs and barriers and facilitators to physical activity.

https://openalex.org/W4307313463,"Introduction Although well-performing workforce is essential to equitable and efficient health service delivery, few countries have systematically addressed performance improvements. How health workers use their work time and what tasks they accomplish is here an important starting point. Therefore, a time motion study was conducted to assess the work time allocation patterns of primary health care doctors and nurses in two regions of Albania. Methods We used observation tool to record the time allocation along eight predefined main categories of activities. Conditional to presence at work, 48 health workers were continuously observed in early 2020 before start of the Covid-19 pandemic over five consecutive working days. Results The observed health workers spent 40.7% of their overall working time unproductively (36.8% on waiting for patients and 3.9% on breaks), 25.3% on service provision to users, 18.7% on administrative activities, 12.7% on outreach activities, 1.6% on continuous medical education and 1% on meetings. The study found variations in work time allocation patterns across cadres, with nurses spending more time unproductively, on administrative activities and on outreach and less on all other activities than doctors. Further, the work time allocation patterns were similar between urban and rural settings, except for nurses in rural settings spending less time than those in urban settings on administrative work. Conclusion This study found that primary health care workers in Albania devote a substantial amount of work time to unproductive, service provision to users and administrative activities. Consequently, there is possibility for productivity, respectively efficiency gains in how health workers use their time."
https://openalex.org/W4307313485,"Introduction So far, shreds of evidence have shown that COVID-19 related hospitalization, serious outcomes, and mortality were high among individuals with chronic medical conditions. However, strict compliance with basic public health measures such as hand washing with soap, social distancing, and wearing masks has been recommended and proven effective in preventing transmission of the infection. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the level of compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures and identify its predictors among patients with common chronic diseases in public hospitals of Southern Ethiopia by applying the proportional odds model. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was employed in public hospitals of Southern Ethiopia between February and March 2021. Using a systematic random sampling technique, 419 patients with common chronic diseases were recruited. Data were collected using an Open Data Kit and then submitted to the online server. The proportional odds model was employed, and the level of significance was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results This study revealed that 55.2% (95%CI: 50.4%-59.9%) of the study participants had low compliance levels with COVID-19 preventive measures. The final proportional odds model identified that perceived susceptibility (AOR: 0.91, 95%CI: 0.84, 0.97), cues to action (AOR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.85, 0.94), having access to drinking water piped into the dwelling (AOR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.32, 0.84), having no access to any internet (AOR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.42, 0.92), having no functional refrigerator (AOR: 2.17, 95%CI: 1.26, 3.74), and having poor knowledge (AOR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.98) were the independent predictors of low compliance level with COVID-19 preventive measures. Conclusion In the study area, more than half of the participants had low compliance levels with COVID-19 preventive measures. Thus, the identified factors should be considered when designing, planning, and implementing new interventional strategies, so as to improve the participants’ compliance level."
https://openalex.org/W4307313775,"Despite advances in techniques, methods, and theory, northeastern North American archaeologists continue to use early to mid-twentieth century culture historical taxa as units of analysis and narrative. There is a distinct need to move away from this archaeological practice to enable fuller understandings of past human lives. One tool that enables such a move is Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates, which provides a means of constructing continuous chronologies. A large dataset of radiocarbon dates for late prehistoric (ca AD 900/1000-1650) sites in the lower upper Ohio River basin in southwestern Pennsylvania and adjacent portions of Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia is used here as an example. The results allow a preliminary assessment of how the settlement plans of contemporaneous villages varied considerably, reflecting decisions of the village occupants how to structure built environments to meet their needs."
https://openalex.org/W4307313894,"A surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is an excitation resulting from the coupling of light to a surface charge oscillation at a metal-dielectric interface. The excitation and detection of SPPs is foundational to the operating mechanism of a number of important technologies, most of which require SPP excitation via direct reflectance, commonly achieved via Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) using the Kretschmann configuration. As a result, the accessible modes are fundamentally high-loss “leaky modes,” presenting a critical performance barrier. Recently, our group provided the first demonstration of “forbidden,” or guided-wave plasmon polariton modes (GW-PPMs), collective modes of a MIM structure with oscillatory electric field amplitude in the central insulator layer with up to an order of magnitude larger propagation lengths than those of traditional SPPs. However, in that work, GW-PPMs were accessed by indirect reflectance using Otto configuration ATR, making them of limited applied relevance. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique for direct reflectance excitation and detection of GW-PPMs. Specifically, we replace the air gap used in traditional Otto ATR with a low refractive index polymer coupling layer, mirroring a technique previously demonstrated to access Long-Range Surface Plasmon Polariton modes. We fit experimental ATR data using a robust theoretical model to confirm the character of the modes, as well as to explore the potential of this approach to enable advantageous propagation lengths. The ability to excite GW-PPMs using a device configuration that does not require an air gap could potentially enable transformative performance enhancements in a number of critical technologies."
https://openalex.org/W4307321134,"Diabetes is on the rise as the worldwide population ages. While physical activity can help protect against diabetes, ageing is commonly associated with reduced physical activity. This study aimed to examine if physical activity differs by diabetes status in mid-aged adults, how this association changes over time, and whether physical activity-related sociodemographic factors and health indicators differ in those with and without diabetes. Data came from four waves of the How Areas in Brisbane Influence HealTh and AcTivity (HABITAT), a longitudinal study of mid-age adults living in Brisbane, Australia. Random effects/Expectation-maximisation (RE-EM) regression trees were used to identify factors affecting physical activity among those with and without diabetes, both separately and combined. At study entry, those with diabetes had a higher median age of 58 years (95% CI: 57-60) and a lower median physical activity of 699 MET.min/week (95% CI: 599-799) than people without diabetes (53 years (95% CI: 53-53) and 849 MET.min/week (95% CI: 799-899)). However, the strongest factors influencing physical activity were BMI and gender, not diabetes status. It is vital to promote physical activity among adults, in particular among those with high BMI and women, as well as those with and at high risk of diseases like diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4307348038,"Changes in consumer behavior in recent years have led to a steady increase in the number of online shoppers. The viewing angle of a product and its position on a webpage can affect consumers' Kansei images and purchase intentions. This study aimed to determine the influences of product viewing angle and position on a webpage on consumers' Kansei images; the influences of consumers' physical characteristics (i.e., sex, dominant hand, and dominant eye) on their Kansei images were also explored. An experiment was designed to evaluate the influences of viewing angle and position on consumers' Kansei images. A product's viewing angle and position on the webpage in question served as independent variables, and the participants' Kansei images served as the dependent variable. Seven representative viewing angles were selected. A predetermined product was placed in nine positions in a 3×3 grid on a webpage. A total of 63 combinations were obtained, and an experiment and interview were designed to investigate the participants' Kansei images for all 63. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Viewing angle affected the participants' Kansei images; 2. the position of the product on the webpage affected the participants' Kansei images; and 3. some physical characteristics affected the participants' Kansei images. In summary, online marketing platforms could document shoppers' physical characteristics to provide them with personalized product displays in order to cater to their Kansei images preferences. These research findings could be applied to online shopping platforms, which could attract more diverse groups of clients by adjusting product display angles and product positions on webpages based on consumers' physical characteristics and preferences."
https://openalex.org/W4307348042,"Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a significant treatment challenge among Canadian veterans. Currently accessible pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for PTSD often do not lead to resolution of PTSD as a categorical diagnosis and have significant non-response rates. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY), a complementary and integrative health (CIH) intervention, can improve symptoms of PTSD. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this intervention has pivoted to virtual delivery and may be reaching new sets of participants who face multiple barriers to care. Objective To evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of virtually delivered Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on decreasing PTSD symptom severity, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain, and improving quality of life in Canadian veterans affected by PTSD. Methods and analysis Using a mixed-methods approach guided by the RE-AIM framework, we will conduct a hybrid type II effectiveness and implementation study of virtually delivered Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for Canadian veterans. Effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing virtually delivered SKY to a waitlist control in a single-blinded (investigator and data analyst) randomized controlled trial (RCT). Change in PTSD symptoms (PCL-5) is the primary outcome and quality of life (SF-36), symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and pain (BPI) are secondary outcomes. The SKY intervention will be conducted over a 6-week period with assessments at baseline, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 30 weeks. The reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention will be evaluated through one-on-one semi-structured interviews with RCT participants, SKY instructors, health professionals, and administrators that work with veterans. Discussion This is the first investigation of the virtual delivery of SKY for PTSD in veterans and aims to determine if the intervention is effective and implementable at scale."
https://openalex.org/W4307348141,"Openings for an assistant professor often attract a hundred or more applicants. This allows hiring committees to select highly productive candidates based on their number of publications. Applicants with more rapid publication would be hired with little or no postgraduate experience, but those with slower rates of publication would need more postgraduate experience. Our results show an association of more postgraduate experience, slower rates of publication, a smaller research group, and slower promotion when years are measured from PhD granting; conversely little or no postgraduate experience is generally associated with more rapid publication, a larger research group, and faster promotion. These results suggest the unexpected result that the number and rate of publication have opposite effects on the years from PhD granting to promotion which parametric survival analysis using a log-logistic distribution with gamma frailty confirmed. Statistical analysis revealed that number and rate of publication are reciprocal suppressor variables which were individually weaker predictors of years to promotion, but much more powerful when combined. Intuitively, this is probably because number and rate of publication contain information about other variables with: (1) number of publications being associated with more postgraduate experience, a smaller research group, and slower rates of publication; and (2) rate of publication being associated with a larger research group, and less postgraduate experience. Further, we found that promotion committees closely follow institutional tenure policy requiring promotion a fixed number of years after hiring as an assistant professor which may partially explain why promotion committees fail adjust the number and rate of publication for research group size as fairness in promotion might favor. Our results suggest that both postgraduate experience and research group size influence a professor's career."
https://openalex.org/W4307348175,"In this paper we analyze the descriptive statistics of the Google search volume for the terms related to the National Reserve of Copper and Associates (RENCA), a Brazilian mineral reserve in the Amazon of 4.6 million hectares, before and after the government signed the decree releasing it for exploration. First, we analyze the volume of searches for expressions related to RENCA in Google Trends using descriptive statistics; second, we assess the cross-correlation coefficient ρ DCCA , which measures the cross-correlation between two nonstationary time series across different time scales. After the government announced the release of the RENCA reserve, there was an increase in the average volume of Google searches for related terms, showing people’s concern about the announcement. By using the cross-correlation coefficient ρ DCCA , we identify strong cross-correlations between the different expressions related to RENCA in Google Trends. Our work shows the utility of Google Trends as an indicator of the perception of environmental policies. Additionally, we show that ρ DCCA can be used as a tool to measure the cross-correlation between synonyms extracted from Google Trends for various time scales."
https://openalex.org/W4307348207,"Objective(s) To use machine learning (ML) to predict short-term requirements for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19 admitted to Australian intensive care units (ICUs). Design A machine learning study within a national ICU COVID-19 registry in Australia. Participants Adult patients who were spontaneously breathing and admitted to participating ICUs with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 20 February 2020 to 7 March 2021. Patients intubated on day one of their ICU admission were excluded. Main outcome measures Six machine learning models predicted the requirement for invasive ventilation by day three of ICU admission from variables recorded on the first calendar day of ICU admission; (1) random forest classifier (RF), (2) decision tree classifier (DT), (3) logistic regression (LR), (4) K neighbours classifier (KNN), (5) support vector machine (SVM), and (6) gradient boosted machine (GBM). Cross-validation was used to assess the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of machine learning models. Results 300 ICU admissions collected from 53 ICUs across Australia were included. The median [IQR] age of patients was 59 [50–69] years, 109 (36%) were female and 60 (20%) required invasive ventilation on day two or three. Random forest and Gradient boosted machine were the best performing algorithms, achieving mean (SD) AUCs of 0.69 (0.06) and 0.68 (0.07), and mean sensitivities of 77 (19%) and 81 (17%), respectively. Conclusion Machine learning can be used to predict subsequent ventilation in patients with COVID-19 who were spontaneously breathing and admitted to Australian ICUs."
