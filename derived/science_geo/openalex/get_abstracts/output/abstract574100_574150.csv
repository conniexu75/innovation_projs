https://openalex.org/W2559267012,"Akkermansia muciniphila, a member of the gut microbiome, has been shown to improve metabolism in mice. Here it is reported that its pasteurization further improves this effect, and that one of its membrane proteins by itself has a similar benefit. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with low-grade inflammation and specific changes in gut microbiota composition1,2,3,4,5,6,7. We previously demonstrated that administration of Akkermansia muciniphila to mice prevents the development of obesity and associated complications8. However, the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect remain unclear. Moreover, the sensitivity of A. muciniphila to oxygen and the presence of animal-derived compounds in its growth medium currently limit the development of translational approaches for human medicine9. We have addressed these issues here by showing that A. muciniphila retains its efficacy when grown on a synthetic medium compatible with human administration. Unexpectedly, we discovered that pasteurization of A. muciniphila enhanced its capacity to reduce fat mass development, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in mice. These improvements were notably associated with a modulation of the host urinary metabolomics profile and intestinal energy absorption. We demonstrated that Amuc_1100, a specific protein isolated from the outer membrane of A. muciniphila, interacts with Toll-like receptor 2, is stable at temperatures used for pasteurization, improves the gut barrier and partly recapitulates the beneficial effects of the bacterium. Finally, we showed that administration of live or pasteurized A. muciniphila grown on the synthetic medium is safe in humans. These findings provide support for the use of different preparations of A. muciniphila as therapeutic options to target human obesity and associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2559597060,"A large set of microbial metabolic models (AGORA) could be applied to better understand the functions of the human gut microbiome. Genome-scale metabolic models derived from human gut metagenomic data can be used as a framework to elucidate how microbial communities modulate human metabolism and health. We present AGORA (assembly of gut organisms through reconstruction and analysis), a resource of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions semi-automatically generated for 773 human gut bacteria. Using this resource, we identified a defined growth medium for Bacteroides caccae ATCC 34185. We also showed that interactions among modeled species depend on both the metabolic potential of each species and the nutrients available. AGORA reconstructions can integrate either metagenomic or 16S rRNA sequencing data sets to infer the metabolic diversity of microbial communities. AGORA reconstructions could provide a starting point for the generation of high-quality, manually curated metabolic reconstructions. AGORA is fully compatible with Recon 2, a comprehensive metabolic reconstruction of human metabolism, which will facilitate studies of host–microbiome interactions."

The catalysts used for creating carbon-silicon bonds, however, often require expensive trace metals or have limited lifetimes. Borrowing from the ability of some metallo-enzymes to catalyze other rare carbene insertion reactions, Kan et al. used heme proteins to form carbon-silicon bonds across a range of conditions and substrates (see the Perspective by Klare and Oestreich). Directed evolution experiments using cytochrome c from Rhodothermus marinus improved the reaction to be 15 times more efficient than industrial catalysts.

https://openalex.org/W2549588201,"Social status is one of the strongest predictors of human disease risk and mortality, and it also influences Darwinian fitness in social mammals more generally. To understand the biological basis of these effects, we combined genomics with a social status manipulation in female rhesus macaques to investigate how status alters immune function. We demonstrate causal but largely plastic social status effects on immune cell proportions, cell type-specific gene expression levels, and the gene expression response to immune challenge. Further, we identify specific transcription factor signaling pathways that explain these differences, including low-status-associated polarization of the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway toward a proinflammatory response. Our findings provide insight into the direct biological effects of social inequality on immune function, thus improving our understanding of social gradients in health."
https://openalex.org/W2551820454,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells has been associated with metastasis, stemness, and resistance to therapy. Some tumors undergo EMT while others do not, which may reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of origin. However, this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show that cell-type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states differentially prime tumors to EMT. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) derived from interfollicular epidermis (IFE) are generally well differentiated, while hair follicle (HF) stem cell-derived SCCs frequently exhibit EMT, efficiently form secondary tumors, and possess increased metastatic potential. Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling revealed that IFE and HF tumor-initiating cells possess distinct chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory networks associated with tumorigenesis and EMT that correlate with accessibility of key epithelial and EMT transcription factor binding sites. These findings highlight the importance of chromatin states and transcriptional priming in dictating tumor phenotypes and EMT."

Based on the absence or presence of additional domains, the SNX family has been subdivided into several subfamilies, three of which include members that interact with retromer: (1) the SNX-PX subfamily member SNX3, which consists of only a PX domain (Harrison et al., 2014Harrison M.S.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); (3) the SNX-FERM subfamily member SNX27, comprising additional PDZ and FERM domains (Steinberg et al., 2013Steinberg F.

Despite the widely held view that the VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 retromer trimer is responsible for cargo recognition, there is currently no structural evidence in support of this notion. In fact, recent X-ray crystallographic analyses of SNX27 have shown that a subset of retromer cargos with NPXY motifs and PDZ ligands associate with the FERM and the PDZ domains of SNX27 (Clairfeuille et al., 2016Clairfeuille T.

How these cargos are recognized by retromer remains unknown. In this article, we report the elucidation of the structural mechanism of cargo recognition and membrane recruitment of the retromer trimer bound to SNX3, using a combination of X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), biochemistry, and cellular analyses. In addition to completing the structural characterization of the whole retromer complex at the atomic level, we identify a binding site for canonical ØX(L/M) recycling signals at the interface between VPS26 and SNX3. The structure shows that SNX3 binds via an N-terminal extension and the PX domain to another site at the interface of VPS26 and VPS35. The SNX3 PX domain, in turn, binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) through a different surface, thus enabling retromer recruitment to the membrane. Remarkably, exposure of the binding site for ØX(L/M) signals requires a conformational change in VPS26 that is induced by the concomitant interaction with SNX3 and cargo, revealing that cargo recognition is coupled to membrane recruitment. The shared and cooperative nature of these interactions explains why previous attempts to characterize interactions of recycling signals with single subunits or partial complexes had limited success and suggests a general mechanism for assembly of retromer coats on membrane tubules. Our initial X-ray crystallographic analyses focused on the unknown N-terminal portion of VPS35 (VPS35N). The crystal structure of residues 14–470, corresponding to ∼60% of VPS35, was determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction using selenium as the anomalous scatterer, and was refined to 3.0 Å resolution (Figures S1A and S1B; Table S1). The structure displays an α/α-solenoid fold formed by 20 α helices (α1 to α20). The shape of the solenoid is slightly curved, except for the first three helices that are tilted ∼45° relative to the solenoid axis. When combined with our previously determined structure of the C-terminal portion of VPS35 (VPS35C) (Hierro et al., 2007Hierro A. Rojas A.L. Rojas R. Murthy N. Effantin G. Kajava A.V. Steven A.C. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Functional architecture of the retromer cargo-recognition complex.Nature. 2007; 449: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we visualize VPS35 as having a total of 33 helices (Figure S1C). Comparison of the five copies of VPS35N in the asymmetric unit reveals larger Cα-root-mean-square deviation (RMSDs) together with higher temperature factors and weaker electron density for the last four helices of VPS35N (α17 to α20) (Figure S1D). These observations are consistent with electron microscopy data showing that VPS35 has an elongated structure with some bending capability around the midsection (Hierro et al., 2007Hierro A. Rojas A.L. Rojas R. Murthy N. Effantin G. Kajava A.V. Steven A.C. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Functional architecture of the retromer cargo-recognition complex.Nature. 2007; 449: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine how VPS26 (VPS26A isoform) binds to VPS35, but attempts to co-crystallize a VPS26-VPS35N complex failed. Inclusion of SNX3 (Strochlic et al., 2007Strochlic T.I. Setty T.G. Sitaram A. Burd C.G. Grd19/Snx3p functions as a cargo-specific adapter for retromer-dependent endocytic recycling.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in the crystallization trials, however, yielded crystals that diffracted to 2.7 Å. The structure of this complex was determined by molecular replacement (see Method Details) and the final model had a free R-factor of 0.25 and excellent stereochemistry (Figures 1, S1E, and S1F; Table S1). The overall complex has a T-shaped architecture, with VPS26 and VPS35N corresponding to both sides of the horizontal bar and SNX3 to the vertical bar (Figure 1; Movie S1). The C-terminal lobe of VPS26 (VPS26C), previously shown to contact VPS35 (Collins et al., 2008Collins B.M. Norwood S.J. Kerr M.C. Mahony D. Seaman M.N. Teasdale R.D. Owen D.J.

SNX3 binds simultaneously through its N-terminal tail and PX domain to VPS26C and VPS35N. Notably, the PtdIns3P-binding pocket on the SNX3 PX domain occurs on the opposite side of the VPS26-VPS35-interaction surface (Figure 1), consistent with the role of SNX3 in retromer recruitment to endosomal membranes (Strochlic et al., 2007Strochlic T.I.

The structure of VPS26-VPS35N presented here enables rationalization of the previous mutational analyses and the contribution of specific residues to binding. The formation of the VPS26-VPS35N subcomplex buries approximately 829 Å2 of surface area. Contact regions concentrate most of the conserved residues (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B) and include both polar and apolar interactions. Binding of VPS26 to VPS35 is through a central hydrophobic core dominated by P247 of VPS26, I104 and M136 of VPS35, and an extended H-bond network (Figure 2B). Accordingly, it has been shown that the double mutation P245S/R247S in VPS26B (analogous to P247S/R249S in VPS26A) prevented its incorporation into retromer in vitro and in vivo (Collins et al., 2008Collins B.M.

Structure of Vps26B and mapping of its interaction with the retromer protein complex.Traffic. 2008; 9: 366-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To confirm the broad binding surface, we extended these analyses by substituting more peripheral contact residues (R54 and R145 of VPS35, and R249 of VPS26) with alanine and found that these mutations also abolished the interaction (Figures 2C and 2D). Other mutations such as I235D/M236N in VPS26A or the equivalent I233D/M234N in VPS26B, which affect the VPS35 interaction in two-hybrid and pull-down assays (Collins et al., 2008Collins B.M.

Biol. 2006; 13: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), appear to contribute to structural destabilization of the VPS26 C-domain’s hydrophobic core rather than alter any direct contact. Furthermore, the crystal structures of VPS35N alone and in complex with VPS26A show that the 106PRLYL110 sequence in VPS35 is at a buried position in α helix 5, acting as a major structural scaffold for stabilization of the surrounding helical solenoid. The only side chain from this motif that sticks out to the surface corresponds to R107, which interacts with E234 and Y233 of VPS26A. Thus, it is likely that mutations of R107 directly affect the interaction with VPS26, while other mutations within the 106PRLYL110 motif have a destabilizing effect that abolishes the binding.Figure S2Conservation of Contact Residues across VPS26 and VPS35N Orthologs, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe alignments were generated by using the Clustal Omega server at EMBL-EBI and plotted with ESPript.

Here, we develop a chemical biology approach to determine mammalian nucleosome positions genome-wide. We uncovered surprising features of nucleosome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. In contrast to the prevailing model, we observe that for nearly all mouse genes, a class of fragile nucleosomes occupies previously designated nucleosome-depleted regions around transcription start sites and transcription termination sites. We show that nucleosomes occupy DNA targets for a subset of DNA-binding proteins, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and pluripotency factors. Furthermore, we provide evidence that promoter-proximal nucleosomes, with the +1 nucleosome in particular, contribute to the pausing of RNA polymerase II. Lastly, we find a characteristic preference for nucleosomes at exon-intron junctions. Taken together, we establish an accurate method for defining the nucleosome landscape and provide a valuable resource for studying nucleosome-mediated gene regulation in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2555109040,"In this study, we outline a regulatory network that involves the p53 tumor suppressor family and the Wnt pathway acting together with the TGF-β pathway in mesendodermal differentiation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Knockout of all three members, p53, p63, and p73, shows that the p53 family is essential for mesendoderm specification during exit from pluripotency in embryos and in culture. Wnt3 and its receptor Fzd1 are direct p53 family target genes in this context, and induction of Wnt signaling by p53 is critical for activation of mesendodermal differentiation genes. Globally, Wnt3-activated Tcf3 and nodal-activated Smad2/3 transcription factors depend on each other for co-occupancy of target enhancers associated with key differentiation loci. Our results therefore highlight an unanticipated role for p53 family proteins in a regulatory network that integrates essential Wnt-Tcf and nodal-Smad inputs in a selective and interdependent way to drive mesendodermal differentiation of pluripotent cells."

We report here that auditory hair cells contain two molecularly distinct mechanotransduction channels. One ion channel is activated by sound and is responsible for sensory transduction. This sensory transduction channel is expressed in hair cell stereocilia, and previous studies show that its activity is affected by mutations in the genes encoding the transmembrane proteins TMHS, TMIE, TMC1 and TMC2. We show here that the second ion channel is expressed at the apical surface of hair cells and that it contains the Piezo2 protein. The activity of the Piezo2-dependent channel is controlled by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and can be recorded following disruption of the sensory transduction machinery or more generally by disruption of the sensory epithelium. We thus conclude that hair cells express two molecularly and functionally distinct mechanotransduction channels with different subcellular distributions."

https://openalex.org/W2557442500,"During metastasis to distant sites, tumor cells migrate to blood vessels. In vivo, breast tumor cells utilize a specialized mode of migration known as streaming, where a linear assembly of tumor cells migrate directionally towards blood vessels on fibronectin-collagen I-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers in response to chemotactic signals. We have successfully reconstructed tumor cell streaming in vitro by co-plating tumors cells, macrophages and endothelial cells on 2.5 μm thick ECM-coated micro-patterned substrates. We found that tumor cells and macrophages, when plated together on the micro-patterned substrates, do not demonstrate sustained directional migration in only one direction (sustained directionality) but show random bi-directional walking. Sustained directionality of tumor cells as seen in vivo was established in vitro when beads coated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells were placed at one end of the micro-patterned ‘ECM fibers’ within the assay. We demonstrated that these endothelial cells supply the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) required for the chemotactic gradient responsible for sustained directionality. Using this in vitro reconstituted streaming system, we found that directional streaming is dependent on, and most effectively blocked, by inhibiting the HGF/C-Met signaling pathway between endothelial cells and tumor cells. Key observations made with the in vitro reconstituted system implicating C-Met signaling were confirmed in vivo in mammary tumors using the in vivo invasion assay and intravital multiphoton imaging of tumor cell streaming. These results establish HGF/C-Met as a central organizing signal in blood vessel-directed tumor cell migration in vivo and highlight a promising role for C-Met inhibitors in blocking tumor cell streaming and metastasis in vivo, and for use in human trials."

In the present study, we determined whether KDM1A modulates GSCs stemness and differentiation and tested the utility of two novel KDM1A-specific inhibitors (NCL-1 and NCD-38) to promote differentiation and apoptosis of GSCs. The efficacy of KDM1A targeting drugs was tested on purified GSCs isolated from established and patient-derived GBMs using both in vitro assays and in vivo orthotopic preclinical models. Our results suggested that KDM1A is highly expressed in GSCs and knockdown of KDM1A using shRNA-reduced GSCs stemness and induced the differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of KDM1A using NCL-1 and NCD-38 significantly reduced the cell viability, neurosphere formation and induced apoptosis of GSCs with little effect on differentiated cells. In preclinical studies using orthotopic models, NCL-1 and NCD-38 significantly reduced GSCs-driven tumor progression and improved mice survival. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that KDM1A inhibitors modulate several pathways related to stemness, differentiation and apoptosis. Mechanistic studies showed that KDM1A inhibitors induce activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. These results strongly suggest that selective targeting of KDM1A using NCL-1 and NCD-38 is a promising therapeutic strategy for elimination of GSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2558360196,"Crosstalk between transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling and p53 has a critical role in cancer progression. TGF-β signals via Smad and non-Smad pathways. Under normal conditions, wild-type p53 forms a complex with Smad2/3 and co-activates transcription of a variety of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in tumor suppressive effects. Thus, p53 stability is essential in progression of tumor suppressive responses mediated by TGF-β signaling. However, it remains unknown whether p53 stability is regulated by TGF-β. In the current study, we identify that USP15 binds to and stabilizes p53 through deubiquitination in U2OS and HEK293 cells. TGF-β promotes the translation of USP15 through activation of mammalian target of rapamycin by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Upregulation of USP15 translation links the crosstalk between TGF-β signaling and p53 stability, allowing this cytokine to have a critical role in cancer progression."

Although 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with early-life behavioral abnormalities, affected individuals are also at high risk for the development of schizophrenia symptoms, including psychosis, later in life. Auditory thalamocortical (TC) projections recently emerged as a neural circuit that is specifically disrupted in mouse models of 22q11DS (hereafter referred to as 22q11DS mice), in which haploinsufficiency of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing-factor-encoding gene Dgcr8 results in the elevation of the dopamine receptor Drd2 in the auditory thalamus, an abnormal sensitivity of thalamocortical projections to antipsychotics, and an abnormal acoustic-startle response. Here we show that these auditory TC phenotypes have a delayed onset in 22q11DS mice and are associated with an age-dependent reduction of miR-338-3p, a miRNA that targets Drd2 and is enriched in the thalamus of both humans and mice. Replenishing depleted miR-338-3p in mature 22q11DS mice rescued the TC abnormalities, and deletion of Mir338 (which encodes miR-338-3p) or reduction of miR-338-3p expression mimicked the TC and behavioral deficits and eliminated the age dependence of these deficits. Therefore, miR-338-3p depletion is necessary and sufficient to disrupt auditory TC signaling in 22q11DS mice, and it may mediate the pathogenic mechanism of 22q11DS-related psychosis and control its late onset."

The oncogenic mucin 1 (MUC1) C-terminal (MUC1-C) subunit is similarly overexpressed in human carcinoma cells and has been linked to their self-renewal. There is no known relationship between MUC1-C and BMI1 in cancer. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C drives BMI1 transcription by a MYC-dependent mechanism in breast and other cancer cells. In addition, we show that MUC1-C blocks miR-200c-mediated downregulation of BMI1 expression. The functional significance of this MUC1-C→︀BMI1 pathway is supported by the demonstration that targeting MUC1-C suppresses BMI1-induced ubiquitylation of H2A and thereby derepresses homeobox HOXC5 and HOXC13 gene expression. Notably, our results further show that MUC1-C binds directly to BMI1 and promotes occupancy of BMI1 on the CDKN2A promoter. In concert with BMI1-induced repression of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor, we found that targeting MUC1-C is associated with induction of p16INK4a expression. In support of these results, analysis of three gene expresssion data sets demonstrated highly significant correlations between MUC1-C and BMI1 in breast cancers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for MUC1-C in driving BMI1 expression and in directly interacting with this stem cell factor, linking MUC1-C with function of the PRC1 in epigenetic gene silencing."

https://openalex.org/W2558218487,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a master driver of a vast majority of breast cancers. Breast cancer cells often develop resistance to endocrine therapy via restoration of the ERα activity through survival pathways. Thus identifying the epigenetic activator of ERα that can be targeted to block ERα gene expression is a critical topic of endocrine therapy. Here, integrative genomic analysis identified MYST3 as a potential oncogene target that is frequently amplified in breast cancer. MYST3 is involved in histone acetylation via its histone acetyltransferase domain (HAT) and, as a result, activates gene expression by altering chromatin structure. We found that MYST3 was amplified in 11% and/or overexpressed in 15% of breast tumors, and overexpression of MYST3 correlated with worse clinical outcome in estrogen receptor+ (ER+) breast cancers. Interestingly, MYST3 depletion drastically inhibited proliferation in MYST3-high, ER+ breast cancer cells, but not in benign breast epithelial cells or in MYST3-low breast cancer cells. Importantly, we discovered that knocking down MYST3 resulted in profound reduction of ERα expression, while ectopic expression of MYST3 had the reversed effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that MYST3 binds to the proximal promoter region of ERα gene, and inactivating mutations in its HAT domain abolished its ability to regulate ERα, suggesting MYST3 functioning as a histone acetyltransferase that activates ERα promoter. Furthermore, MYST3 inhibition with inducible MYST3 shRNAs potently attenuated breast tumor growth in mice. Together, this study identifies the first histone acetyltransferase that activates ERα expression which may be potentially targeted to block ERα at transcriptional level."

Hic-5, a focal adhesion scaffold protein, has previously been implicated in tumor cell invasion, proliferation and metastasis. To investigate the role of Hic-5 in breast tumor progression in vivo, Hic-5-/- mice were generated and crossed with the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus-Polyoma Middle T-Antigen mouse. Tumors from the Hic-5-/-;PyMT mice exhibited increased latency and reduced growth, with fewer lung metastases, as compared with Hic-5+/-;PyMT mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Hic-5 is primarily expressed in the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Further analysis revealed that the Hic-5-/-;PyMT tumor stroma contains fewer CAFs and exhibits reduced ECM deposition. The remodeling of the stromal matrix by CAFs has been shown to increase tumor rigidity to indirectly regulate FAK Y397 phosphorylation in tumor cells to promote their growth and invasion. Accordingly, the Hic-5-/-;PyMT tumor cells exhibited a reduction in FAK Y397 phosphorylation. Isolated Hic-5-/-;PyMT CAFs were defective in stress fiber organization and exhibited reduced contractility. These cells also failed to efficiently deposit and organize the ECM in two and three dimensions. This, in turn, impacted three-dimensional MDA-MB-231 tumor cell migration behavior. Thus, using a new knockout mouse model, we have identified Hic-5 expression in CAFs as a key requirement for deposition and remodeling of the stromal ECM to promote non-cell autonomous breast tumor progression."

Loss of trophic signaling was found to elicit transcriptional programs that govern neuronal death as well as axonal degeneration. Early studies using the developing chick embryo demonstrated that active transcription is required for cell death induced by ablation of the peripheral targets (Oppenheim et al., 1990Oppenheim R.W. Prevette D. Tytell M. Homma S. Naturally occurring and induced neuronal death in the chick embryo in vivo requires protein and RNA synthesis: evidence for the role of cell death genes.Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In later studies, the transcription factor c-Jun, members of the p53 family, and the transcriptionally induced BH3-only proteins Hrk and Bim were identified as key regulators of the apoptosis of sympathetic and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons during development (Aloyz et al., 1998Aloyz R.S.

Additional in vitro findings support the role of active gene transcription in neuronal cell death and axonal elimination following whole-culture trophic deprivation, since inhibiting transcription or translation preserved the neurons and their axons in culture (Martin et al., 1988Martin D.P. Schmidt R.E. DiStefano P.S. Lowry O.H. Carter J.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Inhibitors of protein synthesis and RNA synthesis prevent neuronal death caused by nerve growth factor deprivation.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In addition, disconnection of axons from dying neurons protects the axons from degeneration. This supports the idea that mobilization of newly synthesized proteins from the cell body is required for axonal degeneration (Gerdts et al., 2013Gerdts J. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. DiAntonio A.

However, to date, there has been no comprehensive analysis of this transcriptional program or functional analysis of its components. Mechanisms that control axonal breakdown during development (axonal pruning) and after injury have begun to emerge in the last few years (Neukomm and Freeman, 2014Neukomm L.J. Freeman M.R.

Yaron A. Mechanisms of developmental neurite pruning.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Components of the apoptotic system, including Caspases-9, -6, and -3, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, have been strongly implicated in axonal degeneration in response to trophic withdrawal in vitro and in axonal pruning in vivo (Maor-Nof and Yaron, 2013Maor-Nof M. Yaron A. Neurite pruning and neuronal cell death: spatial regulation of shared destruction programs.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, Caspases execute pruning of sensory neuron dendritic arbors during metamorphosis in Drosophila (Kuo et al., 2006Kuo C.T. Zhu S. Younger S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Identification of E2/E3 ubiquitinating enzymes and caspase activity regulating Drosophila sensory neuron dendrite pruning.Neuron. 2006; 51: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2006Williams D.W.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1234-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of the apoptotic system in this developmental process is evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, it was suggested that regulation of the apoptotic system in axons is distinct from that in cell bodies. Apaf-1 is critical for cell death but not for axonal degeneration, while the Caspase inhibitor XIAP plays an important role in Caspase regulation in axons but not in the soma (Cusack et al., 2013Cusack C.L.

However, other studies have challenged these findings (Simon et al., 2012Simon D.J. Weimer R.M. McLaughlin T. Kallop D. Stanger K. Yang J. O’Leary D.D. Hannoush R.N. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Axon degeneration gated by retrograde activation of somatic pro-apoptotic signaling.Cell. 2016; 164: 1031-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More recently, the pro-apoptotic protein Puma (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) was found to elicit axonal degeneration through an unidentified anterograde degenerative program that activates the axonal apoptotic system (Simon et al., 2016Simon D.J. Pitts J. Hertz N.T. Yang J. Yamagishi Y. Olsen O. Tešić Mark M. Molina H. Tessier-Lavigne M. Axon degeneration gated by retrograde activation of somatic pro-apoptotic signaling.Cell. 2016; 164: 1031-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of sensory neurons following trophic deprivation in vitro to uncover the transcriptional program elicited in response to trophic withdrawal and to discover its role in axonal elimination. Dusp16 is upregulated in this paradigm and was selected for further study since its role in the nervous system has never been explored before. Our findings indicate that Dusp16 provides a safeguard mechanism to down-modulate the transcription upregulation of the pro-degenerative Puma, regulating axonal degeneration. The ability of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors to delay axonal degeneration and cell death of NGF-deprived sensory neurons in vitro (Martin et al., 1988Martin D.P. Schmidt R.E. DiStefano P.S. Lowry O.H. Carter J.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Inhibitors of protein synthesis and RNA synthesis prevent neuronal death caused by nerve growth factor deprivation.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and to delay cell death of sensory and motor neurons in vivo (Oppenheim et al., 1990Oppenheim R.W. Prevette D. Tytell M. Homma S. Naturally occurring and induced neuronal death in the chick embryo in vivo requires protein and RNA synthesis: evidence for the role of cell death genes.Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) suggested the existence of a transcriptional program that promotes cell death and axonal degeneration. To explore this in sensory neurons, we first determined the time point after trophic withdrawal at which the transcriptional program required for degeneration is completed. For this, we cultured DRG neurons from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) mice for 36 hr in the presence of NGF and applied the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D at different times after trophic withdrawal. Axonal degeneration magnitude was assessed after 24 hr. Inhibiting transcription within 6 hr after trophic withdrawal provided robust protection against axonal degeneration as monitored by microtubule (MT) depolymerization (Figures 1A–1D, 1F–1I, and 1K ) and degradation of neurofilaments (NF) (Figures 1L and 1M). Addition of actinomycin D at later time points had some inhibitory effect, but this was much less profound (Figures 1E, 1J, and 1K). These data suggest that, after 6 hr, most of the transcriptional program that mediates axonal degeneration has been executed. To identify and characterize components of the transcriptional program that initiates axonal degradation, we cultured DRG neurons for 36 hr in the presence of NGF and then induced deprivation. RNA was extracted after 1, 3, or 6 hr of trophic deprivation, and the neurons were subjected to RNA-seq analysis (Figure 2A). Transcriptional profiling demonstrated significant changes in gene expression after 3 hr and 6 hr of trophic deprivation relative to control cultures (control, 6 hr) (Figure 2B). These changes included increased expression of two genes previously reported to be induced in sensory neurons upon trophic deprivation, Hrk and Jun (increased by 6-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively). Using a 1.5-fold change as the threshold, 208 genes were found to be downregulated and 87 genes were upregulated. Using the CLICK algorithm (Sharan and Shamir, 2000Sharan R. Shamir R. CLICK: a clustering algorithm with applications to gene expression analysis.Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 2000; 8: 307-316PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2C), these genes were clustered with high homogeneity (>98) into four clusters based on the pattern of changes in their expression. Analysis of this dataset using the Ingenuity Systems IPA platform suggested the emergence of an overall program representing a regressive process of neuronal cell bodies and their processes. Specifically, the group of induced genes was enriched in pathways that are generally involved in “cell death” of different cell types (11 genes). In contrast, the genes with reduced expression included pathways that participate in “cell survival” (54 genes) “development of neurons” (36 genes), “branching of neurons” (17 genes), “shape change of neurites” (17 genes), “branching of neurites (16 genes), and “neuritogenesis” (26 genes) (Table S1). This analysis provides a high-resolution dataset of changes in gene expression in sensory neurons upon trophic withdrawal. To begin to determine the functional implications of these transcriptional changes, we focused on the upregulated genes in clusters 3 and 4 (Figure 2C). Since our results showed that inhibition of transcription protects axons from degeneration, we hypothesized that genetic ablation of genes from these upregulated clusters would also confer axonal protection. Moreover, we aimed to analyze the genes that might converge to play a key role in regulating axonal degeneration during development and in the in vivo axonal response to injury. We therefore compared the upregulated genes from clusters 3 and 4 with those reported in two recently published gene-expression studies of axonal injury of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and DRGs (Michaelevski et al., 2010Michaelevski I. Segal-Ruder Y. Rozenbaum M. Medzihradszky K.F. Shalem O. Coppola G. Horn-Saban S. Ben-Yaakov K. Dagan S.Y.

DLK initiates a transcriptional program that couples apoptotic and regenerative responses to axonal injury.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 4039-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We found only four genes, Stmn4, Atf3, Dusp16, and Puma, to be induced in all three datasets (Figure 2D), a highly significant intersection based on randomized test (p < 0.001). In a previous study, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to examine the role of Stmn4 and failed to detect a role for this protein in axonal degeneration following trophic deprivation (Maor-Nof et al., 2013Maor-Nof M. Homma N. Raanan C. Nof A. Hirokawa N. Yaron A. Axonal pruning is actively regulated by the microtubule-destabilizing protein kinesin superfamily protein 2A.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 971-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Atf3 is a known marker of axonal injury while the function of Dusp16 in the nervous system was not studied before (Niedzielska et al., 2014Niedzielska M. Bodendorfer B. Münch S. Eichner A. Derigs M. da Costa O. Schweizer A. Neff F. Nitschke L. Sparwasser T. et al.Gene trap mice reveal an essential function of dual specificity phosphatase Dusp16/MKP-7 in perinatal survival and regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 2112-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to focus on Dusp16. Moreover, other members of the Dusp family are induced in response to trophic deprivation in different neurons, but their relative importance and specific functions are unknown (Kristiansen et al., 2011Kristiansen M. Menghi F. Hughes R. Hubank M. Ham J. Global analysis of gene expression in NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons identifies molecular pathways associated with cell death.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 551Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Mariga et al., 2015Mariga A.

Neurobiol. 2015; 75: 173-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using DRG neurons from Dusp16 knockout (KO) mice, we first examined whether Dusp16 plays a role in axonal degeneration in response to trophic deprivation in vitro. To our surprise, we found that the degeneration of axons from these neurons is more rapid compared with that from neurons of their wild-type (WT) littermates (Figures 3A–3I), indicating that Dusp16 is a negative regulator of axonal degeneration. Given the central role of Caspase-3 in the process of axonal degeneration (Cusack et al., 2013Cusack C.L. Swahari V. Hampton Henley W. Michael Ramsey J. Deshmukh M. Distinct pathways mediate axon degeneration during apoptosis and axon-specific pruning.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Simon et al., 2012Simon D.J. Weimer R.M. McLaughlin T. Kallop D. Stanger K. Yang J. O’Leary D.D. Hannoush R.N. Tessier-Lavigne M. A caspase cascade regulating developmental axon degeneration.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17540-17553Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we next wanted to know whether its regulation in Dusp16 KO mice is altered. To this end, we made use of the filter culture system, enabling us to differentiate between the neuronal soma and the axons (Schoenmann et al., 2010Schoenmann Z. Assa-Kunik E. Tiomny S. Minis A. Haklai-Topper L. Arama E. Yaron A. Axonal degeneration is regulated by the apoptotic machinery or a NAD+-sensitive pathway in insects and mammals.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 6375-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Figures 3J and 3K). E13.5 embryonic DRGs from Dusp16 KO mice and wild-type littermates were cultured for 48 hr on 1 μm filters, and trophic deprivation was induced for 8, 12, or 16 hr. Neuronal cell bodies and their axons were then extracted separately and subjected to biochemical analysis using anti-Caspase-3 antibody, which detects both the full Caspase-3 and its cleaved (active) short form. We found a pattern of trophic deprivation-induced Caspase-3 activation in both the cell bodies and the axons of Dusp16 KO neurons, manifested by increases in the amount of the cleaved form (Figures 3L and 3M). Next, we tested the role of Caspase-3 activity in the more rapid axonal degeneration observed in Dusp16 KO neurons. Although axonal degeneration was more advanced at 24 hr in Dusp16 KO neurons than in wild-type neurons, 50 μM of the pan-Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD blocked axonal degeneration in a similar manner in both (Figures 3N–3V). These results suggest that ablation of Dusp16 enhances Caspase-3 activation and axonal degeneration following trophic deprivation. We next examined the axonal protective role of Dusp16 in the development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Using whole-mount neurofilament staining, we studied the pattern of DRG axonal development at E12.5. The gross pattern of the axons in Dusp16 KO embryos at that early stage was comparable to the pattern observed in their WT littermates (Figure S1). Moreover, DRG axons grow to the same extent in the Dusp16 KO embryos as in their WT littermates. This suggested that Dusp16 does not regulate axonal growth or guidance (Figures 4A–4C). However, there was a clear reduction in the number of axonal branches (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4D), indicating that Dusp16 is a positive regulator of axonal morphogenesis. This finding is in line with its function as a negative regulator of axonal breakdown. Next, we examined the innervation of the skin at E15.5. Strikingly, staining with the neuronal marker PGP9.5 (Figures 4E–4G) or the general axonal marker tubulin βIII (Figures 4H–4J) revealed approximately 50% fewer nerves innervating the skin in Dusp16 KO mice than in WT controls. To examine the possibility that this strong reduction was due to massive cell death of DRG neurons with subsequent degeneration of their axons, we counted the cleaved Caspase-3-positive cells during development. Relative to controls, there is a 2.8-fold increase in the number of cleaved Caspase-3-positive cells at both E13.5 and E15.5 in the Dusp16 KO mice (Figures 4K–4O). Consistent with this increase, the Dusp16 KO mice exhibited a 16% reduction in the number of Islet1-positive DRG neurons at E13.5 and a 22% reduction at E15.5 (Figures 4P–4T). Taken together, these results support a critical role for Dusp16 in preserving sensory axons and, to a lesser extent, protecting the cell bodies during development. Dusp16 has been shown to negatively regulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the immune system (Niedzielska et al., 2014Niedzielska M. Bodendorfer B. Münch S. Eichner A. Derigs M. da Costa O. Schweizer A. Neff F. Nitschke L. Sparwasser T. et al.Gene trap mice reveal an essential function of dual specificity phosphatase Dusp16/MKP-7 in perinatal survival and regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production.J.

MAPK phosphatase 7 regulates T cell differentiation via inhibiting ERK-mediated IL-2 expression.J. Immunol. 2015; 194: 3088-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the JNK pathway was found to control axonal degeneration and cell death in response to trophic withdrawal (Ghosh et al., 2011Ghosh A.S. Wang B. Pozniak C.D. Chen M. Watts R.J. Lewcock J.W. DLK induces developmental neuronal degeneration via selective regulation of proapoptotic JNK activity.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the activation of JNK in response to trophic deprivation in DRG neurons of the Dusp16 KO mice. Both in WT and in Dusp16 KO neurons, an increase in JNK phosphorylation was detectable between 3 and 6 hr after NGF deprivation (Figures S2A–S2C). To our surprise, however, JNK activation was no greater in Dusp16 KO neurons than in controls (Figures S2A–S2C). To verify these findings, we examined phosphorylation of the JNK substrate c-Jun, which is robustly induced in response to trophic withdrawal (Ghosh et al., 2011Ghosh A.S. Wang B. Pozniak C.D. Chen M. Watts R.J. Lewcock J.W. DLK induces developmental neuronal degeneration via selective regulation of proapoptotic JNK activity.J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5595-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The induction of c-Jun expression levels did not increase in the Dusp16 KO neurons as compared to wild-type (Figures S2D–S2F). Consistent with our analysis of JNK activation, 6 hr of trophic deprivation induced c-Jun phosphorylation (pJun) to the same extent in both wild-type and Dusp16 KO neurons (Figures S2D–S2F). Interestingly, at 9 hr post-deprivation, c-Jun phosphorylation falls in the Dusp16 KO neurons but remains elevated in the controls (Figures S2D–S2F). Overall, these results show that loss of Dusp16 has no effect on JNK activation in neurons following trophic deprivation. Similarly, we did not observe any change in activation of p38 in Dusp16 KO neurons (Figures S2G–S2I). Our results indicate that the observed effects of Dusp16 KO on axon degeneration are not mediated by increased activation of JNK/p38 signaling. Since Puma is co-induced with Dusp16 in response to trophic deprivation and nerve injury (Figure 2D), we examined Puma expression. Upon NGF deprivation, Puma is transcriptionally upregulated as determined by our RNA-seq analysis. We then assessed Puma protein levels following trophic deprivation using the filter culture system described above (Figures 3J and 3K). Using a specific anti-Puma antibody, we detected induction of Puma in the soma compartment 8 hr and 12 hr after trophic deprivation (Figures 5A and 5B ; Figure S2J). Importantly, Puma was also clearly detectable in the axonal compartment at these times points (Figures 5C and 5D). We next examined expression of Puma in Dusp16 KO neurons in response to trophic withdrawal and observed more rapid induction of Puma (4 hr and 5 hr after NGF withdrawal) in Dusp16 KO neurons than in control, suggesting that Dusp16 is an antagonist of Puma expression (Figures 5E and 5F). In contrast, Puma KO had no effect on the expression of Dusp16 in response to trophic withdrawal (Figure 5G). The transcriptional induction of Puma in response to multiple insults is controlled by p53 (Yu and Zhang, 2008Yu J. Zhang L. PUMA, a potent killer with or without p53.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S71-S83Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), which is also important for cell death of sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells following NGF deprivation in vitro and during development in vivo (Aloyz et al., 1998Aloyz R.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15604-15614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p53 transcriptional activity is enhanced by phosphorylation on Ser15 (Loughery et al., 2014Loughery J. Cox M. Smith L.M. Meek D.W. Critical role for p53-serine 15 phosphorylation in stimulating transactivation at p53-responsive promoters.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 7666-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression and the Ser15 phosphorylation status of p53 in response to trophic withdrawal in WT and Dusp16 KO neurons. We did not detect an increase in p53 levels or of Foxo3a, which also regulates the transcription of Puma, following NGF deprivation at any time point tested (Figure 5H; Figures S2K, S2M, and S2N). In contrast, using a specific anti-pSer15 antibody, we detected an increase in p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 as early as 4 hr after trophic withdrawal (Figures 5I and 5J; Figure S2L). This phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in the Dusp16 KO neurons at all tested time points (Figures 5I and 5J). In agreement with the role of Dusp16 as a negative regulator of p53 transcription activity, we found more rapid elevation of Puma mRNA in the Dusp16 KO neurons compared with WT after trophic withdrawal (Fig"

https://openalex.org/W2559323520,"A major genomic alteration in prostate cancer (PCa) is frequent loss of chromosome (chr) 8p with a common region of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chr8p22 locus. Genomic studies implicate this locus in the initiation of clinically significant PCa and with progression to metastatic disease. However, the genes within this region have not been fully characterized to date. Here we demonstrate for the first time that a microRNA component of this region-miR-383-is frequently downregulated in prostate cancer, has a critical role in determining tumor-initiating potential and is involved in prostate cancer metastasis via direct regulation of CD44, a ubiquitous marker of PCa tumor-initiating cells (TICs)/stem cells. Expression analyses of miR-383 in PCa clinical tissues established that low miR-383 expression is associated with poor prognosis. Functional data suggest that miR-383 regulates PCa tumor-initiating/stem-like cells via CD44 regulation. Ectopic expression of miR-383 inhibited tumor-initiating capacity of CD44+ PCa cells. Also, 'anti-metastatic' effects of ectopic miR-383 expression were observed in a PCa experimental metastasis model. In view of our results, we propose that frequent loss of miR-383 at chr8p22 region leads to tumor initiation and prostate cancer metastasis. Thus, we have identified a novel finding that associates a long observed genomic alteration to PCa stemness and metastasis. Our data suggest that restoration of miR-383 expression may be an effective therapeutic modality against PCa. Importantly, we identified miR-383 as a novel PCa tissue diagnostic biomarker with a potential that outperforms that of serum PSA."

Although the NFAT proteins have been extensively investigated in the immune system, their role in cancer progression remains controversial.

Knockdown of endogenous NFAT3 expression by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, colony formation and anchorage-independent cell growth. Furthermore, results of the mammalian two-hybrid assay showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 3 (CDK3) directly interacted with NFAT3 and phosphorylated NFAT3 at serine 259 (Ser259), which enhanced the transactivation and transcriptional activity of NFAT3. The phosphorylation site of NFAT3 was critical for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cell transformation of the HaCaT immortalized skin cell line and mutation of NFAT3 at Ser259 led to a reduction of colony formation in soft agar. We also found that overexpressing wildtype NFAT3, but not mutant NFAT3-S259A, promoted A431 xenograft tumor growth. Importantly, we showed that CDK3, NFAT3 and phosphorylated NFAT3-Ser259 were highly expressed in skin cancer compared with normal skin tissues. These results provided evidence supporting the oncogenic potential of NFAT3 and suggested that CDK3-mediated phosphorylation of NFAT3 has an important role in skin tumorigenesis."

If you want to study bat behavior or stellar nebulae or sleep physiology, you may have to become half-nocturnal and scientists who sign up for the night shift encounter problems that just don't arise during the day. They tumble down embankments in the pitch black, nod off midexperiment, and grow paranoid in the witching hours. a tough gig, and for these and other reasons psychologists and sleep experts take a dim view of night work, which can disrupt sleep, throw hormones out of whack, and make you measurably dumber. And yet, few of the nocturnal scientists Science talked to would give up their work. Amid the misery and exhaustion, science after hours can still produce moments of serenity, even euphoria. Either you're getting to know more about the natural world, or you're getting to know more about yourself, one night-shift scientist says. It's always a source of happiness to me."
