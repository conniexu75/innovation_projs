https://openalex.org/W1725214865,"Because lignin limits the use of wood for fiber, chemical, and energy production, strategies for its downregulation are of considerable interest. We have produced transgenic aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) trees in which expression of a lignin biosynthetic pathway gene Pt4CL1 encoding 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL) has been downregulated by antisense inhibition. Trees with suppressed Pt4CL1 expression exhibited up to a 45% reduction of lignin, but this was compensated for by a 15% increase in cellulose. As a result, the total lignin-cellulose mass remained essentially unchanged. Leaf, root, and stem growth were substantially enhanced, and structural integrity was maintained both at the cellular and whole-plant levels in the transgenic lines. Our results indicate that lignin and cellulose deposition could be regulated in a compensatory fashion, which may contribute to metabolic flexibility and a growth advantage to sustain the long-term structural integrity of woody perennials."

https://openalex.org/W1564321524,"A major challenge for fluorescence imaging of living mammalian cells is maintaining viability following prolonged exposure to excitation illumination. We have monitored the dynamics of mitochondrial distribution in hamster embryos at frequent intervals over 24 h using two-photon microscopy (1,047 nm) while maintaining blastocyst, and even fetal, developmental competence. In contrast, confocal imaging for only 8 h inhibits development, even without fluorophore excitation. Photo-induced production of H2O2 may account, in part, for this inhibition. Thus, two-photon microscopy, but not confocal microscopy, has permitted long-term fluorescence observations of the dynamics of three-dimensional cytoarchitecture in highly photosensitive specimens such as mammalian embryos."

https://openalex.org/W1992541490,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) heterodimerizes with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXRα) to bind to peroxisome proliferator-response elements (PPRE) present in the upstream regions of a number of genes involved in metabolic homeostasis. Among these genes are those encoding fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) and enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD), the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. Here we demonstrate that the orphan nuclear hormone receptor, RevErbα, modulates PPARα/RXRα- dependent transactivation in a response element-specific manner. In vitro binding analysis showed that RevErbα bound the HD-PPRE but not the AOx-PPRE. Determinants within the HD-PPRE required for RevErbα binding were distinct from those required for PPARα/RXRα binding. In transient transfections, RevErbα antagonized transactivation by PPARα/RXRα from an HD-PPRE luciferase reporter construct, whereas no effects were observed with an AOx-PPRE reporter construct. These data identify the HD gene as a target for RevErbα and illustrate cross-talk between the RevErbα and PPARα signaling pathways on the HD-PPRE.

PPREs consist of a direct repeat of the hexameric motif TGACC(T/C) separated by one nucleotide (DR1), and serve to bind not only PPARs but also several other nuclear hormone receptors that differentially modulate PPAR function.

Therefore, transcriptional regulation from PPREs is a net aggregate response generated in part by the availability of PPARs and other factors that bind PPREs, the complexity of response elements, and the interplay of PPARs with other nuclear hormone receptors and cofactors, including corepressors and coactivators. This complex interaction of various factors and elements ensures that the correct transcriptional response to extra- and intracellular stimuli will be elicited from appropriate target genes. RevErbα (also known as Ear1) (23Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily (24Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

Recently, the gene for rat apolipoprotein A1, as well as the CYP4A6 gene encoding a member of the cytochrome P450 fatty acid ω-hydroxylase family, have been shown to contain PPREs that bind, and are regulated by, RevErbα (17Vu-Dac N.

Unlike many nuclear hormone receptors that bind to response elements as hetero- and homodimers, RevErbα is a member of a growing subclass of receptors that includes steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), (32Ikeda Y.

Moreover, unlike many nuclear hormone receptors, RevErbα lacks a conserved carboxyl-terminal activation domain (AF2) (36Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Monomeric RevErbα binds to the TGACC(T/C) consensus half-site flanked by a 5-base A/T-rich region (23Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Considering the similarities between RevErbα and PPARα with respect to their consensus half-sites, tissue distribution, and putative biological functions, we investigated a possible role for RevErbα as an upstream regulatory factor for the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. The luciferase reporter plasmids pCPSluc, pHD(x3)luc, pM2(x3)luc, and pAOx(x2)luc, and the expression plasmids for rat PPARα and human RXRα, have been described previously (2Zhang B. Marcus S.L.

The expression plasmid for human RevErbα (RevErbα:SG5) was constructed by excision of the human RevErbα cDNA as a BamHI fragment from the plasmid pCMX:hRevErbα (a kind gift of H. P. Harding and M. A. Lazar) (23Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by cloning of the fragment in the correct orientation into the BamHI site of the plasmid pSG5 (Promega). Transcription/translation of cDNAs encoding PPARα, RXRα, and RevErbα was performed using the TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Translation products labeled withl-[35S]methionine were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Synthesis of proteins for use in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was carried out in parallel with unlabeled methionine. EMSA using in vitro translated proteins and radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes was carried out essentially as described (18Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the AOx-PPRE (5′-gatCCTTTCCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCCCTTTTGCTa and its complement) and to the HD-PPRE (5′-gatCCTCTCCTTTGACCTATTGAACTATTACCTACATTTGA and its complement) were annealed and end-labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. The underlined sequences indicate the TGACCT-like DRs. Combinations of lysates programmed for RXRα, PPARα, or RevErbα were incubated at room temperature with labeled probes in a final volume of 20 μl containing 6 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 120 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 7% (v/v) glycerol, 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 μg of nonspecific competitor DNA (poly(dI·dC) and sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1:1 weight ratio), 150 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The total amount of reticulocyte lysate in each reaction was kept constant by addition of unprogrammed lysate. Binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C on prerun 2.5 or 3.5% (as indicated) polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide/N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide weight ratio) with 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) or 1.0 × Tris borate-EDTA as running buffers, followed by autoradiography. Transfections were performed in African green monkey kidney BSC40 monolayer cells by the calcium phosphate method (2Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cells at 60–70% confluence were transfected in medium without phenol red and supplemented with 5% (v/v) charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Transfections were carried out with luciferase reporter constructs (pCPSluc, pHD(x3)luc, pM2(x3)luc, or pAOx(x2)luc) and expression plasmids for RXRα, PPARα, and RevErbα, as indicated. 2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was included in transfections as an internal reference. Effector plasmid dosage was kept constant by the addition of empty expression plasmid. Total DNA was kept constant at 20 μg/10-cm plate by the addition of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643 in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to fresh medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. An equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to control medium. Cells were harvested and lysates prepared 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was quantitated as described previously (2Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Both the HD- and AOx-PPREs contain potential binding sites for RevErbα (Fig.1 A). We therefore examined whether RevErbα is capable of binding to the HD- and AOx-PPREs by performing EMSA with radiolabeled PPRE probes and in vitrotranslated receptors. As expected, PPARα and RXRα bound as a heterodimer on the HD-PPRE (Fig. 1 B). RevErbα also bound the HD-PPRE, forming a complex with a mobility slightly less than that formed by the PPARα/RXRα heterodimer (Fig. 1 B). Inclusion of RXRα or PPARα with RevErbα in the binding reactions had no effect on the formation of the RevErbα·HD-PPRE complex. Moreover, coincubation of all three receptors with the HD-PPRE produced only two distinct complexes corresponding to PPARα/RXRα heterodimers and RevErbα monomers (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the three receptors do not co-occupy the HD-PPRE in some higher order complex, and RevErbα does not form complexes with PPARα or RXRα on this element in vitro under the EMSA conditions used. In contrast to the results obtained with the HD-PPRE, RevErbα was unable to bind to the AOx-PPRE. Furthermore, only the characteristic PPARα/RXRα heterodimer was generated on the AOx-PPRE when RevErbα was coincubated with PPARα and RXRα (Fig. 1 B). Binding of RevErbα to the HD-PPRE was specific, since the radiolabeled complex was refractory to competition by nonspecific unlabeled oligonucleotide but was eliminated by addition of unlabeled HD-PPRE oligonucleotide (data not shown). We next investigated whether binding by PPARα/RXRα to the HD-PPRE could be influenced by RevErbα and vice versa. EMSA was first performed using radiolabeled HD-PPRE, constant amounts of PPARα/RXRα, and increasing amounts of RevErbα (Fig.2 A). Increasing the amount of RevErbα did not affect binding of PPARα/RXRα to the HD-PPRE, but did result in greater amounts of RevErbα monomeric complex forming on the HD-PPRE. Conversely, when EMSA was performed with a constant amount of RevErbα, increasing the amounts of PPARα and RXRα led to increased formation of PPARα·RXRα complexes on the HD-PPRE, while the binding of RevErbα monomers was unaffected (Fig. 2 B). Similar findings were observed over a wide range of HD-PPRE probe concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that RevErbα and PPARα/RXRα bind independently to the HD-PPRE, and that RevErbα monomers and PPARα/RXRα heterodimers do not simultaneously occupy the HD-PPRE. The HD-PPRE consists of four half-sites (sites I-IV) related to the consensus TGACC(T/C) hexameric half-site. Each half-site of the HD-PPRE could potentially serve as a binding site for RevErbα. In order to determine the sequence requirements for RevErbα interaction, oligonucleotide probes harboring mutations in each of the four hexameric half-sites of the HD-PPRE were used in binding studies (Fig. 3). EMSA showed that mutations in sites I, III, and IV did not affect binding of RevErbα, either in the absence (data not shown) or presence of PPARα/RXRα. However, disruption of site II effectively abrogated RevErbα binding. This observation is consistent with the fact that site II most closely resembles the consensus sequence for RevErbα binding (Fig.1 A). Binding of PPARα/RXRα was found to require the integrity of sites III and IV but not of sites I and II (Fig. 3), as previously demonstrated (22Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31442-31448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Subramani S. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12939-12945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that RevErbα and PPARα/RXRα target distinct half-sites on the HD-PPRE. To investigate the in vivo properties of RevErbα on transcriptional regulation, we carried out transient transfection assays using luciferase reporter plasmids containing either the HD-PPRE (pHD(x3)luc) or the AOx-PPRE (pAOx(x2)luc), along with expression plasmids for RevErbα, PPARα, and/or RXRα in BSC40 African monkey kidney cells. These cells were chosen because they contain low levels of endogenous PPARα and RXRα (2Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection of PPARα and RXRα with the HD-PPRE reporter plasmid led to a 2-fold induction of transcription over basal levels in the absence of the peroxisome proliferator, Wy-14,643 (Fig. 4 A). Addition of proliferator led to a potent induction of transcription (10–15-fold) over basal levels. Increasing amounts of RevErbα expression plasmid inhibited transactivation from the HD-PPRE by PPARα/RXRα both in the presence and absence of peroxisome proliferator. Transactivation by PPARα/RXRα was reduced by 80% at the highest concentration of RevErbα expression plasmid used (2 μg). PPARα/RXRα also activated transcription of a reporter gene that contained the HD-PPRE harboring a disruption in site II; however, in this case, RevErbα-dependent inhibition was not observed (Fig. 4 B). This finding is in agreement within vitro binding data for RevErbα (see Fig. 3) and indicates that inhibition of PPARα/RXRα-mediated activation is dependent upon RevErbα binding to the HD-PPRE. RevErbα did not significantly affect transcriptional activation by PPARα/RXRα on the AOx-PPRE, in either the absence or presence of Wy-14,643 (Fig. 4 C). These data are in keeping with in vitro binding data showing that RevErbα failed to bind the AOx-PPRE (Fig. 1 B). Control transfections with the parental reporter construct pCPSluc, which lacks a PPRE, showed that the presence of RevErbα, PPARα, and RXRα did not influence basal levels of luciferase activity (data not shown), demonstrating the need for a functional PPRE for receptor activity. Together, these data show that RevErbα antagonizes transactivation by PPARα/RXRα specifically from the HD-PPRE. We were interested in determining whether increased amounts of PPARα and RXRα could modulate the repression exerted by RevErbα on transcription from the HD-PPRE. Transient transfections with a constant amount of RevErbα expression plasmid and increasing amounts of PPARα and RXRα expression plasmids demonstrated that the repressive effects of RevErbα could be alleviated in a dose-dependent manner by increasing amounts of PPARα and RXRα, either in the presence or absence of Wy-14,643 (Fig.5). These results suggest that the net transcriptional response from the HD-PPRE is influenced by the relative levels of PPARα, RXRα, and RevErbα in vivo. A number of recent observations have pointed to possible interplay between the RevErbα and PPARα signaling pathways. First, there is strong sequence similarity between the RevErbα consensus binding site and the PPREs of the AOx and HD genes. Second, a role for RevErbα in PPAR-mediated signaling has been suggested by studies showing that the PPRE of the CYP4A6 gene binds both RevErbα and PPARα (30Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that the PPARγ isoform, a key regulator of adipogenesis, may in turn be regulated by RevErbα, whose mRNA levels are dramatically increased during differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (24Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, RevErbα has been shown to be encoded on the opposite strand of thyroid hormone receptor α and to be able to bind the thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (27Miyajima N. Horiuchi R. Shibuya Y. Fukushige S. Matsubara K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Cell. 1989; 57: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and we have previously demonstrated cross-talk between thyroid hormone receptor α and PPARα in regulating transcription from the AOx-PPRE (20Hunter J. Kassam A. Winrow C.J. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a result of these observations, we considered the possibility of a role for RevErbα in regulating transcription from the AOx- and HD-PPREs. We have demonstrated here that the RevErbα and PPARα signaling pathways converge and that RevErbα serves to repress transcriptional activation specifically from the HD-PPRE. Interestingly, RevErbα had no effect on PPARα/RXRα-mediated activation via the AOx-PPRE. Consistent with this observation, RevErbα was shown to bind specifically to the HD-PPRE but not the AOx-PPRE. The HD-PPRE is comprised of four hexameric direct repeats arranged as two tandem DR1 arrays separated by two nucleotides (a DR2). This complex arrangement is thought to permit the interaction of a diverse array of nuclear hormone receptors with the HD-PPRE, thereby increasing the complexity of transcriptional regulation from this PPRE. RevErbα and PPARα/RXRα target distinct half-sites on the HD-PPRE. The integrity of site II is required for RevErbα binding, while sites III/IV serve to bind RXRα/PPARα. Site II was also required for the RevErbα-dependent repressive effects on transcriptional activation by PPARα/RXRα, indicating that inhibition requires binding of RevErbα to the HD-PPRE. Although sites III/IV have been shown to be essential and sufficient for PPARα/RXRα binding and activity (22Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31442-31448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Subramani S. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12939-12945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an arrangement in which PPARα/RXRα heterodimers are bound to both DR1 sites has been suggested to yield the highest level of transactivation (41Chu R.Y. Lin Y. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29636-29639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since RevErbα occupies site II within the HD-PPRE, this may preclude binding of PPARα/RXRα to the upstream DR1 element, resulting in reduced levels of transactivation from the HD-PPRE by PPARα/RXRα. Although RevErbα and PPARα/RXRα use distinct determinants on the HD-PPRE, we did not observe a higher order complex containing all three receptors in vitro. However, the limitation of our in vitro binding analysis does not preclude the possibility of a higher order complex forming among RevErbα, PPARα, and RXRαin vivo, perhaps through the cooperativity or association of regulatory cofactors such as SRC-1, p300, N-CoR, and SMRT-1 (42Hörlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamai Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 43Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 44DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.H. Ricote M. Ingrey S. Hörlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 45Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The involvement of such cofactors in transcriptional regulation by nuclear hormone receptors is well established. Indeed, N-CoR has been shown to interact with RevErbα in mammalian cells (38Zamir I. Hardin H.P. Atkins G.B. Hörlein A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A model can be proposed in which repression of transactivation by RevErbα is the result of a shift from active to repressive states of the receptor through its association with corepressors and dissociation from coactivators, respectively. RevErbα can also be envisioned to be subjected in vivo to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation that could initiate its repressive state. Interestingly, the amino terminus of RevErbα contains numerous serine and threonine residues that could potentially be phosphorylated (27Miyajima N. Horiuchi R. Shibuya Y. Fukushige S. Matsubara K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Cell. 1989; 57: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The ligand for RevErbα remains unknown. It is therefore impossible to ascertain at this time whether an endogenous ligand exists in BSC40 cells that could induce transcriptional repression upon binding RevErbα, as has been demonstrated for androstanol and the mCARβ receptor (46Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that RevErbα lacks the AF2 transactivation domain that is responsible for ligand binding (37Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), thus precluding the possibility of RevErbα having any capacity for ligand-dependent activation or repression (38Zamir I. Hardin H.P. Atkins G.B. Hörlein A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Orphan receptors lacking AF2 domains could instead act as competitors for ligand-inducible receptors (37Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and such a scenario has been proposed to explain the blocking of RZRα-mediated transactivation by RevErbα (25Forman B.M Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Retnakaran R. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the absence of an AF2 domain does not preclude the possibility that RevErbα contains undetected, and yet undefined, activation domains that could be revealed through interaction with a novel ligand (36Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). RevErbα could also potentially activate transcription by cooperative interaction with a non-AF2-dependent coactivator or, indirectly, by recruiting corepressors away from other nuclear receptors (38Zamir I. Hardin H.P. Atkins G.B. Hörlein A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). TRα and PPARα have been reported to form nonbinding heterodimers in vivo(20Hunter J. Kassam A. Winrow C.J. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 47Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D. Nikodem V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11683-11686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RevErbα could similarly form inactive, nonbinding complexes (36Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with PPARα, RXRα, or other nuclear receptors, effectively sequestering these receptors and preventing them from forming heterodimers that normally potentiate transcription, leading to an overall repression of transcription. However, we consider the latter scenario unlikely, since inhibition by RevErbα required the integrity of the HD-PPRE and had no effect on PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation via the AOx-PPRE. In summary, our results identify the gene encoding enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the second enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, as a target for RevErbα and demonstrate that this orphan nuclear hormone receptor serves as a negative modulator of PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation from the PPRE of this gene. Interestingly, Gervois et al. (48Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Laudet V. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that fibrate drugs, which are potent activators of PPARα, induce expression of the RevErbα gene through competition between RevErbα and PPARα/RXRα for binding to the autoregulatory RevDR2 site of the RevErbα gene. These results are in agreement with our findings that the repressive effects of RevErbα on the HD-PPRE can be overcome by increasing the concentration of PPARα/RXRα, and together, illustrate a convergence of the RevErbα and PPARα signaling pathways in gene regulation. Transcriptional control of peroxisomal β-oxidation involves a complex network of interacting regulatory factors that integrate a diverse array of host signaling pathways to determine a net transcriptional to a particular environmental or physiological cue. An understanding of the various transcriptional factors that control peroxisomal β-oxidation could provide for the development of pharmacological agents that specifically target this metabolic pathway as a means to modulate overall lipid metabolism.
