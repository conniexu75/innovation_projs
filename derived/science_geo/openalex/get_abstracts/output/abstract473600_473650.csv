Hao et al. (p. 720 , published online 24 October; see the cover) found that the presence of surface oxygen could limit the number of nucleation sites and allowed centimeter-scale domains to grow through a diffusion-limited mechanism. The electrical conductivity of the graphene was comparable to that of exfoliated graphene."

Such conditions can be achieved by shining light on a solid, but the effect is challenging to observe. Wang et al. (p. 453 ) used time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to photoexcite Bi 2 Se 3 and observe its dispersion at various delay times. The replicas were seen at expected energy shifts, along with the gaps predicted to occur at the new energy-level crossings caused by the appearance of the replicas. Because Bi 2 Se 3 is a topological insulator, the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry caused by circularly polarized light resulted in the appearance of an energy gap at the Dirac point, indicating an interesting route toward manipulating electronic states in such materials."

Le et al. (p. 731 , published online 24 October) analyzed the structure of the circular chromosome in the prokaryote Caulobacter crescentus by using chromosome conformation capture and deep-sequencing. Highly self-interacting regions (chromosomal interaction domains, or CIDs) were observed—similar to the topologically associated domains previously seen in eukaryotes. Supercoiling helped to establish CIDs, and CID boundaries were defined by highly expressed genes. CIDs appeared to be established during or shortly after DNA replication, and could potentially facilitate chromosomal segregation by preventing newly replicated chromosomes from becoming entangled."

https://openalex.org/W2022785470,"The Root of the Problem The quiescent center (QC) within the root meristem plays a key role as a stem cell organizer to sustain the root stem cell niche. The QC cells execute a dual role: prevention of the differentiation of neighboring stem cells, and maintenance of the root structure by undergoing only occasional cell division. The mechanisms that account for the low QC proliferation are unclear, although the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase is known to suppress QC cell division. Through a systematic functional analysis of APC/C-copurifying proteins, Heyman et al. (p. 860 ) characterized a transcription factor ERF115 as a rate-limiting factor for QC cell division. ERF115 needs to be destroyed to retain QC cells in a resting state. ERF115 operates in a brassinosteroid-dependent manner and controls QC cell division through transcriptional activation of phytosulfokine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2049479909,"Thermoelectric effects, such as the generation of a particle current by a temperature gradient, have their origin in a reversible coupling between heat and particle flows. These effects are fundamental probes for materials and have applications to cooling and power generation. Here we demonstrate thermoelectricity in a fermionic cold atoms channel, ballistic or diffusive, connected to two reservoirs. We show that the magnitude of the effect and the efficiency of energy conversion can be optimized by controlling the geometry or disorder strength. Our observations are in quantitative agreement with a theoretical model based on the Landauer-Bu ttiker formalism. Our device provides a controllable model-system to explore mechanisms of energy conversion and realizes a cold atom based heat engine."

https://openalex.org/W2089702499,"Objective Dravet syndrome is a severe form of intractable pediatric epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP: Sudden Unexpected Death in epilepsy. Cardiac arrhythmias are a proposed cause for some cases of SUDEP, yet the susceptibility and potential mechanism of arrhythmogenesis in Dravet syndrome remain unknown. The majority of Dravet syndrome patients have de novo mutations in SCN1A, resulting in haploinsufficiency. We propose that, in addition to neuronal hyperexcitability, SCN1A haploinsufficiency alters cardiac electrical function and produces arrhythmias, providing a potential mechanism for SUDEP. Methods Postnatal day 15-21 heterozygous SCN1A-R1407X knock-in mice, expressing a human Dravet syndrome mutation, were used to investigate a possible cardiac phenotype. A combination of single cell electrophysiology and in vivo electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were performed. Results We observed a 2-fold increase in both transient and persistent Na+ current density in isolated Dravet syndrome ventricular myocytes that resulted from increased activity of a tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ current, likely Nav1.5. Dravet syndrome myocytes exhibited increased excitability, action potential duration prolongation, and triggered activity. Continuous radiotelemetric ECG recordings showed QT prolongation, ventricular ectopic foci, idioventricular rhythms, beat-to-beat variability, ventricular fibrillation, and focal bradycardia. Spontaneous deaths were recorded in 2 DS mice, and a third became moribund and required euthanasia. Interpretation These data from single cell and whole animal experiments suggest that altered cardiac electrical function in Dravet syndrome may contribute to the susceptibility for arrhythmogenesis and SUDEP. These mechanistic insights may lead to critical risk assessment and intervention in human patients."
https://openalex.org/W1988556034,"Painful venoms are used to deter predators. Pain itself, however, can signal damage and thus serves an important adaptive function. Evolution to reduce general pain responses, although valuable for preying on venomous species, is rare, likely because it comes with the risk of reduced response to tissue damage. Bark scorpions capitalize on the protective pain pathway of predators by inflicting intensely painful stings. However, grasshopper mice regularly attack and consume bark scorpions, grooming only briefly when stung. Bark scorpion venom induces pain in many mammals (house mice, rats, humans) by activating the voltage-gated Na(+) channel Nav1.7, but has no effect on Nav1.8. Grasshopper mice Nav1.8 has amino acid variants that bind bark scorpion toxins and inhibit Na(+) currents, blocking action potential propagation and inducing analgesia. Thus, grasshopper mice have solved the predator-pain problem by using a toxin bound to a nontarget channel to block transmission of the pain signals the venom itself is initiating."

https://openalex.org/W2094311800,"Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues represent a valuable source for biomarker studies and clinical routine diagnostics. However, they suffer from degradation of nucleic acids due to the fixation process. Since genetic and epigenetic studies usually require PCR amplification, this degradation hampers its use significantly, impairing PCR robustness or necessitating short amplicons. In routine laboratory medicine a highly robust PCR performance is mandatory for the clinical utility of genetic and epigenetic biomarkers. Therefore, methods to improve PCR performance using DNA from FFPE tissue are highly desired and of wider interest. The effect of template DNA derived from FFPE tissues on PCR performance was investigated by means of qPCR and conventional PCR using PCR fragments of different sizes. DNA fragmentation was analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis. This study showed that poor PCR amplification was partly caused by inhibition of the DNA polymerase by fragmented DNA from FFPE tissue and not only due to the absence of intact template molecules of sufficient integrity. This PCR inhibition was successfully minimized by increasing the polymerase concentration, dNTP concentration and PCR elongation time thereby allowing for the robust amplification of larger amplicons. This was shown for genomic template DNA as well as for bisulfite-converted template DNA required for DNA methylation analyses. In conclusion, PCR using DNA from FFPE tissue suffers from inhibition which can be alleviated by adaptation of the PCR conditions, therefore allowing for a significant improvement of PCR performance with regard to variability and the generation of larger amplicons. The presented solutions to overcome this PCR inhibition are of tremendous value for clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine."

We recently showed the essentiality of ESX-3 for M. tuberculosis viability and proposed its involvement in iron and zinc metabolism. In this study we confirmed the role of ESX-3 in iron uptake and its involvement in the adaptation to low zinc environment in M. tuberculosis. Moreover, we unveiled functional differences between the ESX-3 roles in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis showing that in the latter ESX-3 is only involved in the adaptation to iron and not to zinc restriction. Finally, we also showed that in M. tuberculosis this secretion system is essential for iron and zinc homeostasis not only in conditions in which the concentrations of these metals are limiting but also in metal sufficient conditions."

The nuclear envelope is a barrier to large protein entry, and this process is regulated by intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and trans-nuclear potential. How β-catenin traverses the nuclear envelope is not well known. We hypothesized that Wnt/Ca2+ and Wnt/β-catenin pathways act in a coordinated manner and that [Ca2+]i release facilitates β-catenin entry into the nucleus in mammalian cells. In a live assay using calcium dyes in PC3 prostate cancer cells, six Wnt peptides (3A, 4, 5A, 7A, 9B, and 10B) mobilized [Ca2+]i but Wnt11 did not. Based upon dwell time (range = 15–30 s) of the calcium waveform, these Wnts could be classified into three classes: short, 3A and 5A; long, 7A and 10B; and very long, 4 and 9B. Wnt-activated [Ca2+]i release was followed by an increase in intranuclear calcium and the depolarization of both the cell and nuclear membranes, determined by using FM4-64. In cells treated with Wnts 5A, 9B, and 10B, paradigm substrates for each Wnt class, increased [Ca2+]i was followed by β-catenin translocation into the nucleus in PC3, MCF7, and 253J, prostate, breast, and bladder cancer cell lines; both the increase in Wnt 5A, 9B, and 10B induced [Ca2+]i release and β-catenin translocation are suppressed by thapsigargin in PC3 cell line.

https://openalex.org/W1984071676,"Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are pluripotent cells that have the capacity to differentiate into tendon fibroblasts (TFs). They are abundant in adults, easy to access, and are therefore an ideal cell source for tendon tissue engineering. Despite this potential, the molecular cues necessary for tenogenic differentiation of ASCs are unknown. Unlike other bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), BMP12, BMP13, and BMP14 have been reported to be less osteo-chondrogenic and to induce tendon rather than bone formation in vivo. This study investigated the effects of BMP12 and BMP14 on ASC differentiation in vitro. In canine ASCs, BMP12 effectively increased the expression of the tendon markers scleraxis and tenomodulin at both mRNA and protein levels. Consistent with these results, BMP12 induced scleraxis promoter driven-GFP and tenomodulin protein expression in mouse ASCs. Although BMP12 also enhanced the expression of the cartilage matrix gene aggrecan in ASCs, the resulting levels remained considerably lower than those detected in tendon fibroblasts. In addition, BMP12 reduced expression of the bone marker osteocalcin, but not the osteogenic transcription factor runx-2. BMP14 exhibited similar, but marginally less potent and selective effects, compared to BMP12. BMPs are known to signal through the canonical Smad pathway and the non-canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. BMP12 triggered robust phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 but not Smad2/3 or p38 MAPK in ASCs. The effect was likely conveyed by type I receptors ALK2/3/6, as phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 was blocked by the ALK2/3/6 inhibitor LDN-193189 but not by the ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB-505124. Moreover, ALK6 was found to be the most abundant type I receptor in ASCs, with mRNA expression 100 to 10,000 times that of any other type I receptor. Collectively, results support the conclusion that BMP12 induces tenogenic differentiation of ASCs via the Smad1/5/8 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2028947895,"Curcumin, the active principle present in the yellow spice turmeric, has been shown to exhibit various pharmacological actions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-carcinogenic activities. Previously we have reported that dietary curcumin delays diabetes-induced cataract in rats. However, low peroral bioavailability is a major limiting factor for the success of clinical utilization of curcumin. In this study, we have administered curcumin encapsulated nanoparticles in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic cataract model. Oral administration of 2 mg/day nanocurcumin was significantly more effective than curcumin in delaying diabetic cataracts in rats. The significant delay in progression of diabetic cataract by nanocurcumin is attributed to its ability to intervene the biochemical pathways of disease progression such as protein insolubilization, polyol pathway, protein glycation, crystallin distribution and oxidative stress. The enhanced performance of nanocurcumin can be attributed probably to its improved oral bioavailability. Together, the results of the present study demonstrate the potential of nanocurcumin in managing diabetic cataract."

The aims of this study were to assess whether citation classics exist in published systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM), examine the characteristics of the most frequently cited SRM articles, and evaluate the contribution of different world regions.The 100 most cited SRM were identified in October 2012 using the Science Citation Index database of the Institute for Scientific Information. Data were extracted by one author. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the association between years since publication, numbers of authors, article length, journal impact factor, and average citations per year.Among the 100 citation classics, published between 1977 and 2008, the most cited article received 7308 citations and the least-cited 675 citations. The average citations per year ranged from 27.8 to 401.6. First authors from the USA produced the highest number of citation classics (n=46), followed by the UK (n=28) and Canada (n=15). The 100 articles were published in 42 journals led by the Journal of the American Medical Association (n=18), followed by the British Medical Journal (n=14) and The Lancet (n=13). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between number of authors (Spearman's rho=0.320, p=0.001), journal impact factor (rho=0.240, p=0.016) and average citations per year. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between average citations per year and year since publication (rho = -0.636, p=0.0001). The most cited papers identified seminal contributions and originators of landmark methodological aspects of SRM and reflect major advances in the management of and predisposing factors for chronic diseases.Since the late 1970s, the USA, UK, and Canada have taken leadership in the production of citation classic papers. No first author from low or middle-income countries (LMIC) led one of the most cited 100 SRM."

The CRY proteins are part of a large repressive complex, the components of which are not completely known. Using mass spectroscopy, we identified the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase as a CRY-interacting protein and found that loss or inhibition of this kinase results in circadian rhythms with abnormally long periods. We then identified serine 588 in the C-terminal tail of mouse CRY1 as a potential DNA-PK phosphorylation site but surprisingly found that the phosphomimetic mutation S588D also results in long period rhythms, similar to the loss of DNA-PK. Consistent with this, we found that phosphorylation of this site is increased in cells lacking DNA-PK, suggesting that DNA-PK negatively regulates the phosphorylation of this site most likely through indirect means. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of this site increases the stability of the CRY1 protein and prevents FBXL3-mediated degradation. The phosphorylation of this site is robustly rhythmic in mouse liver nuclei, peaking in the middle of the circadian day at a time when CRY1 levels are declining. Therefore, these data suggest a new role for the C-terminal tail of CRY1 in which phosphorylation rhythmically regulates CRY1 stability and contributes to the proper circadian period length.

https://openalex.org/W2044546215,"Fluorescent protein-based sensors for detecting neuronal activity have been developed largely based on non-neuronal screening systems. However, the dynamics of neuronal state variables (e.g., voltage, calcium, etc.) are typically very rapid compared to those of non-excitable cells. We developed an electrical stimulation and fluorescence imaging platform based on dissociated rat primary neuronal cultures. We describe its use in testing genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). Efficient neuronal GECI expression was achieved using lentiviruses containing a neuronal-selective gene promoter. Action potentials (APs) and thus neuronal calcium levels were quantitatively controlled by electrical field stimulation, and fluorescence images were recorded. Images were segmented to extract fluorescence signals corresponding to individual GECI-expressing neurons, which improved sensitivity over full-field measurements. We demonstrate the superiority of screening GECIs in neurons compared with solution measurements. Neuronal screening was useful for efficient identification of variants with both improved response kinetics and high signal amplitudes. This platform can be used to screen many types of sensors with cellular resolution under realistic conditions where neuronal state variables are in relevant ranges with respect to timing and amplitude."

Accumulation of misfolded or partially degraded proteins can lead to the formation of pathological protein aggregates. Here we report the use of destabilizing domains, proteins whose folding state can be reversibly tuned using a high affinity ligand, as model substrates to interrogate cellular protein quality control mechanisms in mammalian cells using a forward genetic screen. Upon knockdown of UBE3C, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a reporter protein consisting of a destabilizing domain fused to GFP is degraded more slowly and incompletely by the proteasome. Partial proteolysis is also observed when UBE3C is present but cannot ubiquitinate substrates because its active site has been mutated, it is unable to bind to the proteasome, or the substrate lacks lysine residues. UBE3C knockdown also results in less substrate polyubiquitination. Finally, knockdown renders cells more susceptible to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG, suggesting that UBE3C protects against the harmful accumulation of protein fragments arising from incompletely degraded proteasome substrates.

Modern understanding of the mechanisms that govern the transcription and translation of the genetic code have led to well developed models for protein synthesis. However, maintenance of protein homeostasis achieved through degradation of these proteins remains less thoroughly understood. Although we may understand how proteins are turned over in some individual cases, the general principles governing recognition and degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins are not well characterized. Proteins can misfold for a number of reasons, including chemical or heat stress, transcription or translation errors, viral infection, and mutations in the encoding DNA. Such events commonly expose hydrophobic regions that are prone to aggregation (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Regardless of the source of this insult, cells must contend with the resulting misfolded protein via degradation, sequestration, or secretion as aggregation of these proteins can impair cellular function. Protein aggregates have been implicated in many human pathologies including Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Opinion. What is the role of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cellular protein quality control and degradation is central to basic biology and may provide insights into human disease. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is one of the most well characterized pathways for protein degradation (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, the domain architecture of substrates can influence the nature of processivity, as a substrate with a particularly stable domain downstream of a degradation initiation region can “protect” less stable downstream domains that would be degraded were their positions to be swapped (18Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. ATP-dependent proteases degrade their substrates by processively unraveling them from the degradation signal.Mol.

We have developed a class of chemical biological tools called destabilizing domains (DDs) that confer small molecule ligand-dependent stability to any fused protein of interest (21Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.-C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules.Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the absence of stabilizing ligand, the DDs become unfolded, ubiquitinated, and then rapidly processed by the proteasome in a processive manner that results in degradation of the entire fusion (22Egeler E.L. Urner L.M. Rakhit R. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J. Ligand-switchable substrates for a ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Biol.

The addition (and/or subsequent removal) of different amounts of ligand allows DD levels to be reversibly tuned. Three such domains, based on human FK506-binding protein (FKBP), Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and human estrogen receptor ligand binding domain have been developed to date (21Banaszynski L.A.

The use of small molecules gives us precise control over how and when our substrate unfolds without the need for other nonspecific perturbations such as heat shock, chemical stressors, or translation inhibition. In an effort to better understand the process of DD degradation from recognition of the unfolded state to ubiquitination to degradation, we conducted a focused siRNA screen including all putative members of the chaperone family, the ubiquitin conjugation pathway, and motor proteins. We found that depletion of the protein UBE3C significantly reduces the rate of DD degradation. UBE3C is a 126-kDa member of the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. These ligases form a covalent thioester bond with Ub using a conserved cysteine residue in the HECT domain before transferring Ub to substrates. Prior studies reported that UBE3C associates with the proteasome and assembles Lys-29- and Lys-48-linked polyUb chains (32Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M.

Furthermore, a mutation in the HECT domain of UBE3C was recently identified in a study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) mutations (40O'Roak B.J. Vives L. Girirajan S. Karakoc E. Krumm N. Coe B.P.

Sporadic autism exomes reveal a highly interconnected protein network of de novo mutations.Nature. 2012; 485: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). We report that UBE3C contributes to proteasome processivity by ubiquitinating substrates that are difficult for the proteasome to process, facilitating their complete degradation. This activity is important for cell fitness under conditions of protein folding stress, and an attenuation of this activity may be pathologically relevant in ASD. HeLa S3 (ATCC CCL-2.2) and ΦNX-eco cells (Nolan lab, Stanford University) were cultured in growth media (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Retrovirus was produced by transfecting ΦNX-eco cells with pBMN and pCL-ampho vectors at a 2:1 mass ratio using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and concentrated 10-fold using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (100 kDa molecular weight cutoff). HeLa S3 cells were infected at 37 °C overnight with concentrated viral supernatants containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Infected cells were either sorted by FACS or selected using appropriate drug 48–72 h post-infection. siRNA was purchased as On-Target Plus SMARTpools from Dharmacon with the exception of siUBE3C, where use of the pool was replaced with one specific siRNA reagent after pool deconvolution (J-007183-07-0002). Dharmafect IV (Dharmacon) was added to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. An equal volume of Opti-MEM containing siRNA was mixed with the Dharmafect solution to give a siRNA concentration of 50 nm and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. This mixture was then mixed with an equal volume of growth media containing 80,000 cells/ml to achieve a final siRNA concentration of 25 nm, then plated. 96-, 24-, or 12-well plates contained 0.25, 1, or 2 μl of Dharmafect in a final well volume of 100, 500, or 1000 μl, respectively. Medium was changed 12–24 h after transfection. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in culture media, then analyzed at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility using LSRII with 10,000 events represented. For cells in 96-well format, samples were brought to final volumes of 50 μl and transferred to 96-well U-bottom plates, then analyzed using the BD Biosciences High-Throughput Sampler. Typically a 10-μl sample volume was collected (representing 1000–5000 events). For cells in 24-well or larger format, samples were brought to final volumes of 200–300 μl and analyzed in FACS tubes. The GFP/mCherry ratio for each siRNA sample was divided by the GFP/mCherry ratio for non-targeting siRNA (NTsi). This -fold increase over control was used as the score. Cells were washed once with conditioned media (growth media supplemented with purified recombinant protein) then incubated with conditioned media for the remainder of the washout period. For DD-GFP cells, conditioned media contained 5 μm FKBP protein with the F36V mutation (22Egeler E.L. Urner L.M. Rakhit R. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J.

For DD*-GFP cells, conditioned media contained 5 μm E. coli DHFR protein. For HA-DD-GFP-DD*-FLAG cells, conditioned media contained either 5 μm FKBP(F36V) protein and 10 μm trimethoprim (TMP; for S1 washout) or 5 μm E. coli DHFR protein and 1 μm S1 (for TMP washout). For DD-DHFR cells, conditioned media contained 5 μm FKBP(F36V) protein and 5 μm methotrexate (MTX) or 0.1% DMSO. Cells were harvested, and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (22Egeler E.L. Urner L.M. Rakhit R. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J.

Antibodies were anti-FLAG (mouse, F1804, Sigma), anti-GAPDH (mouse, 6C5, Abcam), anti-GFP (mouse, JL-8, Clontech), anti-HA (rat, 3F10, Rochel), anti-tubulin (mouse, DM1A, Sigma), and anti-UBE3C (rabbit, N1N3, GeneTex). Confluent cells in 10-cm dishes were washed with PBS then cross-linked using 2 ml of 0.25% formaldehyde in PBS for 7 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched by removing the formaldehyde solution and adding 2 ml of ice-cold 1.25 m glycine in PBS and incubating for 5 min. Cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer on ice for 45 min. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Lysates were precleared by incubating with 10 μl of washed Pierce Protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-PSMD2 antibody (Bethyl A303–853A) for 4 h at 4 °C. The antibody complex was then added to 10 μl of washed Pierce Protein A/G-agarose beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The unbound protein fraction was reserved for analysis, then beads were washed 3 times with PBS. Protein was eluted, and cross-linking was reversed by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 30 min. Samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells expressing DD-GFP were harvested, lysed (with or without Usp2 treatment), incubated with agarose beads conjugated to hPLIC2 UBA domain, washed, and eluted as previously described (22Egeler E.L. Urner L.M. Rakhit R. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J. Ligand-switchable substrates for a ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Biol.

Cells expressing either GFP or mCherry were transfected in 24-well format with siUBE3C or NTsi, respectively, and left overnight in transfection media. Cells were then trypsinized and mixed in 12-well plates. DMSO or 100 nm 17-AAG was added to wells at various times so that all cells could be analyzed by flow cytometry together 72 h after transfection. The ratios of the number of GFP-positive cells to the number of mCherry-positive cells was normalized to the starting ratio. Total RNA was prepared from ∼5 × 106 HeLa cells using RNeasy (Qiagen). SuperScript III (Invitrogen) was then used to generate a cDNA library. DyNAzyme EXT (Thermo) was then used to amplify a region of each gene of interest by PCR. A second PCR amplification with DyNAzyme was then carried out to add T7 polymerase sites to each gene of interest. T7 mixed with pyrophosphatase (Meyer laboratory, Stanford University) was then used to transcribe dsRNA, which was then treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and diced with Giardia Dicer (Teruel lab, Stanford University). Diced RNA products were purified using Purelink RNA Mini columns (Ambion) and eluted in water. In a 96-well U-bottom plate, diced siRNA was mixed with 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at a final RNA concentration of 5 nm and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 50 μl of growth media containing 5000 HeLa cells was then mixed with the lipid complex in a 96-well culture plate and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then cultured normally. 24 h post-transfection, media was replaced with growth media. 72 h post-transfection, cells were analyzed. 1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO at 75 mm, then diluted in PBS to 10 mm. This working stock was added to culture media to reach a final concentration of 250 μm. HeLa cells were stained with ANS for 1 h, then imaged on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. Frozen cell pellets (containing 107 HeLa cells each) were resuspended in 500 μl of 8 m urea, then sonicated (Bioruptor UCD-200) for 15 min (high power, 15 s on, 15 s off). The samples were then agitated at room temperature for 15 min and then sonicated again as before. A 100-μl aliquot of the sample was removed for processing, and the rest was stored at −80 °C. The cell lysate was then diluted to 2 m urea with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and the total protein was quantified with a BCA kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). 1 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Soltec Ventures) was then added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and samples were agitated for 30 min at 37 °C, then cooled to room temperature. Alkylation was performed by adding 1 m iodoacetamide (Sigma) to a final concentration of 15 mm, then agitating samples for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Next, the lysate was diluted to 1 m urea with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, upon which heavy standard peptides and sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, catalog #V5113) were added (1 μl of synthetic peptide mixture/10 μg of protein, and 1 μg of trypsin/100 μg of protein). The protein solution was agitated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were purified using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters) and lyophilized before being solubilized in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. Peptides (either two or three unique per protein, JPT Peptide Technologies) were separated on an EASY-nLC Nano-HPLC system (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) and were introduced to the TSQ Vantage triple quadrupole MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) via electrospray ionization and analyzed in selected reaction monitoring mode. The peptide separation was carried out using a 25 × 0.1-mm C18 trapping column (MICHROM C18, 5 μm, 120 Å) and a 200 × 0.075-mm diameter reverse-phase C18 capillary column (Maisch C18, 3 μm, 120 Å). Peptides (2 μg of total protein digest) were separated with a linear gradient from 0 to 45% acetonitrile in 70 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Precursor and fragment ions were targeted for their corresponding heavy and light peptides. Endogenous peptides were quantified by the ratio of the areas between the light (endogenous) and heavy (synthetic standard) peptides peaks, with five biological replicates. Given that DDs are known to be substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (21Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.-C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J.

https://openalex.org/W2102034867,"The Bcl-2 family proteins regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through intricate molecular mechanisms. One of the pro-apoptotic proteins, tBid, can induce apoptosis by promoting Bax activation, Bax homo-oligomerization, and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Association of tBid on the mitochondrial outer membrane is key to its biological function. Therefore knowing the conformation of tBid on the membrane will be the first step toward understanding its crucial role in triggering apoptosis. Here, we present NMR characterization of the structure and dynamics of human tBid in 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-RAC-(1-glycerol)] micelles. Our data showed that tBid is monomeric with six well defined α-helices in the micelles. Compared with the full-length Bid structure, a longer flexible loop between tBid helix α4 and α5 was observed. Helices in tBid do not pack into a compact-fold but form an extended structure with a C-shape configuration in the micelles. All six tBid helices were shown to interact with LPPG micelles, with helix α6 and α7 being more embedded. Of note, the BH3-containing helix α3, which was previously believed to be exposed above the membrane surface, is also membrane associated, suggesting an ""on the membrane"" binding mode for tBid interaction with Bax. Our data provided structural details on the membrane-associated state of tBid and the functional implications of its membrane-associated BH3 domain."

Depletion of phosphoinositides via Ca2+-induced activation of PLC has been shown to be a major factor in desensitization of TRPV1 (3Lukacs V. Thyagarajan B. Varnai P. Balla A. Balla T. Rohacs T.

Despite the clear positive regulation of TRPV1 activity by phosphoinositides both in excised patches and intact cells, there are data supporting the existence of a concurrent, partial inhibitory effect of PI(4,5)P2 in intact cells (3Lukacs V.

Chronic alteration in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate levels regulates capsaicin and mustard oil responses.J. Neurosci. Res. 2011; 89: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lack of data demonstrating that PI(4,5)P2 inhibits TRPV1 in excised patches suggested that this effect may be indirect (12Gamper N. Rohacs T. Phosphoinositide sensitivity of ion channels, a functional perspective.Subcell Biochem. 2012; 59: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In a recent study, TRPV1 was purified and functionally reconstituted in artificial liposomes of defined composition (13Cao E. Cordero-Morales J.F. Liu B. Qin F. Julius D. TRPV1 channels are intrinsically heat sensitive and negatively regulated by phosphoinositide lipids.Neuron. 2013; 77: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Two key findings of the study with respect to phosphoinositide regulation of these channels were as follows: 1) TRPV1 was fully active in the absence of any phosphoinositides; 2) when the phosphoinositides PI, PI(4)P, or PI(4,5)P2 were added to the lipid mix, the capsaicin dose-response curve was shifted to the right, i.e. the channel was partially inhibited by these lipids. These findings suggest direct inhibition by PI(4,5)P2 and no dependence of activity on phosphoinositides. Can these findings be reconciled with earlier excised patch data? To address this apparent contradiction, we studied TRPV1 behavior in excised patches, taking advantage of the intrinsic lipid kinase and phosphatase activities in the patch membrane that can be stimulated with MgATP (14Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Regulation of cardiac Na+,Ca2+ exchange and KATP potassium channels by PIP2.Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 15Zakharian E. Cao C. Rohacs T. Intracellular ATP supports TRPV6 activity via lipid kinases and the generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 3915-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This technique studies the effects of endogenous phosphoinositides and avoids application of exogenous lipids, which have been argued to cause non-physiological effects (13Cao E. Cordero-Morales J.F. Liu B. Qin F. Julius D. TRPV1 channels are intrinsically heat sensitive and negatively regulated by phosphoinositide lipids.Neuron. 2013; 77: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 16Hilgemann D.W. Fitting KV potassium channels into the PIP2 puzzle: Hille group connects dots between illustrious HH groups.J. Gen. Physiol. 2012; 140: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We also re-examined the lipid specificity of the channel and found that, in addition to phosphoinositides, TRPV1 was activated by a variety of negatively charged lipids, including phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as other negatively charged lipids, such as oleoyl-CoA and the artificial lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl] (DGS-NTA). This may explain the lack of requirement for phosphoinositides in reconstituted vesicles that contained high concentrations of PG (13Cao E. Cordero-Morales J.F. Liu B. Qin F. Julius D. TRPV1 channels are intrinsically heat sensitive and negatively regulated by phosphoinositide lipids.Neuron. 2013; 77: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when we reconstituted TRPV1 in planar lipid bilayers consisting of neutral lipids, capsaicin-induced activity depended on the presence of PI(4,5)P2. Our data may reconcile discordant data obtained in various experimental settings, and we conclude that in cellular membranes TRPV1 activity depends on the presence of PI(4,5)P2. Excised inside-out patch clamp measurements were performed as described previously (3Lukacs V. Thyagarajan B. Varnai P. Balla A. Balla T. Rohacs T. Dual regulation of TRPV1 by phosphoinositides.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7070-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with the cRNA of TRPV1 transcribed from the rat TRPV1 clone in the pGEMSH vector. Measurements were performed 5–7 days after injection, using borosilicate glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments) of 0.4–0.7 megohm resistance, filled with a solution containing the following: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), substituted with 0.2 μm, 0.5 μm, or 4 μm capsaicin (as indicated in figure legends). For experiments with TRPV6, we used a pipette solution devoid of capsaicin, consisting of the following: 96 mm LiCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES, (pH 7.4). After establishing gigaohm resistance seals on devitellinized surfaces of oocytes, inside-out configuration was established, and currents were measured using a ramp protocol from −100 to +100 mV applied every second. The main perfusing solution contained the following: 96 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.4. Currents were amplified with an Axopatch 200B unit and analyzed with the pClamp software (version 9.2, Molecular Devices). Measurements were performed at 18–20 °C. Various stimulating solutions were applied to the internal side of the inside-out membrane patch using a custom-made, gravity-driven micro-perfusion system. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing TRPV1 tagged with the Myc epitope on its N terminus were grown to 70–80% confluence, washed, and collected with cold PBS. Cells were harvested and resuspended in NCB buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.5), with addition of 1 mm of the protease inhibitor PMSF and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Then, the cells were lysed by the freeze-thawing method and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 2.5 h, and the pellet was resuspended in NCB buffer with addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% Nonidet P40 (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5% dodecyl maltoside (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA). The suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with gentle agitation and then centrifuged for 1 h at 40,000 g. Further, the TRPV1 protein was purified by immunoprecipitation using AG-protein magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) conjugated with the Myc antibodies. Protein was eluted from the beads with Myc peptide (150 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). All steps of purification were performed at 4 °C. The purified protein ran on SDS gels mainly as a tetramer, see Fig. 6F. Planar lipid bilayer experiments were performed as described earlier (17Zakharian E. Cao C. Rohacs T. Gating of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels activated by cold and chemical agonists in planar lipid bilayers.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12526-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Bilayers were formed from a solution of synthetic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (phosphatidylcholine, PC, or POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (phosphatidylethanolamine, PE or POPE) in a 3:1 ratio in n-decane (Sigma-Aldrich). The solution was used to paint a bilayer in an aperture of ∼150 μm diameter in a Delrin cup (Warner Instruments) between symmetric aqueous bathing solutions of 150 mm KCl, 0.02 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), at 22 °C. Bilayer capacitances were in the range of 50–75 pF. The purified TRPV1 protein derived in dodecyl-maltoside micelles was incorporated into lipid micelles consisting of a mixture of POPC/POPE (3:1, v/v). After the bilayers were formed, 0.2 μl of the TRPV1 micellar solution (0.001 μg/ml) was painted to the aperture with an air bubble glass capillary. Unitary currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Currents through the voltage-clamped bilayers (background conductance < 3 pS) were filtered at the amplifier output (low pass, −3 dB at 10 kHz, 8-pole Bessel response). Data were secondarily filtered at 100 Hz through an 8-pole Bessel filter (950 TAF; Frequency Devices, Ottawa, IL) and digitized at 1 kHz using an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1322A; Molecular Devices) controlled by pClamp (version 9, Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed using the Clampfit software (version 9, Molecular Devices). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). Dioctanoyl (DiC8) phosphoinositides were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Capsaicin, oleoyl-CoA, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) were purchased from Sigma, the latter in two different preparations, both as a powder, and as a glycerol containing solution. The following were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL): arachidonyl-stearyl (AASt) phosphoinositides; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (phosphatidylserine, PS, or POPS); 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-1′-rac-glycerol (phosphatidylglycerol, PG or POPG); POPC; POPE; and DGS-NTA. Long acyl chain phospholipids that were applied at high concentrations, such as PG, PS, PC and PI are poorly soluble in water and form micelles in aqueous solutions, resulting in visible turbidity at the nominal concentrations applied in our experiments (250–500 μm). Extensive sonication of these solutions was necessary for their effects to be reliable; we used an Ultrasonic Homogenizer model 3000 V/T (Biologics, Inc). During the course of an experimental day, we found that resonication of these solutions approximately every 1–1.5 h resulted in more reproducible effects of these lipids. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.; statistical significance is calculated with t test; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. We studied TRPV1 channels in large excised inside-out patches in Xenopus oocytes with capsaicin in the patch pipette. After excision, we usually observed a small transient increase of TRPV1 currents (presumably due to differences in ionic composition of the bath solution and the intracellular environment of the cell), followed invariably by a decrease in channel activity to 10–15% of the cell-attached levels in ∼2–3 min, termed run-down (Fig. 1, A and C–F). Run-down is characteristic of PI(4,5)P2-dependent ion channels and is generally assumed to reflect dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 by lipid phosphatases associated with the patch membrane (18Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gβγ.Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed in the presence of 0.2 μm capsaicin in the patch pipette. With 4 μm capsaicin in the patch pipette, run-down was much slower and usually incomplete within 5 min (Fig. 1, F and G). The velocity of run-down has been shown earlier to inversely correlate with the apparent affinity of phosphoinositide-sensitive channels to PI(4,5)P2 (18Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gβγ.Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 19Du X. Zhang H. Lopes C. Mirshahi T. Rohacs T. Logothetis D.E. Characteristic interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate determine regulation of Kir channels by diverse modulators.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37271-37281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This inverse correlation is consistent with our earlier finding that capsaicin increases the apparent affinity of the channel for PI(4,5)P2 (3Lukacs V. Thyagarajan B. Varnai P. Balla A. Balla T. Rohacs T. Dual regulation of TRPV1 by phosphoinositides.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7070-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In most experiments, we used 0.2 or 0.5 μm capsaicin, a condition under which substantial run-down was observed within 2–3 min (Fig. 1F). Fig. 1A shows that after run-down, channel activity could be restored by the application of MgATP. This, again, is a characteristic of PI(4,5)P2-dependent ion channels (18Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gβγ.Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 20Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Activation of the atrial KACh channel by the betagamma subunits of G proteins or intracellular Na+ ions depends on the presence of phosphatidylinositol phosphates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that MgATP exerts its effect via lipid kinases, we used LY294002 to inhibit PI4K. This drug selectively inhibits PI3K at low concentrations and also inhibits type-III PI4Ks at high concentrations (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1, C–E, LY294002 inhibited the effect of MgATP at 300 μm but not at 10 μm, where the drug selectively inhibits PI3Ks. This result suggests that MgATP exerts its effect by generation of phosphoinositides via PI4K. Intracellular ATP has been described to have a direct positive effect on TRPV1, an effect which does not require Mg2+ (21Kwak J. Wang M.H. Hwang S.W. Kim T.Y. Lee S.Y. Oh U. Intracellular ATP increases capsaicin-activated channel activity by interacting with nucleotide-binding domains.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8298-8304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lishko P.V. Procko E. Jin X. Phelps C.B. Gaudet R. The ankyrin repeats of TRPV1 bind multiple ligands and modulate channel sensitivity.Neuron. 2007; 54: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We also saw a quickly developing effect of ATP (4 mm) in the absence of Mg2+ (data not shown). Our MgATP solutions contained 2 mm Mg2+ and 2 mm ATP, in which the free ATP and free Mg2+ concentrations were 0.43 mm and 0.31 mm, respectively (MaxChelator). In our study, this concentration of MgATP had a negligible direct effect, judged by the essential absence of quickly developing currents. This could be due to either the low free ATP concentration or the direct inhibition by free Mg2+, see the occasional quick increase in current amplitudes after wash out of MgATP (Figs. 1G and 2A). Next, we tested a bacterial PI-PLC directly applied to excised patches. PI-PLC selectively hydrolyzes PI without any direct effect on PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P2 (14Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Regulation of cardiac Na+,Ca2+ exchange and KATP potassium channels by PIP2.Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 20Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Activation of the atrial KACh channel by the betagamma subunits of G proteins or intracellular Na+ ions depends on the presence of phosphatidylinositol phosphates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). If MgATP acted as a substrate for lipid kinases to generate phosphoinositides, cleaving the phosphoinositide precursor PI would eliminate its effect (Fig. 1B), as we showed earlier with TRPV6 channels (15Zakharian E. Cao C. Rohacs T. Intracellular ATP supports TRPV6 activity via lipid kinases and the generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 3915-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). First, we dissolved the enzyme in bath solution, and even though it inhibited the effect of MgATP on TRPV1, the data were quite variable, with a general tendency to lose activity over time even in control experiments with TRPV6 (data not shown). To stabilize PI-PLC, we supplemented the solution with 0.05% BSA, which prevents it from adsorbing to the walls of the tubes, as recommended by the supplier. Fig. 2, A–D, shows that pretreatment with PI-PLC almost completely prevented the effect of MgATP. PI-PLC treatment by itself also induced a partial reactivation of TRPV1 after run-down, consistent with earlier results (1Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Bradykinin and nerve growth factor release the capsaicin receptor from PtdIns(4,5)P2-mediated inhibition.Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). PI-PLC did not increase the activity of TRPV6, but it also prevented the reactivating effect of MgATP (Fig. 2, E–H), consistent with earlier reports (15Zakharian E. Cao C. Rohacs T. Intracellular ATP supports TRPV6 activity via lipid kinases and the generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 3915-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since PI-PLC did not increase TRPV1 activity substantially when we dissolved it without BSA (data not shown), we also tested a different preparation of PI-PLC, supplied as a glycerol-containing stock solution, see methods, which does not require BSA for stabilization. This preparation of PI-PLC behaved very similarly to the previous one, i.e. it partially activated TRPV1 and eliminated the effect of MgATP (Fig. 3). These data show that the partial activation by PI-PLC is not due to the presence of BSA, but likely requires high activity of the enzyme. It could be argued that PI-PLC activated TRPV1 by removing the inhibitory PI. To test this possibility, we applied long acyl chain natural AASt PI after PI-PLC treatment. PI failed to significantly re-inhibit channel activity, arguing that PI-PLC did not increase channel activity by eliminating the putative inhibitory effect of PI. It did, however, partially restore the effect of MgATP (Fig. 3B and D), demonstrating that the lipid indeed incorporated into the patch membrane. Our data so far are consistent with the dependence of TRPV1 activity on PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 in the context of the plasma membrane. We had previously found that TRPV1 is activated not only by PI(4,5)P2, but also by a variety of other phosphoinositides, such as PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 (3Lukacs V. Thyagarajan B. Varnai P. Balla A. Balla T. Rohacs T. Dual regulation of TRPV1 by phosphoinositides.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7070-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This lack of specificity is reminiscent of the nonspecific activation of KATP channels (Kir6.2) by phosphoinositides (23Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Ramdya P.P. Molnár Z. Logothetis D.E. Specificity of activation by phosphoinositides determines lipid regulation of Kir channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Those channels are activated in excised patches not only by phosphoinositides, but also by other negatively charged lipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), when they are applied at high concentrations (24Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Anionic phospholipids activate ATP-sensitive potassium channels.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To test whether TRPV1 behaves similarly to KATP channels in this respect, we tested the effects of various negatively charged lipids on TRPV1. Fig. 4B shows that 250 μm phosphatidylglycerol (PG) slowly but consistently reactivated TRPV1 after run-down in the presence of 0.5 μm capsaicin in the patch pipette. The slow onset of the effect is consistent with the necessity of incorporation of PG micelles into the patch membrane. Lower concentrations of PG were less efficient, and at this high concentration, the lipid needed to be repeatedly sonicated shortly before the experiment to obtain reproducible effects, see “Experimental Procedures.” We retested the effect of PI at a higher concentration (500 μm) and, after more thorough sonication, we found that this lipid could also reactivate TRPV1 (Fig. 4C). PS, another negatively charged phospholipid, also reactivated TRPV1 at 250 μm (Fig. 4D), but the effect was smaller than that of PI or PG. In contrast, the neutral lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) did not activate TRPV1 (Fig. 4E). Importantly, PG did not activate TRPV6 (Fig. 4, G and H), a channel showing higher phosphoinositide specificity and activation by PI(4,5)P2, but not by PI(4)P (25Thyagarajan B. Lukacs V. Rohacs T. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate mediates calcium-induced inactivation of TRPV6 channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14980-14987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We also tested the effects of two other negatively charged amphipathic lipids, oleoyl-CoA and DGS-NTA, both of which could activate KATP channels in excised patches (23Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Ramdya P.P. Molnár Z. Logothetis D.E. Specificity of activation by phosphoinositides determines lipid regulation of Kir channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows that oleoyl-CoA induced a robust activation of TRPV1 at 3 μm; we observed a slowly developing partial activation at 1 μm (Fig. 5B). The artificial lipid DGS-NTA also activated TRPV1; the effect was slower and incomplete at 10 μm and faster and larger at 100 μm (Fig. 5, F–H). DiC8 PI(4,5)P2 induced either a smaller effect or no effect after DGS-NTA, depending on the level of activation, suggesting a common mechanism of activation by the two lipids. Both oleoyl-CoA and DGS-NTA have three negative charges (Fig. 5, D and E), and both induced a higher level of activation of TRPV1 at lower concentrations than either PG or PI, each of which has only one negative charge. To test the effects of PI(4,5)P2 in a pure system, without the presence of other negatively charged lipids, we purified the TRPV1 protein and incorporated it into planar lipid bilayers consisting of the"
https://openalex.org/W2036816754,"The hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a model for examining how protein dynamics contribute to enzymatic function. The relationship between functional motions and enzyme evolution has attracted significant attention. Recent studies on N23PP Escherichia coli DHFR (ecDHFR) mutant, designed to resemble parts of the human enzyme, indicated a reduced single turnover rate. NMR relaxation dispersion experiments with that enzyme showed rigidification of millisecond Met-20 loop motions (Bhabha, G., Lee, J., Ekiert, D. C., Gam, J., Wilson, I. A., Dyson, H. J., Benkovic, S. J., and Wright, P. E. (2011) Science 332, 234-238). A more recent study of this mutant, however, indicated that fast motions along the reaction coordinate are actually more dispersed than for wild-type ecDHFR (WT). Furthermore, a double mutant (N23PP/G51PEKN) that better mimics the human enzyme seems to restore both the single turnover rates and narrow distribution of fast dynamics (Liu, C. T., Hanoian, P., French, T. H., Hammes-Schiffer, S., and Benkovic, S. J. (2013) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 10159-11064). Here, we measured intrinsic kinetic isotope effects for both N23PP and N23PP/G51PEKN double mutant DHFRs over a temperature range. The findings indicate that although the C-H→C transfer and dynamics along the reaction coordinate are impaired in the altered N23PP mutant, both seem to be restored in the N23PP/G51PEKN double mutant. This indicates that the evolution of G51PEKN, although remote from the Met-20 loop, alleviated the loop rigidification that would have been caused by N23PP, enabling WT-like H-tunneling. The correlation between the calculated dynamics, the nature of C-H→C transfer, and a phylogenetic analysis of DHFR sequences are consistent with evolutionary preservation of the protein dynamics to enable H-tunneling from well reorganized active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2068150231,"Glutamine synthetase (GS), which catalyzes the production of glutamine, plays essential roles in nitrogen metabolism. There are two main bacterial GS isoenzymes, GSI-α and GSI-β. GSI-α enzymes, which have not been structurally characterized, are uniquely feedback-inhibited by Gln. To gain insight into GSI-α function, we performed biochemical and cellular studies and obtained structures for all GSI-α catalytic and regulatory states. GSI-α forms a massive 600-kDa dodecameric machine. Unlike other characterized GS, the Bacillus subtilis enzyme undergoes dramatic intersubunit conformational alterations during formation of the transition state. Remarkably, these changes are required for active site construction. Feedback inhibition arises from a hydrogen bond network between Gln, the catalytic glutamate, and the GSI-α-specific residue, Arg(62), from an adjacent subunit. Notably, Arg(62) must be ejected for proper active site reorganization. Consistent with these findings, an R62A mutation abrogates Gln feedback inhibition but does not affect catalysis. Thus, these data reveal a heretofore unseen restructuring of an enzyme active site that is coupled with an isoenzyme-specific regulatory mechanism.

Licensing consists of the loading of the hexameric MCM2–7 complex onto chromatin during G1 phase and is dependent on the licensing factor Cdt1. In vitro experiments have suggested a two-step binding mode for minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins, with transient initial interactions converted to stable chromatin loading. Here, we assess MCM loading in live human cells using an in vivo licensing assay on the basis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP-tagged MCM protein subunits through the cell cycle. We show that, in telophase, MCM2 and MCM4 maintain transient interactions with chromatin, exhibiting kinetics similar to Cdt1. These are converted to stable interactions from early G1 phase. The immobile fraction of MCM2 and MCM4 increases during G1 phase, suggestive of reiterative licensing. In late G1 phase, a large fraction of MCM proteins are loaded onto chromatin, with maximal licensing observed just prior to S phase onset. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching experiments show subnuclear concentrations of MCM-chromatin interactions that differ as G1 phase progresses and do not colocalize with sites of DNA synthesis in S phase.

Faithful DNA replication is a prerequisite for the preservation of genomic information. In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication initiates from multiple replication origins distributed on chromosomes that direct the assembly of multiprotein complexes (known as “replisomes”), which will move along with each replication fork (1Baker T.A.

The DNA replicated by sister forks from a single origin is called a replicon. It has been proposed that, in eukaryotic cells, the DNA replication machinery is restrained at specific nuclear structures, called “replication factories,” that exhibit dynamic behavior as they assemble and disassemble in space during S phase (Ref. 5Hozák P.

During mid-S phase, these foci are located in heterochromatic regions near the nuclear periphery and surrounding the nucleoli, whereas in late S phase, only a few intense and larger replication foci are located at the nuclear periphery and within the nucleoli (6Leonhardt H.

The integrity of genomic information is preserved through the periodic assembly and disassembly of essential prereplication complexes at replication origins. This process, described as chromatin “licensing,” involves the loading of the heterohexameric MCM2–7 (minichromosome maintenance) protein complex onto chromatin by the origin recognition complex (ORC) and two essential loading factors, Cdc6 (15Cocker J.H.

Licensing ensures the faithful regulation of DNA replication in time and space (18Masai H. Matsumoto S. You Z. Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Oda M. Eukaryotic chromosome DNA replication. Where, when, and how?.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 89-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic cell cycle is driven by the periodic activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases that allow prereplication complex formation to occur in a time window between late mitosis through G1 phase during which Cdk/cyclin levels are low because of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (14Siddiqui K. On K.F. Diffley J.F. Regulating DNA replication in eukarya.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 (α012930)Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In metazoa, licensing is additionally controlled through Geminin (19McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Geminin, an inhibitor of DNA replication, is degraded during mitosis.Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), a protein that binds to Cdt1 and inhibits it from loading the MCM complex onto chromatin during S and G2 phases (20Wohlschlegel J.A.

The timing and extent of MCM loading onto chromatin must be accurately controlled through the cell cycle and coordinated with S phase onset. Both underlicensing and overlicensing have been linked to DNA replication stress, genomic instability, and malignant transformation (23Blow J.J. Gillespie P.J. Replication licensing and cancer.

Our analysis reveals transient interactions of MCM proteins with chromatin in telophase, followed by stable binding during G1 phase. In addition, we show that in late G1 phase, the fraction of MCM proteins that are bound to chromatin is increased markedly, suggesting that chromatin is only fully licensed in late G1 phase. Our findings suggest multiple levels of regulation of MCM binding to chromatin within the live cell nucleus, taking place during both mitosis and at the G1-to-S phase transition. MCF7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For live-cell experiments, cells were plated either on MatTek dishes (MatTek Corp.) or in ibidi μ-dishes 35-mm high glass-bottom, in phenol red-free, CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen). Stable GFP-NLS, GFP-MCM2, and GFP-MCM4 cell lines were selected with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Stable Cdt1-GFP cell line generation and characterization have been described previously (47Xouri G. Squire A. Dimaki M. Geverts B. Verveer P.J. Taraviras S. Nishitani H. Houtsmuller A.B.

For transient transfection, MCF7 cells plated in 35-mm dishes were transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Turbofect (Fermentas) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For Cdt1 silencing, MCF7 stable cell lines were transfected twice with 400 nm of Cdt1 siRNA or control Luciferase siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 with a time interval of 24 h and were analyzed 48 h after the second transfection. For mitotic synchronization, cells were treated either with 40 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 12 h or with 100 μm monastrol (Sigma) for 16 h, collected by mechanical shake-off, and released into fresh medium. For late G1 phase synchronization, cells were grown in the presence of 0.5 mm mimosine (Sigma) for 24 h. The synchronization in early S phase was performed with a double thymidine block (2.5 mm, Sigma) or with 5 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma) treatment for 24 h. For FACS analysis, stable GFP-NLS, GFP-MCM2 and GFP-MCM4 cell lines as well as parental MCF7 cells were fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol and stained with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml) in the presence of 100 μg/ml RNase in PBS. Cellular DNA content was analyzed using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer with Cellquest software and WinMDi software version 2.8. Immunofluorescence was done as described previously (49Pefani D.E.

For immunoprecipitation experiments, total cell lysates from asynchronous MCF7 cells as well as from the GFP-MCM2, GFP-MCM4 and GFP-NLS stable cell lines were prepared by using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche). GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-GFP, 3E6, catalog no. 1181460001, Roche) bound to protein G-agarose beads (Upstate). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS buffer and lysed in 0.1 ml of 0.1% TX-100 mCSK buffer (10 mm Pipes (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 0.1 (v/v) % Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm NaF) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant that was isolated represented the soluble fraction (S100). The pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 0.1% TX-100 mCSK buffer and suspended in SDS sample buffer (chromatin-enriched fraction, P100). To fuse GFP to the N termini of MCM2 and MCM4, the open reading frames of MCM2 and MCM4 (provided by Dr. A. Perrakis) were subcloned into pCDNA3.1/EGFP (Invitrogen) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. PCNA tagged to monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) (PCNA-RFP) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Cardoso (51Mortusewicz O. Schermelleh L. Walter J. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H.

A GFP-nls construct was generated by cloning three copies of the SV40 nuclear localization sequences at the C terminus of the GFP sequence in the pEGFP-C1 vector. Photobleaching experiments were performed on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion lens. During experiments, cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, bleaching was accomplished on a defined region of interest of 2 μm diameter within the cell nucleus. Fifty prebleach images were recorded with 3% laser power of the 488-nm line at 70% argon laser intensity, and bleaching was attained by a double bleach pulse of 0.066 s using the 458-, 476-, 488-, and 496-nm laser lines combined at maximum power. Following bleaching, 250 images were recorded at 0.066-s intervals with 3% laser power of the 488-nm line. Raw data were normalized as described previously (47Xouri G. Squire A. Dimaki M. Geverts B.

In Fig. 7A, a circular region of 4 μm in diameter within the cell nucleus was repeatedly bleached with 60 pulses using the 458-, 476-, 488-, and 496-nm laser lines combined at maximum power. In Fig. 7C, a region corresponding to ∼1/3 of the nucleus was bleached as above.

All fluorescent molecules within this region, and molecules that are mobile within the nucleus and move through this region during the bleaching step, become bleached, leading to a gradual depletion of the mobile pool from the nucleus. Following FLIP, confocal images were recorded to visualize immobile structures of GFP-MCM2 within the non-bleached part of the nucleus (53Bancaud A. Huet S. Rabut G. Ellenberg J.

Utilization of PPi to drive cation transport across membranes apparently started in the “pre-ATP world” (2Holm N.G. Baltscheffsky H. Links between hydrothermal environments, pyrophosphate, Na+, and early evolution.Orig. Life Evol. Biosph. 2011; 41: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structurally and functionally, membrane PPases differ completely from ubiquitous soluble PPases (1Baykov A.A. Malinen A.M. Luoto H.H. Lahti R.

Depending on their transported cation specificity under physiological conditions, membrane PPases are divided into H+-PPases (found in all aforementioned organisms), Na+-PPases (found in bacteria and archaea), and Na+,H+-PPases (found in bacteria). The two former types transport either H+ or Na+, whereas Na+,H+-PPases transport both cations in a seemingly non-competitive manner (4Luoto H.H. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M.

All membrane PPases are homologous proteins that form homodimers of ∼75-kDa subunits, each organized into a 16–17-α-helix-containing structure in the membrane (5Kellosalo J. Kajander T. Kogan K.

The structure and catalytic cycle of a sodium-pumping pyrophosphatase.Science. 2012; 337: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported recently reveal a remarkably similar organization. Each subunit forms an unusual funnel-like structure with a large hydrophilic cavity in the cytoplasmic part and a hydrophilic channel in the membrane (Fig. 1A). The cavity represents the hydrolysis site and contains multiple ligands for PPi and five Mg2+ ions, as well as two Asp residues that bind a nucleophilic water molecule. The ion conductance channel connects the hydrolysis site to the other side of the membrane and contains a putative gate formed by Asp-Lys in the H+-PPase and Asp-Lys-Glu in the Na+-PPase (Fig. 1B). The principles of evolution and the structural determinants that impart cation specificity in the membrane PPase superfamily are only poorly understood. Phylogenetic analyses point to Na+-PPase as the predecessor of the membrane PPase superfamily and also reveal that evolution to H+ transport may have occurred via four routes (1Baykov A.A. Malinen A.M. Luoto H.H. Lahti R. Pyrophosphate-fueled Na+ and H+ transport in prokaryotes.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2013; 77: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two of these routes, leading to K+-dependent plant-type and Flavobacterium johnsoniae-type H+-PPases, involved relocation of the gate-forming Glu residue within the same or to another α-helix (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21633-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), consistent with the three-dimensional structural data. The third route, leading to Na+,H+-PPases, involved multiple mutations that apparently indirectly caused repositioning of critical residues in the ion channel (4Luoto H.H. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Membrane-integral pyrophosphatase subfamily capable of translocating both Na+ and H+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The fourth, giving rise to K+-independent H+-PPases, remains to be characterized. The results of these phylogenetic analyses indicate that Na+,H+-PPase evolved independently, ruling out the possibility that it was an intermediate step on the way from Na+-PPase to H+-PPase. Here, we show that Na+/H+ promiscuity is inherent in Na+-PPase, which makes evolution to H+-PPase a very probable event. We also identified a channel residue whose substitution specifically abolished the H+ transport activity of Chlorobium limicola Na+-PPase (Cl-PPase), thus creating a truly Na+-specific transporter. Mutant enzymes were constructed by PCR using the previously cloned wild-type Na+-PPase of C. limicola (NCBI accession number YP001943220) (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M.

The mutated Cl-PPase genes were ligated into the pET36b vector (Novagen) under the control of the T7 promoter. The PPase-encoding regions of the final expression plasmids were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of cloning steps. Proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli C41(DE3) strain by transducing with expression plasmids and inducing with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Membrane PPase genes isolated from other organisms were cloned and expressed as described previously (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M.

Inverted membrane vesicles (IMV) were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described previously (10Belogurov G.A. Malinen A.M. Turkina M.V. Jalonen U. Rytkönen K. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Membrane-bound pyrophosphatase of Thermotoga maritima requires sodium for activity.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IMV were quantitated based on their protein concentration, which was determined by the Bradford method (11Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). The effects of amino acid substitutions on membrane PPase expression were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. IMV were diluted with loading buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 11% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml Orange G), and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 50 °C. Two identical SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–20% acrylamide gradient, Thermo Scientific) were run in parallel with a protein load of 10–18 μg/lane. One of the gels was stained with GelCode Blue (Thermo Scientific). Protein bands from the other gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size, Whatman) using a TE 77 PWR semidry electroblotting apparatus (Amersham Biosciences; run settings of 1 h for 30 min at 60 mA) and standard Towbin buffer (12Towbin H.

Membranes were washed once with water and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% fat-free milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Rabbit serum against the IYTKAADVGADLVGKVE peptide, mimicking a highly conserved membrane PPase sequence motif (7Malinen A.M. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R.

The membrane was washed 5 × 5 min and 1 × 10 min with the same buffer. PPase antiserum-reactive bands were detected with an Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR) after incubation for 1 h with 5,000-fold diluted (with TBS including 0.05% Tween 20) fluorescently labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (IRDye 800CW-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-absorbed, LI-COR). Before imaging, the membrane was washed 4 × 5 min with TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, followed by 2 × 5 min with TBS only. Gel or membrane images were analyzed with ImageJ (13Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34981) Google Scholar). The intensities of membrane PPase bands on both gels varied by a factor of <2 between variant enzymes and IMV batches. The PPi hydrolytic activities of wild-type and mutant Cl-PPases were determined with an automatic phosphate analyzer working in continuous mode (14Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. A simple and sensitive apparatus for continuous monitoring of orthophosphate in the presence of acid-labile compounds.Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The dependence of catalysis on Na+ and K+ was assessed using established Na+- and K+-free reagents (10Belogurov G.A. Malinen A.M. Turkina M.V. Jalonen U. Rytkönen K. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Membrane-bound pyrophosphatase of Thermotoga maritima requires sodium for activity.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The concentration of contaminating Na+ ions in the assay medium was estimated to be ∼30 μm using atomic absorption spectrometry. Except where specified, the reaction medium consisted of 0.1 m MOPS/tetramethylammonium (TMA) hydroxide (pH 7.2), 5.3 mm MgCl2 (5 mm free Mg2+), 160 μm TMA4PPi (100 μm Mg2PPi complex), 40 μm EGTA, 0–200 mm KCl, and 0–200 mm NaCl. The reaction was initiated at 25 °C by adding the IMV suspension, and the generation of inorganic phosphate was continuously recorded for 2–3 min. Reaction rates were calculated from the initial slopes of the phosphate liberation curves. The rates of duplicate measurements typically agreed within 10%. Control experiments using TMA chloride instead of NaCl and KCl indicated that ionic strength did not significantly affect activity. The buffers used at other pH values were 0.1 m MES/TMA hydroxide (pH 6.2) and TAPS/TMA hydroxide (pH 8.2). H+ transport was assayed at 25 °C with the fluorescent dyes 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) and acridine orange (2 μm), which report on ΔpH formation across the vesicle membrane (15Casadio R. Measurements of transmembrane pH differences of low extents in bacterial chromatophores.Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 189-201Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Except where specified, the assay medium additionally contained 475 μm TMA4PPi (300 μm Mg2PPi complex), 5.8 mm MgCl2 (5 mm free Mg2+), 0.1–100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS/TMA hydroxide (pH 7.2), and 8 μm EGTA. The protein concentrations used in H+ transport measurements were 0.15 mg/ml for the wild-type enzyme and 0.3 mg/ml for variant enzymes. Na+ and K+ were added as their sulfate salts, and the Cl− concentration was maintained at 160 mm with TMA chloride. The effects of the ionophores ETH 157 (N,N′-dibenzyl-N,N′-diphenyl-1,2-phenylenedioxydiacetamide), valinomycin, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone on H+ transport were measured in the absence of Cl−. H+ transport inhibition by aminomethylene diphosphonate (AMDP) was measured with 160 μm TMA4PPi. For measurement of H+ transport at pH 6.2 and 8.2, the medium pH was buffered using 20 mm MES/TMA hydroxide and TAPS/TMA hydroxide, respectively. Na+ transport activity was determined by incubating IMV (1 mg/ml for the wild-type enzyme and 2 mg/ml for the mutant enzymes and authentic E. coli controls) for 30–60 min at 0 or 22 °C with 0.025–5 mm 22Na2SO4 (0.6–11.4 μCi; carrier-free 22Na was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of 25 mm K2SO4, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 m MOPS/TMA hydroxide (pH 7.2), 160 mm TMA chloride, and 40 μm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 mm TMA4PPi. After a predetermined incubation time (typically 15 or 60 s), the transport reaction was quenched with 20 mm EDTA, added to chelate Mg2+. IMV were immediately isolated from the reaction medium by filtering the mixture through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2-μm pore size and 13-mm diameter, Millipore). The filters were washed with 1 ml of 5 mm MOPS/TMA hydroxide (pH 7.2), 160 mm TMA chloride, 50 mm Na2SO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 2 μm EGTA and transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (Ultima Gold, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amount of 22Na on the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation counting using a 1215 Rackbeta instrument (LKB Wallac). The values of apparent dissociation constants for the magnesium complexes of PPi used to calculate Mg2PPi complex and free Mg2+ concentrations at pH 7.2 were 0.112 mm (MgPPi) and 2.84 mm (Mg2PPi). The values of these constants at other pH values were calculated as described previously (16Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Steady-state kinetics of substrate hydrolysis by vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase. A simple three-state model.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The dependence of the PPi hydrolysis rate (v) on Na+ and K+ concentrations at saturating substrate and Mg2+ concentrations was analyzed in terms of the two-site model (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21633-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) proposed earlier. The model assumes that enzyme activity is controlled by two alkali metal-binding sites, one Na+-specific and the other accommodating both Na+ and K+, with the latter cation conferring higher activity. The submodels in Scheme 1 (A and B) were used to describe Na+ dependences measured in the absence and presence of K+, respectively. Scheme 1C was used to analyze K+ binding at a fixed Na+ level. ES represents the enzyme-substrate complex, Ka1, Ka2, Ka, and Ki represent the metal binding constants; and VN, VK, V1, and V2 represent the activities of the corresponding species. Scheme 1B predicts that binding of the second Na+ ion partially inhibits the reaction by replacing bound K+ (VN < VK). Conversely, K+ binding in Scheme 1C is expected to increase activity by replacing Na+ at one of the sites. Rate equations for the mechanisms in Scheme 1 (A–C) are provided by Equations 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and assume rapid equilibrium cation binding. v=VN1+Ka2/[M]+Ka1Ka2/[M]2+a(Eq. 1) v=VK+VN[M]/Ki1+Ka/[M]+[M]/Ki+a(Eq. 2) v=V2+V1Ka/[M]1+Ka/[M](Eq. 3) Parameter a refers to the Na+-independent background activity (presumably caused by traces of soluble E. coli PPase trapped in IMV), and its value was 2 and 14% of VN with wild-type Cl-PPase and the least active Cl-PPase variant, respectively. Parameter values were determined by fitting these equations to rate data using Scientist software (Micromath). In a previous study (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M.

To further explore the cation specificity of Na+-PPase, we measured H+ transport by Cl-PPase over a wide range of Na+ concentrations. Cl-PPase was chosen because it is one of the most enzymatically active Na+-PPases when expressed in E. coli (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M.

We also recently optimized the sensitivity of our H+ transport assay employing the fluorescent pH probe ACMA by adjusting the reaction buffer composition (4Luoto H.H. Baykov A.A. Lahti R.

In agreement with the previous report (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21633-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), no H+ transport into Cl-PPase-containing IMV was triggered by PPi in the presence of 5–100 mm Na+ (Fig. 2A). However, the addition of PPi to the reaction mixture at lower Na+ concentrations (0.1–1 mm) induced time-dependent acidification of the IMV lumen, as indicated by ACMA fluorescence quenching that was reversed upon addition of ammonium chloride, a known proton gradient disruptor. The initial slope and maximal amplitude of fluorescence decrease upon PPi addition provide measures of the initial rate of H+ transport and the maximal level of H+ accumulation, respectively. Both parameters decreased progressively as the Na+ concentration was increased. Importantly, H+ was transported inside IMV, similar to what was reported earlier for Na+ (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21633-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A number of control experiments verified that the H+ transport detected at low Na+ levels was directly mediated by Cl-PPase and not by E. coli proton pumps or secondary transport processes (Fig. 2B). First, PPi-fueled H+ transport was not detected in native E. coli vesicles lacking Cl-PPase. Second, the specific membrane PPase inhibitor AMDP (17Zhen R.G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Aminomethylenediphosphonate: a potent type-specific inhibitor of both plant and phototrophic bacterial H+-pyrophosphatases.Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone prevented H+ transport. Third, dissipation of the Cl-PPase-generated sodium gradient by the sodium ionophore ETH 157 slightly stimulated the H+ transport reaction. Finally, PPi-dependent IMV acidification was also detected with acridine orange, a mechanistically different ΔpH probe. 3H. H. Luoto, unpublished data. The observation that valinomycin strongly facilitated H+ transport by Cl-PPase further indicated that the enzyme creates a membrane electric potential difference in addition to chemical ionic gradients. To compare the H+ transport activity of Cl-PPase to that of dedicated H+-PPases, we isolated E. coli IMV containing the previously characterized H+-PPase from Rhodospirillum rubrum (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Huopalahti S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. H+-pyrophosphatase of Rhodospirillum rubrum. High-yield expression in Escherichia coli and identification of the Cys residues responsible for inactivation by mersalyl.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22209-22214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because the tested Cl-PPase and R. rubrum H+-PPase IMV batches exhibited identical PPi hydrolytic activities at 0.1 mm Na+ and had equally sealed vesicles, as indicated by similar levels of ATP-dependent ΔpH generation by intrinsic E. coli H+ pumps, the H+ transport activities of the two PPases could be directly compared. As evident in Fig. 2C, Cl-PPase is less a potent H+ pump than R. rubrum H+-PPase: the initial rate and maximal amplitude of Cl-PPase-mediated ACMA fluorescence quenching were ∼5- and 3-fold lower, respectively. Interestingly, Cl-PPase also supported H+ transport in the absence of K+, although at a lower rate because of a reduction in hydrolytic activity. The permissible Na+ concentration range was larger: detectable transport activity was observed with 5 and 10 mm Na+, but not with 100 mm Na+. As reported previously (7Malinen A.M. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Na+-pyrophosphatase: a novel primary sodium pump.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8872-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Na+ transport by Na+-PPase similarly showed no absolute requirement for K+. At a concentration of 0.1 mm Na+, Cl-PPase retained appreciable H+ transport activity upon decreasing the pH to 6.2 or increasing it to 8.2 (Fig. 3). Again, the H+ transport activity was suppressed by increasing the concentration of Na+; surprisingly, however, the threshold Na+ concentration above which H+ transport was not detectable (5 mm Na+) was identical at the three pH values tested. Thus, a 100-fold variation in H+ concentration did not change the ability of H+ to compete with Na+ as the transport ion. The concentration of H+ and Na+ ions in the medium therefore affected the H+ transport activity of Cl-PPase asymmetrically: whereas increasing the Na+ concentration decreased and eventually abolished H+ transport, increasing the H+ concentration did not increase the Na+ concentration required to inhibit H+ transport activity. These data suggest that selection of the transport ion by Cl-PPase is more complex than a direct competition between Na+ and H+ in the medium. The Na+ concentration dependence of Na+ transport by Cl-PPase was measured at 0 °C because the transport reaction was too fast at 25 °C to be resolved by the procedure used (9Luoto H.H. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 21633-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At 0 °C, the PPi-energized accumulation of 22Na+ inside IMV continued for 90 s (Fig. 4A); this compares with <15 s at 25 °C. The rates of Na+ transport at Na+ concentrations of 0.1–10 mm in the presence of 50 mm K+ were therefore estimated by employing a fixed time point (15 s) within the dynamic range of the progress curve. As Fig. 4B makes clear, the Na+ concentration dependence of the Cl-PPase-catalyzed Na+ transport rate paralleled that of the PPi hydrolysis rate determined under similar conditions. The number of Na+ ions transported per PPi molecule hydrolyzed (the coupling ratio) was low (0.024–0.033), consistent with the earlier observation that E. coli IMV are leaky (7Malinen A.M. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Na+-pyrophosphatase: a novel primary sodium pump.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8872-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but was fairly constant over the Na+ concentration range tested. The latter observation suggests that the emergence of H+ transport activity at low Na+ concentration is not accompanied by a proportional disappearance of Na+ transport activity. In other words, Cl-PPase always couples PPi hydrolysis to the transport of a fixed number of Na+ ions (probably one) but acquires an added capability to transport H+ at low Na+ concentrations. To test whether such dual transport specificity is a common property of Na+-PPases, we also determined the transport specificity of structurally divergent Na+-PPases that segregate to different regions of the phylogenetic tree (4Luoto H.H. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Malinen A.M. Membrane-integral pyrophosphatase subfamily capable of translocating both Na+ and H+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cancer cells rapidly proliferate and are resistant to cell death due, in part, to a shift from mitochondrial metabolism to glycolysis. We hypothesized that this shift is important in regulating cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i), as the ATP-dependent plasma membrane Ca(2+) ATPase (PMCA) is critical for maintaining low [Ca(2+)]i and thus cell survival. The present study aimed to determine the relative contribution of mitochondrial versus glycolytic ATP in fuelling the PMCA in human pancreatic cancer cells. We report that glycolytic inhibition induced profound ATP depletion, PMCA inhibition, [Ca(2+)]i overload, and cell death in PANC1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Conversely, inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism had no effect, suggesting that glycolytic ATP is critical for [Ca(2+)]i homeostasis and thus survival. Targeting the glycolytic regulation of the PMCA may, therefore, be an effective strategy for selectively killing pancreatic cancer while sparing healthy cells."

YopD and its chaperone LcrH are essential components of the Yersinia type III pathway, enabling effector translocation into host cells. YopD, LcrH, and YscM1 also regulate yop expression post-transcriptionally in response to environmental signals; however, the molecular mechanisms for this regulation and Yop secretion are unknown. We show here that YopD associates with 30 S ribosomal particles in a manner requiring LcrH. When added to ribosomes, YopD, LcrH, and YscM1 block the translation of yopQ mRNA. We propose a model whereby LcrH-dependent association of YopD with 30 S ribosomal particles enables YscM1 to block yopQ translation unless type III machines are induced to secrete the effector."
https://openalex.org/W2007093012,"Urinary tract infections are a major source of morbidity for women and the elderly, with Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) being the most prevalent causative pathogen. Studies in recent years have defined a key anti-inflammatory role for Interleukin-10 (IL-10) in urinary tract infection mediated by UPEC and other uropathogens. We investigated the nature of the IL-10-producing interactions between UPEC and host cells by utilising a novel co-culture model that incorporated lymphocytes, mononuclear and uroepithelial cells in histotypic proportions. This co-culture model demonstrated synergistic IL-10 production effects between monocytes and uroepithelial cells following infection with UPEC. Membrane inserts were used to separate the monocyte and uroepithelial cell types during infection and revealed two synergistic IL-10 production effects based on contact-dependent and soluble interactions. Analysis of a comprehensive set of immunologically relevant biomarkers in monocyte-uroepithelial cell co-cultures highlighted that multiple cytokine, chemokine and signalling factors were also produced in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. These results demonstrate that IL-10 responses to UPEC occur via multiple interactions between several cells types, implying a complex role for infection-related IL-10 during UTI. Development and application of the co-culture model described in this study is thus useful to define the degree of contact dependency of biomarker production to UPEC, and highlights the relevance of histotypic co-cultures in studying complex host-pathogen interactions."

However, the pathogenesis-related genes of B. xylophilus are not well characterized. Thus, DNA microarrays were used to investigate differential gene expression in PWN where Pinus thunbergii was inoculated with nematodes, compared with those cultured on Botrytis cinerea. The microarrays comprised 31121 probes, 1310 (4.2%) of which were differentially regulated (changes of >2-fold, P < 0.01) in the two growth conditions. Of these 1310 genes, 633 genes were upregulated, whereas 677 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) categories were assigned to the classes Cellular Component, Molecular Function, and Biological Process. The comparative gene expression analysis showed that a large number of the pathogenesis-related genes of B. xylophilus, such as pectate lyase genes, cytochrome P450s, UGTs, and ABC transporter genes, were highly expressed when B. xylophilus infected P. thunbergii. Annotation analysis indicated that these genes contributed to cell wall degradation, detoxification, and the reproduction process. The microarray results were validated using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The microarray data confirmed the specific expression of B. xylophilus genes during infection of P. thunbergii, which provides basic information that facilitates a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of PWD."

Although they have 20 to 70% amino acid sequence identity, these proteins share a conserved tertiary structure comprised of ten beta sheets and two alpha helixes. Availability of the complete genomes of 34 invertebrates, together with transcriptomes and ESTs, allowed us to systematically investigate the gene structure and alternative splicing of FABP genes over a wide range of phyla. Only in genomes of two cnidarian species could FABP genes not be identified. The genomic loci for FABP genes were diverse and their genomic structure varied. In particular, the intronless FABP genes, in most of which the key residues involved in fatty acid binding varied, were common in five phyla. Interestingly, several species including one trematode, one nematode and four arthropods generated FABP mRNA variants via alternative splicing. These results demonstrate that both gene duplication and post-transcriptional modifications are used to generate diverse FABPs in species studied."

By regulating S1P levels, SPL also controls SC recruitment and muscle regeneration, representing a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy. We found that SPL is induced during myoblast differentiation. To investigate SPL's role in myogenesis at the cellular level, we generated and characterized a murine myoblast SPL-knockdown (SPL-KD) cell line lacking SPL. SPL-KD cells accumulated intracellular and extracellular S1P and failed to form myotubes under conditions that normally stimulate myogenic differentiation. Under differentiation conditions, SPL-KD cells also demonstrated delayed induction of 3 myogenic microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-1, miR-206, and miR-486. SPL-KD cells successfully differentiated when treated with an S1P1 agonist, S1P2 antagonist, and combination treatments, which also increased myogenic miRNA levels. SPL-KD cells transfected with mimics for miR-1 or miR-206 also overcame the differentiation block. Thus, we show for the first time that the S1P/SPL/S1P-receptor axis regulates the expression of a number of miRNAs, thereby contributing to myogenic differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2152144179,"Cardiac Na channel remodeling provides a critical substrate for generation of reentrant arrhythmias in border zones of the infarcted canine heart. Recent studies show that Nav1.5 assembly and function are linked to ankyrin-G, gap, and mechanical junction proteins. In this study our objective is to expound the status of the cardiac Na channel, its interacting protein ankyrinG and the mechanical and gap junction proteins at two different times post infarction when arrhythmias are known to occur; that is, 48 hr and 5 day post coronary occlusion. Previous studies have shown the origins of arrhythmic events come from the subendocardial Purkinje and epicardial border zone. Our Purkinje cell (Pcell) voltage clamp study shows that INa and its kinetic parameters do not differ between Pcells from the subendocardium of the 48hr infarcted heart (IZPCs) and control non-infarcted Pcells (NZPCs). Immunostaining studies revealed that disturbances of Nav1.5 protein location with ankyrin-G are modest in 48 hr IZPCs. Therefore, Na current remodeling does not contribute to the abnormal conduction in the subendocardial border zone 48 hr post myocardial infarction as previously defined. In addition, immunohistochemical data show that Cx40/Cx43 co-localize at the intercalated disc (IDs) of control NZPCs but separate in IZPCs. At the same time, Purkinje cell desmoplakin and desmoglein2 immunostaining become diffuse while plakophilin2 and plakoglobin increase in abundance at IDs. In the epicardial border zone 5 days post myocardial infarction, immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses showed that ankyrin-G protein expression is increased and re-localized to submembrane cell regions at a time when Nav1.5 function is decreased. Thus, Nav1.5 and ankyrin-G remodeling occur later after myocardial infarction compared to that of gap and mechanical junctional proteins. Gap and mechanical junctional proteins remodel in IZPCs early, perhaps to help maintain Nav1.5 subcellular location position and preserve its function soon after myocardial infarction."

Like all successful bacterial pathogens, F. tularensis rapidly responds to changes in its environment during infection of host cells, and upon encountering different microenvironments within those cells. This ability to appropriately respond to the challenges of infection requires rapid and global shifts in gene expression patterns. In this study, we use a novel pathogen transcript enrichment strategy and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to perform a detailed characterization of the rapid and global shifts in F. tularensis LVS gene expression during infection of murine macrophages. We performed differential gene expression analysis on all bacterial genes at two key stages of infection: phagosomal escape, and cytosolic replication. By comparing the F. tularensis transcriptome at these two stages of infection to that of the bacteria grown in culture, we were able to identify sets of genes that are differentially expressed over the course of infection. This analysis revealed the temporally dynamic expression of a number of known and putative transcriptional regulators and virulence factors, providing insight into their role during infection. In addition, we identified several F. tularensis genes that are significantly up-regulated during infection but had not been previously identified as virulence factors. These unknown genes may make attractive therapeutic or vaccine targets."

In 107 first-ever lacunar stroke patients in whom baseline brain MRI and vitamin B12 status were available, we obtained a follow-up brain MRI after 2 years. We assessed progression of periventricular WML (pWML) and deep WML (dWML) using a visual WML change scale. We studied the relationship between baseline levels of plasma vitamin B12 and progression of WML after 2 years of follow-up by binary logistic regression analyses. Vitamin B12 deficiency was more frequent in patients with progression of pWML compared to those without progression (41.9% and 19.7% respectively, p = 0.02). Corrected for sex and age, progression of pWML was associated with lower baseline levels of vitamin B12 (OR 1.42 per 50 unit decrease, 95% CI 1.00-1.92). Vitamin B12 levels were not associated with progression of dWML.

A mutation in CHMP2B (CHMP2B(Intron5), an ESCRT-III component) that is associated with a hereditary form of frontotemporal dementia (FTD3) disrupts the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and causes accumulation of autophagosomes and multilamellar structures. We previously demonstrated that expression of CHMP2B(Intron5) in the Drosophila eye using GMR-Gal4 causes misregulation of the Toll receptor pathway. Here, we show that ectopic expression of CHMP2B(Intron5) using eyeless-Gal4 (ey>CHMP2B(Intron5)), a driver with different spatiotemporal expression attributes than GMR-Gal4 in the Drosophila eye, causes eye deformities when compared to expression of wild-type CHMP2B (CHMP2B(WT)) and the Drosophila homologue of CHMP2B (CG4618). In addition, ey>CHMP2B(Intron5) flies showed defects in photoreceptor cell patterning and phototactic behavior. Furthermore, ey>CHMP2B(Intron5) flies showed accumulation of Notch in enlarged endosomes and up-regulation of Notch activity. Partial loss of Notch activity in ey>CHMP2B(Intron5) flies significantly rescued eye deformities, photoreceptor patterning defect, and phototactic behavior defect, indicating that these defects are primarily due to Notch misregulation.

https://openalex.org/W1989938112,"Impairment of sustained attention is assumed to be a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. However, this seems inconsistent with a recent hypothesis that in schizophrenia the implementation of selection (i.e., sustained attention) is intact but the control of selection (i.e., switching the focus of attention) is impaired. Mounting evidence supports this hypothesis, indicating that switching of attention is a bigger problem in schizophrenia than maintaining the focus of attention. To shed more light on this hypothesis, we tested whether schizophrenia patients are impaired relative to controls in sustaining attention, switching attention, or both. Fifteen patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and fifteen healthy volunteers, matched on age and intelligence, performed sustained attention and attention switching tasks, while performance and brain potential measures of selective attention were recorded. In the sustained attention task, patients did not differ from the controls on these measures. In the attention switching task, however, patients showed worse performance than the controls, and early selective attention related brain potentials were absent in the patients while clearly present in the controls. These findings support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with an impairment of the mechanisms that control the direction of attention (attention switching), while the mechanisms that implement a direction of attention (sustained attention) are intact."

Notably, nitric oxide (NO) generators enhanced Rst2 transcriptional activity upon glucose deprivation as well as under glucose-rich conditions. Furthermore, NO specific scavenger inhibited Rst2 transcriptional activity upon glucose deprivation. Altogether, our data suggest that NO and reactive oxygen species may be involved in the activation of transcription factor Rst2."
https://openalex.org/W3028911167,"When AIDS was first recognized in 1981, health professionals were ill equipped to address the emerging pandemic. Opportunistic infections were treated, and supportive care was provided in accordance with the regional availability of healthcare; however, even after HIV was recognized as the causative agent of AIDS, truly effective therapy would not be available for more than a decade. Prevention methods were similarly insufficient, as messages about safe sex and condoms often proved weaker than human impulse. But helplessness has now given way to hope. Basic and clinical scientific advances have yielded powerful therapeutic and preventive interventions. By the end of 2012, 9.7 million HIV-infected individuals worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and some 4.2 million deaths had been averted during the previous decade in low-income and middle-income countries. These feats were accomplished through the joint efforts of the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (among other multilateral and bilateral organizations); health practitioners in endemic countries; and community activists worldwide. Combination prevention methods have been applied with striking results (WHO, 2013WHO Global update on HIV treatment 2013: results, impact and opportunities. June, 2013. http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85326/1/9789241505734_eng.pdf.Google Scholar). For example, programs aimed at the prevention of mother-to-child transmission have proven highly successful (US Department of State, 2013US Department of State. Recognizing the 10th Anniversary of the U.S. President’s Plan for Emergency AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). June 18, 2013. http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/06/210765.htm.Google Scholar). Voluntary male medical circumcision for the prevention of HIV acquisition shows considerable promise (Gray et al., 2012Gray R. Kigozi G. Kong X. Ssempiija V. Makumbi F. Wattya S. Serwadda D. Nalugoda F. Sewenkambo N.K. Wawer M.J. AIDS. 2012; 26: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Pre-exposure antiretroviral pro-phylaxis lowers the risk of infection, particularly if adherence to treatment is high (Okwundu et al., 2012Okwundu C.I. Uthman O.A. Okoromah C.A. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2012; 7: CD007189PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of an HIV-infected individual with ART benefits that person and substantially reduces the likelihood of transmitting HIV to his or her uninfected sexual partner (Cohen et al., 2011Cohen M.S. Chen Y.Q. McCauley M. Gamble T. Hosseinipour M.C. Kumarasamy N. Hakim J.G. Kumwenda J. Grinsztejn B. Pilotto J.H. et al.HPTN 052 Study TeamN. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (5408) Google Scholar); additionally, it can significantly reduce community-level HIV incidence (Granich et al., 2013Granich R. Williams B. Montaner J. Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2013; 8: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Research into the social and behavioral factors governing acceptance and uptake of these interventions will guide effective deployment. Thus, for the first time since AIDS was recognized, the goal to control and even end the HIV/AIDS pandemic has become part of the global health dialog (Folkers and Fauci, 2010Folkers G.K. Fauci A.S. JAMA. 2010; 304: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Despite these accomplishments, there is much unfinished business. While expanding availability of existing interventions, new prevention and treatment methods must be developed. An HIV vaccine is a crucial goal for prevention, and several strategies are being pursued. Although an effective vaccine has proven elusive so far, a trial (RV144) undertaken in Thailand showed a modest 31% reduction in infection in people given the vaccine (Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009Rerks-Ngarm S. Pitisuttithum P. Nitayaphan S. Kaewkungwal J. Chiu J. Paris R. Premsri N. Namwat C. de Souza M. Adams E. et al.MOPH-TAVEG InvestigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Traditionally, induction of neutralizing antibodies against the targeted pathogen is the hallmark of a successful vaccine. So far, HIV vaccines, including the RV144 candidate, have been unable to generate broadly neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T cell responses capable of preventing HIV infection in human trials. In fact, natural infection with HIV elicits detectable broadly neutralizing antibodies in about 20% of infected individuals—a process that takes 2 years or longer. On the basis of this finding, several groups of investigators have pursued an alternative B cell vaccine strategy: broadly neutralizing antibodies derived from infected individuals have been used to identify epitopes on the HIV envelope trimer that could be used as immunogens to induce broadly reactive antibodies (Klein et al., 2013Klein F. Mouquet H. Dosenovic P. Scheid J.F. Scharf L. Nussenzweig M.C. Science. 2013; 341: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, Hoot et al., 2013Hoot S. McGuire A.T. Cohen K.W. et al.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar, Kwong et al., 2013Kwong P.D. Mascola J.R. Nabel G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This B cell pathway toward an HIV vaccine will likely need to be combined with an additional strategy involving the induction of T cells that enhance B-lymphocyte responses, produce anti-HIV cytokines, or provide cytolytic activity against HIV-infected cells. Finally, harnessing the innate immune response as part of a vaccine strategy is being actively pursued. In addition to preventing HIV infection, prevention and treatment of disease progression in the 35.3 million HIV-infected people worldwide is an enormous challenge, which will require efficient delivery of existing therapies and the discovery of improved interventions. Where ART is available, improved implementation will need to address deficiencies in the care continuum—the steps from diagnosis to retention in care and successful treatment. In some regions, discrimination, stigma, and legal barriers impede the realization of optimum care. These impediments must be addressed. Furthermore, longer-acting therapies could improve adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment. Understanding of co-infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C; of chronic comorbidities, including atherosclerosis, some cancers, liver and kidney disease, and neurocognitive problems; and of the aging process are also crucial. Finally, a cure for HIV infection is no longer beyond the imagination, and efforts are aimed at either eradication of HIV in infected individuals or indefinite control of viral replication in the absence of ART, referred to as a functional cure (Chun and Fauci, 2012Chun T.W. Fauci A.S. AIDS. 2012; 26: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To realize the potential of these efforts, along with those directed at vaccine development and new treatments, translation of concepts into interventions will prove essential. A range of highly effective HIV treatment and prevention methods is available, and others are under intensive investigation through basic and translational research. By combining effective implementation of existing methods with the discovery and eventual introduction of new interventions, achieving an AIDS-free world is no longer an idealistic aspiration—it is an achievable goal (Figure 1).

https://openalex.org/W1967519664,"In metazoans, the highly conserved MAPK signaling pathway regulates cell fate decision. Aberrant activation of this pathway has been implicated in multiple human cancers and some developmental disorders. KSR1 functions as an essential scaffold that binds the individual components of the cascade and coordinates their assembly into multiprotein signaling platforms. The mechanism of KSR1 regulation is highly complex and not completely understood. In this study, we identified Tyr(728) as a novel regulatory phosphorylation site in KSR1. We show that Tyr(728) is phosphorylated by LCK, uncovering an additional and unexpected link between Src kinases and MAPK signaling. To understand how phosphorylation of Tyr(728) may regulate the role of KSR1 in signal transduction, we integrated structural modeling and biochemical studies. We demonstrate that Tyr(728) is involved in maintaining the conformation of the KSR1 kinase domain required for binding to MEK. It also affects phosphorylation and activation of MEK by RAF kinases and consequently influences cell proliferation. Moreover, our studies suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr(728) may affect the intrinsic kinase activity of KSR1. Together, we propose that phosphorylation of Tyr(728) may regulate the transition between the scaffolding and the catalytic function of KSR1 serving as a control point used to fine-tune cellular responses."
