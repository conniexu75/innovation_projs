https://openalex.org/W2001673226,"Bromine is, per atom, far more efficient than chlorine in destroying stratospheric ozone, and methyl bromide is the single largest source of stratospheric bromine. The two main previously known sources of this compound are emissions from the ocean and from the compound's use as an agricultural pesticide. Laboratory biomass combustion experiments showed that methyl bromide was emitted in the smoke from various fuels tested. Methyl bromide was also found in smoke plumes from wildfires in savannas, chaparral, and boreal forest. Global emissions of methyl bromide from biomass burning are estimated to be in the range of 10 to 50 gigagrams per year, which is comparable to the amount produced by ocean emission and pesticide use and represents a major contribution ( approximately 30 percent) to the stratospheric bromine budget."

https://openalex.org/W2078117433,"The synthesis of high-quality films of the recently discovered mercury-based cuprate films with high transition temperatures has been plagued by problems such as the air sensitivity of the cuprate precursor and the volatility of Hg and HgO. These processing difficulties have been circumvented by a technique of atomic-scale mixing of the HgO and cuprate precursors, use of a protective cap layer, and annealing in an appropriate Hg and O(2) environment. With this procedure, a zero-resistance transition temperature as high as 124 kelvin in c axis-oriented epitaxial HgBa(2)CaCu(2)O(6+delta) films has been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2022869724,"The plate-motion circuit through the South Pacific and Antarctica is shown to fail paleomagnetic tests of consistency. These failures imply that reconstructions of Pacific basin plates relative to surrounding plates inferred from this circuit are systematically in error and that estimates of motion between hotspots inferred from this circuit are probably too large. Therefore, the motions between hotspots remain poorly known and may be much smaller than previously estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2082051546,"It was recently proposed that subduction of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) contained in deep sea sediments could have introduced substantial solar helium and neon to the Earth's mantle. However, it is not certain if IDPs would retain solar noble gases during subduction. A diffusion experiment that examined He and Ne in IDPs in a magnetic separate from Pacific Ocean sediments showed that He and Ne would be lost from IDPs within 3 years at 500 degrees C, and possibly within 10(5) years at 200 degrees C, which suggests that they would be lost from subducting slabs at shallow depths."
https://openalex.org/W2061054774,"In situ atomic force microscopy reveals the morphology, surface topography, and growth and dissolution characteristics of microscopic single crystals of the low-dimensional organic conductor (tetrathiafulvalene)Br(0.76)' which are grown by electrocrystallization on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrode in an atomic force microscope liquid cell. The growth modes and the distribution and orientation of topographic features on specific crystal faces, whose identity was determined by ""atomic force microscope goniometry,"" can be correlated with the strength and direction of anisotropic solid-state intermolecular bonding. Growth on the (011) face of (tetrathiafulvalene)Br(0.76) crystals involves the formation of oriented self-similar triangular islands ranging in size from 200 to 5000 angstroms along a side. These nuclei eventually transform into rectangular rafts at larger length scales, where bulk intermolecular bonding interactions and surface energies dominate over nuclei-substrate interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1981627586,"Rhenium heptafluoride, ReF(7), is one of only two stable binary compounds MX(7) with a heptacoordinated metal atom M and halide atom X. Its low-temperature crystal structure, as determined by high-resolution powder neutron diffraction, reveals the molecular structure, which has been the subject of speculation and debate for many years. Here it is shown within experimental error that at 1.5 kelvin the lowest energy configuration of ReF(7) has symmetry Cs (m) and is a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. The deviation of the two axial Re-F bonds from collinear and the puckering of the ring of equatorial fluorine atoms are similar to what has been postulated as one of the conformations of the pseudorotational motion observed at higher temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1988707419,"During biomass burning, large amounts of methyl bromide are produced. Free bromine atoms can catalyze the destruction of ozone through reactions with oxygen and chlorin. This article examines the role of methyl bromide in ozone destruction, and the amounts of natural and anthropogenic methyl bromide production."

Reasons are presented which suggest that the nature of the latter effect should be further analyzed."

https://openalex.org/W2003500799,"The gamma irradiation of mixtures of carbon dioxide with ethylene yielded long-chain carboxylic acids. The G(-ethylene) values varied with reaction temperature from essentially zero at -78 degrees C to 175 at 100 degrees C. Under the same conditions, the substitution of free radical agents for radiation gave polyethylene."
https://openalex.org/W2038047382,"Separation rates of neighboring pieces of orange peel floating on the sea were measured under fresh breeze conditions. When Stommel's equation for neighbor diffusivity (F) was applied to the data it became apparent that the F value increased by an order of magnitude whenever the time adrift increased by this amount. This is a result of the fact that the increase in spacing distance is squared while the time adrift is not. It is recommended that a standard time of 1 second be used whenever Stommel's equation is applied in neighbor diffusivity problems. Recomputation of data from the literature showed that neighbor diffusivity varied between 0.08 and 1 cm(2)/sec while time adrift varied between 10 and 10(8) seconds. Further study of separation rates, as parameters of surface turbulence, is recommended."
