Microstructures analysis indicates that the super plastic bulk metallic glasses are composed of hard regions surrounded by soft regions, which enable the glasses to undergo true strain of more than 160%. This finding is suggestive of a solution to the problem of brittleness in, and has implications for understanding the deformation mechanism of, metallic glasses."

We cued new memories in humans during sleep by presenting an odor that had been presented as context during prior learning, and so showed that reactivation indeed causes memory consolidation during sleep. Re-exposure to the odor during slow-wave sleep (SWS) improved the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories but not of hippocampus-independent procedural memories. Odor re-exposure was ineffective during rapid eye movement sleep or wakefulness or when the odor had been omitted during prior learning. Concurring with these findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant hippocampal activation in response to odor re-exposure during SWS."

We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this."

We examined brainstem encoding of linguistic pitch and found that musicians show more robust and faithful encoding compared with nonmusicians. These results not only implicate a common subcortical manifestation for two presumed cortical functions, but also a possible reciprocity of corticofugal speech and music tuning, providing neurophysiological explanations for musicians' higher language-learning ability."

https://openalex.org/W2027571016,"High-throughput screening for genetic analysis, combinatorial chemistry, and clinical diagnostics benefits from multiplexing, which allows for the simultaneous assay of several analytes but necessitates an encoding scheme for molecular identification. Current approaches for multiplexed analysis involve complicated or expensive processes for encoding, functionalizing, or decoding active substrates (particles or surfaces) and often yield a very limited number of analyte-specific codes. We present a method based on continuous-flow lithography that combines particle synthesis and encoding and probe incorporation into a single process to generate multifunctional particles bearing over a million unique codes. By using such particles, we demonstrate a multiplexed, single-fluorescence detection of DNA oligomers with encoded particle libraries that can be scanned rapidly in a flow-through microfluidic channel. Furthermore, we demonstrate with high specificity the same multiplexed detection using individual multiprobe particles."

We studied the role of autophagy in embryonic cavitation, the earliest PCD process in mammalian development. Embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from cells lacking the autophagy genes, atg5 or beclin 1, fail to cavitate. This defect is due to persistence of cell corpses, rather than impairment of PCD. Dying cells in autophagy gene null EBs fail to express the “eat-me” signal, phosphatidylserine exposure, and secrete lower levels of the “come-get-me” signal, lysophosphatidylcholine. These defects are associated with low levels of cellular ATP and are reversed by treatment with the metabolic substrate, methylpyruvate. Moreover, mice lacking atg5 display a defect in apoptotic corpse engulfment during embryonic development. We conclude that autophagy contributes to dead-cell clearance during PCD by a mechanism that likely involves the generation of energy-dependent engulfment signals.

The lysosomal degradation pathway, autophagy, is active during programmed cell death (PCD) in diverse taxa (Bursch, 2001Bursch W.

Autophagy is most pronounced in developmental processes that involve massive cell elimination, such as embryogenesis, insect metamorphosis, glandular atresia, and lumen formation. In such settings, it has often been assumed that autophagy is a form of nonapoptotic PCD. However, direct proof that autophagy is required for developmental cell death has been lacking, and alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain the presence of autophagy in dying cells during development. One theory is that autophagy may be activated in vivo as a cellular protective mechanism (Levine, 2005Levine B. Eating oneself and uninvited guests: autophagy-related pathways in cellular defense.Cell. 2005; 120: 159-162PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) since autophagy genes delay cell death in cultured mammalian cells subjected to starvation or trophic factor withdrawal (Boya et al., 2005Boya P.

Growth factor regulation of autophagy and cell survival in the absence of apoptosis.Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Another theory is that autophagy may be activated for cellular autolysis and self-clearance during forms of developmental PCD accompanied by insufficient availability of engulfment cells (Levine and Yuan, 2005Levine B. Yuan J. Autophagy in cell death: an innocent convict?.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, Yuan et al., 2003Yuan J. Lipinski M. Degterev A. Diversity in the Mechanisms of Neuronal Cell Death.Neuron. 2003; 40: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). While these theories are all biologically plausible, it is unknown why autophagy is active during developmental PCD. To evaluate the role of autophagy in PCD, we used a mouse model of embryogenesis. In mammalian development, the first wave of PCD occurs during cavitation of the early embryo; the solid embryonic ectoderm undergoes apoptosis to form the proamniotic cavity (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1995Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Signals for death and survival: a two-step mechanism for cavitation in the vertebrate embryo.Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This process can be mimicked in vitro by culturing mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in the absence of feeder cells and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Poirier et al., 1991Poirier F. Chan C.T. Timmons P.M. Robertson E.J. Evans M.J. Rigby P.W. The murine H19 gene is activated during embryonic stem cell differentiation in vitro and at the time of implantation in the developing embryo.Development. 1991; 113: 1105-1114PubMed Google Scholar). In these conditions, ES cells form undifferentiated cell aggregates that develop into simple embryoid bodies (EBs), containing an outer layer of endodermal cells and an inner solid core of ectodermal cells. The inner ectodermal cells of the simple EBs undergo PCD to form cystic EBs. We examined the effect of null mutations in autophagy genes atg5 and beclin 1 on the ability of ES cells to form cystic EBs. Atg5 is an acceptor molecule for the ubiquitin-like molecule Atg12, and the proper conjugation of Atg5 with Atg12 is required for the elongation of the autophagic membrane (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 is the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg6 and interacts with Class III PI3K (Vps34) to mediate the localization of other autophagy proteins to the preautophagosomal membrane (Kihara et al., 2001Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

ES cells lacking either atg5 or beclin 1 are defective in autophagosome formation (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, Yue et al., 2003Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Beclin 1, an autophagy gene essential for early embryonic development, is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Therefore, by culturing these ES cells in conditions that mimic in vivo embryogenesis, we could examine the role of autophagy in PCD during mammalian morphogenesis. Our results indicate that autophagy genes are dispensable for PCD but are essential for the generation of engulfment signals required for the phagocytic removal of dying cells during development. To evaluate the role of autophagy in embryonic cavitation, we studied the morphology of EBs derived from previously described ES cells lacking two different autophagy genes, atg5, and beclin 1, their isogenic wild-type counterparts, and a clone of atg5−/− ES cells stably transformed with atg5 (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, Yue et al., 2003Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Beclin 1, an autophagy gene essential for early embryonic development, is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). We confirmed the lack of Atg5 and Beclin 1 expression in these cells by immunoblot analysis (Figures 1A and 1B). The atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− ES cells formed simple EBs similarly to isogenic wild-type control ES cells. However, we observed striking differences in the ability of wild-type and autophagy gene null simple EBs to form cystic EBs (Figures 1C–1E). Beginning at day 10, cavities were commonly observed in wild-type EBs, but only rarely observed in atg5−/− or beclin 1−/− EBs. By day 20, nearly 80% of atg5+/+ EBs and nearly 70% of beclin 1+/+ EBs were cystic, as compared to less than 10% of atg5−/− EBs and less than 20% of beclin 1−/− EBs (p < 0.0001 for both atg5+/+ versus atg5−/− and beclin 1+/+ versus beclin 1−/−; t test). The atg5-restored atg5−/− EBs had an intermediate phenotype (Figures 1C and 1E), consistent with their lower levels of Atg5 protein expression than wild-type EBs (Figure 1A). When cultured in the presence of LIF, wild-type ES cells still formed cystic EBs (albeit, as previously reported (Murray and Edgar, 2001Murray P. Edgar D. The regulation of embryonic stem cell differentiation by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF).Differentiation. 2001; 68: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) at a reduced frequency compared to EBs grown in the absence of LIF) whereas atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs were severely defective in the formation of cystic EBs (Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Based on these data, we conclude that two different autophagy genes, atg5 and beclin 1, are required for the normal cavitation of mouse EBs. To determine whether the cavitation defect observed in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs results from impaired apoptotic cell death, we performed TUNEL staining at serial time points in development (Figures 2A, 2B, and Figure S2A). Compared to atg5+/+ EBs, atg5−/− EBs have a mild increase in TUNEL-positive cells at day 3 (p = 0.048, t test) and a greater increase at day 6 (p < 0.0001, t test). The number of TUNEL-positive cells in atg5−/− EBs remained elevated at days 10, 14, and 20, whereas the numbers in atg5+/+ and atg5-restored atg5−/− EBs peaked at day 10, and declined at days 14 and day 20 in association with central clearing of the EBs. In the atg5−/− EBs, since nearly 80% of the cells were dead by day 6, the persistent high levels of TUNEL-positive cells until day 20 most likely reflects a failure to clear these dead cells. Indeed, upon higher power imaging at this time point, the central regions of atg5−/− EBs are almost all filled with cellular debris (Figure S3). Although there was an increase in TUNEL-positive cells in atg5−/− EBs at early time points, we did not detect a similar increase in beclin 1−/− EBs versus beclin 1+/+ EBs at days 3 and 6 (Figure S2A). This suggests that autophagy gene deficiency does not invariably result in accelerated cell death during EB development. However, similar to the defect in atg5−/− EBs, we also observed a defect in the clearance of TUNEL-positive cells in beclin 1−/− EBs. After reaching a peak at day 10 in EBs of both genotypes, the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells gradually declined in beclin 1+/+ EBs but remained persistently elevated in beclin 1−/− EBs (Figure S2A). At day 20, beclin 1−/− EBs, like atg5−/− EBs, were filled with cellular debris (Figure S3). Thus, deletion of two different autophagy genes does not impair PCD during EB development but does block the clearance of apoptotic cells. To further characterize the nature and kinetics of cell death in autophagy null EBs, we measured caspase activity using a DEVD cleavage assay (Figures 2C and S2B). Caspase activity peaked at day 6 in EBs of all genotypes. No significant differences in caspase activity were observed between atg5−/− and atg5+/+ at any time point examined (Figure 2C) or between beclin 1−/− and beclin 1+/+ EBs except for a mild increase in beclin 1+/+ EBs at day 6 (p = 0.036, t test) (Figure S2B). In addition, cell death in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/−EBs was accompanied by similar levels of active caspase 3 and similar apoptotic features to those observed in control EBs (data not shown). Since the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor, AIF, is essential for PCD during EB cavitation (Joza et al., 2001Joza N. Susin S. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A. Cheng H.-Y. Ravagnan L. et al.Essential role of the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor in programmed cell deat.Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), we also measured aif mRNA levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR in wild-type and autophagy gene-deficient EBs (Figures 2D and S2C). Aif gene expression was similar in atg5−/− versus atg5+/+ EBs (Figure 2D) and in beclin 1−/− versus beclin 1+/+ EBs (Figure S2C) at days 3, 6, and 10 in development. Taken together, our results indicate that atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs cells undergo PCD during EB formation that is similar to PCD observed in wild-type EBs with respect to TUNEL positivity, caspase activity, caspase 3 activation, cellular morphology, and aif mRNA expression. Thus, the failure of EBs derived from atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− ES cells to cavitate cannot be attributed to a lack of apoptotic cell death. Based on previous studies of EB cavitation using different targeted mutant ES cells, EB cavitation is thought to be accompanied by differentiation of primitive endoderm into visceral endoderm (VE), basement membrane deposition, secretion of BMP signals, death of the inner ectodermal core, and differentiation of the outer ectodermal layer into pseudostratified columnar epithelium (Li et al., 2003bLi S. Edgar D. Fassler R. Wadsworth W. Yurchenco P.D. The role of laminin in embryonic cell polarization and tissue organization.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 613-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). While our data above indicates that death of the inner ectodermal core occurs normally in autophagy null EBs, we also sought to assess other aspects of EB differentiation that have been previously associated with cavitation. Using RT-PCR, we found that the expression of three specific VE molecular markers, Hnf4, Afp, and Ttr (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1999Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. BMP signaling plays a role in visceral endoderm differentiation and cavitation in the early mouse embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 535-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), displayed similar kinetic patterns and similar magnitudes of increase in atg5−/− versus atg5+/+EBs (Figure 2D). Compared to beclin 1+/+ EBs, beclin 1−/− EBs have slightly higher levels of expression of Hnf4 (at day 6 and 10), of Afp (at day 6), and of Ttr (at day 3) (Figure S2C). While the basis for this increase is unclear, these data nonetheless demonstrate that VE differentiation markers are expressed in beclin 1−/− EBs at least as highly as in isogenic control EBs. Furthermore, at the ultrastructural level, atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs displayed morphologic changes indicative of normal endoderm differentiation, including the formation of a dome-shaped, vacuolated cells with microvilli at the periphery of the EBs (Figure S4). In addition, we found that two signals which have been shown to regulate both VE differentiation and ectodermal cavitation of EBs, BMP2 and BMP4 (Coucouvanis and Martin, 1999Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. BMP signaling plays a role in visceral endoderm differentiation and cavitation in the early mouse embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 535-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are expressed with similar kinetics and at similar levels in atg5−/− versus atg5+/+EBs (Figure 2D) and in beclin 1−/− versus beclin 1+/+ EBs (Figure S2C). Together, these data demonstrate that autophagy null EBs are not defective in VE differentiation or expression of the cavitation signals, BMP2 and BMP4. Since previously described mutants in EB cavitation all demonstrate defects in cell death, VE differentiation, and/or BMP signaling (Li et al., 2003bLi S. Edgar D. Fassler R. Wadsworth W. Yurchenco P.D. The role of laminin in embryonic cell polarization and tissue organization.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 613-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), our findings point to a unique role for autophagy genes in EB cavitation. To evalulate whether autophagy is activated during EB development, we performed immunoblot analysis of endogenous LC3 processing in atg5+/+, atg5−/−, and atg5-restored atg5−/− EBs (Figure 3A). LC3 is the mammalian ortholog of the yeast autophagy protein, Atg8, and is widely used as a marker of mammalian autophagy (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). During autophagy induction, cytosolic LC3-I undergoes proteolytic cleavage and lipidation to form the membrane-bound LC3-II. In atg5−/− EBs, LC3-II was absent at all time points, indicating that the atg5 null mutation abolishes autophagy in ES cells during EB development and confirming that autophagy is not required for PCD, VE differentiation, or upregulation of BMP2 or BMP4 gene expression. In atg5+/+ and atg5-restored atg5−/− EBs, LC3-II was detected at all time points, with the highest ratios of LC3-II/LC3-I observed early in development (day 3 and day 6), when maximal amounts of PCD are occurring. The activation of autophagy during EB cavitation is not due to withdrawal of the growth factor LIF, since similar levels of LC3-I to LC3-II conversion were observed in both atg5+/+ and beclin 1+/+ EBs cultured in the presence or absence of LIF (Figure S1B). To evaluate whether autophagy is active in the inner ectodermal cells that undergo PCD during EB development, we performed light microscopic analysis of wild-type atg5+/+ EBs stably transformed with the fluorescent autophagy marker, GFP-LC3 (Mizushima et al., 2004Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). GFP-LC3 redistributes from a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to form punctate structures that label preautophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes when autophagy is stimulated. In GFP-LC3-expressing EBs, the majority of inner ectodermal cells had punctate GFP-LC3 staining at day 3 (Figure 3B, left panel). By day 6, fewer cells were present in the inner ectoderm that expressed detectable GFP-LC3, an observation that may reflect the fewer number of viable cells present in ectoderm at this time (see image of TUNEL staining in atg5+/+ EBs on day 6 in Figure 2A). Nonetheless, amongst residual cells expressing GFP-LC3, the majority contained punctate staining, indicating the presence of autophagy (Figure 3B, right panel). Taken together, our data indicate that autophagy is active during PCD of the inner ectodermal cells, but is dispensable for its occurrence. In both atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs, TUNEL-positive cells persisted in the center of the EBs for more than 20 days in culture (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A; data not shown). This suggested that autophagy genes are essential for the clearance of dead cells during EB development. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the ultrastructure of the inner ectodermal regions of EBs at day 6 of development (Figures 4A and S5; data not shown). In atg5+/+ and beclin 1+/+ EBs, there was morphological evidence of engulfment of apoptotic cell corpses by healthy cells in the inner ectoderm. In contrast, in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs, the inner ectodermal layer consisted primarily of dead cells, and there was an almost complete lack of engulfment of apoptotic corpses. Even in regions at the periphery of the inner ectodermal core where dead cells were in close juxtaposition to healthy cells (see images 2 and 3 for atg5−/− EBs in Figure 4A), very few apoptotic corpses were visualized inside healthy cells, suggesting that factors other than availability of healthy cells contribute to defective dead cell engulfment. By quantitative EM analysis, 40%–50% of dead cells in atg5+/+ and beclin 1+/+ EBs were engulfed inside healthy neighboring cells as compared to 0%–10% in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs (p = 0.002 for atg5+/+ versus atg5−/− EBs, p = 0.003 for beclin 1+/+ versus beclin 1−/− EBs, t test) (Figures 4B and 4C). Thus, there is a marked defect in apoptotic corpse engulfment in both atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs. The engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes depends on signals from the apoptotic cell, including markers on the apoptotic cell surface (referred to as “eat-me” signals) and signals secreted by the apoptotic cell (referred to as “come-get-me” signals) (Grimsley and Ravichandran, 2003Grimsley C. Ravichandran K.S. Cues for apoptotic cell engulfment: eat-me, don't eat-me and come-get-me signals.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 648-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, Lauber et al., 2004Lauber K. Blumenthal S.G. Waibel M. Wesselborg S. Clearance of apoptotic cells: getting rid of the corpses.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Given the engulfment defect in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs, we hypothesized that autophagy genes may be essential for the generation of eat-me and/or come-get-me signals in apoptotic cells. The best-characterized eat-me signal is the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, a process that can be detected by staining with the PS-specific probe, annexin V (Grimsley and Ravichandran, 2003Grimsley C. Ravichandran K.S. Cues for apoptotic cell engulfment: eat-me, don't eat-me and come-get-me signals.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 648-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We compared the outer membrane leaflet exposure of PS in atg5−/− and atg5+/+ EBs and in beclin 1−/− and beclin 1+/+ EBs by adding biotinylated annexin V to live EB cultures which were then fixed, sectioned, and stained with HRP-avidin (Figure 5A). The pattern of annexin V staining in the inner ectodermal cells of atg5+/+ and beclin 1+/+ EBs (Figures 5A and S6) was identical to that observed for TUNEL staining (Figure 2A and data not shown), indicating that apoptotic wild-type EB cells expose PS at their outer membrane surface. In contrast, almost no annexin V staining was observed in the inner ectodermal cells of atg5−/− or beclin 1−/− EBs (Figures 5A and S6), despite the presence of TUNEL positivity, caspase 3 activation, and ultrastructural characteristics of apoptosis. The percentage of annexin V-positive EBs was 70%–80% in wild-type EBs whereas only 8%–12% of atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs were annexin V-positive (p < 0.0001 for atg5+/+ versus atg5−/− EBs, p = 0.009 for beclin 1+/+ versus beclin 1−/− EBs, t test) (Figure 5B). Therefore, two different autophagy genes, beclin 1 and atg5, that act at different steps in the autophagy pathway, are essential for the generation of a critical engulfment signal, PS exposure, that occurs in PCD during embryonic cavitation. This requirement for autophagy genes in PS exposure is not observed in single ES cell cultures treated with apoptosis-inducing agents such as etoposide, mitomycin C, and staurosporine (Figure S7) suggesting that unique mechanisms exist for regulating PS exposure in three-dimensional tissue models. The release of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) from apoptotic cells functions as a critical come-get-me signal and chemoattractant for phagocyte recruitment (Lauber et al., 2003Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. et al.Apoptotic cells induce migration of phagocytes via caspase-3-mediated release of a lipid attraction signal.Cell. 2003; 113: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), we analyzed the culture media of EBs for three forms of LPC, 16:0 LPC, 18:0 LPC, and 18:1 LPC, at both day 3 and day 6 in development (Figures 5C and 5D). The secretion of these three forms of LPC was significantly lower in atg5−/− EBs versus atg5+/+ EBs (p = 0.003 for day 3, p = 0.007 for day 6, paired t test) and in beclin 1−/− versus beclin 1+/+ EBs (p = 0.004 for day 3, p = 0.001 for day 6, paired t test). Thus, autophagy null EBs are deficient in the secretion of an important chemoattractant factor, LPC, which is involved in triggering the efficient removal of apoptotic corpses. This defect in secretion of chemoattractant signals may explain the absence of healthy phagocytic cells in the inner ectodermal core of autophagy null EBs. One function of autophagy is to generate amino acids and fatty acids that are utilized by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for ATP production (Lum et al., 2005bLum J.J. DeBerardinis R.J. Thompson C.B. Autophagy in metazoans: cell survival in the land of plenty.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We postulated that this ATP-generating function of autophagy in dying cells may be required for the expression of apoptotic corpse engulfment signals. To begin to investigate this hypothesis, we measured ATP levels in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs and wild-type control EBs. As predicted, ATP levels were significantly lower at both day 3 and day 6 in development in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs than in wild-type EBs (p < 0.0001 for day 3 and p = 0.016 for day 6 for atg5−/− versus atg5+/+ EBs, and p < 0.0001 for day 3 and p = 0.018 for day 6 for beclin 1−/− versus beclin 1+/+ EBs, t test) (Figures 6A and 6B). The decreased ATP levels in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs demonstrates a role for autophagy genes in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis during development. We determined whether the defect in ATP production in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs could be reversed by treating the EBs with a cell-permeable form of pyruvate, methylpyruvate (MP), that serves as an alternative metabolic substrate for the TCA cycle. MP has been used previously to restore cellular bioenergetics in autophagy-deficient cells deprived of trophic factor support (Lum et al., 2005bLum J.J. DeBerardinis R.J. Thompson C.B. Autophagy in metazoans: cell survival in the land of plenty.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that one dose of 10 mM MP restored ATP production in both atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs to levels that were equivalent to those observed in untreated wild-type EBs (Figures 6A and 6B). This pattern was observed both when EBs were treated with MP on day 2 and ATP production was measured on day 3 (Figure 6A) and when EBs were treated with MP on day 4 and ATP production was measured on day 6 of development (Figure 6B). MP had no effect on ATP levels in atg5+/+ or beclin 1+/+ EBs, indicating that it specifically reverses the defect in autophagy null EBs and does not act as stimulator of ATP production in autophagy-competent cells (Figures 6A and 6B). Further, MP did not alter the levels of cell death as measured by quantitative TUNEL analyses in either wild-type or autophagy null EBs (Figures 6C and 6D). This suggests that MP restores normal levels of ATP production in autophagy-deficient EBs by increasing cellular production of ATP rather than by increasing cell viability. Next, we evaluated the effects of restoring ATP production by MP treatment on apoptotic cell engulfment, PS exposure, LPC secretion, and early stages of cavity formation in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs. Upon EM analysis, MP treatment (administered at day 4) had no discernible effects on the ultrastructure of wild-type EBs at day 6 of development (Figure 4A for atg5+/+; data not shown for beclin 1+/+). In contrast, MP treatment significantly altered the ultrastructure of atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs. Unlike untreated autophagy gene-deficient EBs, MP-treated atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs contained a pattern of dead cells similar to that observed in wild-type EBs, with an inner ectodermal core composed of a mix of healthy and dead cells (Figure 4A for atg5+/+; data not shown for beclin 1+/+). Moreover, upon MP treatment, the percentage of engulfed dead cells increased in atg5−/− and beclin 1−/− EBs to levels that were"

Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrating that UV induction of POMC/MSH in skin is directly controlled by p53. Whereas p53 potently stimulates the POMC promoter in response to UV, the absence of p53, as in knockout mice, is associated with absence of the UV-tanning response. The same pathway produces β-endorphin, another POMC derivative, which potentially contributes to sun-seeking behaviors. Furthermore, several instances of UV-independent pathologic pigmentation are shown to involve p53 “mimicking” the tanning response. p53 thus functions as a sensor/effector for UV pigmentation, which is a nearly constant environmental exposure. Moreover, this pathway is activated in numerous conditions of pathologic pigmentation and thus mimics the tanning response.

Ultraviolet radiation (UV) represents a definitive risk factor for skin cancer, especially when exposure occurs in combination with certain underlying genetic traits such as red hair and fair skin (Fitzpatrick and Sober, 1985Fitzpatrick T.B.

Pigmentation of the skin results from the synthesis of melanin in the pigment-producing cells, the melanocytes, followed by distribution and transport of pigment granules to neighboring keratinocytes. It is commonly believed that melanin is crucial for absorption of free radicals that have been generated within the cytoplasm by UV, and it acts as a direct shield from UV and visible light radiation (Pathak and Fanselow, 1983Pathak M.A. Fanselow D.L.

Molecular and genetic data indicate that variations in the coding region of the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) play an important role in tanning and pigmentation in humans (Valverde et al., 1995Valverde P.

Genet. 1995; 11: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). MC1R is expressed in melanocytes and is activated by its ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). This propigmentation hormone is produced and secreted following UV by both keratinocytes and melanocytes in the skin (Schauer et al., 1994Schauer E. Trautinger F. Kock A. Schwarz A. Bhardwaj R. Simon M. Ansel J.C. Schwarz T. Luger T.A. Proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides are synthesized and released by human keratinocytes.J. Clin.

The gene encoding α-MSH is pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a multicomponent precursor for α-MSH (melanotropic), ACTH (adrenocorticotropic), and the opioid peptide β-endorphin. Normal synthesis of α-MSH and ACTH is an important determinant of constitutive human pigmentation and the cutaneous response to UV (Lunec et al., 1990Lunec J. Pieron C. Sherbet G.V. Thody A.J.

The Melanotropins. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1998Google Scholar). When taken together with the fact that circulating levels of α-MSH and ACTH are low in humans, these findings suggest that cutaneous activity of these two hormones might involve primarily local paracrine, or perhaps autocrine, effects within the epidermis (Abdel-Malek et al., 2000Abdel-Malek Z.

Although expression of POMC/α-MSH is critical for the UV-photopigmentation response, the underlying mechanism of UV-mediated expression of α-MSH is not known. The tumor-suppressor protein p53 (Lane and Crawford, 1979Lane D.P. Crawford L.V.

Jang S.K. Presence of a potent transcription activating sequence in the p53 protein.Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, Farmer et al., 1992Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C. Wild-type p53 activates transcription in vitro.Nature. 1992; 358: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). It has been shown to directly activate transcription of numerous genes such as those that regulate cell-cycle progression, apoptotic cellular pathways, and others (Levine et al., 2006Levine A.J. Hu W. Feng Z. The P53 pathway: what questions remain to be explored?.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Loss of function of p53 leads to aberrant cell growth and survival responses and, as such, p53 dysregulation plays an integral part in the genesis of human cancer. In the skin, p53 function is critical for the retention of tissue integrity following UV irradiation. p53−/− mice exhibited an enormously enhanced propensity to develop tumors following UVB by week 16, while none of the comparably treated p53+/+ mice developed skin tumors after 17 weeks (Li et al., 1998Li G. Tron V. Ho V. Induction of squamous cell carcinoma in p53-deficient mice after ultraviolet irradiation.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). UV can induce “signature” mutations in the p53 gene, which are almost exclusively dipyrimidine C to T substitutions that include CC to TT frameshift mutations; these are rarely seen in noncutaneous tumors (Brash et al., 1991Brash D.E. Rudolph J.A. Simon J.A. Lin A. McKenna G.J. Baden H.P. Halperin A.J. Ponten J. A role for sunlight in skin cancer: UV-induced p53 mutations in squamous cell carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sunlight and skin cancer: inhibition of p53 mutations in UV-irradiated mouse skin by sunscreens.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These mutations were found in the skin of UV-irradiated mice months before tumor development (Ananthaswamy et al., 1997Ananthaswamy H.N. Loughlin S.M. Cox P. Evans R.L. Ullrich S.E. Kripke M.L. Sunlight and skin cancer: inhibition of p53 mutations in UV-irradiated mouse skin by sunscreens.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutations in p53 are absent from most melanomas (Lubbe et al., 1994Lubbe J. Reichel M. Burg G. Kleihues P. Absence of p53 gene mutations in cutaneous melanoma.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 819-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the above activities, p53 has been shown to be essential for the formation of “sunburn cells,” which are a hallmark of sunburns (Ziegler et al., 1994Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Leffell D.J. Simon J.A. Sharma H.W. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D.E. Sunburn and p53 in the onset of skin cancer.Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). These apoptotic keratinocytes are absent in p53−/− mice following UV irradiation. This important discovery provided a striking example of p53's pivotal role in regulating keratinocyte apoptosis in the context of a naturally occurring environmental exposure. Collectively, these observations led us to examine the possibility that p53 may also participate in regulation of the pigmentation response to UV. Previous data had suggested that the POMC gene is upregulated at both protein and mRNA levels following UV irradiation of skin (Iyengar, 1994Iyengar B.

Although RNA upregulation could occur through a variety of mechanisms, we examined the proximal 1 kb promoter region of the POMC gene to search for consensus transcription-factor-binding elements that are conserved between human, rat, and mouse. Among the various consensus elements found, one was particularly noteworthy due to its known regulation by UV: p53. We therefore examined primary human keratinocytes and the mouse keratinocyte line PAM212 for both POMC and p53 levels following UV, as shown in Figure 1. A 100 J/m2 UVB dose was administered in this experiment (see Experimental Procedures). This dose is equivalent to the standard erythema dose (SED; Diffey et al., 1997Diffey B.L. Jansen C.T. Urbach F. Wulf H.C. The standard erythema dose: a new photobiological concept.Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1997; 13: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, CIE Standard, 1998CIE StandardErythema reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose. Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage, Vienna1998Google Scholar), which is commonly used as a measure of sunlight. As a point of reference, the ambient exposure on a clear summer day in Europe is approximately 30–40 SED. Also, an exposure dose of 4 SED would be expected to produce moderate erythema on unacclimated white skin but minimal or no erythema on previously exposed (tanned) skin. UV markedly induced expression of POMC mRNA and protein by 6 hr, and p53 induction was already maximal by 3 hr, which is consistent with its known stabilization by UV (Figures 1A and 1B). At 24 hr the levels of POMC protein were lower relative to those found after 6 hr in keratinocytes (human as well as mouse), probably as a result of the proteolytic processing and secretion by keratinocytes (Schauer et al., 1994Schauer E. Trautinger F. Kock A. Schwarz A. Bhardwaj R. Simon M. Ansel J.C. Schwarz T. Luger T.A. Proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides are synthesized and released by human keratinocytes.J. Clin.

ELISA analysis of the corresponding culture media demonstrated >30-fold induction of α-MSH secretion by keratinocytes after UV (Figure S2). To test whether POMC is a p53-responsive gene in keratinocytes, we introduced pcDNA-HA-p53 or empty vector into the PAM212 keratinocyte cell line, and we assessed POMC expression by a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay and immunoblotting (Figure 1C). POMC expression was significantly induced in response to p53 at both mRNA and protein levels. The rapid induction of POMC following UV radiation of keratinocytes is consistent with the rapid, posttranslational stabilization that is responsible for p53 upregulation following UV (Kastan et al., 1991Kastan M.B.

Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5530) Google Scholar). To test whether POMC induction by p53 correlates with other p53-mediated functions such as apoptosis, the PAM212 keratinocyte cell line was transfected with varying doses of pcDNA-HA-p53 and assessed for apoptotic cells (by flow cytometry) as well as POMC mRNA (by qPCR). p53 overexpression triggered both POMC expression and apoptosis, and there was no obvious difference in threshold for these two endpoints (Figure S3), though differences might exist in other settings, such as within skin or with specific genetic backgrounds. Examination of POMC mRNA stability was also undertaken (±UV), and its decay kinetics were measured in the presence of actinomycin D (Figure S1). No significant changes in POMC mRNA stability were observed with UV. To examine whether p53 is required for UV-mediated induction of POMC, we stably introduced a synthetic dominant-negative p53 allele (p53DD; Shaulian et al., 1992Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Identification of a minimal transforming domain of p53: negative dominance through abrogation of sequence-specific DNA binding.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) into the PAM212 keratinocyte line and into the human primary foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) “PAMDD” and “HFKDD.” As shown in Figures 2A and S4A, ectopic expression of p53DD was seen to abrogate induction of both mRNA and protein levels of POMC following UV. We also studied keratinocytes from wild-type and p53 null mice (littermates). p53 nullizygous keratinocytes exhibited no measurable POMC mRNA upregulation following UV irradiation (Figure 2B). Of note, western blotting demonstrated that basal POMC expression (prior to UV) was not significantly diminished in the absence of p53, which suggests that p53 is not globally required for POMC expression but is essential for the UV-responsive induction of POMC in keratinocytes. This finding is corroborated by the obvious fact that p53−/− C57Bl6 mice exhibit black fur. A potential p53-binding site was identified in the POMC 5′-flanking region ∼300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in humans, and a similar site was identified in the mouse promoter (Bargonetti et al., 1991Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C.

Identification of p53 as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein.Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). A series of luciferase reporters was tested for UV responsiveness after being transfected into PAM212 keratinocytes. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, deletion mutants, as well as a site-specific mutation at the p53 consensus element, abrogated UV responsiveness of the POMC promoter. Furthermore, parallel transfections into PAM212 and PAM212/p53DD revealed that suppression of endogenous p53 is sufficient to abrogate the UV-induced reporter activity (Figure 3C). Classical electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated a UV-induced DNA-binding activity that was supershifted by anti-p53 antibody and that had sequence specificity for the p53 consensus probe (but not the point mutant) in keratinocyte nuclear extracts (Figure 3D). To determine whether p53 occupies the endogenous POMC promoter in cells, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from UV-irradiated versus unirradiated mouse keratinocytes (PAM212) or human primary keratinocytes. p53 binding to the POMC promoter was detected following UV, whereas no association was detected in unirradiated cells (Figure 3E). Controls included ChIP of the p53 response element in the p21 promoter, in the actin promoter, and in intronic sequences of the POMC gene (negative controls). The human p53 protein was also able to bind to the mouse POMC promoter (Figure S4B). These data suggest that p53 directly modulates transcriptional activity of the POMC promoter following UV. To assess whether the induction of POMC by UV (via p53) occurs in nonkeratinocytes, we exposed melanocytes, fibroblasts, and spleen cells to UV. All three lineages displayed reproducible POMC induction, but the magnitude of the effect was significantly greater in keratinocytes (16- to 25-fold in keratinocytes versus ∼3-fold in nonkeratinocytes; Figures S5A and S6). Using p53−/− primary melanocytes, we found that even the modest (∼3-fold) induction of POMC by UV in melanocytes appears to require p53 (Figure S5B). The degree of p53 induction by UV did not predictably correlate with POMC induction in other cell types (e.g., melanocytes or mouse primary spleen cells; Figures S5A and S6), which suggests tissue-specific differences in POMC promoter responsiveness to p53 following UV. To test the in vivo requirement of p53 for UV pigmentation, age-matched wild-type and p53 null C57Bl6 mice were subjected to UV; this was followed by an evaluation of their ears and tails, which are two locations that contain epidermal melanocytes (furry regions lack epidermal melanocytes; Nordlund et al., 1986Nordlund J.J. Collins C.E. Rheins L.A. Prostaglandin E2 and D2 but not MSH stimulate the proliferation of pigment cells in the pinnal epidermis of the DBA/2 mouse.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 4A, S7A, and S7B, visible tanning of ears and tails was observed in wild-type but not in p53 null mice. Interestingly, baseline pigmentation was not appreciably different in fur of p53 wild-type versus that of null mice but was reproducibly slightly lighter in epidermal tail skin of p53 nulls (Figure S7A). Histologic analyses revealed absence of both POMC and melanin induction in UV-irradiated p53−/− skin (Figures 4B and 4C). POMC mRNA induction was also directly measured in skin of the same mice following UV radiation. As shown in Figure 4D, significant POMC mRNA induction was observed following UV but was absent in p53−/− mice. Aside from α-MSH, another proteolytic cleavage product of POMC is the opioid receptor ligand β-endorphin, which previously has been suggested to be a mediator of sun-seeking behavior in man (Wintzen et al., 1996Wintzen M.

As shown in Figure 4E, expression of β-endorphin, like that of α-MSH, was induced by UV in a p53-dependent manner. These data indicate that p53 is essential for in vivo POMC induction following UV and establish p53 as an integral molecule in the tanning response. To explore whether similar events occur in the UV response of human skin, discarded normal human skin specimens were exposed to UV and stained over a time course for p53, α-MSH peptide, and the melanocytic transcription factor MITF. Induction of MITF by α-MSH/MC1R/cAMP indicates activation of the pigmentation pathway (D'Orazio et al., 2006D'Orazio J.A. Nobuhisa T. Cui R. Arya M. Spry M. Wakamatsu K. Igras V. Kunisada T.

As shown in Figure 5, p53 is rapidly induced in virtually every epidermal keratinocyte by 1 hr after UV exposure. α-MSH is expressed later (3–6 hr) and is also seen throughout the epidermal keratinocyte population. MITF is strongly induced at 6 hr and localizes to the melanocyte nuclei that are found in the basal epidermal population (Figure 5) as previously reported by King et al., 1999King R. Weilbaecher K.N.

Pathol. 1999; 155: 731-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar. These studies indicate a similar temporal induction of signaling components following UV irradiation of either mouse or human skin. The role of p53 in the UV-pigment response is notable because p53 protein may be stabilized by various non-UV stressors, which raises the possibility that it may participate in cutaneous pigmentation in a variety of non-UV-associated settings. To test this, PAM212 keratinocytes were treated with the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, and induction of p53 and POMC was measured. As shown in Figure 6A, both p53 and POMC were induced. A simple test of the possibility that p53 may participate in non-UV skin hyperpigmentation is found in the response to topical 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU), a known inducer of p53 (Lowe et al., 1994Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A. Remington L. Ruley H.E. Fisher D.E. Housman D.E. Jacks T. p53 status and the efficacy of cancer therapy in vivo.Science. 1994; 266: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). This drug is used in multiple human dermatologic conditions and has been described to induce hyperpigmentation as a side effect in a fraction of patients (PDR staff, 2005PDR staffDermatology.in: Physicians' Desk Reference. Thomson PDR, Montvale, NJ2005: 3267Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 6B and 6C, chronic exposure to topical 5-FU induced hyperpigmentation in p53 wild-type but not p53−/−, mouse skin, which suggests that non-UV triggers of p53 may also induce pigmentation. This result is consistent with previous reports that DNA damage (or its repair) can stimulate tanning (Eller et al., 1994Eller M.S. Yaar M.

To assay the dynamic behavior of chromatin in living cells, we used genomic tiling arrays to measure histone H3 turnover in G1-arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae at single-nucleosome resolution over 4% of the genome, and at lower (∼265 base pair) resolution over the entire genome. We find that nucleosomes at promoters are replaced more rapidly than at coding regions and that replacement rates over coding regions correlate with polymerase density. In addition, rapid histone turnover is found at known chromatin boundary elements. These results suggest that rapid histone turnover serves to functionally separate chromatin domains and prevent spread of histone states."
https://openalex.org/W2005435367,"During heart development the second heart field (SHF) provides progenitor cells for most cardiomyocytes and expresses the homeodomain factor Nkx2-5. We now show that feedback repression of Bmp2/Smad1 signaling by Nkx2-5 critically regulates SHF proliferation and outflow tract (OFT) morphology. In the cardiac fields of Nkx2-5 mutants, genes controlling cardiac specification (including Bmp2) and maintenance of the progenitor state were upregulated, leading initially to progenitor overspecification, but subsequently to failed SHF proliferation and OFT truncation. In Smad1 mutants, SHF proliferation and deployment to the OFT were increased, while Smad1 deletion in Nkx2-5 mutants rescued SHF proliferation and OFT development. In Nkx2-5 hypomorphic mice, which recapitulate human congenital heart disease (CHD), OFT anomalies were also rescued by Smad1 deletion. Our findings demonstrate that Nkx2-5 orchestrates the transition between periods of cardiac induction, progenitor proliferation, and OFT morphogenesis via a Smad1-dependent negative feedback loop, which may be a frequent molecular target in CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2133663463,"High-level visual cortex in humans includes functionally defined regions that preferentially respond to objects, faces and places. It is unknown how these regions develop and whether their development relates to recognition memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the development of several functionally defined regions including object (lateral occipital complex, LOC)-, face ('fusiform face area', FFA; superior temporal sulcus, STS)- and place ('parahippocampal place area', PPA)-selective cortices in children (ages 7-11), adolescents (12-16) and adults. Right FFA and left PPA volumes were substantially larger in adults than in children. This development occurred by expansion of FFA and PPA into surrounding cortex and was correlated with improved recognition memory for faces and places, respectively. In contrast, LOC and STS volumes and object-recognition memory remained constant across ages. Thus, the ventral stream undergoes a prolonged maturation that varies temporally across functional regions, is determined by brain region rather than stimulus category, and is correlated with the development of category-specific recognition memory."
https://openalex.org/W4210384175,"Histone lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated. These posttranslational modifications regulate the affinity of effector proteins and may also impact chromatin structure independent of their role as adaptors. In order to study histone lysine methylation, particularly in the context of chromatin, we have developed a chemical approach to install analogs of methyl lysine into recombinant proteins. This approach allows for the rapid generation of large quantities of histones in which the site and degree of methylation can be specified. We demonstrate that these methyl-lysine analogs (MLAs) are functionally similar to their natural counterparts. These methylated histones were used to examine the influence of specific lysine methylation on the binding of effecter proteins and the rates of nucleosome remodeling. This simple method of introducing site-specific and degree-specific methylation into recombinant histones provides a powerful tool to investigate the biochemical mechanisms by which lysine methylation influences chromatin structure and function."

Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling shifts mesenchymal cell fate toward osteoblastogenesis at the expense of adipogenesis; however, molecular mechanisms by which Wnt signaling alters mesenchymal cell fate have not been fully investigated. Our prior work indicates that multipotent precursors express adipogenic and osteoblastogenic transcription factors at physiological levels and that ectopic expression of Wnt10b in bipotential ST2 cells suppresses expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and increases expression of Runx2, Dlx5, and osterix.

Our group previously reported that expression of Wnt10b in bone marrow results in an increase in trabecular bone density, whereas Wnt10b-deficient mice exhibit a low bone mass phenotype, indicating that Wnt10b is an endogenous regulator of bone formation (4Bennett C.N. Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Suva L.J. Lane T.F. Hankenson K.D. MacDougald O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Furthermore, various Wnt signaling components, including Wnt10b, are induced in response to mechanical loading, further suggesting that Wnt signaling plays an important role in bone physiology (11Robinson J.A. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Yaworsky P.J. Cullen D.M. Zhao W. Li C. Kharode Y. Sauter L. Babij P. Brown E.L. Hill A.A. Akhter M.P. Johnson M.L. Recker R.R. Komm B.S. Bex F.J. J. Biol.

One of the main mechanisms by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases bone mass is to increase the number of osteoblasts, which play a critical role in bone formation. Genetic and cell culture studies have indicated that Wnt signaling increases proliferation and decreases apoptosis of osteoblasts. For instance, targeted deletion of a Wnt coreceptor, low density lipoprotein-related protein 5, in mice resulted in low bone mass and reduced proliferation of osteoblasts (12Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R. Lobov I. Chang B.H. Glass II, D.A. Hartmann C. Li L. Hwang T.H. Brayton C.F. Lang R.A. Karsenty G. Chan L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), whereas transgenic expression of low density lipoprotein-related protein 5 with a gain of function mutation increased bone mass and decreased apoptosis of osteoblasts (3Babij P.

Res. 2003; 18: 960-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice devoid of the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled-related protein 1, exhibited high bone mass due to reduced apoptosis (2Bodine P.V. Zhao W. Kharode Y.P. Bex F.J. Lambert A.J. Goad M.B. Gaur T. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Komm B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1222-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In addition to effects on proliferation and apoptosis of osteoblasts, Wnt/β-catenin signaling also stimulates osteoblastogenesis (13Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. Macdougald O.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts arise from mesenchymal precursor cells that have potential to differentiate into many different cell types, including myoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes (13Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. Macdougald O.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Often, imbalance among the cell types is observed with bone loss. In particular, an increased ratio of adipocytes to osteoblasts is associated with age-related osteoporosis (14Nuttall M.E. Gimble J.M. Bone. 2000; 27: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Gimble J.M. Zvonic S. Floyd Z.E. Kassem M. Nuttall M.E. J. Cell.

Thus, it has been suggested that targeting regulatory factors that alter mesenchymal cell fate to increase the number of osteoblasts has the potential to provide novel therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis and related bone diseases (14Nuttall M.E.

However, our molecular understanding of how Wnt signaling shifts mesenchymal cell fate remains limited. Although the transcriptional cascade for osteoblastogenesis is not fully defined, studies have provided insight into transcriptional components regulating differentiation into osteoblasts. A runt domain-containing transcription factor, Runx2 (AML3/PEBP2αA1/CBFA1) (17Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) is required for osteoblast differentiation, as shown by the observation that Runx2 deficient embryos lack ossification due to the absence of osteoblasts (18Otto F.

Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). A zinc finger transcription factor, osterix, also appears to play an essential role in osteoblast differentiation, since osterix-deficient mice exhibit a bone phenotype similar to that of Runx2 deficient mice (20Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). Osterix appears to be downstream of Runx2, since osterix is not expressed in Runx2-deficient mice and Runx2 is expressed in osterix-deficient mice (20Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). In addition, two homeobox transcription factors, Msx2 and Dlx5, are also thought to regulate osteoblast differentiation. Mice with deletion of Msx2 or Dlx5 exhibit a marked delay of ossification in the bones of the skull (21Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S.

Bober E. Barbieri O. Simeone A. Levi G. Development. 1999; 126: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Msx2 might lie upstream of Runx2, and Dlx5 might act down-stream of or be independent of Runx2. However, interactions between these transcription factors are considerably more complex than a simple linear relationship causing differentiation. For example, one study showed that Dlx5 is required for BMP2 (bone morphogenic protein 2)-induced Runx2 expression (23Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M.

On the other hand, the genetic cascade of adipogenesis is well established based upon considerable analyses of in vitro and in vivo models. In response to adipogenic inducers, early transcription factors C/EBPβ, 4The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcription.

Together they increase expression of the two important transcription factors for adipogenesis, PPARγ2 and C/EBPα, which then induce downstream genes that are characteristic of mature adipocytes, including FABP4, Glut4, and adiponectin (25Rosen E.D.

In addition to this traditional cascade, several other transcription factors have been found to regulate adipogenesis. For example, a lipogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, SREBP1c, enhances adipogenesis by inducing expression of the PPARγ ligand (28Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E.

Herein, we report on our findings that Wnt signaling decreases expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ to regulate fate of mesenchymal precursors toward osteoblastogenesis and away from adipogenesis. Cell Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and ST2 cells were cultured essentially as described previously (4Bennett C.N. Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Suva L.J. Lane T.F. Hankenson K.D. MacDougald O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 42Kang S. Bajnok L. Longo K.A. Petersen R.K. Hansen J.B. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs and ST2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and in α-minimal essential medium, respectively, that contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For adipogenesis, cells that had been confluent for a day were treated with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 1 or 5 μm troglitazone (day 0). Subsequently, cells were fed 1 μg/ml insulin in 10% fetal bovine serum media on day 2, and refed with 10% fetal bovine serum media every 2 days subsequently. To induce osteoblastogenesis, confluent MEFs were switched to maintenance media containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. ST2 cells were differentiated under the same conditions except that 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid was used. CHIR99021 (3 μm in Me2SO) was used to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3. Accumulation of neutral lipids in adipocytes was evaluated with Oil Red-O staining (43Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16348-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Degree of mineralization in osteoblasts was determined with von Kossa or Alizarin Red staining. In von Kossa staining, silver substitutes for calcium in salts with phosphate and carbonate. Thus, detection of silver ions is an indirect measure of calcium content (44Bills C.E. Eisenberg H. Pallante S.L. Johns Hopkins Med. J. 1974; 128: 194-207PubMed Google Scholar). Alizarin Red S is an anthraquinone derivative that complexes with calcium, resulting in an orange-red-colored product (45Hankenson K.D. Bornstein P. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 46Puchtler H. Meloan S.N. Terry M.S. J. Histochem. Cyto-chem. 1969; 17: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infection and Constructs—Genes were stably introduced into MEFs and ST2 cells by retroviral infection as described previously (43Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16348-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pLHCX-Wnt10b was as described by Bennett et al. (4Bennett C.N. Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Suva L.J. Lane T.F. Hankenson K.D. MacDougald O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). pMSCV and pMSCV-PPARγ were provided by Evan Rosen (Harvard Medical School). pMSCV-C/EBPα was subcloned at BglII (5′) and Xho (3′) restriction sites from pBabe-C/EBPα at BamHI (5′) and SalI (3′). Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in a lysis buffer containing 1% SDS and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Lysates were boiled for 5 min, vortexed, and then boiled for an additional 5 min prior to storing at -20 °C. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Briefly, equal lysate volumes were loaded and separated by electrophoresis in 10 or 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulous membrane (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein loading between lanes was confirmed by Ponceau staining. Membranes were immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibodies, and secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution; IgG-peroxidase) was visualized with Super Signal (Pierce) enhanced chemiluminescence. Polyclonal FABP4 antibody (1:5000 dilution) was from Dr. David Bernlohr (University of Minnesota). PPARγ, C/EBPα (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and laminin (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signal Transduction) antibodies were obtained commercially. Quantitative RT-PCR—One μg of total RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SYBR green I was used to monitor amplification of DNA on the I-Cycler thermal cycler and IQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). After amplification, melting curve analysis was performed as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was normalized to cyclophilin or 18 S RNA. All primers were evaluated as described previously (4Bennett C.N. Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Suva L.J. Lane T.F. Hankenson K.D. MacDougald O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The corresponding primer sequences are 18 S (forward, 5′-cga tgc tct tag ctg agt gt-3′; reverse, 5′-ggt cca aga att tca cct ct-3′), cyclophilin (forward, 5′-tcc aaa gac agc aga aaa ctt tcg; reverse, 5′-tct tct tgc tgg tct tgc cat tcc-3′), C/EBPα (forward, 5′-tga aca aga aca gca acg ag-3′; reverse, 5′-tca ctg gtc acc tcc agc ac-3′), PPARγ (forward, 5′-gga aag aca acg gac aaa tca c-3′; reverse, 5′-tac gga tcg aaa ctg gca c-3′). Calcium Assay—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and decalcified with 0.6 n HCl and rotation of cell culture plates overnight at room temperature. Calcium content of the supernatant was estimated relative to a standard provided within the LiquiColor kit (Stanbio Laboratories) (47ter Brugge P.J. Wolke J.G. Jansen J.A. Clin. Oral. Implants Res. 2003; 14: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reaction between calcium and ortho-cresolpthalein complexone produces a purple complex at 580 nm, and color intensity is directly proportional to the concentration of calcium in the sample. After decalcification, cells were solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, 0.1% SDS, and the amount of protein was assayed (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Short Hairpin RNAs—Knock-down of endogenous genes was accomplished with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and pSUPERIOR. retro and pSUPERIOR.retro.neo + GFP retroviral vectors (Oligoengine). Target sequences were selected with software available on the Dharmacon, Invitrogen, and/or Ambion Web sites. Oligonucleotides synthesized by Invitrogen were annealed and subcloned into retroviral vectors at HindIII and BglII sites. The target sequences were 5′-gtttgagtttgctgtgaagtt-3′ for PPARγ and 5′-gcaagagccgagataaagcca-3′ for C/EBPα. shRNA constructs were introduced into cells using retroviral transduction as detailed above. Efficiency and specificity of suppression by shRNAs were evaluated with analyses of protein and/or RNA levels as indicated. Wnt10b Inhibits Adipogenesis and Promotes Osteoblastogenesis in Pluripotent Cell Culture Models—As reported previously (4Bennett C.N. Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Suva L.J. Lane T.F. Hankenson K.D. MacDougald O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), enforced expression of Wnt10b in bone marrow-derived ST2 cells stimulates osteoblastogenesis (Fig. 1A). Here we used MEFs to test whether activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates cell fate in another type of multipotent precursor cells. Although MEFs have been extensively used as a model for adipogenesis (42Kang S. Bajnok L. Longo K.A. Petersen R.K. Hansen J.B. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2003; 113: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) or osteoblast-like cells (52Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 303-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), depending upon the inducing stimulus. For instance, a bona fide bone anabolic protein, BMP4 stimulates mineralization (Fig. 1B) and increases expression of osteoblast genes, including type I collagen (data not shown). To activate Wnt signaling in MEFs, we ectopically expressed Wnt10b and exposed them to induction media for osteoblast or adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1, B and D). Control MEFs rarely undergo mineralization in osteogenic medium, which provides ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate to promote mineralization of extracellular matrix (Fig. 1, A and B). However, prolonged treatment with BMP4 stimulates mineralization of extracellular matrix, as assessed by Alizarin Red staining. Importantly, Wnt10b-expressing MEFs spontaneously differentiate into osteoblast-like cells, and BMP4 further enhances mineralization (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Wnt10b increases total deposition of calcium in cell matrix by ∼4- and ∼8-fold compared with control ST2 cells and MEFs, respectively (Fig. 1C). In response to adipogenic stimuli, control ST2 cells and MEFs infected with empty retrovirus vector differentiate into adipocytes and accumulated lipid droplets in cytoplasm as visualized by Oil Red-O staining (Fig. 1D), whereas Wnt10b-expressing cells showed a dramatic reduction in adipogenesis and accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data provide further evidence that activation of Wnt signaling inhibits adipogenesis and promotes osteoblastogenesis in pluripotent precursor cells. Wnt Signaling Represses Expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ—To investigate mechanisms whereby Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates cell fate, we measured mRNA expression of transcriptional components regulating adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis in ST2 cells infected with control or Wnt10b retroviruses (4Bennett C.N.

Retroviruses, including HIV-1, SIV, and EIAV, bind and recruit ALIX through YPX(n)L late-domain motifs (X = any residue; n = 1-3). Crystal structures reveal that human ALIX is composed of an N-terminal Bro1 domain and a central domain that is composed of two extended three-helix bundles that form elongated arms that fold back into a ""V."" The structures also reveal conformational flexibility in the arms that suggests that the V domain may act as a flexible hinge in response to ligand binding. YPX(n)L late domains bind in a conserved hydrophobic pocket on the second arm near the apex of the V, whereas CHMP4/ESCRT-III proteins bind a conserved hydrophobic patch on the Bro1 domain, and both interactions are required for virus budding. ALIX therefore serves as a flexible, extended scaffold that connects retroviral Gag proteins to ESCRT-III and other cellular-budding machinery."

We have determined the 2.8 angstrom structure of a bifunctional cell-wall cross-linking enzyme, including its transpeptidase and GT domains, both unliganded and complexed with the substrate analog moenomycin.

Homeotic gene clusters display conspicuous peaks of histone replacement at boundaries of cis-regulatory domains superimposed over broad regions of low replacement. Peaks of histone replacement closely correspond to nuclease-hypersensitive sites, binding sites for Polycomb and trithorax group proteins, and sites of nucleosome depletion. Our results suggest the existence of a continuous process that disrupts nucleosomes and maintains accessibility of cis-regulatory elements."

We found that small nucleotides ppGpp and pppGpp, which are induced upon starvation, appeared to inhibit replication directly by inhibiting primase, an essential component of the replication machinery. The replication forks arrested with (p)ppGpp did not recruit the recombination protein RecA, indicating that the forks are not disrupted.

DNA replication involves the action of >10 polypeptides and consists of initiation, elongation, and termination phases (Baker and Bell, 1998Baker T.A. Bell S.P.

Many bacteria, including B. subtilis, have a single circular chromosome (reviewed in Duggin and Wake, 2002Duggin I.G. Wake R.G. Termination of chromosome replication.in: Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A.

ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2002: 73-86Google Scholar) with one origin of replication (oriC). During initiation, the replication machinery loads onto oriC. Elongation proceeds bidirectionally and duplicates the leading and lagging strands at each replication fork. In B. subtilis, termination occurs at ter sites, located approximately opposite from oriC (Figure 1A), by the action of the replication-termination protein Rtp (Duggin and Wake, 2002Duggin I.G.

The stringent response, a pleiotropic response to starvation (Cashel et al., 1996Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.H. Vinella D. The stringent response.in: Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R.

The stringent response is triggered by amino acid starvation when RelA, a ribosome-bound enzyme, rapidly synthesizes the small nucleotides pppGpp (guanosine pentaphosphate) and ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate; together (p)ppGpp) from GTP and ATP. In E. coli, slow growth rates and nutritional downshifts inhibit replication initiation (Levine et al., 1991Levine A. Vannier F. Dehbi M. Henckes G. Seror S.J.

In B. subtilis, the stringent response regulates replication elongation. The stringent response can cause replication arrest ∼100–200 kbp to the left and right of oriC (Figure 1A; Levine et al., 1991Levine A. Vannier F. Dehbi M. Henckes G. Seror S.J.

Biol. 1991; 219: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was proposed that Rtp binds to sites (called LSTer and RSTer) in these regions to mediate this arrest (Autret et al., 1999Autret S. Levine A. Vannier F. Fujita Y. Seror S.J.

A checkpoint involving RTP, the replication terminator protein, arrests replication downstream of the origin during the Stringent Response in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that the replication-elongation inhibition caused by the stringent response in B. subtilis occurs throughout the chromosome. This response occurs independently of previously proposed specific arrest sites near oriC and independently of Rtp. The response is mediated by the starvation signals (p)ppGpp, which appear to directly inhibit primase, an essential component of the replication complex. Regulation of replication elongation allows a much more rapid response to starvation than if replication were regulated at initiation alone. Inhibition of replication elongation caused by a variety of adverse situations, including depletion of dNTPs or DNA damage, leads to arrest and disruption of replication forks, induction of the SOS response, and genomic instability (Michel et al., 2004Michel B. Grompone G. Flores M.J. Bidnenko V. Multiple pathways process stalled replication forks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12783-12788Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar and references therein). We found that the replication forks arrested by (p)ppGpp did not detectably recruit RecA, indicating that the forks were probably not disrupted. We suggest that (p)ppGpp-mediated replication arrest contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability by preventing disruptive fork arrest that might otherwise occur with uncontrolled replication during starvation. We used DNA microarrays to follow the progression of replication forks in B. subtilis, as has been done in E. coli (Khodursky et al., 2000Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Schmid M.B. DeRisi J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Analysis of topoisomerase function in bacterial replication fork movement: use of DNA microarrays.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Briefly, cells are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature to allow ongoing rounds of replication to finish. A new round of replication initiates after cells are shifted to permissive temperature. DNA samples were collected at various times, labeled with Cy5, mixed with Cy3-labeled reference DNA from cells with fully replicated chromosomes, and hybridized to DNA microarrays. The ratio of Cy5 to Cy3 represents the gene dosage and was determined for each gene spot and plotted versus gene position (Figures 1B–1F). Following replication, gene dosage doubled, and the average positions of the replication forks could be mapped and followed as the forks moved from oriC toward ter (Figures 1B–1E).Table 1B. subtilis Strains UsedStrainsGenotypeJH642 (AG174)trpC2 pheA1BB914ΔrelA::mlsaWendrich and Marahiel, 1997.JDW119Δrtp::kanJDW154dnaB134ts hutM+-lacO cat thrC::(Ppen-lacIΔ11-gfp(mut2) mls) polC::(polC-myc spc) Δrtp::kanJDW194dnaB134ts-zhb83::(Tn917 cat) Δrtp::kanJDW197dnaB134ts-zhb83::(Tn917 cat) ΔrelA::mlsJDW278pHV1610 (cat)bBruand et al., 1995.JDW280pHV1610-1 (cat)bBruand et al., 1995.KPL69dnaB134ts-zhb83::(Tn917 mls)KPL151dnaB134ts-zhb83::(Tn917 cat)KPL382dnaX::(dnaX-gfp(mut2) spc)cLemon and Grossman, 2000.KPL544hutM+-lacO cat thrC::(Ppen-lacIΔ11-gfp(mut2) mls)cLemon and Grossman, 2000.KPL549dnaB134ts hutM+-lacO cat thrC::(Ppen-lacIΔ11-gfp(mut2) mls) polC-myc spccLemon and Grossman, 2000.LAS40PY79 recA::(recA-gfp spc)dSimmons et al., 2007.a Wendrich and Marahiel, 1997Wendrich T.M.

Open table in a new tab The average rate of replication was ∼0.45–0.55 kb/s at 30°C for both the left and right forks (Figures 1G and 1H).

We noticed that one replication fork was slightly and consistently ahead of the other, which is similar to what was observed in E. coli (Breier et al., 2005Breier A.M. Weier H.U. Cozzarelli N.R. Independence of replisomes in Escherichia coli chromosomal replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3942-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We observed that replication forks arrested near oriC if amino acid starvation was induced at the same time that replication initiated, which is consistent with previous reports (Autret et al., 1999Autret S.

Addition of arginine hydroxamate (RHX), a nonfunctional arginine analog, quickly inhibited cell growth, causing the doubling time to increase from ∼55 min to >400 min. Forty minutes after replication initiation in cells treated with RHX, forks were ∼160 kb on either side of oriC (Figure 1F). In untreated cells, replication forks were much further along the chromosome, ∼500–700 kb to either side of oriC (Figure 1D). This observation appeared to support the model that cis-acting sites (LSTer and RSTer) ∼100–200 kb to each side of oriC mediate a starvation-induced replication arrest (Autret et al., 1999Autret S. Levine A. Vannier F. Fujita Y. Seror S.J.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, this model predicts that if replication forks already passed the putative oriC-proximal arrest sites, then their progression should not be inhibited by starvation. To test this prediction, we induced starvation by adding RHX 20 min after initiation of replication, when forks have already proceeded ∼400–500 kb from oriC and passed the proposed arrest sites in the ∼100–200 kb region ( Figures 1G and 2A). We found that replication forks still arrested within 10 min after amino acid starvation (Figure 1G) ∼600–700 kb from oriC (Figure 2B), which demonstrates that starvation-induced replication arrest can take place not just near oriC, but elsewhere on the chromosome. Our results indicate that replication might arrest throughout the chromosome soon after starvation. Alternatively, there may be additional arrest sites on the chromosome ∼600–700 kb from oriC. We distinguished between these possibilities by evaluating the effects of starvation on asynchronous cell replication, in which replication forks could be anywhere on the chromosome. We observed virtually complete inhibition of replication shortly after amino acid starvation. The rate of replication was measured by pulse labeling with 3H-thymidine (3H-thy) and by measuring the incorporation of 3H-thy into the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable fractions. At 30°C, incorporation of 3H-thy was reduced ∼50% in ∼2–4 min and was at background levels (≤200 cpm in a 2 min pulse) within ∼10 min after addition of RHX. In the absence of RHX, there were >16,000 cpm per optical density (OD) unit of cells incorporated in a 2 min pulse. At 37°C, incorporation was reduced to ∼50% in ∼1–2 min and was at background levels within ∼6 min (Figure 2G). The inhibition of 3H-thy incorporation by starvation was not due to inhibition of thymidine uptake. We measured uptake of 3H-thy and found no significant effect after treatment of cells with RHX (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that replication arrests shortly after amino acid starvation, irrespective of the location of the replication forks. In B. subtilis, replication is normally arrested at ter sites by Rtp (Duggin and Wake, 2002Duggin I.G. Wake R.G. Termination of chromosome replication.in: Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2002: 87-95Google Scholar). It was proposed that Rtp also mediates replication arrest upon amino acid starvation (Levine et al., 1995Levine A. Autret S. Seror S.J. A checkpoint involving RTP, the replication terminator protein, arrests replication downstream of the origin during the Stringent Response in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Rtp in mediating replication arrest in response to starvation, we monitored fork progression in a strain lacking Rtp (Δrtp). Replication forks were in approximately the same location in rtp+ and Δrtp cells before addition of RHX (Figures 2A and 2C). After induction of amino acid starvation with RHX, we found that replication forks arrested in the same regions of the chromosome in rtp+ and Δrtp cells (Figures 2B and 2D), indicating that starvation-induced replication arrest does not depend on Rtp. We also monitored the rate of asynchronous replication in rtp mutant cells using 3H-thy incorporation. We found that the addition of RHX caused replication arrest to a similar extent in Δrtp and rtp+ cells (Figure 2G). Previous work showed that starvation-induced replication arrest near oriC can be observed by determining the copy number of oriC-proximal genes using fluorescence microscopy (Dworkin and Losick, 2002Dworkin J.

Movement of replicating DNA through a stationary replisome.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we observed that Rtp was not required for starvation-induced replication arrest near the proposed LSTer site (Supplemental Data). Taken together, these results show that starvation-induced replication arrest occurs throughout the chromosome and does not require Rtp, the protein that is normally involved in arresting replication forks at the ter sites. RelA, the enzyme essential for the stringent response (Cashel et al., 1996Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.H. Vinella D. The stringent response.in: Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was previously found to be required for starvation-induced replication arrest near oriC (Levine et al., 1991Levine A. Vannier F. Dehbi M. Henckes G. Seror S.J. The stringent response blocks DNA replication outside the ori region in Bacillus subtilis and at the origin in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We found that RelA is required for starvation-induced replication arrest throughout the chromosome. We monitored replication-fork progression using DNA microarrays in a ΔrelA mutant that had been synchronized for the replication cycle (Figures 2E and 2F). We also monitored the rate of replication in asynchronous cultures using 3H-thy incorporation (Figure 2G). In both experiments, we found that the relA mutant did not arrest replication after addition of RHX. These results demonstrate that the starvation-induced replication arrest that occurs throughout the chromosome is mediated by the stringent response. The best characterized effects of the stringent response are global transcription changes, especially decreased transcription of rRNA and tRNA operons (Cashel et al., 1996Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.H. Vinella D. The stringent response.in: Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Using microarrays to monitor changes in mRNA levels in response to RHX treatment, we observed that transcription of many genes decreased while transcription of some genes increased (data not shown), which is similar to previous work (Eymann et al., 2002Eymann C. Homuth G. Scharf C. Hecker M. Bacillus subtilis functional genomics: global characterization of the stringent response by proteome and transcriptome analysis.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2500-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To test whether replication arrest was mediated by decreased transcription, we inhibited transcription by adding rifampicin and monitored replication forks. Treatment of cells with rifampicin resulted in rapid inhibition of transcription (Figure 3A). Replication-fork progression, as monitored by microarrays, was not affected (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that rifampicin treatment increased incorporation of 3H-thy into DNA by increasing the uptake of thymidine into the cells (Figures 3B and 3C). To test whether the stringent response mediates replication arrest by increasing transcription of some genes, we examined whether replication can still be inhibited by starvation in the absence of de novo transcription. RHX was added 1.5 min after rifampicin, when transcription was severely inhibited (Figure 3A). Replication was still rapidly arrested upon addition of RHX (Figure 3B) despite the inhibition of transcription. These results indicate that the starvation-induced replication arrest is not a consequence of RelA-mediated changes in transcription. Upon amino acid starvation, RelA synthesizes the small nucleotides (p)ppGpp from ATP and GTP. We observed that ppGpp (Figure 3D) and pppGpp (not shown) accumulated immediately after RHX addition and reached a plateau within 10 min. The increase in (p)ppGpp was accompanied by a decrease in GTP (Figure 3E), most likely due to the use of GTP to synthesize (p)ppGpp and the inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in GTP biosynthesis, by (p)ppGpp (Lopez et al., 1981Lopez J.M. Dromerick A. Freese E. Response of guanosine 5′-triphosphate concentration to nutritional changes and its significance for Bacillus subtilis sporulation.J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 605-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular ATP did not decrease (Figure 3F). In B. subtilis, decreases in GTP levels mediate several of the RelA-dependent responses to starvation (Inaoka and Ochi, 2002Inaoka T. Ochi K.

Enzyme changes during Bacillus subtilis sporulation caused by deprivation of guanine nucleotides.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test if starvation-induced replication arrest is mediated by elevated levels of (p)ppGpp and/or by decreased levels of GTP, we uncoupled changes in GTP and (p)ppGpp using two approaches. First, we lowered GTP levels without affecting (p)ppGpp by treating cells with decoyinine, a selective inhibitor of the synthesis of GMP (a precursor of GTP), that has been used to differentiate the effects of GTP from those of (p)ppGpp (Lopez et al., 1981Lopez J.M.

Enzyme changes during Bacillus subtilis sporulation caused by deprivation of guanine nucleotides.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, decoyinine treatment reduced GTP levels to 30%–40% of those in untreated cells within 4 min (Figure 3E) and reduced the growth rate (data not shown). The rate of replication in decoyinine-treated cells was nearly normal after 8 min and decreased only gradually afterwards (Figure 3B). These results indicate that decreasing the level of GTP does not directly lead to replication arrest. We also observed that starvation-induced replication arrest occurs when (p)ppGpp increase without a significant decrease in GTP. To elevate (p)ppGpp levels without causing a significant drop in GTP, we inhibited transcription with rifampicin before inducing starvation. Inhibition of transcription reduces GTP consumption, causing a significant increase in GTP (data not shown). Addition of RHX 1.5 min after addition of rifampicin caused significant accumulation of (p)ppGpp, yet the GTP level remained >80% of that before treatment (Figures 3D and 3E). Replication was still quickly inhibited by RHX in the presence of rifampicin (Figure 3B) even though GTP was much higher than in cells treated with decoyinine or RHX alone (Figure 3E). Together, these results provide evidence that replication arrest is not caused by a decrease in GTP and indicate that the likely signals for the replication arrest are (p)ppGpp. The rapid arrest of replication elongation following starvation appears to be mediated by (p)ppGpp. We tested potential targets of (p)ppGpp in vitro by measuring the effects of (p)ppGpp on the activities of purified components of the B. subtilis replication machinery. Addition of GDP, ppGpp, or pppGpp had little or no effect on the activity of the purified DNA polymerase catalytic subunit PolC (Figure 4A). However, ppGpp and pppGpp, but not GDP, clearly inhibited the activity of purified primase (DnaG); pppGpp was a more potent inhibitor than was ppGpp (Figure 4B). The primase activity is not due to contamination of the protein preparations with RNA polymerase (RNAP), as rifampicin did not inhibit the activity (Figure 4B). The products synthesized in the primase assay could be extended by Klenow polymerase (Supplemental Data), indicating that they are bona fide primers. In addition, we found that ppGpp inhibits helicase-dependent primosome activity in vitro (G.M.S., unpublished data"

https://openalex.org/W2986082729,"Puberty is characterized by mood swings and anxiety, which are often produced by stress. Here we show that THP (allopregnanolone), a steroid that is released as a result of stress, increases anxiety in pubertal female mice, in contrast to its anxiety-reducing effect in adults. Anxiety is regulated by GABAergic inhibition in limbic circuits. Although this inhibition is increased by THP administration before puberty and in adults, during puberty THP reduces the tonic inhibition of pyramidal cells in hippocampal region CA1, leading to increased excitability. This paradoxical effect of THP results from inhibition of α4βδ GABAA receptors. These receptors are normally expressed at very low levels, but at puberty, their expression is increased in hippocampal area CA1, where they generate outward currents. THP also decreases the outward current at recombinant α4β2δ receptors, and this effect depends on arginine 353 in the α4 subunit, a putative site for modulation by Cl−. Therefore, inhibition of α4β2δ GABAA receptors by THP provides a mechanism for the generation of anxiety at puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2004727909,"Actin filament formation and turnover within the treadmilling actin filament array at the leading edge of migrating cells are interdependent and coupled, but the mechanisms coordinating these two activities are not understood. We report that Coronin 1B interacts simultaneously with Arp2/3 complex and Slingshot (SSH1L) phosphatase, two regulators of actin filament formation and turnover, respectively. Coronin 1B inhibits filament nucleation by Arp2/3 complex and this inhibition is attenuated by phosphorylation of Coronin 1B at Serine 2, a site targeted by SSH1L. Coronin 1B also directs SSH1L to lamellipodia where SSH1L likely regulates Cofilin activity via dephosphorylation. Accordingly, depleting Coronin 1B increases phospho-Cofilin levels, and alters lamellipodial dynamics and actin filament architecture at the leading edge. We conclude that Coronin 1B's coordination of filament formation by Arp2/3 complex and filament turnover by Cofilin is required for effective lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration."

Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), now known as the “reference” structure, determined at 2.8 Aå resolution with crystals grown in the presence of both ADP and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, 3The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 3The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. showed that the three noncatalytic α-subunits and the three catalytic β-subunits are arranged in alternation around an asymmetric α-helical structure in the single γ-subunit. The α- and β-subunits have similar folds consisting of an N-terminal domain with six β-strands, a central nucleotide binding domain made of both α-helices and β-strands and an α-helical C-terminal domain containing six α-helices in β-subunits and seven in α-subunits. Because of the asymmetry of the γ-subunit, the catalytic β-subunits adopt different conformations with different nucleotide occupancies. Two of them have similar conformations, but one, designated as βDP, contains bound ADP, and the second, βTP, has bound AMP-PNP. The third has adopted a radically different conformation in which the nucleotide binding domain has been disrupted by an outward hinging movement of part of the domain and the attached C-terminal domain in response to the curvature of the central α-helical structure of the γ-subunit. This β-subunit has no bound nucleotide, and so it is known as the “empty” or open state, designated as βE. To explain the interconversion of catalytic sites through “tight,” “loose,” and “open” states required by a binding change mechanism of catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase (2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the interconversion of sites is effected by a mechanical rotation of the γ-subunit, each 360° rotation taking each β-subunit through the three states and thereby hydrolyzing three ATP molecules. It was shown subsequently that during ATP hydrolysis, either in an α3β3γ complex or in the intact F1Fo-ATPase, that the direction of rotation is counterclockwise (as viewed from the membrane domain of the enzyme) during ATP hydrolysis and clockwise during ATP synthesis (3Noji H.

This first structure of bovine F1-ATPase was interpreted as representing a state in the active catalytic cycle, the ADP-inhibited state of the enzyme, or both. The crystals used in this analysis were grown in the presence of azide, primarily to prevent microbial growth during the 2–3-month period of crystallogenesis.

Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8646-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is associated via the partial positive charge of its central nitrogen atom with the β-phosphate of ADP and via the partial negative charges of its two peripheral nitrogen atoms with βLys-162 in the P-loop region of the nucleotide binding site and with the catalytically essential residue, αArg-373. Hence, azide appeared to enhance the binding of ADP to the βDP site and to stabilize the ADP-inhibited state of the enzyme.In the present work, crystals of bovine F1-ATPase were grown in the presence of both ADP and AMP-PNP under conditions identical to those employed previously, except that azide was omitted. The structure of this complex determined at 1.9 Aå resolution (see footnote b in Table 1) shows that, despite the presence of both ADP and AMP-PNP, both the βTP and βDP nucleotide binding sites were occupied by AMP-PNP. As described below, this structure is the most accurate representation to date of an intermediate in the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme.TABLE 1Data processing and refinement statisticsSpace groupP212121Unit cell dimensions (Aå) a, b, c261.8, 105.6, 123.1Resolution range (Aå)20.0-1.9No. of unique reflections194,499MultiplicityaStatistics for the highest resolution bin (1.96-1.9 Aå) are shown in parentheses3.1 (1.5)CompletenessaStatistics for the highest resolution bin (1.96-1.9 Aå) are shown in parentheses,bThe completeness is 88.2% at 2.27 Aå; the completeness to 1.9 Aå is low as these data were only recorded in the corners of the detector (%)72.8 (18.8)RmergeaStatistics for the highest resolution bin (1.96-1.9 Aå) are shown in parentheses,cRmerge = ΣhΣi|I(h) – I(h)i|/ΣhΣiI(h)i, where I(h) is the mean weighted intensity after rejection of outliers0.060 (25.7)[I/σ(I) ]aStatistics for the highest resolution bin (1.96-1.9 Aå) are shown in parentheses15.9 (1.7)B-factor (from Wilson) (Aå2)23.5Water molecules2340R-factordR = Σhkl||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes (%)17.5Free R-factoreRfree = Σhkl⊂T||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl⊂T|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes and T is the test set of data omitted from refinement (5% in this case) (%)22.0r.m.s.fr.m.s., root mean square deviationsBonds (Aå)0.008Angles (°)1.1a Statistics for the highest resolution bin (1.96-1.9 Aå) are shown in parenthesesb The completeness is 88.2% at 2.27 Aå; the completeness to 1.9 Aå is low as these data were only recorded in the corners of the detectorc Rmerge = ΣhΣi|I(h) – I(h)i|/ΣhΣiI(h)i, where I(h) is the mean weighted intensity after rejection of outliersd R = Σhkl||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudese Rfree = Σhkl⊂T||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl⊂T|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes and T is the test set of data omitted from refinement (5% in this case)f r.m.s., root mean square Open table in a new tab EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme Purification and Crystallization—Bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase was purified as described previously (7Lutter R.

An ammonium sulfate precipitate of purified bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase was redissolved in minimal buffer. Crystals of F1-ATPase were grown in microdialysis buttons (50 μl) with SpectraPor dialysis membranes (3500 molecular weight cut-off). An equal volume of inside buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 400 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm AMP-PNP, 40 μm ADP, 0.004% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 in D2O) was added slowly to the protein, and the solution was mixed gently (final concentration 5 mg/ml). The samples were dialyzed against 3 ml of outside buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgSO4, 250 μm AMP-PNP, 5 μm ADP, 0.004% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 9% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000). After 48 h, this buffer was replaced with the same buffer containing polyethylene glycol 6000 from 10–12.5% (w/v) in 0.25% steps. Crystal growth was complete in 4 weeks.Dehydration of Crystals—Crystals were harvested in a MicroMesh loop (MiteGen, Ithica, NY). Their diffraction properties were monitored during dehydration in a gradient of relative humidity of water from 99–94% in a free mounting system (Proteros Biostructures, GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) using established conditions for improved diffraction of crystals of bovine F1-ATPase (8Bowler M.W. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2006; 62: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Then the crystals were coated in a thin film of perfluoropolyether oil (Alfa Aeasar, Heysham, UK), plunged into liquid nitrogen, and stored at 100 K.Data Collection—Diffraction data for the N-3-free-F1 crystals were collected to 1.9 Aå resolution on a charge-coupled detector Q210 from Area Dector Systems Corp. (Poway, CA) at beamline ID14-2 (λ = 0.933 Aå) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (9Leslie A.G.W.

The refinement was carried out with REFMAC5 (12Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8646-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the diffraction properties of the present crystals were improved substantially by controlled dehydration, allowing data to be collected to 1.9 Aå, which is an exceptionally high resolution for such a large and mobile complex. The crystals belong to the space group P212121. Their unit cell dimensions are a = 261.8 Aå, b = 105.6 Aå, and c = 123.1 Aå, and there is one F1 complex in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The structure, known as N-3-free-F1, was solved by molecular replacement using data to 1.9 Aå. (The structure of F1-ATPase inhibited with azide is known as N-3-F1.) Data processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final model contains the following residues: αTP 23–401 and 410–510; αDP 21–510; αE 24–510; βTP 9–474; βDP 9–475; βE 9–387 and 396–474; γ1–47, 67–86, 105–116, 127–148, 159–173, and 206–273; δ 17–29, 35–40, 58–65, 76–81, and 91–145; and ɛ 1–25. The shrinkage of the unit cell parameter of the crystal in the a dimension, brought about by controlled dehydration, stabilizes the central stalk subunits (γ, δ, and ɛ), as has been observed in other structures (16Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 17Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, the concomitant reduction of the c dimension by ∼20 Aå to a value of 123.1 Aå leads to the β-sandwich domain of the δ-subunit becoming disordered, because stabilizing crystal contacts in structures with a c cell edge of ∼140 Aå are lost.After one round of refinement, positive density peaks (height 12 and 14σ) representing the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP were observed in the difference map for the βDP- and βTP-subunits, respectively (Fig. 1). The noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites contained AMP-PNP also. Thus, the βDP-subunits in the N-3-F1 and azide-free structures differ in so far as the former binds ADP and azide and the latter AMP-PNP. Nonetheless, their overall conformations differ very little; the root-mean-square difference between Cα chains of βDP-subunits is 0.22 Aå, and the positions of the adenosine, α- and β-phosphates, and catalytic side chains are very similar (Fig. 2). The root-mean-square deviation between the two F1-ATPase complexes is 0.44 Aå.FIGURE 1The βDP binding site in the structure of the azide-free F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria. The view is in stereo. The difference electron density (Fo - Fc) for the γ-phosphate, contoured at 3σ before its inclusion in the model, is shown as a green mesh. The 2Fo - Fc densities for ADP and αArg-373 are shown as a blue mesh contoured at 1.5σ. The red and green spheres represent the catalytic water molecule and a magnesium ion, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Superimposition of the P-loop residues of the βTP-subunit onto those of the βDP-subunit in the azide-free structure reveals small but significant differences between the two sites (Fig. 3). In the βDP-subunit, a movement of the guanidinium group of αArg-373 toward the γ-phosphate of 1.0–1.5 Aå relative to the βTP-subunit rotates the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP and positions it for in-line nucleophilic attack by the water molecule that is polarized by βGlu-188. In addition, the nucleophilic water molecule in the βDP-subunit has moved 0.7 Aå closer to the γ-phosphate than in the βTP-subunit of the azide-free structure (see Figs. 3 and 4). Similar changes have been noted previously in the βDP-subunit in the structure of bovine F1-ATPase where ADP-BeF -3 is bound to both the βDP and βTP sites (18Kagawa R. Montgomery M.G. Braig K. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2734-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Schematic representations of the nucleotide binding sites in the βDP- and βTP-subunits in the structure of the azide-free F1-ATPase. A, βDP-subunit; B, βTP-subunit. The distances between atoms are given in angstroms, and possible hydrogen bonds and interactions involving the magnesium ion are shown as dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently, the structure of the F1-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been described at 2.8 Aå resolution based on crystals grown in the presence of AMP-PNP and ADP and in the absence of azide (19Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this structure, AMP-PNP is also bound to both the βDP- and βTP-subunits. Superposition of the structures of the P-loops of the βDP-subunits of the bovine azide-free F1-ATPase and the yeast F1-ATPase shows that the positions of the nucleotides and of the key side chains in the nucleotide binding sites are very similar (supplemental Fig. 1).Position of αArg-373 in the βE Catalytic Site—The highly accurate electron density map of the azide-free F1-ATPase has provided evidence that αEArg-373, the arginine-finger residue in the βE catalytic site, has two conformations, each at about 50% occupancy (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S2). One conformation of the side chain of this residue is oriented away from the catalytic site in the βE-subunit, and the other is oriented toward it. The inward pointing conformation is very similar to the conformation of the equivalent side chain of αEArg-375 in yeast F1-ATPase (19Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is involved in the coordination of a phosphate (or sulfate) ion. It seems likely that the side chain in the bovine enzyme alternates between the two conformations and assumes the inward position when phosphate binds. Why phosphate (sulfate) is not bound in a similar way in the bovine N-3-free-F1 structure is unclear, especially because its concentration during crystallization of the bovine enzyme was 40 times greater than that employed in the crystallization of the yeast enzyme.Roles of the βDP- and βTP-Subunits in Catalysis—The structure of azide-free bovine F1-ATPase described here, where AMP-PNP is bound in preference to ADP to the nucleotide binding sites in both the βDP- and βTP-subunits, illustrates the similarities between the two sites. These similarities, and the selectivity for AMP-PNP over ADP at the concentrations of nucleotides employed in the crystallization experiments, are consistent with the Kd values measured in the Escherichia coli enzyme, which show that AMP-PNP and ATP have a much higher affinity for both sites than ADP (20Lobau S.

However, despite these similarities, in all of the structures that have been described of the bovine F1-ATPase (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and in that of the yeast enzyme (19Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the βDP- and βTP-nucleotide binding sites are not equivalent to each other. This structural inequivalence arises because the structure of F1-ATPase is inherently asymmetrical. Therefore, the interactions of βDP- and βTP-subunits with adjacent α-subunits differ, they occupy different positions in the structure relative to the βE-subunit, and they are adjacent to different aspects of the asymmetrical centrally located γ-subunit. These structural differences between βDP- and βTP-subunits make them functionally inequivalent, as various pieces of structural evidence show. First, the current structure and that determined in the presence of azide (6Bowler M.W. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8646-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) show that the βDP site, and not the βTP site, binds ADP and azide very strongly, but it can bind AMP-PNP also. In contrast, the βTP site does not bind ADP and azide, but it has a high affinity for AMP-PNP. Second, in both the current structure (see Fig. 4) and in the BeF-3-F1 structure (18Kagawa R. Montgomery M.G. Braig K. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2734-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the nucleophilic water molecule in the βDP-subunit is significantly closer to the γ-phosphate of ATP (or rather its analogs) than in the βTP-subunit. Third, in a transition state analog structure formed in the presence of ADP and aluminum fluoride (the (AlF3·ADP)-F1 structure (25Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)), the transition state analog of ATP hydrolysis has formed in the βDP site, whereas ATP (AMP-PNP) is bound to the βTP-subunit. This last observation and the previous one show that the ATP bound to the βDP-site, and not the ATP bound to the βTP-site, is the nucleotide that is poised to form the transition state and then be hydrolyzed. Subsequently, hydrolysis at this site leads to the release of products and the regeneration of the βE state.Thus, the structure of the azide-free F1-ATPase described here represents a highly detailed snapshot of three different structures of β-subunits representing intermediates that form together in the ground state of the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase. From this structure and that of N-3-F1, it is clear that the reference structure (and the more detailed structure of N-3-F1) represents a state closely related to the ADP-inhibited state of the enzyme and that this conformation is also an accurate representation of an intermediate in the active catalytic cycle. Our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of F1-ATPase is based on the structural analysis by x-ray crystallography of the enzyme from bovine heart mitochondria. The first high resolution structure (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), now known as the “reference” structure, determined at 2.8 Aå resolution with crystals grown in the presence of both ADP and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, 3The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 3The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. showed that the three noncatalytic α-subunits and the three catalytic β-subunits are arranged in alternation around an asymmetric α-helical structure in the single γ-subunit. The α- and β-subunits have similar folds consisting of an N-terminal domain with six β-strands, a central nucleotide binding domain made of both α-helices and β-strands and an α-helical C-terminal domain containing six α-helices in β-subunits and seven in α-subunits. Because of the asymmetry of the γ-subunit, the catalytic β-subunits adopt different conformations with different nucleotide occupancies. Two of them have similar conformations, but one, designated as βDP, contains bound ADP, and the second, βTP, has bound AMP-PNP. The third has adopted a radically different conformation in which the nucleotide binding domain has been disrupted by an outward hinging movement of part of the domain and the attached C-terminal domain in response to the curvature of the central α-helical structure of the γ-subunit. This β-subunit has no bound nucleotide, and so it is known as the “empty” or open state, designated as βE. To explain the interconversion of catalytic sites through “tight,” “loose,” and “open” states required by a binding change mechanism of catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase (2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the interconversion of sites is effected by a mechanical rotation of the γ-subunit, each 360° rotation taking each β-subunit through the three states and thereby hydrolyzing three ATP molecules. It was shown subsequently that during ATP hydrolysis, either in an α3β3γ complex or in the intact F1Fo-ATPase, that the direction of rotation is counterclockwise (as viewed from the membrane domain of the enzyme) during ATP hydrolysis and clockwise during ATP synthesis (3Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 4Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This first structure of bovine F1-ATPase was interpreted as representing a state in the active catalytic cycle, the ADP-inhibited state of the enzyme, or both. The crystals used in this analysis were grown in the presence of azide, primarily to prevent microbial growth during the 2–3-month period of crystallogenesis. However, in the presence of ADP, azide is an inhibitor of F1-ATPase (5Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but because of the relatively modest resolution of the data, its presence was not detected in the structure. Recently, in a related structure at 1.95 Aå resolution, determined with crystals grown under conditions identical to those used in the first structural analysis, azide was resolved in the βDP-subunit (6Bowler M.W.

Here, we show that N-WASP WH2 domains play a previously unanticipated role in vesicle movement by transiently attaching actin filament barbed ends to the membrane. To dissect the attachment mechanism, we reconstituted the propulsive motility of lipid-coated glass beads, using purified soluble proteins. N-WASP WH2 mutants assembled actin comet tails and initiated movement, but the comet tails catastrophically detached from the membrane. When presented on the surface of a lipid-coated bead, WH2 domains were sufficient to maintain comet tail attachment. In v-Src-transformed fibroblasts, N-WASP WH2 mutants were severely defective in the formation of circular podosome arrays. In addition to creating an attachment force, interactions between WH2 domains and barbed ends may locally amplify signals for dendritic actin nucleation."

Alk is expressed and required in target neurons in the optic lobe, whereas Jeb is primarily generated by photoreceptor axons and functions in the eye to control target selection of R1-R6 axons in the lamina and R8 axons in the medulla. Impaired Jeb/Alk function affects layer-specific expression of three cell-adhesion molecules, Dumbfounded/Kirre, Roughest/IrreC, and Flamingo, in the medulla. Moreover, loss of flamingo in target neurons causes some R8-axon targeting errors observed in Jeb and Alk mosaic animals. Together, these findings suggest that Jeb/Alk signaling helps R-cell axons to shape their environment for target recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2119861955,"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are key metal cofactors of metabolic, regulatory, and stress response proteins in most organisms. The unique properties of these clusters make them susceptible to disruption by iron starvation or oxidative stress. Both iron and sulfur can be perturbed under stress conditions, leading to Fe-S cluster defects. Bacteria and higher plants contain a specialized system for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis under stress, namely the Suf pathway. In Escherichia coli the Suf pathway consists of six proteins with functions that are only partially characterized. Here we describe how the SufS and SufE proteins interact with the SufBCD protein complex to facilitate sulfur liberation from cysteine and donation for Fe-S cluster assembly. It was previously shown that the cysteine desulfurase SufS donates sulfur to the sulfur transfer protein SufE. We have found here that SufE in turn interacts with the SufB protein for sulfur transfer to that protein. The interaction occurs only if SufC is present. Furthermore, SufB can act as a site for Fe-S cluster assembly in the Suf system. This provides the first evidence of a novel site for Fe-S cluster assembly in the SufBCD complex.

Fe-S clusters perform important functions in multiple cellular processes, including respiration, gene regulation, and the trichloroacetic acid cycle (1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In vivo Fe-S biogenesis requires specific proteins such as a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase that mobilizes sulfur from l-cysteine and an Fe-S cluster scaffold upon which the nascent cluster can be constructed prior to its transfer to an apoprotein. Homologues of these two core components can be found in numerous organisms ranging from bacteria to humans (1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev.

In bacteria the basal pathway of Fe-S cluster assembly is known as Isc 5The abbreviations used are: Isc, iron-sulfur cluster; Mts, methane-thiosulfonate; ESI, electrospray ionization; DTT, dithiothreitol.

Fe-S cluster homeostasis is sensitive to disruption by reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species or by iron limitation (6Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol.

Recently it was discovered that biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters during adverse stress conditions such as iron starvation and oxidative stress requires a specialized assembly pathway different from the basal Isc system. This pathway, termed the Suf pathway (mobilization of sulfur), is regulated in response to those stress conditions (7Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 9Takahashi Y.

The Suf pathway is present in cyanobacteria and the chloroplast of higher plants as well as in bacteria, including human pathogens such as Yersinia pestis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In M. tuberculosis, the Suf pathway seems to be the primary Fe-S cluster assembly system, as deleting the suf genes is thought to be lethal to that organism (10Huet G. Daffe M. Saves I. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because of its importance, Suf has been the focus of intense study at the biochemical level, especially in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The sufABCDSE operon in E. coli encodes six proteins. SufA is homologous to IscA in the basal Isc Fe-S cluster pathway. The exact function of SufA is unknown. Although it has been suggested to act as an Fe-S scaffold, it cannot be excluded that SufA plays a regulatory role (11Balasubramanian R. Shen G. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J.

The function of the SufB and SufD proteins is not known, but the two proteins are homologous to each other. SufB and SufD interact with SufC to form the Suf-BCD complex, and SufB was recently shown to enhance the basal ATPase activity of SufC (13Eccleston J.F. Petrovic A. Davis C.T. Rangachari K.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6543-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a number of questions concerning their biochemical functions in vivo remain unanswered. At least two distinct multiprotein complexes form among the Suf proteins, the SufBCD complex and the SufSE complex. Formation of these complexes may help protect iron and sulfur from disruption by stress during Fe-S cluster assembly. Although the SufSE complex seems to form a specialized sulfur transfer pair, little is known about the function of the SufBCD complex. Because each of the SufB, SufC, and SufD gene products is absolutely essential for Suf pathway function in vivo, this is a key gap in our knowledge of Suf (8Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 9Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In this study we have analyzed the protein-protein interactions that occur between the SufE protein and the SufBCD complex. Our results indicate that SufE interacts specifically with SufBC to donate sulfur to SufB and that SufB can form an Fe-S cluster. These results may explain SufBCD enhancement of SufSE sulfur mobilization and also provide the first evidence for the presence of an Fe-S cluster within the SufBCD complex. Plasmid Construction—All of the PCR reactions were carried out using plasmid pGSO164 containing the entire suf operon from E. coli as template (14Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). SufB, SufC, and SufD were amplified using the primers 5′-GTTCTAGACGTGAAGGACTTAATCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCATACTTAACATGTTTATTCC-3′ for SufB, 5′-GTTCTAGAGCACAAAAACTCCTCGCC-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCGATGCCACTGTTGCAG-3′ for SufC, and 5′-GTTCTAGAGAATTGTGAAATCCGGCG-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCCCGCACTTTGTCGACGG-3′ for SufD. PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET3a (Novagen), generating plasmids pET3aSufB, pET3aSufC, and pET3aSufD. The nucleotide sequences of all of the plasmid inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Strains and Growth Conditions—His6-SufE and SufABCDSE were expressed in TOP10 (Invitrogen) and His6-SufA and His6-SufS were expressed in BL21(DE3) plysS (Invitrogen) as already described (14Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). SufB, SufC, SufD, SufE-His6, and SufE(C51S)-His6 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pET3aSufB, pET3aSufC, pET3aSufD, pET-Ehis, and pET-EC51Shis, respectively. All protein expression was carried out in Lennox Broth (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter). Ampicillin was used at 100 mg/liter, and chloramphenicol was used at 30 mg/liter. l-arabinose was added to 0.2% final concentration by weight or isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5–1 mm final concentration. For production of all proteins cells were grown at 37 °C except for SufB where cells were grown at 18 °C overnight after induction. All chemicals used were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Protein Purification and Chromatography—His6-SufA, SufE, SufE-His6, SufE(C51S)-His6, and His6-SufS were purified as described previously (14Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The wild-type SufBCD complex was overexpressed using pGSO164, and cell growth for expression was carried out as described previously (14Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The following new procedure was used for SufBCD purification. Cells were lysed by sonication in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, cleared cell lysate was loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (low substitution) hydrophobic column (GE Healthcare) after 1:3 dilution with 1 m (NH4)2SO4. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1-0 m (NH4)2SO4. Fractions containing SufBCD were pooled, diluted 1:3 with 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, loaded on a strong anion exchange column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Fractions containing the SufBCD complex were concentrated and separated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. For purification of SufC the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cells were lysed by sonication. The soluble protein fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 150,000 × g, 4 °C for 90 min. The obtained supernatant was cleared of DNA with 2% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate. The resulting supernatant was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. After extensive washing of the column, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. SufC-containing fractions were pooled and diluted 1:1 with buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 m (NH4)2SO4) before loading the protein solution on a Butyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 m (NH4)2SO4). After extensive washing of the column, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1–0 m (NH4)2SO4. SufC-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). For purification of SufB and SufD the soluble protein fraction was diluted 1:1 with buffer B and the resulting protein solution was loaded on a Butyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). All subsequent purification steps were the same as those for SufC purification. Purified proteins were concentrated and stored at –70 °C. The molecular mass of purified proteins was verified by mass spectrometry. Cross-linking and Label Transfer—Purified SufE was labeled with a trifunctional cross-linker Mts-Atf-biotin (2-[N2-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoyl)-N6-(6-biotinamidocaproyl)-l-lysinyl]ethyl methane-thiosulfonate (Pierce). This cross-linker contains a sulfhydryl-specific methane-thiosulfonate (Mts) moiety that was used to attach Mts-Atf-biotin specifically to cysteine residues in SufE. It also contains a photoactivatable tetrafluorophenyl azide moiety (Atf) (supplemental Fig. S1A). The Atf moiety will insert into carbon-hydrogen bonds within 11.1 Å of the cross-linker upon exposure to UV light. SufE at 12.6 μm was mixed with 40 μm Mts-Atf-biotin in a total reaction volume of 300 μl in phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 m, pH 7.2). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the non-reacted Mts-Atf-biotin was removed by Zeba Desalt spin columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Labeling reactions were carried out in the absence of ambient light to prevent premature activation of the Atf moiety. Addition of reductant to labeled SufE was able to remove the label, indicating that Mts-Atf-biotin binds SufE as expected via reducible disulfide bonds with cysteine residues. The 2 cysteine residues in SufE (Cys-17 and Cys-51) are both accessible to labeling because individual point mutants of SufE were still labeled with Mts-Atf-biotin. For label transfer assays, levels of reductant were kept low until after UV cross-linking with prey proteins to avoid premature loss of the label from SufE bait protein (see below). Mts-Atf-biotin-labeled SufE was mixed with the other Suf proteins at a final concentration of 2 μm for each component in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 100 μm ATP. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were irradiated with UV light for 5 min at a distance of 10 cm using a Spectroline Model BIB-150P UV lamp (365 nm) to initiate cross-linking with the Atf moiety. After UV light exposure, 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) with 1.2 m β-mercaptoethanol was added. The samples were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) was used to visualize proteins labeled with Mts-Atf-biotin. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000. SufE was covalently immobilized to the carboxylated dextran matrix on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) via primary amino groups using the amine-coupling protocol (Biacore). Levels of SufE immobilized to the chip were 1300–1600 response units for all experiments. Purified His6-SufS, SufBCD complex, or His6-SufA was injected at various concentrations. All experiments were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore). Binding of analyte to SufE at equilibrium was plotted against analyte concentration, and the Prism (Graphpad) program was used to create a nonlinear curve fit of the data. A one site binding model (hyperbola), where Y = Bmax*X/(KD + X), provided the best fit for SufS binding to SufE based on Akaike’s Information Criterion analysis of multiple models. A Boltzmann sigmoidal model, where Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(1 + exp((V50–X)/Slope)), provided the best fit for SufBCD binding to SufE. Interactions between Suf Proteins by Affinity Chromatography—1 mg of pure His6-tagged SufA, SufS, SufE, or SufE(C51S) was loaded by gravity flow onto a 0.1-ml nickel-loaded metal-chelating Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer D. Subsequently 0.5 mg of purified SufB, SufC, SufD, or SufBCD that does not carry a His6 tag were passed over these “Suf columns.” The columns were washed with 9 ml of buffer D containing 20–50 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted using buffer D containing 0.5 m imidazole. These experiments were performed either aerobically or anaerobically at 20 °C. In the experiments where combinations of two proteins were used, they were mixed and preincubated for 30 min to allow any necessary complex formation to occur prior to column loading. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cysteine Desulfurase Activity Assays—Assays were performed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm DTT in a final volume of 100 μl. Final protein concentrations were 500 nm SufS and 1.5 μm SufE, SufB, SufC, SufD, or SufBCD. Reactions were initiated by addition of 100 μml-cysteine (final concentration) and were allowed to proceed for 20 min at 27 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating the mixtures at 99 °C for 10 min. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed for its alanine content using alanine dehydrogenase (26Yoshida A. Freese E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 176-181Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The absorbance of NADH at 340 nm (ɛ340 nm = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1) was used to determine the alanine content of the cysteine desulfurase activity assay mixtures. Sulfur Transfer Assays—All sulfur transfer assays were performed under anaerobic conditions in a glove box (<2 ppm O2). SufS, SufE, and SufBCD were pretreated with 5 mm DTT for 30 min. The DTT was then removed from the protein solutions by passage of the proteins over a Micro-Biospin 6 Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad). Reaction mixtures contained either 100 μm SufBCD, 5 μm SufS, 5 μm SufE, and 5 mml-cysteine or 100 μm SufBCD, 5 μm SufS, and 5 mml-cysteine in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, reactions were stopped by removal of cysteine with Micro-Biospin 6 columns. The eluate was analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—A Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK) operating with a needle voltage of 3 kV was used to analyze the samples. Sample cone and extraction voltages were 30 and 0.2 V, respectively. Samples were infused continuously at a 5 μl/min flow rate with a concentration between 400 and 900 nm in water/acetonitrile (1/1, v/v) with 0.2% formic acid. The mass spectra were recorded in the 800–2200 range of mass-to-charge (m/z) with a 1-s scan time. A 1-μm solution of Glufibrinopeptide B was used to calibrate the instrument in the tandem mass spectrometry mode. Spectra were acquired and processed with MassLinx 4.0 (Waters). Iron-Sulfur Cluster Reconstitution on SufB—Purified SufB (135 μm) was incubated with catalytic amounts (1.5 μm) of SufS and SufE, an excess (2 mm) of l-cysteine, and a 6-fold excess (810 μm) of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 in the presence of 5 mm DTT at 20 °C under anaerobic conditions in a glove box. After 5 h of incubation, EDTA (270 μm) was added and after 15 min the mixture was desalted using a Nap25 column (GE Healthcare). The protein was concentrated to 125 μm and stored at –80 °C. UV-visible spectra of reconstituted SufB were recorded on a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. The iron and sulfide content of the proteins was determined as previously described (27Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 28Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Concentration—The Bio-Rad protein assay was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of EPR Samples—Reconstituted SufB (125 μm) was reduced by catalytic amounts of photoreduced deazaflavin during 1 h at 18°C inside an anaerobic glove box. EPR spectra were recorded at 10 K on a Bruker EMX (9.5 Hz) EPR spectrometer equipped with an electron spin resonance (ESR) 900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Double integrals of the EPR signals and spin concentration were obtained through the Win-EPR software using the spectrum of a 1-mm Cu-(EDTA) standard recorded under non-saturating conditions. Label Transfer from SufE Shows Interactions between SufE and SufS and SufE and SufB—To test whether transient interactions occur between SufE and the other Suf proteins we utilized the trifunctional cross-linker Mts-Atf-biotin (supplemental Fig. S1). All label transfer experiments were carried out with equal amounts of the same preparation of labeled SufE so that the same amount of Mts-Atf-biotin was present in each sample. Several previous studies have clearly demonstrated interactions between SufE and SufS, presumably to facilitate shielded sulfur transfer from SufS to SufE during Fe-S cluster assembly (14Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Lascoux D. Loiseau L. Barras F. Forest E. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, as an initial test of this method, we labeled SufE as bait protein and performed the label transfer with His6-SufS (Fig. 1A). After UV cross-linking and reduction, an immunoblot performed using a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate detected intense biotin labeling of SufE, indicating the Mts-Atf-biotin can photocross-link to the “bait” protein itself. This intramolecular label transfer within SufE is consistent with the SufE crystal structure, which shows that Cys-17 of SufE is present at the dimer interface between two SufE monomers (29Goldsmith-Fischman S.

Cys-17 can be labeled in the bait protein and would likely transfer label to the adjacent SufE monomer during cross-linking and reduction. Alternatively, the label may transfer directly to residues surrounding the labeled Cys-17 or Cys-51 within a SufE monomer. Importantly, we also observed intense label transfer to His6-SufS. In contrast, the immunoblot showed only weak biotin labeling of the bovine serum albumin control. Next, labeled SufE was mixed with various combinations of His6-SufS, the SufBCD complex, and His6-SufA (Fig. 1B). SufE interacted with SufS and SufB, resulting in a high level of label transfer to those proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, only small amounts of label could be observed on SufD, SufC, or SufA. The same pattern of interactions between SufE and the other Suf proteins was also observed if SufE C51S or SufE C17S single mutant proteins were used as bait, indicating neither cysteine is required for binding to SufS and SufB (data not shown). The same level of label transfer was observed after 2 or 60 min of incubation time before the irradiation step, indicating that the interaction occurs within a short time frame. We also performed another critical control experiment in which the labeled SufE was incubated with the prey proteins but the mixture was not cross-linked by UV light. In the absence of UV cross-linking, we observed no label transfer from SufE to prey proteins, excluding a nonspecific Mts-Atf-biotin transfer mechanism via disulfide bond exchange caused by exposed cysteine thiol groups in SufS or SufBCD (data not shown). Surprisingly, the presence of His6-SufA in the label transfer assay seems to diminish interactions between SufE and both His6-SufS and SufB (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 to lane 4 and lane 3 to lane 5). At present the significance of this effect is unclear. Interestingly, SufE was able to interact directly with SufB even in the absence of SufS, indicating that SufB likely contains a SufE-specific binding site (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Suf Interactions by Column Co-purification—We next used a column chromatography co-purification assay to determine whether SufS or SufA interact with the SufBCD complex. In this assay, His6-tagged SufA, SufS, or SufE was loaded on nickel-charged metal-chelating Sepharose columns and the SufBCD complex (with no tag) was passed over these “Suf columns”. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with imidazole and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Using this method we observed that SufBCD was not retained on columns that were charged with His6-SufA or His6-SufS. In contrast, SufBCD was found in the elution fraction of a column charged with His6-SufE (Fig. 2A). Under the same conditions SufBCD did not bind to an empty nickel-charged metal-chelating Sepharose column (data not shown). These results indicate that SufBCD does not interact with SufA or SufS, or at least that interactions are not strong enough to be detected by our column chromatography method. However, these experiments show that SufBCD interacts with SufE in agreement with the results of the label transfer experiments. Neither label transfer nor co-purification assays showed any interaction between His6-SufA and the other Suf proteins. To determine whether the presence of the His6 tag on SufA was responsible for this lack of interaction, an affinity co-purification assay was performed with His6-SufE loaded on the column and untagged SufA passed over the column. No interaction was observed between untagged SufA and SufE (data not shown). SufE-SufBCD Interaction Does Not Depend on Intermolecular Disulfide Bridges—To investigate whether the observed interaction between SufE and SufBCD requires formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, we repeated the co-purification assays in an anaerobic chamber using degassed buffers. Under these anaerobic conditions the SufE-SufBCD interaction was still observed (supplemental Fig. S2). Additionally, we repeated the experiment using a His6-SufE protein in which the reactive nucleophilic cysteine residue Cys-51 (14Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol.

Whether checkpoints also ensure the completion of DNA replication before mitosis is unknown. Here, we show that in yeast smc5-smc6 mutants, which are related to cohesin and condensin, replication is delayed, most significantly at natural replication-impeding loci like the ribosomal DNA gene cluster. In the absence of Smc5-Smc6, chromosome nondisjunction occurs as a consequence of mitotic entry with unfinished replication despite intact checkpoint responses. Eliminating processes that obstruct replication fork progression restores the temporal uncoupling between replication and segregation in smc5-smc6 mutants. We propose that the completion of replication is not under the surveillance of known checkpoints."
https://openalex.org/W2076643686,"Examples of sympatric speciation in nature are rare and hotly debated. We describe the parallel speciation of finches on two small islands in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean. Nesospiza buntings are a classic example of a simple adaptive radiation, with two species on each island: an abundant small-billed dietary generalist and a scarce large-billed specialist. Their morphological diversity closely matches the available spectrum of seed sizes, and genetic evidence suggests that they evolved independently on each island. Speciation is complete on the smaller island, where there is a single habitat with strongly bimodal seed size abundance, but is incomplete on the larger island, where a greater diversity of habitats has resulted in three lineages. Our study suggests that the buntings have undergone parallel ecological speciation."

The resulting ternary complex has been used to conditionally perturb protein function, and one such method involves perturbation of a protein of interest through its mislocalization. We synthesized two rapamycin derivatives that possess large substituents at the C-16 position within the FRB-binding interface, and these derivatives were screened against a library of FRB mutants using a three-hybrid assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several FRB mutants responded to one of the rapamycin derivatives, and twenty of these mutants were further characterized in mammalian cells. The mutants most responsive to the ligand were fused to yellow fluorescent protein, and fluorescence levels in the presence and absence of the ligand were measured to determine stability of the fusion proteins. Wild-type and mutant FRB domains were expressed at low levels in the absence of the rapamycin derivative, and expression levels rose up to 10-fold upon treatment with ligand. The synthetic rapamycin derivatives were further analyzed using quantitative mass spectrometry, and one of the compounds was found to contain contaminating rapamycin. Furthermore, uncontaminated analogs retained the ability to inhibit mTOR, although with diminished potency relative to rapamycin.

A common approach for studying complex biological processes is to perturb a protein of interest and observe subsequent changes to the biological system. The classical approach of disrupting a gene and studying the resultant phenotype is problematic for examining essential genes. As a result, several conditional techniques have been developed including the tetracycline/doxycycline and Cre recombinase/lox P systems, where control is exerted at the transcriptional level (1Furth P.A.

Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar), but RNAi lacks tunability and does not affect existing protein levels. An ideal perturbation method would directly affect the protein with a cell-permeable probe that rapidly and reversibly targets a specific protein of interest. Small molecules have been very useful as conditional perturbants; however, the lack of specificity of many of these reagents can make it difficult to unambiguously interpret results. One approach to ensure specificity is to chemically modify a small molecule with a large substituent, and this technique has been widely used to interrogate specific protein tyrosine kinases that possess a complementary cavity-forming mutation (4Shah K.

An alternative system has recently been developed using a cell-permeable small molecule to regulate the stability of specific proteins in a rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent manner (6Banaszynski L.A.

A third approach for directly controlling protein function is by perturbing subcellular localization. Conditional regulation of protein localization has been achieved using the FKBP·rapamycin·FRB complex (7Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R.

With this method a protein of interest is fused to either FKBP, the 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein or FRB, the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of the protein kinase, mTOR. The other rapamycin-binding protein is modified to include a domain that regulates subcellular localization (e.g. nuclear export or plasma membrane-associated). The addition of rapamycin induces heterodimerization of the FRB and FKBP fusions and rapid formation of a ternary complex, which causes the protein of interest to be rapidly rerouted within the cell. One disadvantage of this system is that rapamycin has biological activity; it binds to endogenous mTOR kinase, inhibition of which may confound interpretation of the experiment (13Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 14Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To engineer biologically silent ligands to induce dimerization, a “bump-hole” strategy has been pursued in which rapamycin derivatives were designed to possess bulky substituents within the FRB/mTOR binding region. These derivatives bind poorly to mTOR, and thus are relatively nontoxic to cells, but can bind to FRB domains that contain compensatory cavityforming mutations. One such derivative contains a methallyl addition at the C-20 position in rapamycin (MaRap) and binds a triple mutant of FRB (K2095P, T2098L, W2101F) designated FRB* (15Liberles S.D. Diver S.T. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7825-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Fusing the essential gene encoding GSK-3β to FRB* and a nuclear export sequence to FKBP, the addition of MaRap should allow the formation of a ternary complex and a resultant ligand-dependent translocation of GSK-3β to the cytoplasm would be expected. However, in the absence of MaRap levels of GSK-3β expressed as a fusion to FRB* are significantly decreased with respect to the native protein, indicating that the FRB* domain confers instability (16Stankunas K.

To conditionally mislocalize a protein of interest in a rapid and reversible fashion, the protein domains that comprise the ternary complex should not be inherently unstable, and the small molecule should be easy to prepare and possess desirable pharmacokinetics in vivo. We set out to develop a conditional mislocalization system that would have these characteristics. To this end, we synthesized two rapamycin derivatives that possess large substituents at the C-16 position within the FRB-binding interface, C-16-(R)-trimethoxyphenyl rapamycin (TMOP-rap) and C-16-(S)-3-methylindolerapamycin (iRap) (8Luengo J.I.

A. 1996; 93: 12817-12821Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) provided many FRB mutants that activated reporter gene expression in response to iRap. Further analyses in mammalian cells revealed that these FRB mutants, as well as wild-type FRB (wtFRB), significantly reduced expression levels of fusion proteins, and addition of iRap caused a dose-dependent increase in expression levels. An awareness of this ligand-dependent behavior should aid investigators in interpreting experiments based on this conditional dimerization technology. FRB Library Generation—The FRB gene used for these studies encodes residues 2015–2114 of mTOR. Diversity in the FRB sequence was generated using a combination of error-prone PCR and nucleotide analog mutagenesis. Primers for mutagenic PCR were designed to contain 50 bases of homology to the yeast expression vector pGAD-T7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) including the desired restriction site and 18 bases complementary to either the 5′- or 3′-terminus of the FRB gene. For the first library, wtFRB was used as the PCR template for mutagenesis. One set of library conditions utilized 10 ng of wtFRB template, each oligonucleotide primer at 0.5 μm, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dATP and dGTP, 1.0 mm dCTP and dTTP, 2.5 units Taq polymerase, and either 0.5 or 0.05 mm MnCl2. For the second set of conditions, the non-natural nucleotides 8-oxo-dGTP and dPTP were utilized to encourage misincorporation (18Zaccolo M. Williams D.M. Brown D.M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For the second FRB library, a mixed template was generated consisting of equimolar ratios of wtFRB, FRB21, and FRB22 as well as a FRB21/FRB22 double mutant. Three independent condition sets were utilized to generate diversity within the FRB coding sequence and are described in Ref. 6Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.-C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J.

Yeast Transformations—The protocols for both high efficiency and library transformations were followed (20Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. A 50-ml culture (100-ml for library transformations) of the YSE2 strain was grown overnight in yeast/peptone/dextrose for 8 generations of doubling to a final A600 of 1.0. For the library transformation, 100 μg of library DNA along with 10 μg of digested pGAD-T7 library vector was added to the cells. Me2SO (1/10 volume of the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate mixture) was added to the cells before a 5-min heat shock at 42 °C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in yeast/peptone/dextrose and allowed to recover for 3 h at 30 °C, and then shaken before being plated on selective dropout media. Flow Cytometry with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Collection of FRB Mutants—YSE2 cells carrying the FRB library in selective media were treated with ligand (5 μm TMOP-rap for library 1 and 1 μm iRap for library 2) 16 h prior to analysis, and the top 1% of fluorescent cells were collected and grown at 30 °C for 48 h before retreatment. Cells were analyzed (with 10,000 events collected for analysis) and sorted at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility. Library DNA was recovered with a yeast plasmid rescue kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) and transformed into electrocompetent TOP10 cells (Bio-Rad gene pulser; 25 μF, 2.5 kV, 0.2-cm cuvette). Cell Culture—All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated donor bovine serum (NIH3T3 cells), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (ΦNX, 293T, and COS-1 cell lines) or 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HEK293 cells).

Cells were treated as described previously (16Stankunas K. Bayle J.H. Gestwicki J.E. Lin Y.-M. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Mol.

Transfections and Transductions—FRB mutants were cloned into the pBMN retroviral expression vector as N-terminal fusions to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Either the ΦNX ecotropic packaging cell line or 293T cells were transfected with the pBMN vectors using standard Lipofectamine 2000 protocols. For a transient transfection, 293T cells were cultured in growth medium for 24 h. To generate transduced NIH3T3 cells, viral supernatants were harvested from the ΦNX cells 48 h post-transfection, and NIH3T3 cells were incubated with the retroviral supernatants supplemented with 4 mg/ml polybrene for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were cultured in growth medium for 24 h to allow for viral integration before analysis. Flow Cytometry with Mammalian Cells—Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate and treated with iRap. For the stability assay, cells were treated with 1 μm iRap for 24 h and then harvested. For the dose-response assay, cells were treated with iRap (0–10 μm) and harvested at each time point. Cells were trypsinized from the plate, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were analyzed at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility, with 10,000 events collected for analysis. Immunoblotting for the mTOR Kinase Assay—HEK293 cells were plated at 2–2.5 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate and serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium only. Cells were mock-treated or treated with rapamycin (0.05–50 nm), iRap (0.5–500 nm), or AP21967 (0.5–500 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Serum was added to a final concentration of 20% for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed as described previously (22Park I.-H. Erbay E. Nuzzi P. Chen J. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with a phosphospecific primary antibody against Thr-389 of p70 S6 kinase (catalog number 9205, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA). Data were analyzed using ImageQuant and KaleidaGraph. Screening FRB Mutants in Yeast—To identify FRB mutants able to accommodate either TMOP-rap or iRap, we used a three-hybrid transcriptional switch assay in S. cerevisiae. In this assay, FKBP was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4BD), and FRB was fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD). The addition of rapamycin led to the formation of the FKBP·rapamycin·FRB complex, reconstituting the Gal4 transcription factor. We engineered a yeast strain in which yeGFP was placed under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter, and reporter gene expression indicated successful formation of the ternary complex (Fig. 1A). The rapamycin derivatives TMOP-rap and iRap were synthesized with modifications at the C-16 position within the FRB-binding region to abrogate binding to the native target mTOR (Fig. 1B). To accommodate the added steric bulk of the rapamycin analog, a compensatory cavity in FRB had to be introduced, and we used error-prone PCR and nucleotide analog mutagenesis to prepare a library of FRB mutants. The FRB library was designed and cloned into the destination vector by in vivo ligation, a process in which yeast cells ligated a library of PCR-derived inserts into a vector through homologous recombination. Successful recombination allowed cells to grow on selective dropout media. Transformed yeast were subjected to multiple rounds of FACS-based sorting, enriching for cells that expressed yeGFP. A library containing ∼106 members was subjected to six rounds of sorting using flow cytometry. For each round, the transformed cells were induced with 5 μm TMOP-rap 16 h prior to sorting, and the fluorescent cells were collected and further cultured from 1 to 7 days between sorts. The library population contained ∼2% positives upon initial analysis and was enriched to ∼80% by the final sort. These fluorescent cells were collected and the plasmid DNA isolated and sequenced. Sequence analysis of 33 clones revealed only two mutations; the first was I2021T and the second involved a mutation of the stop codon to one encoding leucine. The construct encoding FRB possessed a second in-frame stop codon four residues beyond the original stop codon, thus the second mutant had a four-residue extension (Leu-Asp-Ser-Ser) at the C terminus. To validate the screening method for selecting an FRB mutant that could bind TMOP-rap and to eliminate false positives, both FRB mutants in the pGAD-T7 vector were transformed into YSE2 and plated onto selective dropout media. Cells were treated with 5 μm TMOP-rap and analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of the reporter gene yeGFP. Surprisingly, the two FRB mutants responded weakly to TMOP-rap treatment, and the yeGFP expression levels did not reach those of the library population. To find an FRB mutant more responsive to ligand treatment, a second library was generated in a similar method to the first. The two mutations derived from the first screen were included in the library generation, so the mixed FRB template included wild-type FRB, both single FRB mutants discovered from the first library and the corresponding double mutant. Additionally, another rapamycin derivative, iRap, was chosen for the screen. A second FRB library containing ∼106 members was subjected to two rounds of sorting with flow cytometry. Transformed cells were treated with 1 μm iRap 16 h prior to sorting, and the top 1% of cells were collected and grown in the absence of ligand for 48 h. These cells were then treated with iRap 16 h prior to sorting. At this time, ∼55% of the population was fluorescent (Fig. 2A). The top 1% of cells were collected, and the plasmid DNA isolated and sequenced. Sequence analysis of 54 clones revealed 29 new FRB mutants. For validation, these FRB mutants were all individually transformed into YSE2 as described above. Two colonies expressing each mutant were treated with 1 μm iRap, and yeGFP expression levels were measured by flow cytometry. Fluorescence levels of the protein varied from barely above background to 6-fold higher (Fig. 2B). Twenty of these clones, all expressing high levels of yeGFP, were next tested in mammalian cells using a three-hybrid transcriptional switch. Further Characterization of FRB Mutants in Mammalian Cells—COS-1 cells were co-transfected by electroporation with the vectors pG5IL2SX, pBJ5-GF3E, and pBJ5-FRBVE (encoding either wild-type or mutant sequences of FRB) (21Bayle J.H. Grimley J.S. Stankunas K. Gestwicki J.E. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutant FRB sequences included the twenty clones from the iRap library as well as both of the mutants isolated from the first TMOP-rap-dependent screen. Supplemental table 1 lists the sequences of these 22 FRB mutants. Transfected cells were treated for 16 h in quadruplicate with rapamycin or iRap (0.5–500 nm). Fluorescence levels, representative of SeAP activity, were measured for all FRB constructs, and a representative sample is shown in Fig. 3. FRB mutants show varying response to iRap, and the EC50 values for the mutants range from 14.4 to 250 nm (Table 1). Additionally, iRap induces expression with an EC50 value of ∼20 nm, indicating that both wtFRB and the FRB mutants isolated from the library screen respond similarly to iRap in this transcriptional switch assay.TABLE 1FRB mutants treated with iRap exhibit a range of EC50 values by the SeAP assayFRB mutantEC50 (±S.E.)nmWT FRB20.5 (0.6)FRB1914.4 (0.4)FRB2218.4 (0.8)FRB1119.3 (1.1)FRB1020.4 (1.2)FRB2022.1 (2.0)FRB1423.0 (0.6)FRB224.9 (2.1)FRB2126.0 (1.1)FRB1828.1 (2.0)FRB129.7 (2.2)FRB631.4 (1.1)FRB1732.6 (1.5)FRB933.4 (2.1)FRB439.0 (5.3)FRB839.1 (2.3)FRB541.7 (4.6)FRB1642.7 (9.2)FRB1345.1 (10.5)FRB367.4 (10.0)FRB788.8 (19.3)FRB12100 (55)FRB15250 (140) Open table in a new tab Examining the Stability of FRB Mutants—An important characteristic for a conditional mislocalization system that operates in a rapid fashion is that all ligand-binding proteins are stable in the absence of ligand. This was not the case for the original MaRap-sensitive FRB mutant (16Stankunas K. Bayle J.H. Gestwicki J.E. Lin Y.-M. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To evaluate the stability of the FRB mutants isolated from the library screen, FRB mutants 2, 10, 11, and 19 as well as wtFRB were fused to the N terminus of YFP, and the constructs were expressed in mammalian cells. These four FRB mutants were chosen because they displayed the lowest EC50 values for iRap in the SeAP assay. NIH3T3 cells were individually transduced with all five constructs and mock-treated or treated with 1 μm iRap 24 h prior to FACS analysis. 293T cells were transiently transfected with only the wtFRB construct and treated as above. YFP fluorescence levels were measured in the presence and absence of iRap (Fig. 4A). In the absence of iRap, YFP fluorescence levels for the FRB constructs were only slightly above background, showing that the FRB proteins were unstable when expressed in mammalian cells. Moreover, as for FRB* treated with MaRap, the FRB proteins appeared to be stabilized when treated with iRap. A 10-fold increase in fluorescence was observed when cells stably expressing wtFRB fused to YFP were treated with iRap (Fig. 4A). Similar iRap-dependent stability was observed when measuring YFP expression levels for 293T cells transiently transfected with the wtFRB-YFP construct. All of the FRB mutants demonstrated similar increases in fluorescence (4–8-fold) upon treatment with iRap. Characterization of FRB-induced Instability—To determine both the time required to achieve maximum fluorescence as well as the minimum dose required to reach this fluorescence level, a kinetic study of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the wtFRB-YFP construct was carried out. Transduced cells were treated with various concentrations of iRap, and YFP fluorescence was monitored as a function of time (Fig. 4B). We observed that YFP fluorescence increased at approximately the same rate for the cell populations treated with 100 nm, 1 μm, and 10 μm iRap, whereas the cell population treated with 10 nm iRap showed decreased fluorescence levels at all time points. All cell populations achieved maximum fluorescence at 12 h, and levels dropped off slightly by 24 h, indicating that maximum fluorescence was reached by 12 h but not maintained in the absence of further dosing. A dose-response assay was performed to determine the concentration of iRap required to stabilize the wtFRB-YFP fusion protein. NIH3T3 cells transduced with wtFRB-YFP were treated with iRap (0–1 μm) and YFP fluorescence levels measured. The cells achieved maximum fluorescence with 1 μm iRap and the EC50 value at ∼10 nm (supplemental Fig. 2). To confirm that YFP fluorescence levels correlate to protein expression levels, NIH3T3 cells transduced with the wtFRB-YFP construct and treated with 1 μm iRap for 24 h were harvested and immunoblotted with a primary antibody against YFP. The protein expression levels were consistent with fluorescence levels (data not shown). mTOR Kinase Assays—The experiments carried out hitherto utilized FRB, which is a relatively small domain within the mTOR kinase. To determine whether the rapamycin derivatives bound with the same affinity to mTOR as they bound to FRB, a series of S6 kinase assays was performed. The mTOR protein kinase phosphorylates p70 S6 kinase at threonine 389, so the ability of rapamycin and its derivates to inhibit endogenous mTOR can be probed using a phosphospecific antibody for this residue. HEK293 cells were treated with rapamycin (0.05–50 nm), iRap (0.5–500 nm), or the derivative C-16-(S)-7-methylindolerapamycin (AP21967) (0.5–500 nm) under conditions that stimulated mTOR kinase activity. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a phosphospecific antibody for p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389). A representative Western blot is shown in Fig. 5A, in which the signal for phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase Thr-389 disappears as iRap inhibits mTOR. All three compounds were found to inhibit endogenous mTOR, with IC50 values of ∼0.1 nm for rapamycin, ∼5nm for iRap, and ∼10 nm for AP21967 (Fig. 5B). We set out to discover a ternary complex comprising FKBP, an FRB mutant and a rapamycin derivative that could be used to conditionally mislocalize proteins to rapidly and reversibly probe their function. The FRB library screened with the rapamycin derivative iRap revealed twenty mutants that expressed yeGFP above background levels (Fig. 2B). In a mammalian three-hybrid system using the reporter gene SeAP, these FRB mutants exhibited a range of expression levels. Some mutants were slightly more potent than wtFRB (EC50 values <20 nm), but most mutants were moderately weaker (EC50 values >20 nm) (Table 1). The iRap sample was pure by 1H NMR analysis (95%), but we became concerned that trace quantities of rapamycin might be responsible for the behavior of some of the mutants isolated from the library screen. Upon analysis by quantitative mass spectrometry, we determined that the iRap sample contained ∼2.6% rapamycin. Rapamycin was not detected (<0.1%) in the sample of AP21967. Our findings show that the bumped rapamycin analogs retain the ability to bind to wtFRB (Fig. 3) and full-length mTOR (Fig. 5), but trace quantities of rapamycin may improve the potency of the analogs. Given this fact, it was difficult to determine how much activity (i.e. isolation of mutants, activation of SeAP) is due to the rapamycin analog. The fusion protein of wtFRB to YFP was examined in both stably transduced (NIH3T3) and transiently transfected (293T) cells, and the 10-fold increase in expression levels in the presence of iRap was consistent for both protocols. Additionally, wtFRB and the FRB mutant proteins were only partially rescued by ligand, as the fluorescence levels in the presence of iRap were still 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than a construct expressing YFP only. Thus, although the FRB proteins exhibited ligand-dependent stability, the degree of stabilization in the presence of ligand was modest relative to unfused YFP. The destabilization behavior of FRB* was originally attributed to the cavity-forming mutations, but it appeared that even the wild-type FRB protein was destabilizing. To create a technology to control protein function based on rapid subcellular localization, the ligand-binding proteins should be stable. Waiting 12–24 h for protein levels to rise largely removes the temporal advantage of ligand-induced mislocalization. Additionally, a mislocalization system built upon domains that display ligand-dependent stability may produce ambiguous results, as it would be difficult to ascertain how much of an observed phenotype is due to mislocalization versus changes in protein expression levels. We found that, by monitoring fluorescence growth, NIH3T3 cells transduced with a wtFRB-YFP fusion and treated with 10 nm iRap reached 50% of the maximum value that the populations treated with higher concentrations of iRap reached and had lower expression levels at every time point. Thus, when treating cells with a ligand at low concentrations, it is important to note that maximum protein expression levels are never achieved. Upon examining the activity of rapamycin, iRap, and AP21967 in mTOR kinase assays, both iRap and AP21967 were found to inhibit mTOR with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (Fig. 5). Our studies to quantitate rapamycin levels in these samples revealed that rapamycin was not detected in AP21967 (<0.1%). Because the C-16 substituent of iRap was nearly identical to that of AP21967, this finding suggests that the ability of iRap to more potently inhibit mTOR (Fig. 5) or translocate fusion proteins (10Inoue T. Heo W.D. Grimley J.S. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) is likely due to traces of contaminating rapamycin. In our search for a ternary complex that could be used to rapidly mislocalize proteins of interest, we have discovered that the FRB domain of the mTOR kinase is inherently unstable. When FRB is fused to the fluorescent protein YFP and studied in the presence and absence of ligand, the expression levels of the fusion protein increase from 4- to 10-fold for all of the FRB proteins examined. Both the ligand-dependent stability of FRB fusion proteins as well as the purity of rapamycin derivatives should be considered as potentially confounding variables when using rapamycin-based ligand-mediated colocalization systems.

By supplying NADPH for antioxidant systems, we recently demonstrated that the control of mitochondrial redox balance and the cellular defense against oxidative damage are some of the primary functions of mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPm). In this study, we demonstrate that modulation of IDPm activity in U937 cells regulates ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. When we examined the regulatory role of IDPm against ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in U937 cells transfected with the cDNA for mouse IDPm in sense and antisense orientations, a clear inverse relationship was observed between the amount of IDPm expressed in target cells and their susceptibility to apoptosis. Upon exposure to 2 gray γ-irradiation, there was a distinct difference between the IDPm transfectant cells in regard to the morphological evidence of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, cellular redox status, oxidative damage to cells, mitochondrial function, and the modulation of apoptotic marker proteins. In addition, transfection of HeLa cells with an IDPm small interfering RNA decreased the activity of IDPm, enhancing the susceptibility of radiation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that IDPm may play an important role in regulating the apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation, and the effect of IDPm small interfering RNA on HeLa cells offers the possibility of developing a modifier of radiation therapy.

Wardman P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5734-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). When water, the most abundant intracellular material, is exposed to ionizing radiation, decomposition reactions occur, and a variety of ROS, including superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide, are generated (2Ewing D. Jones S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The secondary radicals formed by the interaction of hydroxyl radicals with organic molecules may also be of importance (1Mikkelsen R.B. Wardman P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5734-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 2Ewing D. Jones S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These ROS have the potential to damage critical cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and lipids and eventually result in physical and chemical damage to tissues that may lead to cell death or neoplastic transformation (3Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). In many cases, ionizing radiation-induced cell death has been identified as apoptosis (4Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Biological systems have evolved an effective and complicated network of defense mechanisms, which enable cells to cope with lethal oxidative environments. These defense mechanisms involve antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes the dismutation of O2.¯ to H2O2 and O2 (5McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 224: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), catalase, and peroxidases, which remove hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides (6Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4829) Google Scholar). These enzymes normally act as a team, and thus SOD protects catalase and peroxidase against inhibition by O2.¯ (7Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5751-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas catalase and peroxidase provide protection for SOD against inactivation by hydrogen peroxide (8Pigeolet E. Corbisier P. Houbion A. Lambert D. Michiels C. Raes M. Zachary M.D. Remacle J. Mech. Ageing. 1990; 51: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Because ROS appear to be mediators of the apoptosis by ionizing radiation (9Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), factors, including antioxidant enzymes that regulate the fate of such species, may be of great importance in the protection of cells against ionizing radiation-induced cell death. The isocitrate dehydrogenases (ICDHs, EC 1.1.1.41 and EC 1.1.1.42) catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and require either NAD+ or NADP+, producing NADH and NADPH, respectively (10Koshland Jr., D.E. Walsh K. LaPorte D.C. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1985; 27: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). NADPH is an essential reducing equivalent for the regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH) by glutathione reductase and for the activity of NADPH-dependent thioredoxin system (11Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kwon S.J. Park J.-W. Choi W.K. Kim I.H. Kim K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); both are important in the protection of cells from oxidative damage. Therefore, ICDH may play an antioxidant role during oxidative stress. We recently reported that mitochondrial ICDH (IDPm) is involved in the supply of NADPH needed for GSH production against mitochondrial oxidative damage (13Jo S.-H. Son M.-K. Koh H.-J. Lee S.-M. Song I.-H. Kim Y.-O. Lee Y.S. Jeong K.-S. Kim W.B. Park J.-W. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16168-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that modulation of IDPm activity in U937 cells regulates apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation. We report here that increased expression of IDPm suppresses ionizing radiation-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and also prevents nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. In addition, we show that treatment of HeLa cells with an IDPm small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased activity of IDPm, enhancing the susceptibility of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that IDPm may play an important role in regulating the apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation, presumably through acting as an antioxidant enzyme. Furthermore, the effect of IDPm siRNA in HeLa cells offers the possibility of developing a modifier of radiation therapy.

Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). A peptide representing the N-terminal 16 amino acids of mouse IDPm (ADKRIKVAKPVVEMPG) was used to prepare polyclonal anti-IDPm antibodies (13Jo S.-H. Son M.-K. Koh H.-J. Lee S.-M. Song I.-H.

U937 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were irradiated at room temperature with 137Cs source at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs from cultured cells were prepared using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA from cultured cells was separated by electrophoresis on 0.66 m formamide, 1% agarose gels, transferred to GeneScreen membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled mouse IDPm cDNA as a probe. Hybridization and subsequent procedures were the same as those described previously (13Jo S.-H. Son M.-K. Koh H.-J. Lee S.-M. Song I.-H. Kim Y.-O. Lee Y.S. Jeong K.-S. Kim W.B. Park J.-W. Song B.J.

Measurement of IDPm Activity—Cells were collected at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and were washed once with cold PBS. The mitochondrial pellets were obtained as described previously (13Jo S.-H.

The supernatants were used to measure the activity of IDPm. Apoptosis Assay—Cells were collected at 2,000 × g for 5 min, washed once with cold PBS, fixed in ice-cold methanol/acetic acid (1:1, v/v) for 5 min, and stained with 2 μg/ml PI in the dark state. The morphological changes of apoptotic cells were analyzed by the Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Apoptotic nuclei were expressed as a percentage of total nuclei. Labeled nuclei were also subjected to flow cytometric analysis and then gated on light scatter to remove debris, and the percentage of nuclei with a sub-G1 content was considered apoptotic cells. ApoAlert annexin V apoptosis detection system (Clontech) was used to measure the relative distribution of apoptotic and necrotic cells. The cell suspension was double-stained with annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments were measured according to the instruction manual of the cell death detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Applied Science). DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. After the TUNEL reaction, cells or histologic paraffin-embedded sections were analyzed by flow cytometry or by fluorescence microscopy. The green fluorescence of FITC was recorded with excitation at 488 nm through a 515 nm band pass, together with the transmission image. DNA fragmentation induced by apoptosis was also assessed by the photometric ELISA for detection of BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments (Roche Applied Science) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Cellular Redox Status—NADPH was measured using the enzymatic cycling method as described by Zerez et al. (14Zerez C.R. Lee S.J. Tanaka K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and expressed as the ratio of NADPH to the total NADP pool. The concentration of total glutathione was determined by the rate of formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm (ɛ = 1.36 × 104 m–1cm–1) as described by Akerboom and Sies (15Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was measured by the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-GSSG reductase recycling assay after treating GSH with 2-vinylpyridine (16Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS production was measured using the oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analyses. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentrations were determined using a ferric acid-sensitive dye, xylenol orange, as described (17Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Cellular Oxidative Damage—The protein carbonyl content was determined spectrophotometrically using the DNPH labeling procedure as described (18Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). The protein carbonyl contents in U937 cells were also determined with DNP-specific antibody (1:200 dilution) and anti-human IgG FITC (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm) conjugate (1:800 dilution) as a secondary antibody, and then fluorescence was observed by using a fluorescence microscope. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were determined as an independent measurement of lipid peroxidation (19Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10824) Google Scholar). The lipid peroxidation in U937 cells was determined with rabbit polyclonal anti-HNE Michael adduct antibody (1:200 dilution) and anti-human IgG TRITC conjugate (1:800 dilution). Lipid peroxidation was also estimated by using a fluorescent probe DPPP as described by Okimoto et al. (20Okimoto Y. Watanabe A. Niki E. Yamashita T. Noguchi N. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 8-Hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) levels of U937 and HeLa cells were estimated by using a fluorescent binding assay as described by Struthers et al.

Mitochondrial Damage—Mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) was measured by the incorporation of rhodamine 123 dye into the mitochondria, as described previously (22Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To evaluate the levels of mitochondrial ROS, cells in PBS were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 5 μm DHR 123, and cells were washed and resuspended in complete growth media, and ionizing radiation was applied to the cells. The cells were then incubated for an additional 40 min. FACS was used for fluorescence intensity quantification. Intracellular ATP levels were determined by using luciferin-luciferase as described (23Spragg R.G. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Schraufstatter I.U. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Light emission was quantitated in a Turner Designs TD 20/20 luminometer (Stratec Biomedical Systems, Germany). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 10–12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactive antigen was then recognized by using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Knockdown of p53 by siRNA—All siRNA duplexes directed against p53 was synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The presynthesized siRNA against luciferase was used as the control oligonucleotides. The sequences of the double-stranded RNAs of p53 and luciferase used in the current experiments are as follows. For p53, sense and antisense siRNAs are 5′-GCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCAUdTdT-3′ and 5′-AUGGGCCUCCGGUUCAUGCdTdT-3′, respectively. For luciferase, sense and antisense siRNAs are 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGdTdT-3′, respectively. U937 cells were transfected with 20 nm oligonucleotide by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free conditions according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 4 h of incubation, the cells were washed and supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Knockdown of IDPm by siRNA—IDPm siRNA and scrambled siRNA were purchased from Samchully Pharm Co. Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). The sequences of the double-stranded RNAs of IDPm and control used in the current experiments are as follows. For IDPm, sense and antisense siRNAs are 5′-AGACCGACUUCGACAAGAAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UUCUUGUCGAAGUCGGUCUdTdT-3′, respectively. For scrambled control, sense and antisense siRNAs are 5′-CUGAUGACCUGAGUGAAUGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CAUUCACUCAGGUCAUCAGdTdT-3′, respectively. HeLa cells were transfected with 60 nm oligonucleotide by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free conditions according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After incubation for 2 days, the cells were washed and supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. RT-PCR Analysis of p53—RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The cDNA template was then amplified by quantitative RT-PCR using the following specific primers: p53, 5′-CCT ATG AGC CGC CTG AGG TT (sense) and 5′-CGG AGA TTC TCT TCC TCT GT (antisense); and GADPH, 5′-GGA CCT GAC CTG CCG TCT AGA A (sense) and 5′-GGT GTC GCT GTT GAA GTC AGA G GAPDH (antisense). The amplified DNA products were resolved on a 1.5% nondenaturing agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide. Quantitaion of Relative Fluorescence—The averages of fluorescence intensity from fluorescence images were calculated as described (24Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans C.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The difference between two mean values was analyzed by Student’s t test and was considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. Replicates—Unless otherwise indicated, each result described in this paper is representative of at least three separate experiments. Construction of IDPm Transfectant Cells—To study the relationship between IDPm activity and ionizing radiation-induced apoptotic cell death, the three kinds of U937 transfectant cells were constructed. The U937 cells were transfected with the LNCX containing either an IDPm gene as a sense orientation, IDPm(+), as an antisense orientation, IDPm(–), or the LNCX alone, control. Chromosomal integration of the transfected IDPm constructs was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). The IDPm activity of IDPm(+) U937 cells was increased 4.5-fold compared with that of the control cells. In contrast, IDPm(–) U937 cells exhibited 65% less IDPm activity when compared with that of the control (Fig. 1A, upper). When we transfected IDPm cDNA to HEK293 and HL-60 cells, the IDPm activity of IDPm(+) cells was increased 6- and 3.6-fold, respectively, and IDPm(–) cells exhibited 45 and 50% less IDPm activity, respectively, compared with that of the control cells. Immunoblot analysis using anti-IDPm antibody further confirmed the correlation between the amount of IDPm enzyme measured in cell extracts by immunoreaction and the corresponding levels of enzyme activity (Fig. 1A, middle). Increased expression of IDPm in IDPm(+) or reduced expression of IDPm in IDPm(–) did not significantly alter the activities of other antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase (data not shown), suggesting that the transfection of IDPm cDNA did not affect the activities of other enzymes involved in antioxidation. The mRNA (2.2-kb pairs) level of IDPm showed a corresponding change with the IDPm activity and protein levels (Fig. 1A, lower). Apoptosis Determination—When U937 cells were irradiated at the clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy, shrinkage of the cell and plasma membrane blebbing was observed by light microscopy (data not shown). To assess whether these changes were attributable to apoptotic changes, nuclear morphology was observed by fluorescence microscopy using PI. When cells were exposed to ionizing radiation, apoptotic cells were increased markedly in IDPm(–) cells as compared with IDPm(+) cells (Fig. 1B). The regulatory role of IDPm against ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis was not limited to U937 cells. Transfection of IDPm cDNA to other cell lines, such as HEK293 and HL-60, also exhibited a clear inverse relationship between the amount of IDPm expressed in target cells and their susceptibility to apoptosis (Fig. 1B). The proportion of cell death was detected by annexin V/PI staining. As shown in Fig. 1C, a substantial increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed upon exposure to 2 Gy of γ-irradiation. The population of apoptotic cells in γ-irradiated cultures was significantly reduced in IDPm(+) cells. The protective effect of IDPm against ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis was also confirmed by the cell death detection ELISA plus, as shown in Fig. 1D. DNA Fragmentation—Ionizing radiation-triggered apoptosis in U937 cells was determined by the measurement of DNA fragmentation using TUNEL assay and evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1E, left). DNA fragmentation was further confirmed by the photometric ELISA for detection of BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments (Fig. 1E, right). Results of DNA fragmentation assay for U937 cells treated with 2 Gy of γ-irradiation showed that apoptosis was the main mechanism of cell death observed, because DNA fragments were present only inside the cells. The DNA fragmentation was significantly reduced in IDPm(+) cells compared with control or IDPm(–) cells upon exposure to ionizing radiation. Cellular Redox Status—To investigate whether the difference in apoptotic cell death of U937 cells upon exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with ROS formation, the levels of intracellular peroxides in the U937 cells were evaluated by confocal microscopy with the oxidant-sensitive probe DCFH-DA. As shown in Fig. 2A, an increase in DCF fluorescence was observed in U937 cells when they were exposed to 2 Gy of γ-irradiation. The increase in fluorescence was significantly reduced in IDPm(+) cells. We also determined the level of intracellular H2O2 in transfectant cells exposed to ionizing radiation. A significantly lower intracellular level of H2O2 was observed in IDPm(+) cells as compared with that of control or IDPm(–) cells with the exposure of 2 Gy of γ-irradiation (Fig. 2A). These data strengthen the conclusion that IDPm provided protection from the ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis by decreasing the steady-state level of intracellular oxidants. One important parameter of GSH metabolism is the ratio of GSSG/total GSH (GSHt) which may reflect the efficiency of GSH turnover. When the cells were exposed to 2 Gy of γ-irradiation, the ratio of cellular [GSSG]/[GSHt] was significantly higher in IDPm(–) cells than in IDPm(+) cells (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that GSSG in IDPm(–) cells was not reduced as efficiently as in IDPm(+) cells. These results suggest that a decrease in the efficiency of GSH recycling may be responsible for the higher concentration of intracellular peroxides. NADPH, required for GSH generation by glutathione reductase, is an essential factor for the cellular defense against oxidative damage. The ratio for [NADPH]/[NADP+ + NADPH] (NADPt) was significantly decreased in cells treated with 2 Gy of γ-irradiation; however, the decrease in this ratio was much less pronounced in IDPm(+) cells (Fig. 2B). Cellular Oxidative Damage—As indicative markers of oxidative damage to cells, the occurrence of oxidative DNA damage, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation was evaluated. It is well established that oxidative stress in various cells usually leads to accumulation of potent, cytotoxic lipid peroxides such as malondialdehyde and HNE (25Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Exposure of 2 Gy of γ-irradiation increased the level of malondialdehyde 3.6-fold in IDPm(–) cells; however, the increase in malondialdehyde content of IDPm(+) cells was significantly lower than that of control and IDPm(–) cells (Fig. 2C). To determine whether IDPm decreased the sensitivity of protein damage, we performed carbonyl content measurements for protein oxidation after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation. IDPm(–) cells elicited an ∼2-fold increase of carbonyl groups, as compared with unirradiated cells when 2 Gy of ionizing radiation was exposed. Although the carbonyl content of IDPm(+) cells also increased with irradiation, the increase was significantly lower than that of IDPm(–) cells (Fig. 2C). Lipid peroxidation was visualized by immunocytochemical method using anti-HNE antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the fluorescent intensity, which reflects the endogenous levels of HNE adducts in proteins, was significantly increased when U937 cells were exposed to 2 Gy of γ-irradiation, and the increase of lipid peroxidation was markedly reduced in IDPm(+) cells. Recently, it has been shown that DPPP is a suitable fluorescence probe to monitor lipid peroxidation within cell membrane specifically (20Okimoto Y. Watanabe A. Niki E. Yamashita T. Noguchi N. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). DPPP fluorescent intensity was increased markedly in control cells, whereas it was not significantly increased in IDPm(+) cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. To determine whether IDPm decreased the sensitivity to protein damage, protein oxidation was also visualized by immunocytochemical method using anti-DNP antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the fluorescent intensity, which reflects the endogenous levels of carbonyl groups in proteins, was significantly increased when U937 cells were exposed to 2 Gy of γ-irradiation, and the increase of protein oxidation was markedly reduced in IDPm(+) cells. 8-OH-dG has been used as an indicator of oxidative DNA damage in vivo and in vitro (26Park J.-W. Floyd R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that 8-OH-dG level is specifically measured by a fluorescent binding assay using avidin-conjugated TRITC (21Struthers L. Patel R. Clark J. Thomas S. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, the fluorescent intensity, which reflects the endogenous levels of 8-OH-dG in DNA, was significantly increased in untreated cells upon exposure to ionizing radiation. In contrast, the overall DNA appeared to be markedly protected in IDPm(+) cells even after exposure to the same dose of ionizing radiation. These results indicate that IDPm appears to protect cells from oxidative damage caused by ionizing radiation. Mitochondrial Damage—Alterations in mitochondrial integrity and function may play an important role in the apoptotic cascade. MPT, associated with the opening of large pores in the mitochondrial membranes, is a very important event in apoptosis, and ROS is one of the major stimuli that change MPT (27Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y. Crowe R.A. Cascio W.E. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Herman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scop"

https://openalex.org/W1992488799,"A crucial step in the immune response is the binding of antigenic peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Class II MHC proteins present their bound peptides to CD4(+) T cells, thereby helping to activate both the humoral and the cellular arms of the adaptive immune response. Peptide loading onto class II MHC proteins is regulated temporally, spatially and developmentally in antigen-presenting cells. To help visualize these processes, we have developed a series of novel fluorogenic probes that incorporate the environment-sensitive amino acid analogs 6-N,N-dimethylamino-2-3-naphthalimidoalanine and 4-N,N-dimethylaminophthalimidoalanine. Upon binding to class II MHC proteins these fluorophores show large changes in emission spectra, quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime. Peptides incorporating these fluorophores bind specifically to class II MHC proteins on antigen-presenting cells and can be used to follow peptide binding in vivo. Using these probes we have tracked a developmentally regulated cell-surface peptide-binding activity in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2015190128,"Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in transformed cells and tumor cells containing activated p21RAS results in apoptosis. To investigate the pro-apoptotic pathway induced by the p21RAS oncoprotein, we first identified the specific PKC isozyme necessary to prevent apoptosis in the presence of activated p21RAS. Dominant-negative mutants of PKC, short interfering RNA vectors, and PKC isozyme-specific chemical inhibitors directed against the PKCδ isozyme demonstrated that PKCδ plays a critical role in p21RAS-mediated apoptosis. An activating p21RAS mutation, or activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Ras effector pathway, increased the levels of PKCδ protein and activity in cells, whereas inhibition of p21RAS activity decreased the expression of the PKCδ protein. Activation of the Akt survival pathway by oncogenic Ras required PKCδ activity. Akt activity was dramatically decreased after PKCδ suppression in cells containing activated p21RAS. Conversely, constitutively activated Akt rescued cells from apoptosis induced by PKCδ inhibition. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that p21RAS, through its downstream effector PI3K, induces PKCδ expression and that this increase in PKCδ activity, acting through Akt, is required for cell survival. The p21RAS effector molecule responsible for the initiation of the apoptotic signal after suppression of PKCδ activity was also determined to be PI3K. PI3K (p110CAAX, where AA is aliphatic amino acid) was sufficient for induction of apoptosis after PKCδ inhibition. Thus, the same p21RAS effector, PI3K, is responsible for delivering both a pro-apoptotic signal and a survival signal, the latter being mediated by PKCδ and Akt. Selective suppression of PKCδ activity and consequent induction of apoptosis is a potential strategy for targeting of tumor cells containing an activated p21RAS.

Selective suppression of PKCδ activity and consequent induction of apoptosis is a potential strategy for targeting of tumor cells containing an activated p21RAS. The ras oncogene family is among the most commonly mutated group of genes in human cancer. Its protein products code for three closely related p21RAS proteins, including H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras. p21RAS proteins are localized in the inner plasma membrane, bind GDP and GTP, and possess an intrinsic GTPase activity. p21RAS proteins function as plasma membrane-bound guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and act as molecular switches, thereby regulating signal transduction pathways for hormones, growth factors, and cytokine receptors (1Wiesmuller L. Wittinghofer F. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several downstream effector proteins of p21RAS have been identified that bind preferentially to p21RAS in the GTP-bound state, including Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), 2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; siRNA, short interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; siRNA, short interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. and a family of GDP-GTP exchange factors for the Ral small GTPases (Ral-GDS). Raf proteins, which are proto-oncogene-encoded serine/threonine kinases, activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. PI3K activation results in the activation of the anti-apoptotic serine/threonine kinase Akt, among other molecules. Other p21RAS targets include the GTPase-activating proteins, p120GAP and neurofibromin (2Adjei A.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1062-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). p21RAS proteins were shown to influence proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and apoptosis by relaying mitogenic and growth signals from the membrane into the cytoplasm and the nucleus.Specific point mutations localized in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 63, 116, 117, and 146 can lock the p21RAS protein in the active GTP-bound state and permit stimulation of downstream signaling cascades in the absence of extrinsic p21RAS activation. Ras mutations can be found in human malignancies with an overall frequency of 20%. A particularly high incidence of ras gene mutations has been reported in malignant tumors of the pancreas (80–90%, K-ras), in colorectal carcinomas (30–60%, K-ras), in non-melanoma skin cancer (30–50%, H-ras), and in hematopoietic neoplasia of myeloid origin (18–30%, K- and N-ras) (3Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar).In addition to its central involvement in cell proliferation, recent studies indicate that the presence of an activated p21RAS protein sensitizes transformed or malignant cells to apoptotic stimuli (4Hiraragi H.

Various signaling pathways have been proposed for this pro-apoptotic activity. Chou et al. (10Chou C.K. Liang K.H. Tzeng C.C. Huang G.C. Chuang J.I. Chang T.Y. Liu H.S. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 1823-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported activated p21RAS can cause apoptosis in transformed murine fibroblast cells through activation of the transcription factor NFκB. Another study suggested that the p21RAS/MAPK pathway is involved in Ras-specific apoptosis (11Jung J.W. Cho S.D. Ahn N.S. Yang S.R. Park J.S. Jo E.H. Hwang J.W. Jung J.Y. Kim S.H. Kang K.S. Lee Y.S. Cancer Lett. 2005; 225: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The latter study also found that activating p21RAS mutations increased colon cancer cell sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis through the negative regulation of gelsolin expression (12Klampfer L. Swaby L.A. Huang J. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Augenlicht L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3932-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in cells expressing activated p21RAS rapidly induces apoptosis via FADD/caspase-8 signaling (9Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We also found that reactive oxygen species are necessary as downstream effectors of the Ras-mediated apoptotic response to PKC inhibition (7Liou J.S. Chen C.Y. Chen J.S. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39001-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).There are at least 12 PKC isoforms that are classified into three subfamilies according to the structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain, which determines their sensitivity to the second messengers Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (13Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of homology, however, there is a surprising degree of nonredundancy. Thus, individual PKC isoforms mediate different and unique cellular functions in different cell types and different tissues (14Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). PKCδ belongs to the subfamily of novel isoforms (PKCδ, PKCɛ, PKCθ, and PKCη), which are insensitive to Ca2+. PKCδ is widely regarded as having pro-apoptotic properties (15Santiago-Walker A.E. Fikaris A.J. Kao G.D. Brown E.J. Kazanietz M.G. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol.

In addition, PKCδ activity is known to initiate a number of pro-apoptotic signals, such as increased expression and stability of p53 (20Gil-Perotin S. Marin-Husstege M. Li J. Soriano-Navarro M.

But recent studies have also shown that PKCδ can protect cells against apoptotic stimuli under certain conditions (25Zhang J. Liu N. Zhang J. Liu S. Liu Y. Zheng D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PKCδ has been reported to regulate B-lymphocyte survival (26Mecklenbrauker I. Kalled S.L. Leitges M. Mackay F. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2004; 431: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Knock-out experiments have shown that PKCδ-deficient mice have a severely deregulated immune system and develop autoimmune disease (27Mecklenbrauker I. Saijo K. Zheng N.Y. Leitges M. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2002; 416: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Miyamoto A. Nakayama K. Imaki H. Hirose S. Jiang Y. Abe M. Tsukiyama T. Nagahama H. Ohno S. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I.

Thus, PKCδ activation can serve as a pro-apoptotic signal, or as a survival signal, to determine cell fate.This study examines the mechanism of apoptotic signaling induced by the p21RAS oncoprotein. We found that PKCδ plays a critical role in suppressing p21RAS-mediated apoptosis, and selective inhibition of this isozyme initiates apoptosis in cells containing activated p21RAS. Our data further demonstrate that unregulated Ras activity, through activation of the downstream effector PI3K, up-regulates PKCδ expression and subsequently activates Akt, generating an anti-apoptotic effect and protecting against Ras-mediated apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Reagents—The activated Ras effectors, Raf-1 (Raf-22W), PI3K (p110CAAX), Rlf (Rlf-CAAX), and Ral-GDS (RalA-28N, dominant-negative) were cloned into the pBabe puro vector (29Rodriguez-Viciana P.

Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Treatment—NIH/3T3 and Balb cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). NIH/3T3-Ras cells were produced by stable transfection of v-Harvey Ras and selected and maintained in 0.5 mg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen). Ki-v-Ras-Balb (KBalb) cells were produced by stable infection of Balb with retroviral vector stocks containing v-Kirsten Ras, and were selected and maintained with geneticin. The human pancreatic tumor lines Hs 766s, BxPC-3, and MIA PaCa-2 were obtained from the ATCC. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Media were additionally supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (NIH/3T3, NIH/3T3-Ha-v-Ras, Balb/3T3, Ki-v-Ras-Balb, and Balb-myc) or 10% fetal bovine serum (BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2). Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Roche Applied Science). The number of viable cells growing in a single well on a 96-well microtiter plate was estimated by adding 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the stain was diluted with 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. The optical densities were quantified at a test wavelength of 550 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm on a multiwell spectrophotometer.siRNA Knockdown of PKCδ and PKCα—siRNA duplexes for PKCδ (siRNAs) were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The siRNA sequences for targeting PKCδ were PKCδ-siRNA-1 (5′-GAUGAAGGAGGCGCUCAGTT-3′) and PKCδ-siRNA-2 (5′-GGCUGAGUUCUGGCUGGA-CTT-3′) (32Yoshida K. Wang H.G. Miki Y. Kufe D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The corresponding scrambled siRNAs were used as negative control. These siRNA sequences were also cloned into the pRNA6.1-Neo vector with a GFP tag according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). siRNA for PKCα (PKC-PKCα-V6) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Transfection of siRNA (oligonucleotide) was performed using 50 nm PKCδ siRNA or the same amount of scrambled siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection of plasmid-based siRNA vectors was carried out using the same method. PKCδ protein levels were determined by immunoblot analysis.Assay of PKCα and PKCδ Kinase Activities—PKCα and PKCδ activities were measured with an assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling). After 2 days of treatment with inhibitors, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 μg/ml aprotinin. PKCα and PKCδ were immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of protein extracts as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with the kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) and then incubated with a PKC-specific peptide substrate, [γ-32P]ATP, and inhibitors of cAMP-dependent kinase and calmodulin kinase for 10 min at 30 °C. 32P incorporated into the substrate was separated from residual 32P using p81 filters and subsequently quantified by scintillation counting. β-Actin antibody was used as negative control in immunoprecipitations.p21Ras Activity Assays—Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.5% serum for 48 h. Then cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm NaF. Protein was normalized to 1 μg/μl, and activated Ras was affinity-precipitated by mixing 1 mg of cell lysate with 10 μgof Raf-RBD-agarose bead conjugate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 60 min at 4 °C. The conjugates were washed three times in lysate buffer and then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with a monoclonal p21RAS antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories).DNA Profile Analysis—1 × 105 cells were plated in a 60-mm dish and grown until confluent. Cells were harvested and resuspended with 1 ml of a 35% ethanol/DMEM solution for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were collected and stained with solution containing 50 μg of propidium iodide/ml and 25 units of RNase/ml in PBS and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature for flow cytometric analysis.Immunoblotting Analysis—Harvested cells were disrupted in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm NaCl. Total protein (40 μg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight and probed with affinity-purified antibodies against p21RAS (BD Transduction Laboratories), PKCα, -β,-η,-θ, and -δ (BD Transduction Laboratories), caspase-3, caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), β-actin (Sigma) Akt, phospho-Akt specific for serine 473, Erk1/2, or p-Erk1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Apoptosis Assay—Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was used for apoptosis assay. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min on ice. After rinsing twice with PBS, the samples were incubated with the TMR red TUNEL reagent (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C in the dark, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptotic cells were identified by fluorescent microscopy.Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test, and p values <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSSelective Down-regulation of PKCδ Induces Apoptosis in Cells with Activated p21Ras—To begin determination of whether a specific PKC isozyme is responsible for suppression of Ras-mediated apoptosis, six isozyme-specific or nonspecific PKC inhibitors were used to suppress PKCα, PKCα/β, PKCβ1/2, PKCδ, or general PKC activity (Table 1). Optimal maximal effective concentrations of each inhibitor (>90% inhibition of relevant enzyme activity) were determined in pilot experiments (Fig. 1A or data not shown). The elevated activity of p21RAS in KBalb, MIA PaCa-2, and NIH/3T3-Ras cell lines compared with their counterpart cell lines (Balb, BxPc-3, and NIH/3T3, respectively) was confirmed by an activated p21RAS pulldown assay (Fig. 1B). Cells were treated for 48 h, and cell proliferation was quantitated by an MTT assay. Among the isozyme-specific inhibitors, rottlerin dramatically and specifically decreased the proliferation of both MIA PaCa-2 and NIH/3T3-Ras cells (both of which express a mutant, activated p21RAS protein), compared with the corresponding Hs766T cells and NIH/3T3 cells (which contain wild-type p21RAS) (Fig. 1, C and D). The pan-PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and the diacylglycerol antagonist 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol also strongly suppressed the growth of the cells containing activated p21RAS, consistent with our previous studies, while having no significant effect on most of the cell lines that contained a wild-type p21RAS (7Liou J.S.

Physiol. 2004; 198: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, rottlerin modestly but consistently stimulated proliferation of those cell lines expressing wild-type p21RAS (Balb and Hs766T cells). Cytofluorometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei showed that rottlerin caused 24–35% apoptosis (manifested as hypodiploid nuclei) in activated Ras-containing cell lines after 60 h of treatment, whereas the matched cells containing wild-type p21RAS displayed only 12–14% apoptosis (Fig. 1E). PKCδ expression and activity were analyzed in the rottlerin-treated cells to confirm suppression of activity.To confirm inhibition of PKCδ activity by rottlerin, both in vivo and in vitro kinase assays were performed. For the in vivo assays, cells were treated with rottlerin at 20 μm for 48 h and then lysed, and PKCδ was immunoprecipitated by a specific anti-PKCδ antibody. The incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into a PKC substrate peptide (QKRPSQRSKYL) by the immunoprecipitates was quantitated. Exposure to rottlerin, at the concentrations used in the apoptosis studies described above, blocked greater than 85% of the PKCδ activity in all of the cell lines tested, except Balb (Fig. 2A). In contrast, rottlerin produced only a slight, statistically insignificant decrease in PKCα activity (Fig. 2B). For the in vitro kinase assay, rottlerin was added to immunopurified PKCδ protein and incubated for 4 h, and PKCδ kinase activities were assayed using the artificial substrate. Rottlerin directly inhibited 55–90% of PKCδ activity (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Effects of rottlerin on PKCδ and PKCα enzyme activity and protein levels. A, PKCδ; B, PKCα kinase activities. The indicated cell lines were treated with rottlerin (20 μm) for 48 h and then harvested for analysis. 400 μg of protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitation by isozyme-specific antibodies, and the immunopurified proteins were assayed using an artificial substrate. C, PKCδ activity measured by in vitro assay. PKCδ was pulled down from cell lysates by immunoprecipitations and treated with rottlerin (20 μm) for 4 h and then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. D, PKCδ protein levels in cells after rottlerin treatment. 40-μg aliquots of the same protein lysates used in the studies in A and B were separated and immunoblotted using an anti-PKCδ monoclonal antibody. Ratio refers to the value of PKCδ expression/β-actin expression measured by Software BandLead 3.0. E, PKC isozyme expression levels after treatment with rottlerin. 1 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 6-well plate. Cells were treated with rottlerin (20 μm) or with the same volume of vehicle after they reached 80% confluence. After 48 h, cells were harvested, lysed in 50 μl lysis buffer, and the lysates separated and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-PKC isoform-specific antibodies. Lanes 1–4 represent Balb, KBalb, NIH/3T3, and NIH/3T3-Ras cells, respectively. The immunoblots shown in the left and right panels were separated on the same gel and immunoblotted at the same time. Because the samples in the left panel came from untreated cells, whereas the samples in the right panel came from rottlerin-treated cells, and because rottlerin-treatment inhibited cell growth/proliferation, fewer numbers of cells were obtained in these groups, and therefore less protein/lysate was available for assay from the treated group compared with the vehicle control group. The mean activities ± S.D. were obtained from at least three independent experiments, and assays from immunoprecipitations using an anti-β-actin antibody were used to determine the background activity, which was subtracted. Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis.

Similarly, total levels of PKCδ protein were elevated in the cell lines containing activated p21RAS relative to the corresponding lines containing wild-type p21RAS (Fig. 2D). The data obtained with the chemical inhibitors of PKC isozymes are consistent with PKCδ being the relevant PKC target for Ras-mediated apoptosis.Unexpectedly, exposure to rottlerin for 48 h suppressed PKCδ protein levels in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2D), whereas the levels of other PKC isozymes, including PKCα,-β,-η, and -θ, were not changed by rottlerin (Fig. 2E). The magnitude of suppression of PKCδ levels by rottlerin in the cells containing activated p21RAS (3–5-fold) approached the magnitude of the suppression of PKCδ activity in these cells by rottlerin (6–10-fold). Thus, although we can demonstrate direct inhibition of PKCδ activity by rottlerin in in vitro assays, the marked suppression in PKCδ activity observed after 48 h in vivo may be because of suppression of isozyme protein levels as well as direct inhibition of enzyme activity.As the specificity of chemical kinase inhibitors is never absolute, we employed two specific genetic techniques to suppress PKCδ activity. At 48 h after transfection of each of two PKCδ-specific hairpin vectors targeted at different PKCδ sequences into matched pairs of cell lines, BxPc-3/MIA PaCa-2 and NIH/3T3/NIH/3T3-Ras, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that expression of PKCδ protein was significantly diminished by transfection with the PKCδ-siRNA-2 vector. In contrast, the PKCδ-siRNA-1 vector did not produce significant knockdown of PKCδ protein (Fig. 3A). Because the efficiency of transient transfection in these cells was less than 50%, these analyses likely underestimate the activity of the siRNAs in a"
https://openalex.org/W2099895389,"The adenovirus protein E4orf6 targets p53 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and is known to form a complex with the Cul5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, whether Cul5 is directly responsible for the E4orf6-mediated degradation of p53 remains unclear. By using a dominant-negative mutant of Cul5 and silencing Cul5 expression through RNA interference, we have now demonstrated that E4orf6-mediated p53 degradation requires Cul5. Furthermore, we have identified a lentiviral Vif-like BC-box motif in E4orf6 that is highly conserved among adenoviruses from multiple species. More importantly, we have shown that this Vif-like BC-box is essential for the recruitment of Cul5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase by E4orf6 and is also required for E4orf6-mediated p53 degradation. E4orf6 selectively recruited Cul5 despite the lack of either a Cul5-box, which is used by cellular substrate receptors to recruit Cul5, or a newly identified HCCH zinc-binding motif, which is used by primate lentiviral Vif to recruit Cul5. Therefore, adenovirus E4orf6 molecules represent a novel family of viral BC-box proteins the cellular ancestor of which is as yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1966780764,"Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, with more than 500,000 new worldwide cases reported annually, resulting in 200,000 deaths of mainly older men in developed countries. Existing treatments have not proved very effective in managing prostate cancer, and continuing efforts therefore are ongoing to explore novel targets and strategies for future therapies. LAPSER1 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, but its true functions remain unknown. We report here that LAPSER1 colocalizes to the centrosomes and midbodies in mitotic cells with gamma-tubulin, MKLP1, and p80 katanin, and is involved in cytokinesis. Moreover, RNAi-mediated disruption of LAPSER1, which is accompanied by the mislocalization of p80 katanin, results in malformation of the central spindle. Significantly, the enhanced expression of LAPSER1 induces binucleation and renders the cells resistant to oncogenic transformation. In cells transformed by the v-Fps oncogene, overexpressed LAPSER1 induces abortive cytokinesis, followed by mitotic catastrophe in a p80 katanin-dependent manner. Cells that are rescued from this apoptotic pathway with Z-VAD-fmk display karyokinesis. These results suggest that LAPSER1 participates in cytokinesis by interacting with p80 katanin, the disruption of which may potentially cause genetic instability and cancer."

Walsh J.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 673-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YegS is annotated as a putative diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), 2The abbreviations used are: DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; MulK, multilipid kinase; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PGP, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. because it shares sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of the first reported DGKα (3Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a lipid second messenger generated as a response to receptor activation and has important functions in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and carcinogenesis (4Chang J.S. Noh D.Y. Park I.A. Kim M.J. Song H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5465-5468PubMed Google Scholar) Eukaryotic DGKs constitute a protein family that catalyzes the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid. A major cellular function of DAG is to activate protein kinase C (5Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar); DGKs prevent this activity by converting DAG to phosphatidic acid. Related mammalian sphingosine and ceramide kinases, as well as the recently identified multilipid kinase (MulK) (6Waggoner D.W. Johnson L.B. Mann P.C. Morris V. Guastella J. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38228-38235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with a broader substrate specificity, are also members of the lipid kinase family. Both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated sphingosine and ceramide adducts are important second messengers in cellular stress and apoptosis, but in particular, sphingosine-1-phosphate (7Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and ceramide-1-phosphate (8Gomez-Munoz A. Duffy P.A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Brindley D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 833-839PubMed Google Scholar) have attracted much attention recently. The sphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated pathways are proliferative, pro-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic, and thus sphingosine kinase has been described as an oncogene and a potential neoplastic drug target. Several of the other lipid kinases have also been proposed as potential targets for therapeutic interventions (9Bektas M. Payne S.G. Liu H. Goparaju S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Selzner M. Bielawska A. Morse M.A. Rudiger H.A. Sindram D. Hannun Y.A. Clavien P.A.

Mammalian DGKs represent a large group of lipid kinases with ten known isoforms (12Imai S. Kai M. Yasuda S. Kanoh H. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39870-39881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These isoforms are subdivided into five groups, depending on the composition of accessory domains. In contrast, YegS does not contain any accessory domains. Mammalian DAG kinases have been shown to be regulated by second messengers, and Ca2+ has been demonstrated to be a potent activator of the DGKα isoform. The MulK broad specificity lipid kinase is also activated by Ca2+, but only at low Mg2+ concentrations (0.5 mm) (6Waggoner D.W. Johnson L.B. Mann P.C. Morris V. Guastella J. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38228-38235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), implying a complex dependence on divalent metals. The mechanism for the calcium-dependent effects of DGKα has been assumed to be mediated by the EF-hand domain, where Ca2+ binding induces membrane localization through the C1 domains and thereby enables access to the lipid substrates (13Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Ca2+ effects have also been shown to be mediated at the catalytic subunit of DGKs, where Ca2+ lowered the Km values for ATP binding (13Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutagenesis studies on the catalytic subunit of porcine DGKα have identified two conserved aspartic acid residues that are implied in Ca2+ regulation through an unknown mechanism (2Abe T. Lu X. Jiang Y. Boccone C.E. Qian S. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Walsh J.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 673-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A structural basis for the regulation and action of the lipid kinases is lacking, as there is no three-dimensional structure available for any family member. The function of YegS has not previously been established, but the homology to other lipid kinases implies that YegS might be involved in lipid phosphorylation. E. coli does contain a well characterized membrane-bound DGK (14Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DGK is a homotrimeric integral membrane protein in which each subunit has three predicted transmembrane helices (15Oxenoid K. Sonnichsen F.D. Sanders C.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12876-12882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, YegS is a soluble cytosolic protein. Numerous prokaryotic YegS homologues are available, but these are all from uncharacterized hypothetical proteins. Close homologues are found in the human pathogens Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium LT2, Yersinia pestis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recently, the latter gene, Rv2252, was shown to code for a DAG kinase that catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid but that is not essential for M. tuberculosis survival under laboratory conditions (16Owens R.M. Hsu F.F. VanderVen B.C. Purdy G.E. Hesteande E. Giannakas P. Sacchettini J.C. McKinney J.D. Hill P.J. Belisle J.T. Butcher B.A. Pethe K. Russell D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that YegS is a lipid kinase with phosphatidylglycerol kinase activity, which has been previously undescribed. The structure of YegS reveals a two-domain protein with significant similarities to the fold and active site of NAD kinases. The structure also reveals a novel metal binding site coordinated by residues conserved in most lipid kinases. The mechanistic implications of the YegS structure for the human lipid kinases are discussed as well as the potential biological role for YegS homologues in prokaryotic lipid metabolism. Purification—Two expression constructs of YegS were used in this study. The cloning and vector details for construct 1 were described earlier (17Bakali H.M. Nordlund P. Hallberg B.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2006; 62: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Construct 2 is similar to construct 1 but lacks the non-cleavable C-terminal His tag of construct 1. Construct 2 was generated due to problems in reproducing the crystals from construct 1. Construct 1 protein was expressed and purified as described earlier (17Bakali H.M. Nordlund P. Hallberg B.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2006; 62: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Construct 2 was purified from selenomethionine-labeled protein (18Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L.

The affinity-purified protein was exchanged into 20 mm Tris, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, pH 7.5. The His tag was removed by cleavage with TEV protease (19van den Berg S. Lofdahl P.A. Hard T. Berglund H. J. Biotechnol. 2005; 121: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (1 mg of His-tagged TEV/10 mg of protein) at room temperature overnight. The cleaved protein was subjected to a second round of affinity purification to remove the uncleaved protein, cleaved His tag, and TEV protease from the cleaved protein. The proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 (Hiload 26/60) (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, pH 7.5. The pure protein was concentrated and stored at -80 °C. Enzyme Assays—Lipid kinase activity was analyzed by measuring the incorporation of [γ-33P]ATP into a selection of potential lipid substrates at 25 °C (20Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15062-15069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay was performed in a total volume of 250 μl containing 40 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm octyl glucoside, 500 μm lipid acceptor, 1 mm ATP (containing ∼5 μCi of labeled ATP), and ∼1 μg of the purified enzyme. The different lipids tested as substrate were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1), placed in a disposable glass tube, dried under a stream of nitrogen vapor, resuspended in the assay buffer with detergent, and sonicated for 5 min in a water bath sonicator. After preincubating the assay mixture for 5 min at 25 °C, ATP was added and the reaction was stopped after 30 min by adding 750 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2) containing 1% HCl. Extraction and separation of phospholipids were performed as follows. 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 500 μl of 1 m KCl plus 0.2 m H3PO4 were added, and the mixture was mixed thoroughly on a vortexer; samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The lower density phase (lipids) was transferred to a new glass reaction tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) were added to each tube, and the samples were applied to TLC silica plates (TLC plates 20 × 20 cm silica gel 60; Merck) that had been treated with 0.15 m ammonium sulfate and activated for 2 h and 30 min at 120 °C. The plates were developed in acetone/toluene/water (91:30:8), and the radioactive lipids were visualized by autoradiography. For direct quantification, the amount of phosphate incorporated into the lipid phase was determined by scintillation counting. For assays employing Mg2+ or Ca2+, both EGTA and 5 mm MgCl2 were omitted. To remove contaminating metals before the calcium effect measurements, the purified protein sample was incubated in 1 mm EGTA solution for 30 min at 4 °C. To remove EGTA, the protein solution was passed sequentially over two Sephadex G-25 PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated in 40 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.5. The protein samples as well as the other assay buffers/solutions were deionized using a Chelex 100 column (Bio-Rad) (21Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive [γ-33P]ATP (9000 TBq/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and Sigma. Salts (MgCl2, CaCl2, and NaCl) and detergents were purchased from Sigma. Reference lipids on the developed TLC plates were visualized with iodine vapor. Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometric analysis of a short chain substrate, 20 mm water-soluble phosphatidylglycerol (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (sodium salt) (Avanti Polar Lipids) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 2 μg of enzyme in a buffer containing 40 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2. Mass spectra were acquired in negative mode on an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-ToF; Micromass). Reference sample had the same composition, but no protein was added. Tandem mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identity of the product. The parent ion (m/z 521) was subjected to collision-induced dissociation using argon as the collision gas. The tandem mass spectrometry spectra revealed peaks at m/z 78.93, 96.99, and 115.12 corresponding to the fragments PO3, PO4H2, and C6H11O2, respectively. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals in the space group P21 were obtained as described previously (17Bakali H.M. Nordlund P. Hallberg B.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2006; 62: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine protein from construct 2 crystals was used for phasing (crystal 1). Crystals were produced by mixing 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) with 1 μl of mother liquid containing 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, and 0.2 m Li2SO4. Crystal 3 was obtained using the same ratio of protein to mother liquid but with a protein solution of 5 mg/ml protein, 10 mm ADP, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glycerol-3-phosphate, and a crystallization solution containing 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 0.2 m LiCl, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350. The data set for crystal 1 was collected at beamline PSF-BL1 (BESSY, Berlin, Germany) and the data set for crystal 3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at beamline ID14:3. Structure Determination and Refinement—Data of crystals from construct 2 were processed using the programs DENZO/SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38607) Google Scholar). XPREP (23Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

When the data were very anisotropic a “smoothed” σ cutoff procedure was used for filtering. 3K. A. Johnson, unpublished information. Data for refinement were selected by calculating an average σ on F for each reflection and all neighboring reflections. Thus, up to 27 reflections contributed to the average σ cut-off value for each reflection. Then, several “smoothed” σ cutoffs were tried to select data for refinement. The final selected smoothed σ cutoff was chosen because it produced a data set that refined well. This averaged σ cut-off was set at 4 σ, resulting in a refinement data set 98% complete to 2.7 Å, 73% complete overall to 1.9 Å, and 37.8% complete in the final shell to 1.9 Å. We did in parallel try refinement using a maximum likelihood-based anisotropic correction scheme, but this refinement did not converge as well as the best smoothed σ cutoff procedure. The data set for the complex structure (crystal 3) was refined to 2.5 Å. Procheck (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) analysis of the two refined structures indicated that no amino acids were present in the disallowed regions in the Ramachandran plot. The native structure (crystal 2) contained three residues in the generously allowed regions and one in the complex structure. YegS has been classified as a putative DGK based on the primary sequence analysis. To address the question of whether YegS is a bona fide lipid kinase, a functional activity assay was performed. TLC revealed no phosphatidic acid accumulation when using DAG as substrate (Fig. 1, lane 1) but detected a strong incorporation of γ-33P from ATP into a major band when using E. coli total lipid extracts or phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3 and Fig. 1B). Analysis of the lipid product by mass spectrometry, after using a short chain analogue of PG (C 6:0) as acceptor substrate, confirmed that YegS acts directly on a PG-type head group, yielding the phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) product (see supplemental Fig. S1). From the substrate-activity relationships in Fig. 1B, an apparent Km for PG of 0.70 mm, and a Vmax of 29.7 nmol/min/mg, could be calculated. Activity was obtained from pH 5 to 9. The Km value could be compared with a molar fraction of PG in the mixed PG/CHAPS aggregates of a few percent, substantially below the 10–15 mole percent PG in the E. coli inner membrane in vivo. To the best of our knowledge a phosphatidylglycerol phosphorylation reaction has not been reported earlier in E. coli or in any other organism. The structure of YegS was initially solved to 2.9 Å resolution in a tetragonal crystal form (P42212) by single wavelength anomalous dispersion techniques using a selenomethionine-substituted variant of YegS. An initial model was subsequently used to solve the structure of the native protein crystallized in a monoclinic (P21) crystal form that diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution and contained two protomers in the asymmetric unit. An anisotropic smoothed σ cutoff procedure was used (see “Experimental Procedures”) when this helped in promoting the convergence of the refinement. Although the average B-values remain relatively high, all residues are well defined in protomer A, except for the loop containing residues 148–157, whereas in the B protomer residues 148–161 and residues 228–245 were poorly defined. The structure of YegS reveals a two-domain protein with the active site crevice found between the two domains (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal domain is formed by residues 5–124 and 286–301 and comprises five α-helices (α1–α5) and six β-strands (β1–β5 and β19). This domain resembles the Rossmann fold nucleotide binding motif (33Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (residues 125–285) contains 13 β-strands (β6–β18) and two α-helices (α6 and α7). Data were also collected from crystals co-crystallized with ADP and the substrate analogue glycerol-3-phosphate to 2.5 Å resolution. In the resulting density from these crystals, only the ligand density for the pyrophosphate moiety and some minor residual density are observed, and neither the ribose, adenosine ring of the ADP, nor the glycerol-3-phosphate is visible in the electron density. Although the density clearly reveals a pyrophosphate moiety, the high B-values in the refinement (∼100) might indicate that it is not fully occupied. The pyrophosphate moiety is found in close proximity to the crevice between the two domains that constitutes the active site. YegS shows the closest structural similarity to the fold recently described in NAD kinases (34Garavaglia S. Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Magni G. Rizzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40980-40986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Mori S. Yamasaki M. Maruyama Y. Momma K. Kawai S. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys.

Biol. 2005; 354: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Superposition of the structure of each of the N- and C-terminal domains of YegS with NAD kinase shows a root mean square deviation of 2.6 Å (109 residues to 1Z0S) and 2.7 Å (115 residues to 2AN1), respectively. The superposition of the entire proteins gives a significantly higher root mean square distance because the two domains display slightly different orientation to each other in the two proteins (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal domain of YegS also shows good structural superposition with the N-terminal domain of PFK (37Shirakihara Y. Evans P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A signature GGDG motif of the PFK family is also present in YegS (GGDGT in YegS), as well as in NAD kinase, and superimposes well in the structures. This motif has been implicated by structural and mutagenesis studies to be essential for the phosphoryl transfer reaction in the PFK family (38Hellinga H.W. Evans P.R. Nature. 1987; 327: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and more recently in the NAD kinase structure from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (36Liu J. Lou Y. Yokota H. Adams P.D. Kim R. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, a detailed understanding of how this motif promotes the reaction has been elusive. A DALI (39Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) search using the N-terminal domain of YegS found a large number of significant hits to Rossmann fold-containing proteins involved in nucleotide and dinucleotide interactions. Searching with the C-terminal domain found, in addition to NAD kinase, only the structure of Vp4, a sialic acid binding domain from rhesus rotavirus (40Dormitzer P.R. Sun Z.Y. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, Vp4 does not contain a Rossmann fold nucleotide binding domain. Therefore, YegS and NAD kinases appear to represent a unique subgroup of the Rossmann fold kinases and are structurally distinct from the PFK family. The similarity of the C-terminal domain to that of NAD kinases is especially apparent in the core β-sandwich of this domain (Fig. 2B). In contrast, large deviations in structure between YegS and NAD kinases are noticeable in the region corresponding to the NAD binding site. YegS has a loop protruding into the region where the NAD/NADP binding site is found in NAD kinase (residues 203–204). Furthermore, the secondary structural elements α6, α7, β7, and β8 of YegS do not have corresponding elements in NAD kinase, and this region is likely to constitute the substrate binding region of the lipid kinases. The structure of YegS underlines the importance of four signature sequence motifs constituting the active site crevice, three in the N-terminal domain and one in the C-terminal domain highly conserved in both bacterial and eukaryotic lipid kinases (2Abe T. Lu X. Jiang Y. Boccone C.E. Qian S. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Walsh J.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 673-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The motifs in the N-terminal domain are NXKS (residues 12–15 and X represents any amino acid), GGDG (residues 65–69 also present in NAD kinases and PFK) and LPLGTXNDXA (residues 91–100), which we label the T-motif. All three motifs are found to make interactions to the bound pyrophosphate in the ADP co-crystallized structure (Fig. 3). The importance of the GGDG motif for the mammalian lipid kinases has been demonstrated by several mutagenesis studies (2Abe T. Lu X. Jiang Y. Boccone C.E. Qian S. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Walsh J.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 673-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the YegS structure, the GGDG motif is found at the beginning of the third α-helix, and the amino groups of the helix termini (Gly-66 and Gly-68) directly coordinate the pyrophosphate moiety. The aspartic acid (Asp-67) is not directly involved in phosphate binding but instead is found some 6 Å from the closest phosphate moiety. Instead, it makes hydrogen bonds to main chain amide groups of two residues of the T-motif (Asp-98 and Phe-99). This interaction anchors the end of a very flexible loop, which in A. fulgidus NAD kinase (1Z0S) contains a GXXG motif conserved in the NAD kinases and involved in coordinating phosphate groups of a bound pyrophosphate moiety. The similar positioning of the pyrophosphate moieties in A. fulgidus NAD kinase, as in YegS, supports the assignment of the density in YegS as pyrophosphate. In YegS this loop contains Thr-95, which makes a hydrogen bond to the pyrophosphate molecule. The threonine following the GGDG motif (Thr-69) also makes a hydrogen bond to the pyrophosphate molecule. A threonine in the corresponding position is highly conserved in the NAD kinase family (36Liu J. Lou Y. Yokota H. Adams P.D. Kim R. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The conserved Asn-12 and Lys-14 of the NXKS motif are positioned at the end of strand β1, and the N terminus of α1 is in close proximity to the pyrophosphate binding site. Asn-12 directly coordinates the pyrophosphate, whereas Lys-14 is positioned so it could potentially provide a ligand to a phosphate moiety, but in the pyrophosphate-bound structure it is not within hydrogen bonding distance. In the pyrophosphate-bound NAD kinase structure from A. fulgidus (1Z0S), Lys-8 is in the same position a"

Since the five Lol proteins involved in the sorting of E. coli lipoproteins are conserved in P. aeruginosa, we examined whether or not the Lol proteins of P. aeruginosa are also involved in lipoprotein sorting but utilize different signals. The genes encoding LolCDE, LolA, and LolB homologues were cloned and expressed. The LolCDE homologue thus purified was reconstituted into proteoliposomes with lipoproteins. When incubated in the presence of ATP and a LolA homologue, the reconstituted LolCDE homologue released lipoproteins, leading to the formation of a LolA-lipoprotein complex. Lipoproteins were then incorporated into the outer membrane depending on a LolB homologue. As revealed in vivo, lipoproteins with Lys and Ser at positions 3 and 4, respectively, remained in proteoliposomes. On the other hand, E. coli LolCDE released lipoproteins with this signal and transferred them to LolA of not only E. coli but also P. aeruginosa. These results indicate that Lol proteins are responsible for the sorting of lipoproteins to the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa, as in the case of E. coli, but respond differently to inner membrane retention signals.

Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the Asp residue at position 2 causes the retention of lipoproteins in the inner membrane, whereas other residues cause their outer membrane localization (2Yamaguchi K. Yu F.

Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) composed of five proteins, LolA through LolE. An ATP-binding cassette transporter LolCDE complex recognizes a newly synthesized outer membrane-directed lipoprotein on the periplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane and mediates the detachment of lipoproteins from the inner membrane in the presence of a periplasmic carrier protein, LolA. LolA forms a soluble complex with one molecule of lipoprotein and traverses the periplasmic space to reach a lipoprotein-specific outer membrane receptor, LolB. LolB, itself an outer membrane lipoprotein, receives a lipoprotein from LolA and then incorporates it into the outer membrane. The role of Asp at position 2 in the lipoprotein sorting has been extensively studied, and it has been revealed that the Asp residue functions as a LolCDE avoidance signal because LolCDE does not recognize lipoproteins with Asp at position 2 (6Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found that both the negative charge of the Asp residue and the positive charge of phosphatidylethanolamine are critical for the LolCDE avoidance (7Hara T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40408-40414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was also found that LolCDE releases lipoproteins without recognizing the residue at position 2. Lipoprotein sorting signals have been comprehensively characterized in E. coli (2Yamaguchi K. Yu F.

Chem. 2006; 282: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that lipoproteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sorted according to the residues at positions 3 and 4. Here, we show that the five Lol proteins are responsible for the sorting of lipoproteins to the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa, as in the case of E. coli lipoproteins. Moreover, it is also shown that differences in lipoprotein sorting signals between E. coli and P. aeruginosa reflect differences in the properties of LolCDE. Materials—n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) 2The abbreviations used are: DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. and sucrose monocaprate were purchased from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). E. coli phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids and washed with acetone as reported (10Tokuda H. Shiozuka K. Mizushima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Primers, and Media—The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables 1–3. P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 was a generous gift from Dr. Taiji Nakae (Tokai University). Bacteria were grown on LB medium (11Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). When required, carbenicillin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol were added at concentrations of 100, 50, and 35 μg/ml, respectively. Cloning of lol Genes from P. aeruginosa—The gene for His-tagged LolA was amplified from P. aeruginosa TNP072 (12Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers lolA-Pae-1 and lolA-Pae-His-5 and then cloned into the EcoRI-SphI sites of pMAN885EH (13Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to construct pPLOLA-His. pUCP-PLOLA-His was constructed by partial digestion of pPLOLA-His with EcoRI and HindIII followed by subcloning into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pUCP20. The lolB gene was amplified from TNP072 by PCR using primers lolB-Pae-1 and lolB-Pae-2 and cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pMAN885EH to construct pPLOLB. pPLOLB2 was constructed by subcloning the lolB gene from pPLOLB into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pTTQ18 (14Stark M.J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding LolC, LolD, and LolE was amplified from TNP072 by PCR using primers lolC-Pae-1 and lolE-Pae-2 and then cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pMAN885EH to construct pPLOLCDE. An oligonucleotide encoding hexahistidine was inserted into the 3′-terminus of the lolD gene by PCR using primers Pae-lolD-His-f and Pae-lolD-His-r to construct pPLOLCDHE. Since expression of LolE from pPLOLCDHE was inefficient, a plasmid expressing LolE was constructed. A DNA fragment encoding LolE was amplified from TNP072 by PCR using primers lolE-Pae-1 and lolE-Pae-2 and then cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pTTQ18. A 1.3-kb fragment corresponding to the lolE gene was removed from pPLOLCDHE by digestion with StuI and HindIII, followed by self-ligation, to construct pPLOLCDH. Construction of Plasmids Encoding Pal Derivatives—Plasmid pTAN21KS was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pTAN21 (15Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with primers Pal(SKS)-1 and Pal(SKS)-2. pTAN21LI was constructed in the same way with primers Pal(SLI)-1 and Pal(SLI)-2. Purification of LolA—P. aeruginosa PAO1 was transformed with pUCP-PLOLA-His encoding His-tagged PaLolA and then grown on LB at 37 °C. When the OD at 660 nm reached 0.2, expression of PaLolA was induced with 2 mm IPTG followed by cultivation for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested, suspended in a buffer comprising 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 200 mm MgCl2, and then subjected to cold-shock treatment by repeated incubation of the cell suspension alternately at 37 and 0 °C three times (16Akama H.

The cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain a soluble periplasmic fraction.

Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), His-tagged PaLolA in the periplasmic fraction was adsorbed to TALON resin (Clontech) and then eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. The eluate containing PaLolA was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). EcLolA was purified from E. coli TT015 (17Tajima T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) transformed with pAM201 (18Miyamoto A. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A spheroplast supernatant was prepared as described previously (19Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and His-tagged EcLolA was purified using TALON resin as described for PaLolA. Purification of the LolCDE Complex—To purify the PaLolCDE complex containing His-tagged LolD, E. coli JM83 (20Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar) was transformed with pPLOLCDH and pPLOLE and then grown on LB at 30 °C. When the OD at 660 nm reached 0.8, LolC, LolD-His, and LolE were induced with 0.2% arabinose and 20 μm IPTG followed by cultivation for an additional 2 h. A total membrane fraction was prepared after disruption of cells with a French pressure cell and then solubilized on ice for 30 min with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1% DDM, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm ATP followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The PaLolCDE complex in the supernatant was adsorbed to TALON resin, which had been equilibrated with the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, and then developed with a linear gradient of imidazole (10–250 mm). PaLolCDE was eluted at ∼60 mm imidazole and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.01% DDM, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm ATP. The EcLolCDE complex containing His-tagged LolD was overproduced in JM83 harboring pKM301 and pKM402 (6Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and purified with TALON resin in the presence of 2 mm ATP as reported previously (21Ito Y. Kanamaru K. Taniguchi N. Miyamoto S.

(Tokyo). 1979; 86: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). His-tagged MexA was expressed in JM83 carrying pUCP-MEXA-His (9Narita S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total membrane fractions were solubilized on ice for 30 min with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2% sucrose monocaprate followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. MexA in each supernatant was adsorbed to TALON resin, which had been equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2% sucrose monocaprate, and then developed with a linear gradient of imidazole (0–250 mm). MexA was eluted at ∼50 mm imidazole and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 2% sucrose monocaprate. Release of Lipoproteins from Proteoliposomes—EcLolCDE (1 μg) or PaLolCDE (5 μg) was incubated for 1 min on ice with 0.8 mg of E. coli phospholipids and 2 μg of lipoproteins in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 1.2% sucrose monocaprate. The mixture was diluted with 900 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 100 mm NaCl and then dialyzed against 2,000 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C overnight. Reconstituted proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C and then subjected to the lipoprotein release assay at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of 4 μg of LolA and 2 mm ATP as reported previously (25Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Where specified, sodium orthovanadate was added to the reaction mixture at 5 mm. The reaction mixtures were fractionated into proteoliposomes and supernatants by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. Lipoproteins in the precipitates and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 1/50 of the precipitated material, and ⅓ of the supernatant material was applied to the gel. LolB-dependent Incorporation of Lipoproteins into Membranes—LolB-depleted outer membranes were prepared from E. coli KT60 (ΔlolB) harboring pYKT123, which encodes a soluble periplasmic variant of LolB. 3J. Tsukahara, R. Tsurumizu, S. Narita, and H. Tokuda, manuscript in preparation. PaLolB-containing outer membranes were prepared from KT60 harboring pYKT123 and pPLOLB2 encoding PaLolB. The outer membrane fractions containing PaLolB were diluted 18-fold with the LolB-depleted outer membrane fraction to give the same amount of PaLolB as that of EcLolB in the outer membrane fraction prepared from E. coli JC7752. Pal-LolA complexes were prepared by means of release assays performed with proteoliposomes and mixed with specified outer membrane fractions followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The precipitate and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-His antiserum. ATPase Activity Assay—ATP hydrolysis by proteoliposomes reconstituted with EcLolCDE or PaLolCDE was determined as described previously (6Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amounts of inorganic phosphate were determined according to the reported method (26Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Other Techniques—SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (19Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Anti-His tag antiserum was raised in rabbits against purified hexahistidine-tagged RpmJ protein (28Ikegami A. Nishiyama K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Anti-Pal (29Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) antiserum was raised in rabbits against the purified protein. Cloning and Purification of Lol Proteins from P. aeruginosa—To examine the sorting mechanism for P. aeruginosa lipoproteins in vitro, we cloned the genes for the Lol proteins of this bacterium. The PA2614 locus encodes a P. aeruginosa LolA homologue (PaLolA) comprising 208 amino acids, which contains the N-terminal signal peptide and the mature region. PaLolA exhibits 34% sequence identity with E. coli LolA. The gene encoding PaLolA was engineered to have a His tag at the C terminus and then cloned into P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells. PaLolA was then purified to homogeneity from the periplasm by metal affinity chromatography for His-tagged proteins (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was DDSAAVQRLT, indicating that the signal peptide was cleaved after the residue at position 21 of the PaLolA precursor. The PA2988, PA2987, and PA2986 loci constitute a possible transcriptional unit and encode proteins homologous to E. coli LolC, LolD, and LolE, the sequence identities being 38, 61, and 37%, respectively. The three proteins are hereafter referred to as PaLolC, PaLolD, and PaLolE. The chromosomal region encoding PaLolC and PaLolD was cloned into a plasmid under the araBAD promoter. A sequence was added to express PaLolD with a His tag at the C terminus. The region encoding PaLolE was cloned into another plasmid under the tac promoter. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli JM83, and then expression of PaLolC, PaLolD-His, and PaLolE was induced by the addition of arabinose and IPTG. PaLolC and PaLolE were co-purified with His-tagged PaLolD by metal affinity chromatography from membranes solubilized with DDM, indicating that these proteins form a complex as in the case of the E. coli LolCDE complex (25Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the subunit composition of the purified complex varied with the concentration of IPTG that was added to induce PaLolE (Fig. 1B). When cells were grown in the presence of 0.2% arabinose with no IPTG, PaLolC was co-purified with PaLolD-His, indicating that the two proteins directly interact with each other. In contrast, when 1 mm IPTG was added in the presence of 0.2% arabinose, only PaLolE was co-purified with PaLolD-His, although PaLolC was expressed, suggesting that excess PaLolE excluded PaLolC from the complex. The LolCDE complex of E. coli is composed of one molecule each of LolC and LolE and two copies of LolD (25Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The PaLolCDE complex with the same subunit stoichiometry was purified from cells grown in the presence of 0.2% arabinose and 20 μm IPTG (Fig. 1B). Since both PaLolC and PaLolE were required for the reconstituted activity (see below), the PaLolCDE complex was overproduced in the presence of 0.2% arabinose and 20 μm IPTG. PaLolCDE and E. coli LolCDE (EcLolCDE) were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1C) and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes with E. coli phospholipids, whose compositions were essentially the same as those in P. aeruginosa (data not shown). PaLolCDE exhibited ATPase activity, 4.0 mol of ATP hydrolyzed/mol/min, that was sensitive to orthovanadate. On the other hand, the activity of EcLolCDE (11.6 mol of ATP hydrolyzed/mol/min) was 3-fold higher than that of PaLolCDE (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2ATPase activity of the P. aeruginosa LolCDE complex. ATP hydrolysis by proteoliposomes reconstituted with 20 μg each of EcLolCDE (left panel) and PaLolCDE (right panel) was examined in the presence (open squares) or absence (filled squares) of 5 mm orthovanadate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reconstitution of the Lipoprotein-releasing Apparatus of P. aeruginosa—To examine the lipoprotein-releasing activity, PaLolCDE or EcLolCDE was reconstituted into proteoliposomes together with E. coli outer membrane lipoprotein Pal followed by incubation with either PaLolA or EcLolA. The efficiency of lipoprotein release from proteoliposomes is generally low because the orientation of the reconstituted proteins is random, which leaves a major fraction of lipoproteins incompetent as to release (6Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, reconstitution of LolCDE revealed important aspects of the lipoprotein release reaction (6Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Hara T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40408-40414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Ito Y. Kanamaru K. Taniguchi N. Miyamoto S. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, PaLolCDE released Pal from proteoliposomes in the presence of PaLolA in orthovanadate-sensitive and ATP-dependent manners, indicating that PaLolCDE and PaLolA are functional homologues of the respective E. coli Lol proteins. The amount of PaLolCDE required to detect the Pal release was 5-fold higher than that of EcLolCDE. EcLolCDE released Pal in the presence of not only EcLolA but also PaLolA, whereas PaLolCDE only released Pal in the presence of PaLolA. It is not clear at present whether this difference is caused by more specific subunit interaction of PaLol proteins or simply by lower activity of PaLolCDE. It has been shown in E. coli that a water-soluble complex formed between LolA and a lipoprotein released by LolCDE represents the physiological intermediate of the lipoprotein release reaction (5Narita S. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LolA efficiently transports hydrophobic lipoproteins through the hydrophilic periplasm to LolB on the outer membrane, and then LolB incorporates lipoproteins into the outer membrane. We next examined the outer membrane incorporation of Pal released by PaLolCDE in the presence of PaLolA. P. aeruginosa chromosomal locus PA4668 encodes a putative outer membrane lipoprotein exhibiting 27% amino acid identity to E. coli LolB (EcLolB). This LolB homologue of P. aeruginosa (PaLolB) was overexpressed in the E. coli ΔlolB strain, and an outer membrane fraction was prepared. When the supernatant obtained after the release reaction performed with PaLolCDE and PaLolA was mixed with the outer membrane fraction containing PaLolB, Pal was recovered in the membrane fraction, whereas PaLolA remained in the supernatant (Fig. 3B), indicating that Pal was transferred from the Pal-PaLolA complex to the outer membrane containing PaLolB. In contrast, Pal remained in the supernatant together with PaLolA when the outer membrane containing EcLolB was used. In contrast to the heterologous release reaction with EcLolCDE and PaLolA (Fig. 3A), EcLolA did not transfer Pal to PaLolB, suggesting that the specificity of the interaction between LolA and LolB is strict. Taken together, these results establish that the PaLol system mediates the transfer of lipoproteins from the inner to the outer membrane. Neither the PaLolC/D complex nor the PaLolD/E complex purified in the absence and presence of IPTG, respectively (Fig. 4A), supported PaLolA-dependent release of Pal from proteoliposomes (Fig. 4B). Thus, both PaLolC and PaLolE are required for the lipoprotein-releasing activity. Sorting of Lipoproteins by the PaLolCDE Complex—To determine in vitro whether or not the residues at positions 3 and 4 function as sorting signals for P. aeruginosa lipoproteins, PaLolCDE was reconstituted into proteoliposomes together with Pal derivatives having various combinations of residues at positions 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 5A) followed by release assays with PaLolA. When EcLolCDE and EcLolA were used as controls, not only Pal(SLI) but also Pal(SKS) was released (Fig. 5B), confirming that Ser2 does not retain lipoproteins in the inner membrane of E. coli. In marked contrast, when PaLolCDE and PaLolA were used, Pal(SLI) was released, whereas Pal(SKS) was not (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we also examined the release of MexA and found that it was released by the EcLol system but not the PaLol system. These results agree well with the in vivo localization of MexA in E. coli and P. aeruginosa (10Tokuda H. Shiozuka K. Mizushima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is therefore clear that the residues at positions 3 and 4 function as lipoprotein sorting signals in P. aeruginosa but not in E. coli. It is concluded that the PaLol system functions to localize lipoproteins to the outer membrane as the EcLol system does but that their sorting mechanisms are not identical. Although the residues at positions 3 and 4 determine the membrane specificity of lipoproteins in P. aeruginosa both in vivo and in vitro, Asp at position 2 also functions as an inner membrane retention signal in vivo (9Narita S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistent with the in vivo results, Pal(DSN) having Asp at position 2 remained in proteoliposomes reconstituted with not only EcLolCDE but also PaLolCDE (Fig. 5B), indicating that Asp at position 2 is the common inner membrane retention signal. The release of Pal(SLI) by PaLolCDE appeared to be more efficient than that of Pal. However, Pal(DLI) still remained in proteoliposomes reconstituted with PaLolCDE (data not shown), suggesting that Leu3-Ile4 does not abolish the inner membrane retention function of Asp at position 2. Taking advantage of the heterologous release reaction involving EcLolCDE and PaLolA, we examined whether or not PaLolA distinguishes lipoprotein sorting signals. For this, proteoliposomes were reconstituted with EcLolCDE and Pal or one of its derivatives, Pal(DSN), Pal(SKS), or Pal(SLI), followed by the release assay in the presence of PaLolA. As shown in Fig. 5C, only Pal(DSN) remained in proteoliposomes, the other Pal derivatives including Pal(SKS) being released from proteoliposomes in a PaLolA-dependent manner, indicating that the lipoprotein sorting signals of the 3rd and 4th residues of P. aeruginosa lipoproteins only function against PaLolCDE, i.e. not PaLolA. The lipoprotein sorting signals examined in vitro using purified Lol proteins revealed that both Asp2 and Lys3-Ser4 function as inner membrane retention signals for the PaLol system. In contrast, Lys3-Ser4 did not function as an inner membrane retention signal for the EcLol system. These lipoprotein sorting signals were found to only function against LolCDE, i.e. not LolA (Fig. 5C). Because E. coli phospholipids were used to reconstitute both PaLolCDE and EcLolCDE, differences in the properties of membrane phospholipids between the two bacteria, if any, cannot account for the differences in the sorting signals. Instead, the different properties of the two LolCDE complexes most likely caused the differences in the sorting signals. It has been found in E. coli that phosphatidylethanolamine is critically important for the LolCDE avoidance function of Asp2 (7Hara T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40408-40414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins having Asp2 were therefore released from proteoliposomes reconstituted with EcLolCDE and cardiolipin alone. However, our preliminary experiments revealed that PaLolCDE did not release lipoproteins with Asp2 or Lys3-Ser4 even when proteoliposomes were reconstituted with cardiolipin alone. 4S. Tanaka, S. Narita, and H. Tokuda, unpublished observation. Therefore, it remains to be determined how Asp2 functions as an inner membrane retention signal for PaLolCDE. The release of one outer membrane-specific lipoprotein by EcLolCDE was competitively inhibited by an excess amount of another outer membrane-specific, but not inner membrane-specific, lipoprotein. The ATPase activity of EcLolCDE was stimulated by outer membrane-specific, but not inner membrane-specific, lipoproteins. These results indicated that inner membrane-specific lipoproteins with Asp2 do not act as substrates for EcLolCDE (6Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because of the technical difficulty in reconstituting proteoliposomes with PaLolCDE and a large amount of lipoproteins, we do not know whether or not inner membrane signals Asp2 and Lys3-Ser4 function as PaLolCDE avoidance signals. The membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent was inaccessible to Cys introduced to position 2 of lipoproteins, whereas it was accessible to Cys at positions 3 and 4 (7Hara T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40408-40414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It seems therefore likely that Asp2 and Lys3-Ser4 cause the retention of lipoproteins through different mechanisms. The periplasmic loops of PaLolC and/or PaLolE may be involved in the recognition of the retention signals at positions 3 and 4 of lipoproteins, whereas phospholipids may play an important role in the retention of lipoproteins with Asp2. Asp2 is generally found in the inner membrane lipoproteins of E. coli, whereas the residues at positions 3 and 4 of P. aeruginosa inner membrane lipoproteins vary (9Narita S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, Glu3-Ala4 of MexX, a paralogue of MexA, also function as an inner membrane retention signal (9Narita S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We speculate that the secondary structure formed by these residues functions as a lipoprotein sorting signal. We convincingly showed here that the PaLol system is involved in the lipoprotein sorting to the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa, as the EcLol system is. Five Lol proteins are highly conserved in the γ-proteobacteria including E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Moreover, other classes of proteobacteria also possess Lol proteins, although the gene for LolE is missing (5Narita S. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these cases, the lipoprotein-releasing ATP-binding cassette transporters are probably composed of a homodimer of the LolC-LolD heterodimer. α-Proteobacteria apparently lack a gene for LolB, although they possess ones for LolCD and LolA. The outer membrane lipoproteins of these bacteria may be released from the inner membrane through a mechanism homologous to those in E. coli and P. aeruginosa but may be incorporated into the outer membrane through a different mechanism. It is not known whether or not lipoprotein sorting to the outer membrane in other Gram-negative bacteria is mediated by the Lol system. A recent report suggested that the sorting of Borrelia spirochaete lipoproteins to the outer surface of the outer membrane is mediated by a system other than the Lol system (30Schulze R.J. Zückert W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lipoprotein sorting signals used in this bacterium are likely to be different from those used in E. coli and P. aeruginosa.

Crystallographic studies of hairpin ribozymes have provided high resolution views of the RNA functional groups that comprise the active site and stimulated biochemical studies that probed the contributions of nucleobase functional groups to catalytic chemistry. The dramatic loss of activity that results from perturbation of active site architecture points to the importance of positioning and orientation in catalytic rate acceleration. The current study focuses on the network of noncovalent interactions that align nucleophilic and leaving group oxygens in the orientation required for the SN2-type reaction mechanism and orient the active site nucleobases near the reactive phosphate to facilitate catalytic chemistry. Nucleotide modifications that alter or eliminate individual hydrogen bonding partners had different effects on the activation barrier to catalysis, the stability of ribozyme complexes in the ground state, and the internal equilibrium between cleavage and ligation of bound products. Furthermore, substitution of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors with seemingly equivalent pairs sometimes had very different functional consequences.

These biochemical analyses augment high resolution structural information to provide insights into the functional significance of active site architecture. The well-characterized structure of the hairpin ribozyme offers a valuable framework for investigating the contributions of individual active site interactions to the activation barrier to catalysis and to the stability of ribozyme complexes in the ground state. The hairpin ribozyme catalyzes a reversible self-cleavage reaction in which nucleophilic attack of a ribose 2′-hydroxyl on an adjacent phosphorus proceeds through a trigonal bipyramidal transition state that leads to the formation of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini (1Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). High resolution crystal structures have been solved for hairpin ribozymes in complexes with a noncleavable substrate analog, cleavage products and a vanadate mimic of the trigonal bipyramidal transition state, making this ribozyme the subject of more detailed structural analyses than virtually any other catalytic RNA (2Rupert P.B.

Tritz R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4929-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). High resolution structures reveal a network of stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions within the active site that align the reactive phosphate in the appropriate orientation for an SN2-type nucleophilic attack mechanism and orient nucleotide base functional groups near the reactive phosphate to facilitate catalytic chemistry (Fig. 1). G+1 is the conserved nucleotide on the 3′-side of the reactive phosphodiester in loop A (Fig. 2). Tertiary interactions between G+1 and nucleotides in loop B define the architecture of the active site (2Rupert P.B. Ferré-D’Amaré A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 8Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Guanine at the +1 position has no direct contact with the reactive phosphodiester but loss of this nucleobase virtually eliminates catalytic activity, highlighting the significant contribution of active site architecture to catalytic rate enhancement (8Pinard R.

Positioning and orientation also play critical roles in the internal equilibrium between cleavage and ligation of bound products. Interdomain junction modifications and changes in reaction conditions that destabilize ribozyme tertiary structures shift the internal equilibrium toward cleavage (13Nesbitt S.M. Erlacher H.A. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1009-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Donahue C.P.

Biol. 2001; 309: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The relationship between tertiary structure stability and the internal equilibrium is consistent with the idea that ligation requires a rigid ribozyme structure to align the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini, while these reactive groups are fixed by the diester linkage in a cleavage substrate. Biochemical studies have shown that interactions that seem to be equivalent in hairpin ribozyme crystal structures can make very different energetic contributions. For example, the N6 exocyclic amines of A9 and A38 both appear to donate hydrogen bonds to the same proRP nonbridging oxygen of the reactive phosphate (3Rupert P.B. Massey A.P. Sigurdsson S.T. Ferré-D’Amaré A.R. Science. 2002; 298: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), but substitution of adenine with purine at position 38 inhibits cleavage activity more than 103 fold (17Kuzmin Y.I. DaCosta C.P. Cottrell J. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 989-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) while complete elimination of adenine at position 9 through an abasic substitution reduces cleavage activity just 4-fold (18Kuzmin Y.I. Da Costa C.P. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The dramatic difference in the functional significance of two seemingly identical interactions illustrates the need for direct analyses of structure-function relationships that might be inferred from crystal structures. Minimal hairpin ribozymes, in which the A and B domains are joined by a two-way helical junction, partition almost equally between an inactive, extended conformation and a functional structure that juxtaposes loops A and B to create the active site (19Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Millar D.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Extensive structure-function studies of minimal hairpin ribozymes have been reported previously (1Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, it is now understood that most modifications that disable minimal ribozymes do so by shifting the conformational equilibrium further toward the inactive, extended structure (19Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Millar D.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Walter N.G. Hampel K.J. Brown K.M. Burke J.M.

In viral satellite RNAs, the A and B domains comprise two arms of a four-way helical junction (7Hampel A. Tritz R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4929-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 22Murchie A.I. Thomson J.B. Walter F. Lilley D.M. Mol.

Restoring this natural junction stabilizes the docked structure and ribozymes with a four-way junction retain activity despite unfavorable reaction conditions and loss of individual tertiary interactions (14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Yadava R.S. Choi A.J. Lebruska L.L. Fedor M.J. J. Mol.

This discovery makes it possible to examine the effects of nucleotide modifications in the context of the native folded structure. We report a systematic analysis of the active site architecture of a four-way junction ribozyme aimed at comparing the energetic consequences of functional group modifications on the stability of ribozyme complexes in the ground state, the activation barrier to catalysis, and the internal equilibrium between cleavage and ligation of bound products. RNA Preparation—RNAs were prepared by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of linearized plasmid templates or by chemical synthesis (Fig. 2 and Table 1) (Dharmacon), as described previously (12Lebruska L.L. Kuzmine I.I. Fedor M.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 465-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ligated ribozyme LR43 3The abbreviations used are: LR, ligated ribozyme; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; 5′R, 5′ product of ribozyme cleavage; 3′P, 3′ product of ribozyme cleavage; Pu, purine; I, inosine; mG, 2′-O-methyl guanosine; 2AP, 2-aminopurine; dX, abasic deoxynucleotide; PDB, Protein Data Bank. is a self-cleaving ribozyme that assembles in the context of a four-way helical junction and has three base pairs in the intermolecular helix, H1, that forms between the 5′ and 3′ cleavage product RNAs (Fig. 2A). 5′R4 RNA was obtained from LR43 self-cleavage during bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase transcription of the pTLR43 template. 5′R4 was combined with 3′P3 RNAs obtained through chemical synthesis to measure cleavage kinetics through ligation-chase assays, as described below. LR46 and LR47 variants are four-way junction ribozymes with six or seven base pairs in H1, respectively, which were produced by ligation of 5′R4, the 5′ product of LR43 self-cleavage, and 3′P6 or 3′P7 RNAs obtained through chemical synthesis (Fig. 2B). LR46 and LR47 variants were used to measure ligation kinetics and equilibrium dissociation constants for 5′R4·3′P complexes. The pTLR43G+1A,C25U plasmid template encodes the LR43G+1A,C25U self-cleaving ribozyme variant, and was derived from pTLR43 by using QuikChange mutagenesis to replace the guanine at position +1 with adenine and the cytosine at position 25 with uridine. Self-cleavage of the LR43G+1A,C25U ribozyme variant produces 5′R4C25U and 3′P3G+1A product RNAs. The ribozyme RNA, R4, and substrate RNA, S43, which were used for intermolecular cleavage reactions (14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), were prepared through T7 RNA polymerase transcription of the pTR4 plasmid template and through chemical synthesis, respectively.TABLE 1Synthetic oligoribonucleotidesAB(3′GA3)G4A5′-CAAGAUGAGAAGCCAACCAGAGAAACACAAGCGAAA-3′LR43ΔAΔB(5′GA3)C+6U5′-CGAAAGGUCGUGGUGGGAAACCACCUGGCAGUCCAUAGAUC-3′BdA385′-AGCUUGGUdAUAUUACCUGGUACGAC-3′BA38dX5′-AGCUUGGUXUAUUACCUGGUACGAC-3′ (X = abasic deoxynucleotide)BA38Pu5′-AGCUUGGUPuUAUUACCUGGUACGAC-3′ (Pu = purine)BG36I5′-AGCUUGIUAUAUUACCUGGUACGAC-3′ (I = inosine)S435′-CCCACCUGGCAGUCCAC-3′S44G+1Pu5′-CCCACCUGGCAPuUCCACC-3′ (Pu = purine)S44G+1A5′-CCCACCUGGCAAUCCACC-3′3′P6C+6U5′-GUCCAUCUU-3′3′P6C+6U, dG+15′-dGUCCAUCUU-3′3′P6C+6U, mG+15′-mGUCCAUCUU-3′ (mG = 2′-OMe guanosine)3′P6C+6U, G+1I5′-IUCCAUCUU-3′ (I = inosine)3′P6C+6U, G+1(2AP)5′-(2AP) UCCAUCUU-3′ (2AP = 2-aminopurine)3′P6C+6U, G+1Pu5′-PuUCCAUCUU-3′ (Pu = purine)3′P6C+6U, G+1A5′-AUCCAUCUU-3′3′P6C+6U, ΔG+15′-UCCAUCUU-3′3′P7C+6U(3′G), G+1Pu5′-PuUCCAUCUUGG-3′ (Pu = purine)3′P7C+6U, G+1A5′-AUCCAUCUUGG-3′3′P7C+6U, ΔG+15′-UCCAUCUUGG-3′3′P3C+6U5′-GUCCAUAGAUCC-3′3′P3C+6U, dG+15′-dGUCCAUAG-3′3′P3C+6U, mG+15′-mGUCCAUAG-3′ (mG = 2′-OMe guanosine)3′P3C+6U, G+1A5′-AUCCAUAG-3′3′P3C+6U, G+1(2AP)5′-(2AP) UCCAU-3′ (2AP = 2-aminopurine)3′P3C+6U, G+1I5′-IUCCAU-3′ (I = inosine) Open table in a new tab Ribozymes with modifications at positions 36 and 38 were prepared through ligation of synthetic RNAs (Table 1 and Fig. 2C). First, LR43ΔAΔB(5′GA3)C+6U and B were phosphorylated in reactions with 1 nmol of oligonucleotide, 2 nmol of ATP, and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in a final volume of 5 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the kinase was inactivated at 90 °C for 2 min. Next, stoichiometric amounts of LR43ΔAΔB(5′GA3)C+6U, B and AB(3′GA3)G4A RNAs were annealed in T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (NEB) by heating to 85 °C for 1 min and cooling to 30 °C over 4 min. Incubation at 30 °C for an additional 20–40 min led to nearly complete cleavage of LR43ΔAΔB(5′GA3)C+6U for oligonucleotides with noninhibitory modifications of A38 and G36, producing a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate terminus. Ribozymes with inhibitory modifications (A38dX) were induced to cleave by adding 20 mm isocytosine to the reaction and extending incubation times to 4 h (17Kuzmin Y.I. DaCosta C.P. Cottrell J. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 989-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Kuzmin Y.I. Da Costa C.P. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Covalent joining of ribozyme fragments was accomplished by adding 1 mm ATP and 20 units T4 RNA ligase and incubating overnight at 17 °C, followed by heat inactivation of the ligase at 90 °C for 2 min. Full-length ribozyme products were fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, eluted, and prepared as sodium salts using DEAE ion exchange chromatography as described previously (14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with a typical yield of 120 pmol of ribozyme per 1 nmol of each of the three oligonucleotide components. Chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides that correspond to the 3′ product of ribozyme cleavage was used to introduce modifications at the G+1 position. Abasic substitutions were introduced as deoxynucleotides because abasic ribonucleotides are not yet available commercially. 3′ Product RNAs were labeled at the 3′ terminus by 32pCp ligation (24England T.E. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, 75 pmol of cytosine monophosphate (Cp) was combined with 25 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol) and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 °C to produce 32pCp. Following heat inactivation of the kinase, the mixture was added to a solution containing 12.5 pmol of 3′ product RNA, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 mm ATP, polynucleotide kinase buffer, and 2 units of T4 RNA ligase and incubated overnight at 15 °C. Products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted, then desalted by NAP column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and reduced to a volume of ∼40 μlby lyophilization. Measurement of Equilibrium Dissociation Constants—Equilibrium dissociation constants for 5′R·3′P complexes, Kd5′R⋅3′P, and values for the internal equilibrium between cleavage and ligation of bound products, Keqint, for 5′R·3′P complexes with rapid ligation kinetics were determined from the RNA concentration dependence of observed ligation rates as described (13Nesbitt S.M. Erlacher H.A. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1009-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, maximum ligation extents, FLmax, were determined from reactions with varying concentrations of 5′R and 0.1–0.25 nm of 32pCp-labeled 3′P6 or 3′P7 at 15 °C in 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaHepes pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA by computing the fit to Equation 1, FLRobs=Factive×[5′R]×FLRmax(Kd,app5′R⋅3′P+[5′R])(Eq.1) where FLRobs is the fraction of ligated ribozyme at the end of a reaction, Factive is the fraction of active ribozyme complex that is correctly folded and has the necessary 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate terminus, and Kd,app5′R⋅3′P is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the 5′R·3′P complex. FLRmaxis the maximum theoretical fraction of ligated ribozyme calculated from the equilibrium between cleavage and ligation rate constants, Keqint = klig/kcleav, according to FLRmax=Keqint(Keqint+1)=klig/(klig+kcleav). Within the same set of experiments, Factive × FLRmax remains constant so that Equation 1 reduces to Equation 2. FLRobs=[5′R]×C(Kd,app5′R⋅3′P+[5′R])(Eq.2) Kd,app5′R⋅3′P is related to the thermodynamic equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd5′R⋅3′P, according to Kd,app5′R⋅3′P=Kd5′R⋅3′P/(Keqint+1). Therefore, Kd5′R⋅3′P can be calculated from Kd,app5′R⋅3′P using Keqint values obtained from the cleavage and ligation rate constants that were measured independently, as described below. For ribozyme variants with slow ligation kinetics, equilibrium dissociation constants for 5′R·3′P complexes were determined directly from the concentration dependence of complex formation using gel shift assays, as described previously (25Hegg L.A. Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15813-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1–0.25 nm of 32pCp-labeled 3′ product RNA was incubated with varying concentrations of 5′R for 2–4 h at 15 °C in 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaHepes pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA to allow complex formation to reach equilibrium. Bound and unbound 32P-labeled 3′P were fractionated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 15% acrylamide (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5 for 12 h at 35 mA at a constant temperature of 5 °C in a vertical slab gel electrophoresis unit (Hoefer SE600). Equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated from the fit to Equation 3, where Fcomplex,obs = ([LR] + [5′R·3′P])/([LR] + [5′R·3′P] + [3′–P]. Fcomplex,obs=[5′R]×Factive(Kd5′R⋅3′P+[5′R])(Eq.3) Cleavage Kinetics Assays—Cleavage rate constants were determined at 15 °C in 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaHepes pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, the same conditions used for equilibrium binding assays, from intermolecular cleavage assays with saturating concentrations of ribozyme, as described (18Kuzmin Y.I. Da Costa C.P. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Hegg L.A. Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15813-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Fedor M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 252: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar). Ligationchase assays were used to monitor self-cleavage rates directly within a fully functional ribozyme created by self-ligation, as described (18Kuzmin Y.I. Da Costa C.P. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1–0.25 nm of 32pCp-labeled 3′P3 was combined with 5′ ribozyme RNA at a concentration approximately equal to the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for product binding and allowed to undergo ligation to yield a final fraction of ligated ribozyme of at least 20%. To maximize ligation efficiency in reactions with 5′RA38dX, exogenous isocytosine was included at a concentration of 1 mm. Ligation reactions were then diluted 40- and 80-fold into reaction buffer to initiate cleavage. Aliquots were quenched after various times, fractionated on denaturing gels and quantified by radioanalytic imaging (Molecular Dynamics). Cleavage rate constants were computed from fits to the equation FPt = FPt=∞ × (1 – ekcleavt) + FPt=0 where FP = [3′P]/([LR]+[3′P]). Each reported value represents the mean of two or more independent measurements; reported errors are standard deviations. 3′ Product RNA sequences were chosen to form an intermolecular H1 helix with a stability optimized to ensure that product binding affinity was high enough to support adequate ligation extents at experimentally accessible RNA concentrations during a ligation pulse but low enough to ensure that cleavage rates observed following a 40-fold dilution were not complicated by slow product dissociation or product re-binding and ligation. Confirmation that similar cleavage rates were observed following 40- and 80-fold dilutions ensured that no significant product rebinding and ligation occurred during the chase phase. For unmodified RNAs and modified RNAs that form stable complexes (dG+1, mG+1, dA38), we used a 3′ product RNA, 3′P3(+2), that forms an H1 helix with three base pairs. 3′P3(+2) contains a 2-nucleotide 3′ overhang so that 3′ terminal labeling with 32pCp does not affect H1 stability. For modified RNAs that form less stable complexes (G+1I, G+1(2AP), A38dX) pulse-chase experiments were carried out using 3′P3 RNA, which forms an H1 helix with four base pairs after 3′ end-labeling with 32pCp. In each case, results of experiments with different 3′P RNAs that have different binding affinities were compared to confirm that observed cleavage rates monitored the cleavage step and not slow product dissociation or re-binding and ligation of bound product. Ligation Kinetics Assays—Ligation kinetics were measured under the same conditions used for cleavage and equilibrium binding assays. 5′R, at concentrations between 500 nm and 4 μm, first was heated to 85 °C for 1′ in 50 mm NaHepes pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA then slowly cooled to 15 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. 32pCp-labeled 3′P6 (or 3′P7) was added to a final concentration of 0.1–0.25 nm to initiate ligation. Samples were removed at intervals, quenched, fractionated, and quantified as described above. Observed ligation rates were computed from fits to the equation FLRt = FLRt=∞ × (1 – eklig,obst) + FLRt=0, where FLR = [LR]/([LR]+[3′P]). Comparisons of observed ligation rates and extents in reactions with at least a 2-fold difference in 5′R concentrations confirmed that ligation rates were not limited by slow 5′R·3′P complex formation. Ligation rate constants were calculated from the difference between the cleavage rate constant obtained from pulse-chase experiments and the mean observed ligation rate, which reflects the rate of approach to equilibrium between cleavage and ligation and is the sum of ligation and cleavage rate constants, as described previously (13Nesbitt S.M.

The functional consequences of active site modifications were determined from changes in cleavage and ligation rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants for the complex formed between 5′ ribozyme and 3′ product RNAs, 5′R·3′P, as illustrated by the reaction scheme shown in Fig. 3. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters were measured at pH 7.5 in reactions with 10 mm MgCl2. These conditions are similar to those previously used for analyses of similar hairpin ribozymes (12Lebruska L.L. Kuzmine I.I. Fedor M.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 465-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Kuzmin Y.I.

Biol. 2004; 340: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), except that a temperature of 15 °C was chosen, rather than the standard temperature of 25 °C, because the lower temperature facilitated comparisons of ribozyme variants with destabilizing modifications. A ligation-chase protocol was used to measure cleavage rates to ensure that cleavage assays monitored the catalytic activity within properly folded 5′R·3′P complexes and were not complicated by slow refolding of misfolded RNAs (13Nesbitt S.M. Erlacher H.A. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1009-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Changes in cleavage and ligation rate constants reflect the effects of modifications on the magnitude of the activation barrier to cleavage or ligation, ΔΔG‡, while changes in equilibrium dissociation constants reflect effects of modifications on the ground state stability of 5′R·3′P complexes, or ΔΔG5′R·3′P. It is important to recognize that observed changes in transition state and ground state energies that result from functional group modifications are not a direct measure of the energetic contribution of the bonds formed between specific functional groups because changes in interactions with solvent also contribute to free energy changes (27Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).

Crystallographic studies revealed very similar active site structures for a ribozyme complex with vanadate, a mimic of the trigonal bipyramidal transition state in which phosphorus associates with five oxygen atoms, and a ribozyme complex with product RNAs that have 5′-hydroxyl and 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini (3Rupert P.B. Massey A.P. Sigurdsson S.T. Ferré-D’Amaré A.R. Science. 2002; 298: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). In both vanadate and product complexes, G+1 extrudes from loop A in an unusual syn conformation and stacks between the A38 and A26 nucleobases in loop B. G+1 forms additional hydrogen bonding interactions with loop B nucleotides that include Watson-Crick pairing between G+1 and C25 (8Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and hydrogen bonding between N7 of G+1 and the 2′-OH of A38 and between the 2′-hydroxyl of G+1 and the exocyclic amine of G36. The absence of significant differences between the two structures in the distances between G+1 functional groups and putative hydrogen bonding partners in loop B suggests that G+1 forms virtually the same hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions in the ground state as in the transition state. G+1 is the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the 3′ cleavage product RNA (3′P) so changes in ground state interactions with G+1 will be reflected in equilibrium dissociation constants for 3′ product RNA binding (14Fedor M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11040-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The length and sequence of the intermolecular H1 helix that forms between 5′ ribozyme and 3′ product RNAs can vary without loss of catalytic activity (1Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, 3′ product RNAs can be designed to form H1 helices with the optimal number of base pairs to facilitate measurements of cleavage or ligati"

We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for HMGA1-interacting proteins and identified the SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9 as one such partner. The Ubc9-interacting domain of HMGA1 is bipartite, consisting of a proline-rich region near the N terminus and an acidic domain at the extreme C terminus, whereas the HMGA1-interacting domain of Ubc9 comprises a single region previously shown to associate with and SUMOylate other transcription factors. Consistent with these findings, endogenous HMGA1 proteins and Ubc9 could be co-immunoprecipitated from several human cell lines. Studies with HMGA1b proteins containing mutations of either or both Ubc9-interacting domains and with Ubc9-depleted cell lines indicated that the proline-rich domain of HMGA1b positively influences transformation and growth, whereas the acidic domain negatively influences these properties. None of the changes in HMGA1 protein functions mediated by Ubc9 appears to require SUMOylation. These findings are consistent with the idea that Ubc9 can act as both a positive and negative regulator of proliferation and transformation via its non-SUMO-dependent interaction with HMGA1 proteins.

These findings are consistent with the idea that Ubc9 can act as both a positive and negative regulator of proliferation and transformation via its non-SUMO-dependent interaction with HMGA1 proteins. The HMGA1 (high mobility group A1) proteins are a subgroup of non-histone, chromatin-associated, “architectural” proteins that participate in chromatin folding and modeling, DNA binding, and transcription (1Reeves R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As a result, these proteins exert profound effects over basic cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and genotoxic stress responses (1Reeves R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3Liu F. Chau K.Y. Arlotta P. Ono S.J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 24: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As befitting their role in these processes, HMGA1 proteins are widely expressed, with particularly high levels occurring in rapidly proliferating, undifferentiated, and neoplastic cells (4Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Takaha N. Resar L.M. Vindivich D. Coffey D.S.

Pathol. 2006; 209: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). HMGA1 proteins occur in two major isoforms, HMGA1a and HMGA1b, which arise from alternate splicing of a common parent gene transcript (1Reeves R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Liu F. Chau K.Y. Arlotta P. Ono S.J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 24: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The former protein contains a unique 11-amino acid insert between residues 34 and 35 that likely accounts for the differential post-translational modification of the two isoforms (7Edberg D.D. Bruce J.E. Siems W.F. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11500-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Edberg D.D. Adkins J.N. Springer D.L. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8961-8973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other important characteristics of both proteins include their relatively small sizes (∼11–12 kDa), highly acidic C-terminal domains, and three reiterated “AT hooks” of 10–12 residues each. The latter mediate cooperative DNA binding to AT-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA, particularly if these exist within a structurally distorted context (2Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9Claus P. Schulze E. Wisniewski J.R. J. Biol.

In many cases, these sites lie within the promoters of genes whose transcript levels are modulated by HMGA1 proteins (11Martinez Hoyos J. Fedele M. Battista S. Pentimalli F. Kruhoffer M. Arra C. Orntoft T.F. Croce C.M. Fusco A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5728-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HMGA1 proteins can thus regulate target gene expression by virtue of their modification of chromatin and DNA structure, which in turn alters the accessibility or function of other transcription factors (11Martinez Hoyos J. Fedele M. Battista S. Pentimalli F. Kruhoffer M. Arra C. Orntoft T.F. Croce C.M. Fusco A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5728-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, an alternate way for HMGA1 proteins to regulate transcription has been shown by demonstrating that they interact with the oligomerization domains of the tumor suppressor p53 and its relatives, p63 and p73, resulting in the inhibition of their DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activities (12Frasca F.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The deregulated overexpression of HMGA1 proteins has also been shown to contribute directly to the development of certain experimental neoplasms (14Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pierantoni G.M. Battista S. Pentimalli F. Fedele M. Visone R. Federico A. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A.

Conversely, siRNA 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; AD, activation domain; HA, hemagglutinin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HOS, human osteosarcoma; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IP, immunoprecipitation. or antisense-mediated depletion of HMGA1 proteins is associated with a less aggressive tumor cell phenotype (18Hommura F.

Rearrangements or otherwise abnormal expression of the HMGA1 gene have also been implicated in a variety of naturally occurring human tumors (20Kazmierczak B. Meyer-Bolte K. Tran K.H. Wockel W.

Further consistent with its putative role in experimental and naturally occurring cancers, the HMGA1 gene is a direct downstream transcriptional target for both the c-Myc and c-Jun oncoproteins (14Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hommura F. Katabami M. Leaner V.D. Donninger H. Sumter T.F. Resar L.M. Birrer M.J. Mol.

The importance of this relationship is underscored by the fact that inhibition of HMGA1 expression blocks both c-Myc and c-Jun transformation (14Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hommura F. Katabami M. Leaner V.D. Donninger H. Sumter T.F. Resar L.M. Birrer M.J. Mol.

Furthermore, we have previously shown that ectopic HMGA1b expression partially phenocopies c-Myc in c-Myc nullizygous fibroblasts, rendering them more highly proliferative and transformed (26Rothermund K. Rogulski K. Fernandes E. Whiting A. Sedivy J. Pu L. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because of the central importance of HMGA1 proteins to transformation, particularly with respect to that mediated by c-Myc, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid-based screen for novel HMGA1b-interacting proteins. As a result of these studies, we have identified Ubc9 as an avid HMGA1 partner whose interaction with these proteins dramatically alters their function. Ubc9 is the sole E2 conjugase for the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1 and is itself frequently overexpressed in certain tumors (27Mo Y.Y. Moschos S.J. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2005; 9: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Mo Y.Y. Yu Y. Theodosiou E. Rachel P.L. Beck W.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2677-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whereas ubiquitinylation invariably results in proteasome-mediated degradation of the targeted protein, SUMOylation more typically alters target protein activity or subcellular trafficking (29Matunis M.J.

Several instances have also been described of proteins that interact with Ubc9 without being SUMOylated (36Kurtzman A.L. Schechter N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5602-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol.

It is this latter group into which the HMGA1 proteins appear to fall. Despite its apparent lack of physical modification by Ubc9, we show that the function of HMGA1b is nevertheless dramatically altered as evidenced by changes in the growth-promoting and transforming activity of HMGA1b when its interaction with Ubc9 is perturbed or when endogenous cellular Ubc9 stores are depleted. Together, these results provide evidence for a novel interaction involving HMGA1b and Ubc9 that has profound consequences for the HMGA1b-transformed cell. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—General procedures for yeast two-hybrid screening and validation and quantitative β-galactosidase assays have been previously described (40Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E.V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 41Li Y. Rogulski K. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3401-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To screen specifically for HMGA1b-interacting proteins, the entire murine HMGA1b coding region was amplified by PCR with the forward and reverse primers engineered to contain EcoRI and SalI restriction sites, respectively. The digested product was cloned directionally into the pGBKT7 “bait” vector (BD-Clontech, San Diego, CA) so as to be in-frame with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a c-Myc epitope tag encoded by the vector. All HMGA1b N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants were similarly amplified by PCR using appropriate primers and cloned into the same vector. All of the primer sequences and conditions utilized for PCR are available upon request. Internal deletions and point mutations utilized the full-length HMGA1b vector described above as a template and were constructed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the directions of the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences and reading frames of all mutants were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Initial screening for HMGA1b-interacting proteins was performed using a murine day-11 embryo cDNA library cloned in the pGAD424 vector (41Li Y. Rogulski K. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3401-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From ∼2 × 107 screened clones, 85 were identified as interacting with HMGA1b and confirmed following secondary screens. Of these, 51 were subjected to DNA sequencing, and 4 were shown to encode in-frame fusions between the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (AD) and Ubc9. Ubc9 deletion mutants were obtained by PCR amplification from the initial pGAD-Ubc9 clone using forward and reverse primers with EcoRI and SalI sites, respectively. These were cloned into the pGADT7 yeast vector (Stratagene) so as to be in-fame with the Gal4 AD and an HA epitope tag encoded by the vector. The sequences and reading frames of all mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Mammalian Cell Propagation—Burkitt’s lymphoma and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were routinely propagated in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as previously described (42Rogulski K. Li Y. Rothermund K. Pu L. Watkins S. Yi F. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7524-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells, Rat1a fibroblasts and the Phoenix amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line were propagated in Dulbecco’s modified minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. All of the media were routinely supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Assays of Rat1a cells for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar were conducted as previously described (42Rogulski K. Li Y. Rothermund K. Pu L. Watkins S. Yi F. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7524-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 43Mu Z.M. Yin X.Y. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol.

Mammalian Expression Vectors and siRNA Transfection—The indicated HMGA1 coding sequences were amplified using forward and reverse primers containing engineered XhoI and SalI sites, respectively. The reverse SalI primer was constructed so as to lack a termination signal. After digestion, the products were cloned into the previously described pLXSN-EYFP bi-cistronic retroviral vector containing a 3′-c-Myc epitope tag (26Rothermund K. Rogulski K. Fernandes E. Whiting A. Sedivy J. Pu L. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells were transfected with retroviral constructs using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the directions of the supplier. Supernatants were harvested 48–72 h later for infection of recipient Rat1a cells. After an additional 48–72 h, EYFP-positive cells were purified by cell sorting as previously described (26Rothermund K. Rogulski K. Fernandes E. Whiting A. Sedivy J. Pu L. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), pooled, and utilized in all further studies. The creation of HMGA1b-Ubc9 fusion protein expression vectors was performed in two steps. In the first step, the coding region, including the termination codon of murine Ubc9 was amplified by PCR using XhoI- and SalI-linked forward and reverse primers, respectively. The fragment was cloned into the XhoI site in the polylinker of the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Stratagene), and expression of Ubc9 was verified by immunoblotting in a transient transfection assay. In the second step, the Ubc9 expression vector was digested with HindIII and XhoI to allow for the directional cloning of wild-type or mutant HMGA1b fragments, each of which had been amplified with forward and reverse PCR primers that contained engineered HindIII and XhoI sites, respectively. The reverse primers also lacked termination codons so as to allow for continuity of the HMGA1b and Ubc9 reading frames. The resultant vectors were sequenced to confirm the in-frame fusions between HMGA1b and Ubc9 coding sequences and to verify the identities of the HMGA1b moieties. Inhibition of endogenous HMGA1 in HOS cells was performed using an siRNA duplex sequence (SiGenome duplex number D-004597-01-005, Dharmacon, Inc. Lafayette, CO) at a final concentration of 100 nm. Transfections were performed using DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent according to the directions of the supplier. Lysates for co-immunoprecipitation experiments and SDS-PAGE were performed 48 h after transfection. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—These were performed essentially as described previously (41Li Y. Rogulski K. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Prochownik E.V. Mol.

Briefly, 107 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of ice cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 μm ZnCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the suspension was subjected to two 30-s bursts with the microtip of a Branson sonifier (setting 7). Following clarification at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was precleared with 5 μl of nonimmune rabbit IgG followed by 30 μl of a slurry of protein G-agarose (Sc-2002; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The cleared supernatant was then incubated overnight at 4C with 10 μl (2 μg) of rabbit polyclonal IgG against HMGA1a/b (Sc-8982; Santa Cruz) or an equivalent amount of control IgG. Following precipitation with 30 μl of protein G-agarose for 3 h, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. The final pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described below. Immunoblotting—General procedures for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting have been previously described (42Rogulski K. Li Y. Rothermund K. Pu L. Watkins S. Yi F. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7524-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Antibodies included monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 directed against the c-Myc epitope tag (Sc-40, Santa Cruz), the anti-HA tag mAb (Sc-7392, Santa Cruz), and a mAb directed against human Ubc9 (number 610748; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Identification of Ubc9 as an HMGA1b-interacting Protein—A full-length human HMGA1b coding sequence, fused in-frame to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a c-Myc epitope tag, was expressed in the AH109 yeast strain (Fig. 1A). This fusion protein alone was not self-transactivating, as evidenced by its inability to confer histidine or adenine prototrophy or to induce the expression of β-galactosidase at levels above background (Fig. 1B). This yeast strain was then used to screen a day-11 murine embryo cDNA library in which in-frame cDNAs are expressed as fusions with the Gal4 AD. From a total of ∼2 × 107 clones, we identified 85 histidine + adenine prototrophs, which also expressed significant levels of β-galactosidase. Upon retrieving, validating, and sequencing 51 of the cDNAs from these clones, 4 were shown to contain in-frame fusions between the Gal4 AD and Ubc9. To confirm the specificity of the HMGA1b-Ubc9 association, as well as to identify the region(s) of HMGA1b responsible for the interaction, we constructed a series of c-Myc epitope-tagged HMGA1b deletion mutants in the pGBKT7 vector (Fig. 1A) and expressed each of these in AH109 yeast expressing a full-length Ubc9-AD. Immunoblotting equivalent amounts of protein from each strain showed that all fusions were expressed at similar levels and were of the predicted sizes (Fig. 1C). A comparison of these deletion mutants for their ability to grow on medium lacking adenine and histidine and to induce β-galactosidase (Fig. 1B) revealed that HMGA1b contained two independent Ubc9-interacting domains localizing, respectively, to a proline-rich segment between AT hooks 1 and 2 and to the extreme C-terminal acidic domain immediately adjacent to AT hook 3. Although full-length HMGA1a and HMGA1b behaved identically in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we noted that the 11-amino acid insert that distinguishes the former isoform from the latter occurs within the proline-rich Ubc9-interacting domain. This suggested that the isolated proline-rich domains of the two HMGA1 isoforms might differentially interact with Ubc9. To test this directly, therefore, we examined comparable regions of HMGA1a and HMGA1b in the above assay. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), the proline-rich domain of HMGA1b, encompassed by amino acids 20–50, interacted strongly with Ubc9. Interestingly, yeast expressing the comparable HMGA1a-derived segment also grew on His–Ade– selection medium and produced nearly as much β-galactosidase. Both HMGA1a- and HMGA1b-derived proteins were expressed at equivalent levels as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). From these studies, we conclude that the Ubc9-interacting domains of HMGA1a and b are bipartite, with each subdomain being capable of independent binding to Ubc9. Furthermore, the 11-amino acid insert, which interrupts the proline-rich domain of HMGA1a, exerts little influence over the ability of this region to interact with Ubc9. Identification of the HMGA1-interacting Domain of Ubc9—To identify the region of Ubc9 responsible for its interaction with HMGA1 proteins, we pursued a deletion-based strategy similar to that described in the preceding section (Fig. 2A). The results of these studies showed that the HMGA1-interacting domain of Ubc9 consisted of a single region between amino acids 110–134 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, this segment contains a cluster of at least six closely spaced residues that have been previously shown to play a critical role in SUMOylation of proteins relevant to tumorigenesis such as p53, E1b, and PML (Ref. 45Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). Immunoblotting showed that all deletions were expressed at comparable levels and were of the predicted sizes (Fig. 2C). Interaction between Endogenous HMGA1 Proteins and Ubc9—To verify the HMGA1-Ubc9 interaction under more physiologic conditions, co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) were performed on total cell lysates prepared from human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and HOS cell lines. These were chosen because preliminary experiments indicated that they express extremely high levels of endogenous c-Myc and Ubc9 and have demonstrable deregulation of HMGA1 proteins (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous HMGA1a/b-associated Ubc9 was readily detectable in all three cell lines when an ant1-HMGA1 antibody was used in the initial IP but not when a control IgG was used. To confirm the specificity of the above co-IPs, we transiently knocked down endogenous HMGA1 protein expression in HOS cells using siRNA. SDS-PAGE of cellular lysates performed 2 days after transfection showed a >90% reduction in HMGA1 protein levels compared with lysates derived from cells transfected with a control duplex sequence (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, co-IPs performed on lysates from these cells under the conditions described in Fig. 3A showed that whereas endogenous Ubc 9 was again readily detectable in cells treated with the control siRNA, Ubc9 was undetectable in HMGA1 siRNA-treated cells. To further corroborate the above findings and to verify the relevance of the two Ubc9-interacting domains of HMGA1b, several Myc epitope-tagged variants of the latter protein were stably expressed in Rat1a fibroblasts, which express low to undetectable levels of endogenous HMGA proteins but which can be transformed by their deregulated expression (14Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants included either double or triple proline → alanine (P → A) substitutions in the proline-rich domain (P33A/P34A or P33A/P34A/P37A), a 19-amino acid C-terminal deletion of the acidic domain (1–77), or a combination of triple P → A substitutions and the acidic domain deletion (3P → A/1–77) (Fig. 3D). Immunoblotting of lysates from these cells established that all four proteins were expressed at levels comparable with that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3E). The ability of each protein to interact with endogenous Ubc9 was then determined in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3F, all of the above described proteins, excepting the double mutant, interacted with Ubc9. From these studies, we conclude that the proline-rich and C-terminal domains of HMGA1b interact identically with Ubc9 both in yeast and mammalian cells. Functional Consequences of HMGA1b Mutant Protein Expression—The foregoing experiments established that two genetically separable domains in HMGA1a/b were capable of associating independently with Ubc9. This redundancy suggested that distinct outcomes might arise as a consequence of each interaction and that Ubc9 might serve to integrate HMGA1 protein functions. To explore this in more depth, we focused initially on HMGA1b-mediated transformation. Each of the Rat1a cell lines depicted in Fig. 3E was thus examined for its ability to form anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar. As expected, cells expressing unmodified, wild-type HMGA1b were highly clonogenic (14Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rothermund K. Rogulski K. Fernandes E. Whiting A. Sedivy J. Pu L. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas those expressing either the double or triple P → A point mutations were devoid of transforming potential (Fig. 4A). In marked contrast, cells expressing the acidic domain deletion of HMGA1b were not only more clonogenic than those expressing the wild-type protein but produced colonies of markedly larger average size (Fig. 4B). The combination mutation 3P → A/1–77 eliminated entirely the ability of the protein to confer anchorage-independent growth. From these experiments, we conclude that the proline-rich segment of HMGA1b positively regulates transformation, whereas the acidic N terminus negatively regulates both colony number and size. The behavior of the double mutant also allows us to conclude that the proline-rich"

But what happens if the stem cells are lost? In a recent issue of Developmental Cell, Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar propose that the progeny of stem cells, called transit-amplifying progenitor cells, are able to replace lost stem cells. A key feature of tissue stem cells is their ability to perpetuate and maintain their population over the life span of the organism. Although there may be some decline in stem cell vigor with aging, self renewal is a remarkably stable property. However, in cases where stem cells are lost, the stem cell population can be regenerated. Is this regenerated stem cell population solely replenished from equivalent stem cells, or are there additional safe guards in the system that would allow other cells to acquire stemness? A stem cell's immediate surrounding microenvironment, the niche, is crucial for its maintenance. Can an empty niche impose stem cell features on other cells, or is self renewal strictly limited to actual stem cells? Such questions get to the heart of what a stem cell is. The mouse testis is an elegant and powerful model with which to study stem cells. Spermatogonia, which include subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells (some of which have yet to be defined), give rise to mature spermatozoa in 40 days, which then leave the seminiferous tubules (Brinster, 2002Brinster R.L. Science. 2002; 296: 2174-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The structural organization of the testis makes it possible to trace the progeny of individual stem cells. Furthermore, it is possible to analyze the reconstitution of the stem cell population after an insult by studying regeneration of this population or through transplantation experiments. In an elegant study, Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar pulse-labeled undifferentiated cells in the mouse male germline using an inducible genetic recombination system. Recombination (and thus labeling of the cells) occurs both in the stem cells and in their immediate descendants, the transit-amplifying progenitor cells. After 3 months (that is, after several rounds of spermatogenesis), all labeled cells are derived from self-renewing stem cells and constitute 0.3% of the cells in the testis. Nakagawa and colleagues next examined reconstitution of the stem cell population after transplantation, or regeneration following an insult. Remarkably, they found that 3 months after transplantation of pulse-labeled testes into germ cell-depleted testes, close to 12% of the cells that constitute the regenerated testis were labeled (Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). They obtained similar results when they examined regeneration after an insult such as treatment with busulfan, which eliminates stem cells in the testis. Thus, the recombination frequency is different in the stem cells that maintain normal homeostasis and in the cells that act as long-term stem cells after transplantation or regeneration. This finding indicates that the stem cells that maintain normal homeostasis do not appear to be the same cell population that repopulates the niche after transplantation and regeneration. It has long been suspected that cells other than those that maintain homeostasis (actual stem cells) can take over stem cell function in certain situations, and they have been referred to as potential stem cells (Potten and Loeffler, 1990Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Progenitor cells can take on stem cell functions when stem cells are lost in the Drosophila germ line (Brawley and Matunis, 2004Brawley C. Matunis E. Science. 2004; 304: 1331-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, Kai and Spradling, 2004Kai T. Spradling A. Nature. 2004; 428: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but this has been difficult to establish unambiguously in mammals. To explore whether dormant stem cells or transit-amplifying progenitor cells represent potential stem cells in the mouse testis, Nakagawa and colleagues next transplanted cells at different time points after pulse labeling. They find that it is only when cells are transplanted shortly after labeling (i.e., shortly after recombination) that the reconstituting stem cells have a different recombination frequency than the actual stem cells (Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This establishes that the cell population with the higher recombination frequency is transient, indicating that transit-amplifying progenitor cells are potential stem cells in this system (Figure 1). Furthermore, by studying mice over long time periods, Nakagawa and colleagues provide evidence that actual stem cells are lost and replaced over time (Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether they are replaced by potential stem cells or through symmetric divisions of actual stem cells. An important and fortuitous feature in the system exploited by Nakagawa and colleagues is a different recombination frequency between the stem cells and progenitor cells. If the frequency were the same in both compartments, there would be no reduction in the number of recombined potential stem cells over time, as they would be replenished at the same recombination frequency from actual stem cells. The much larger absolute number of progenitor cells than actual stem cells cannot explain their results. The reason for the different recombination efficiency in these cellular compartments is unknown but could, for example, be due to different levels of expression of the transgene, different epigenetic states, or chromatin structure. The results of Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar indicate that stem cell function is not strictly cell autonomous and that there is a potential for some cells to gain stemness. Strictly speaking, a lineage relationship between the actual and potential stem cells has not been established in their study, but the most plausible model is that the potential stem cells are the immediate descendants of the actual stem cells. Stem cells are notoriously difficult to identify in tissues, which has hampered the study and use of these cells. Transplantation assays have been invaluable for the identification of stem cells in several tissues (Weissman, 2000Weissman I.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The results of Nakagawa et al., 2007Nakagawa T. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, however, underscore the difficulty of drawing definitive conclusions regarding the identity of actual stem cells from transplantation or regeneration experiments alone. Strategies for genetic labeling similar to those used by Nakagawa and colleagues can be developed for other stem cell lineages. This may reveal whether potential stem cells are a general feature of many tissues and may aid in the identification of the actual stem cell population."
