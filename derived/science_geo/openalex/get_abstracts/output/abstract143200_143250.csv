https://openalex.org/W2171370174,"We have produced yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice expressing normal (YAC18) and mutant (YAC46 and YAC72) huntingtin (htt) in a developmental and tissue-specific manner identical to that observed in Huntington’s disease (HD). YAC46 and YAC72 mice show early electrophysiological abnormalities, indicating cytoplasmic dysfunction prior to observed nuclear inclusions or neurodegeneration. By 12 months of age, YAC72 mice have a selective degeneration of medium spiny neurons in the lateral striatum associated with the translocation of N-terminal htt fragments to the nucleus. Neurodegeneration can be present in the absence of macro- or microaggregates, clearly showing that aggregates are not essential to initiation of neuronal death. These mice demonstrate that initial neuronal cytoplasmic toxicity is followed by cleavage of htt, nuclear translocation of htt N-terminal fragments, and selective neurodegeneration."

Here, we test several hypotheses about the function of the PPA. We find that PPA activity (1) is not affected by the subjects' familiarity with the place depicted, (2) does not increase when subjects experience a sense of motion through the scene, and (3) is greater when viewing novel versus repeated scenes but not novel versus repeated faces. Thus, we find no evidence that the PPA is involved in matching perceptual information to stored representations in memory, in planning routes, or in monitoring locomotion through the local or distal environment but some evidence that it is involved in encoding new perceptual information about the appearance and layout of scenes."

https://openalex.org/W2045165874,"Regeneration is abortive following adult mammalian CNS injury. We have investigated whether increasing the intrinsic growth state of primary sensory neurons by a conditioning peripheral nerve lesion increases regrowth of their central axons. After dorsal column lesions, all fibers stop at the injury site. Animals with a peripheral axotomy concomitant with the central lesion show axonal growth into the lesion but not into the spinal cord above the lesion. A preconditioning lesion 1 or 2 weeks prior to the dorsal column injury results in growth into the spinal cord above the lesion. In vitro, the growth capacity of DRG neurite is also increased following preconditioning lesions. The intrinsic growth state of injured neurons is, therefore, a key determinant for central regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1969820174,"The tumor suppressor PTEN is a phosphatase with sequence homology to tensin. PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and it can inhibit cell growth, invasion, migration, and focal adhesions. We investigated molecular interactions of PTEN and FAK in glioblastoma and breast cancer cells lacking PTEN. The PTEN trapping mutant D92A bound wild-type FAK, requiring FAK autophosphorylation site Tyr397. In PTEN-mutated cancer cells, FAK phosphorylation was retained even in suspension after detachment from extracellular matrix, accompanied by enhanced PI 3-K association with FAK and sustained PI 3-K activity, PIP3 levels, and Akt phosphorylation; expression of exogenous PTEN suppressed all five properties. PTEN-mutated cells were resistant to apoptosis in suspension, but most of the cells entered apoptosis after expression of exogenous PTEN or wortmannin treatment. Moreover, overexpression of FAK in PTEN-transfected cells reversed the decreased FAK phosphorylation and PI 3-K activity, and it partially rescued PIP3 levels, Akt phosphorylation, and PTEN-induced apoptosis. Our results show that FAK Tyr397 is important in PTEN interactions with FAK, that PTEN regulates FAK phosphorylation and molecular associations after detachment from matrix, and that PTEN negatively regulates the extracellular matrix-dependent PI 3-K/Akt cell survival pathway in a process that can include FAK.

Recent evidence demonstrates the ability of PTEN to directly dephosphorylate position D3 of PIP3, a product of PI 3-K (16Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). In PTEN-mutated glioblastoma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the activity of Akt (also called protein kinase B) is constitutively elevated (17Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L.

Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1195-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Akt is a survival-promoting serine-threonine protein kinase regulated by PIP3 that is implicated in survival signaling in a wide variety of cells, including fibroblastic, epithelial, and neuronal cells (23Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PTEN increases sensitivity to cell death in response to several apoptotic stimuli, including UV irradiation and treatment with tumor necrosis factor α, by negatively regulating the PI 3-K/Akt pathway (17Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in regulating the PI 3-K/Akt cell survival pathway, PTEN also inhibits growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation and suppresses the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway (24Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTEN has roles in independent signaling pathways. PTEN also interacts with FAK, a key molecule implicated in integrin signaling pathways, and it directly dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK (18Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The activation of integrins by cell binding to extracellular matrix leads to increases in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation levels and enhances kinase activity (25Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 26Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Activation of FAK leads to its association with several kinases, signal transduction molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins including PI 3-K, Src, Grb2, and paxillin. Binding is mediated by specific tyrosine-phosphorylated residues within FAK and is followed by activation of downstream signaling pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase/MAP kinase and PI 3-K/Akt cell survival pathways (30Schlaepfer D.D.

In fact, the integrin-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway is also suppressed by PTEN (24Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Many mammalian cell types are dependent on adhesion to the extracellular matrix for their continued survival. When the signals from matrix are interrupted, normal cells may undergo apoptosis in a process termed anoikis (36Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ability of malignant cells to proliferate in the absence of adhesion, termed anchorage independence of growth, correlates closely with tumorigenicity. In a study published while this paper was under review, Davies et al. (37Davies M.A. Lu Y. Sano T. Fang X. Tang P. LaPushin R. Koul D. Bookstein R. Stokoe D. Yung W.K. Mills G.B. Steck P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5285-5290PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PTEN expression in a cell line lacking PTEN increases the rate of apoptosis approximately 2-fold both before and especially after detachment from extracellular matrix. Another recent study reported that PTEN overexpression in human breast cancer cells induces apoptosis, even while the cells were substrate-attached and regardless of the presence of endogenous PTEN, and Akt was identified as a key molecule in this effect (38Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M.P. Tonks N. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5667-5672PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have implicated FAK in the general process of anoikis,i.e. apoptosis after loss of matrix interactions. Inhibition of FAK activity in fibroblasts or attenuation of FAK expression in tumor cells leads to apoptosis (39Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 40Xu L.H. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively activated FAK protects Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from apoptosis caused by loss of matrix contact, and Tyr397 of FAK is required for this effect (41Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-K with Tyr397 in FAK is induced by the attachment of cells to matrix (42Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 43Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). PI 3-K is required for integrin-stimulated Akt activation (44King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that FAK is an important mediator of integrin-mediated survival signals upstream of the PI 3-K/Akt cell survival pathway. Several studies have also established that levels of FAK expression are often increased in proliferating cells or advanced cancers (45Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1024-1025Abstract PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 46Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Kornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G.

In the present study, we have investigated further the interactions between PTEN and FAK in trying to determine whether PTEN dephosphorylation of FAK is involved in processes related to cancer progression. Our results suggest that the major autophosphorylation site of FAK (Tyr397) is responsible for the initialin vivo association of PTEN with FAK, a prerequisite for FAK dephosphorylation by PTEN. A trapping mutant of PTEN (D92A) competed for the binding of Src and PI 3-K, which also bind to Tyr397 of FAK, without effects on binding to other sites. In order to explore PTEN signaling pathways, we also tested whether FAK dephosphorylation by PTEN was associated with effects on PI 3-K and downstream Akt cell survival signaling. In PTEN-mutated cancer cells, FAK phosphorylation was retained even in the absence of extracellular matrix contact, accompanied by sustained PI 3-K binding to FAK, activity of PI 3-K, levels of PIP3, and phosphorylation of Akt. PTEN-mutated cells were markedly resistant to apoptosis triggered by detachment from extracellular matrix. Expression of exogenous PTEN in PTEN-mutated cells inhibited FAK phosphorylation, and it restored a normal pattern of FAK/PI 3-K association, PI 3-K activity, PIP3 levels, Akt phosphorylation, and apoptosis in response to detachment from matrix. Furthermore, overexpression of FAK could effectively inhibit these effects of PTEN on PI 3-K activity and partially inhibited its effects on PIP3 levels, Akt phosphorylation, and apoptosis. Our results suggest that PTEN interactions with FAK may lead to inhibition of the PI 3-K/Akt cell survival pathway in parallel with its direct effects on PIP3, thereby promoting apoptosis in response to detachment from matrix. The monoclonal antibodies 2A7 directed against FAK and 4G10 against phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were used for immunoprecipitation, and a second monoclonal antibody against FAK (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used for immunoblotting.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (U-87MG) or RPMI 1640 (DBTRG-05MG and MDA-MB468) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and cultured in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Calf serum (10%) was substituted for culturing NIH 3T3 cells. Transfections were performed by electroporation as described (18Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Briefly, pGZ21δxZ (10 μg) containing either no insert or wild type or mutant PTEN was transfected into 1.5 × 106 cells by electroporation together with 10 μg of pHA262pur. Cells were subcultured at a 1:3 dilution 24 h after transfection and were maintained for 2 days in 1 μg/ml puromycin-containing medium. Cells were subsequently maintained in puromycin-free medium for an additional 24 h. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were transfected with either HA-FAK or IL-2R-FAK (3 μg each) plus GFP-tagged wild-type PTEN or PTEN trapping mutant D92A (10 μg each) and used for immunoprecipitations 24 h after transfection. Cells were analyzed for expression of various constructs by Western blotting for GFP, HA, and FAK as described below; percentages of GFP-expressing cells were also quantified by scoring at least 100 cells per transfection using a fluorescent microscope. After puromycin selection of cells expressing the various constructs, U87MG cells (5 × 105) were allowed to spread for 2 h on 10-cm Petri dishes coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells were detached by trypsinization, resuspended, and maintained in suspension in medium containing 10% serum. The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), except for the PTEN and FAK co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which used modified CSK buffer (100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the protease inhibitor mixture). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce), and samples were adjusted to equal protein concentration and volume. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (49De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), except using anti-FAK (5 μg/ml) or anti-HA (4 μg/ml) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with RC20 (1:2500), HA, GFP (1:1000), c-Src (2 μg/ml), PI 3-K (1:5000), paxillin (1:10,000), Grb2 (1:1000), FAK (1:1000), Akt (1:1000), phospho-Akt (1:1000), JNK (1:1000), or phospho-JNK (1:1000) antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Determination of PIP3 in vivo was carried out as described (50Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after selecting transfected cells using puromycin, 1 × 106 cells were labeled with 32PO4(500 μCi/ml) for 1 h. Cells were suspended by trypsinization and then either plated on fibronectin-coated dishes for 1 h in 10% serum-containing medium or incubated for an additional 1 h in suspension in the same serum-containing medium. Phospholipids were extracted from these adherent or suspended cells as described (50Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For examining platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h before labeling with32PO4 and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Sigma) for 10 min. PIP3 levels were determined by using TLC (silica gel 60, EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) and autoradiography (50Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). PI 3-K proteins were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-PI 3-K antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated with 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (30 μCi) in kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitates were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant solutions were extracted for lipids, and aliquots were applied to TLC plates (51Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-K was measured by immunoprecipitating total tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using monoclonal antibody 4G10 and then immunoblotting with anti-p85 PI 3-K monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Phosphorylation of Akt was evaluated using anti-phospho-Akt antibodies as described (24Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected using puromycin as described above. After attachment to fibronectin or detachment, cells were lysed with cold PBS and homogenized in the 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described above. The cell homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt or total Akt antibodies. Phosphorylation of JNK was evaluated using anti-phospho-JNK antibodies as described (24Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing HA-JNK1 was co-transfected with the control GFP vector or wild type PTEN-GFP, and the cells were used for assays 24 h after transfection. Subconfluent cells were washed once with PBS and then exposed to UV light (200 mJ/cm2) using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene) followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C to induce JNK. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 as described above. After puromycin selection for transfected cells, cells were harvested by trypsinization and plated on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 10% serum-containing medium for 2 h. Cells were then detached with trypsin and cultured in suspension in the presence of 10% serum-containing medium for the indicated times then spread, air-dried, and fixed on glass coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min, incubated with blocking solution (0.3% H2O2 in methanol) for 30 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Tr"

Mice carrying a null mutation for the nACh α9 gene were produced to investigate its role(s) in auditory processing and development of hair cell innervation. In α9 knockout mice, most OHCs were innervated by one large terminal instead of multiple smaller terminals as in wild types, suggesting a role for the nACh α9 subunit in development of mature synaptic connections. α9 knockout mice also failed to show suppression of cochlear responses (compound action potentials, distortion product otoacoustic emissions) during efferent fiber activation, demonstrating the key role α9 receptors play in mediating the only known effects of the olivocochlear system."
https://openalex.org/W2046607296,"Elapid snake venom neurotoxins exert their effects through high-affinity interactions with specific neurotransmitter receptors. A novel murine gene, lynx1, is highly expressed in the brain and contains the cysteine-rich motif characteristic of this class of neurotoxins. Primary sequence and gene structure analyses reveal an evolutionary relationship between lynx1 and the Ly-6/neurotoxin gene family. lynx1 is expressed in large projection neurons in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. In cerebellar neurons, lynx1 protein is localized to a specific subdomain including the soma and proximal dendrites. lynx1 binding to brain sections correlates with the distribution of nAChRs, and application of lynx1 to Xenopus oocytes expressing nAChRs results in an increase in acetylcholine-evoked macroscopic currents. These results identify lynx1 as a novel protein modulator for nAChRs in vitro, which could have important implications in the regulation of cholinergic function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2051900024,"Expression of rat TrkA in Xenopus spinal neurons confers responsiveness of these neurons to nerve growth factor (NGF) in assays of neuronal survival and growth cone chemotropism. Mutational analysis indicates that coactivation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) by specific cytoplasmic domains of TrkA is essential for triggering chemoattraction of the growth cone in an NGF gradient. Uniform exposure of TrkA-expressing neurons to NGF resulted in a cross-desensitization of turning responses induced by a gradient of netrin-1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) but not by a gradient of collapsin-1/semaphorin III/D or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). These results, together with the effects of pharmacological inhibitors, support the notion that there are common cytosolic signaling pathways for two separate groups of guidance cues, one of which requires coactivation of PLC-γ and PI3-kinase pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2057647863,"The importance of lateral inhibition mediated by NOTCH signaling is well demonstrated to control neurogenesis both in invertebrates and vertebrates. We have identified the chicken homolog of Drosophila numb, which suppresses NOTCH signaling. We show that chicken NUMB (c-NUMB) protein is localized to the basal cortex of mitotic neuroepithelial cells, suggesting that c-NUMB regulates neurogenesis by the modification of NOTCH signaling through asymmetrical cell division. Consistent with this suggestion, we show (1) that c-NUMB interferes with the nuclear translocation of activated c-NOTCH-1 through direct binding to the PEST sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of c-NOTCH-1 and (2) that c-NUMB interferes with c-NOTCH-1-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1986792090,"Agrin induces synaptic differentiation at the skeletal neuromuscular junction (NMJ); both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation are drastically impaired in its absence. Multiple alternatively spliced forms of agrin that differ in binding characteristics and bioactivity are synthesized by nerve and muscle cells. We used surgical chimeras, isoform-specific mutant mice, and nerve-muscle cocultures to determine the origins and nature of the agrin required for synaptogenesis. We show that agrin containing Z exons (Z+) is a critical nerve-derived inducer of postsynaptic differentiation, whereas neural isoforms containing a heparin binding site (Y+) and all muscle-derived isoforms are dispensable for major steps in synaptogenesis. Our results also suggest that the requirement of agrin for presynaptic differentiation is mediated indirectly by its ability to promote postsynaptic production or localization of appropriate retrograde signals."

Spatially congruent activations in the prefrontal, temporal, and superior parietal regions and in the anterior supplementary motor area were observed for both languages and in both experiments at the individual and group levels of analysis. Proficient bilinguals exposed to both languages early in life utilize common neuroanatomical regions during the conceptual and syntactic processing of written language irrespective of their differences in surface features."
https://openalex.org/W1970564284,"Zinc (Zn2+) inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity involves both voltage-independent and voltage-dependent components. Recombinant NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors exhibit similar voltage-dependent block, but voltage-independent Zn2+ inhibition occurs with much higher affinity for NR1/NR2A than NR1/NR2B receptors (nanomolar versus micromolar IC50, respectively). Here, we show that two neighboring histidine residues on NR2A represent the critical determinant (termed the “short spacer”) for high-affinity, voltage-independent Zn2+ inhibition using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of either one of these two histidine residues (H42 and H44) in the extracellular N-terminal domain of NR2A shifted the IC50 for high-affinity Zn2+ inhibition ∼200-fold without affecting the EC50 of the coagonists NMDA and glycine. We suggest that the mechanism of high-affinity Zn2+ inhibition on the NMDAR involves enhancement of proton inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2038359286,"Several distinct mechanisms may cause synaptic depression, a common form of short−term synaptic plasticity. These include postsynaptic receptor desensitization, presynaptic depletion of releasable vesicles, or other presynaptic mechanisms depressing vesicle release. At the endbulb of Held, a fast central calyceal synapse in the auditory pathway, cyclothiazide (CTZ) abolished marked paired pulse depression (PPD) by acting presynaptically to enhance transmitter release, rather than by blocking postsynaptic receptor desensitization. PPD and its response to CTZ were not altered by prior depletion of the releasable vesicle pool but were blocked by lowering external calcium concentration, while raising external calcium enhanced PPD. We conclude that a major component of PPD at the endbulb is due to a novel, transient depression of release, which is dependent on the level of presynaptic calcium entry and is CTZ sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W2042774241,"In beta cells from the pancreas, ATP-sensitive potassium channels, or KATP channels, are composed of two subunits, SUR1 and KIR6.2, assembled in a (SUR1/KIR6.2)4 stoichiometry. The correct stoichiometry of channels at the cell surface is tightly regulated by the presence of novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals in SUR1 and KIR6.2; incompletely assembled KATPchannels fail to exit the ER/cis-Golgi compartments. In addition to these retrograde signals, we show that the C terminus of SUR1 has an anterograde signal, composed in part of a dileucine motif and downstream phenylalanine, which is required for KATPchannels to exit the ER/cis-Golgi compartments and transit to the cell surface. Deletion of as few as seven amino acids, including the phenylalanine, from SUR1 markedly reduces surface expression of KATP channels. Mutations leading to truncation of the C terminus of SUR1 are one cause of a severe, recessive form of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy.

The same motif is found in SUR1 and SUR2 on the N-terminal side of NBF1. Deletion or mutation of the KIR signal permits surface expression of KIR subunits without SUR1, whereas mutation of the SUR1 signal gives surface expression without a KIR.

Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C terminus of SUR1 affects KATPchannel activity measured here by a 86Rb+efflux assay. The SUR1ΔC2 and ΔC4/KIR6.2 channels show glibenclamide-inhibited 86Rb+ efflux attributable to KATP channels which is comparable with wild-type channels (Fig. 1 A); the SUR1ΔC7/KIR6.2 channels show approximately a 50% decrease in activity, while a complete loss of activity is observed for the SUR1ΔC13, ΔC22, and ΔC49/KIR6.2 channels. The results suggest that the last 5 to 13 amino acids of the C terminus of SUR1 are essential for obtaining channel activity. To determine whether the SUR1 C terminus was masking the ER retention signal on KIR6.2 (11Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), we co-expressed the SUR1ΔC constructs with KIR6.2ΔC35 missing 35 residues from its C terminus (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in the rates of86Rb+ efflux between the SUR1ΔC/KIR6.2 versusSUR1ΔC/KIR6.2ΔC35 channels (Fig. 1 A), indicating that the loss of channel activity resulting from deletion of the C terminus of SUR1 does not depend on the presence of the ER retention signal on KIR6.2. SUR1 is differentially glycosylated, exhibiting a mature or complex glycosylated form (150–170 kDa) and an immature or core glycosylated form (140 kDa) (3Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 16Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Vu Q.A. Humphrey M.B. Boyd III A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8218-8224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature SUR1 is present only when the receptor is co-expressed with KIR6.1 or KIR6.2 and has been shown to assemble with KIR6.2 to form active KATP channels in the plasma membrane (3Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The mature receptor is resistant to Endo H, whereas the immature, core glycosylated species is deglycosylated to a 137-kDa species (data not shown). Endo H removes high mannose oligosaccharide chains that are added in the ER, thus the appearance of an Endo H-resistant form indicates processing of the oligosaccharides beyond thecis-Golgi. Co-expression of SUR1ΔC2 or ΔC4 with KIR6.2 yields both the immature and mature glycosylated forms of SUR1 as shown in Fig. 1 B using125I-iodoazidoglibenclamide to identify the receptors. SUR1ΔC7, ΔC13, ΔC22, and ΔC49 show essentially a complete lack of complex glycosylation. The results are consistent with either a defect in the processing of oligosaccharides on the C-terminal truncated receptors, with a failure of the receptors to traffic to the medial Golgi apparatus and thus the cell surface, or with a failure of subunits to co-assemble. We used luminometry to quantify the appearance of SUR1c-myc at the cell surface (Fig.1 C). The results confirm the observation that co-expression of SUR1 and KIR6.2 markedly increases their surface expression (11Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Co-expression of KIR6.2 with full-length SUR1c-myc produced the greatest differential. The SUR1ΔC2c-myc and ΔC4c-myc constructs give ∼ 60% of this increase, whereas further deletions reduced surface expression to background values. The loss of surface expression observed with C-terminal deletion parallels the loss of mature SUR1 (Fig.1 B) and KATP channel activity (Fig.1 A). The results are consistent with a failure of the C-terminal deleted receptors to traffic beyond the cis-Golgi to the plasma membrane. To determine whether KIR6.2 and the SUR1ΔC subunits were co-assembling, we tested whether the inward rectifier would photolabel with 125I-azidoglibenclamide and co-immunoprecipitate when expressed with the truncated receptors. Fig.2 (left panel) shows that when SUR1ΔC49 or SUR1ΔC221 are co-expressed with KIR6.2, both the receptor and inward rectifier are photolabeled consistent with their physical association with SUR1. We have previously shown that the inward rectifier alone does not label (3Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Comparison with the wild-type control indicates that the mature form of the receptor is absent in both cases. The right panel in Fig. 2 demonstrates that the truncated receptor and inward rectifier co-assemble. When N-6X-hisSUR1ΔC49, tagged with six histidine residues at its N terminus, is co-expressed with KIR6.2, the inward rectifier labels with 125I-iodoazidoglibenclamide and can be co-immunoprecipitated using anti-histidine tag antibodies (Fig. 2,Co-IP). The results indicate the C-terminal truncated receptors can assemble with KIR6.2 but then fail to traffic into the Golgi and plasma membrane. To determine which amino acids in the C terminus of SUR are important, we compared the distal 25 amino acids of SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B (Fig.3 A). The amino acids 24, 22, 17, 9, and 5 residues from the C-terminal were conserved, whereas amino acid 16 was one of a dileucine pair. We engineered alanine substitutions at positions Val-1578, Phe-1574, Leu-1567, Leu-1566, and Asp-1561 in SUR1c-myc, co-expressed them with KIR6.2, and analyzed their channel activity and surface expression. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, substitution of alanine at positions Phe-1574 and Leu-1566 gave parallel reductions in KATP channel activity measured as glibenclamide-inhibited efflux and in surface expression measured by the appearance of the myc tag. Companion experiments indicate there is a parallel decrease in maturation of the receptor (data not shown). Single channel recordings of the SUR1F1574A/Kir6.2 channels (Fig.4) shows that their ATP sensitivity is similar to wild-type channels (IC50(ATP) = 8.9 ± 03 μm versus 6.9 ± 03 μm for wild type (WT)), but their surface density (N) is ∼5–6 times lower than that of the wild-type, consistent with the86Rb+ efflux and surface expression results. We conclude that amino acids Phe-1574 and Leu-1566 are a part of an anterograde trafficking signal that is required for the surface expression of KATP channels. These results identify an export or anterograde signal on the C terminus of the sulfonylurea receptor, SUR1, which is required for surface expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The anterograde signal and the recently described “−RKR−” endoplasmic reticulum retention, or retrograde, signal in SUR and in the C termini of KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 are summarized schematically in Fig. 5. These signals act as a quality control mechanism to ensure that only fully assembled, octameric ATP-sensitive potassium channels reach the plasma membrane. The results are consistent with our previous observations on glycosylation of the receptor. The mature, complex glycosylated receptor is Endo H-resistant, whereas the immature, core-glycosylated receptor is Endo H-sensitive. The Endo H resistance of mature SUR1 indicates it has been transported from the ER and cis-Golgi to the medial and trans-Golgi where further processing takes place. The mature receptor has been shown to be associated with KIR6.2 as a large octameric complex consistent with its being in active KATP channels on the cell surface (3Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Their Endo H sensitivity indicates the immature, core glycosylated receptors are retained in the ER and cis-Golgi and do not undergo further processing. Expression of SUR1 without KIR6.1 or KIR6.2 produces the immature form of the receptor (3Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observed lack of surface expression of SUR1 in Xenopus oocytes (11Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and in COSm6 cells (Fig. 1 C) unless KIR6.1 or KIR6.2 are present and indicates the retrograde signals must be masked before the assembled channels can exit the ER andcis-Golgi. Deletion of as few as seven residues from the C terminus of SUR1 reduces the amount of mature receptor, the level of surface expression, and the density of KATP channels when the receptor is expressed with KIR6.2. Co-photolabeling of SUR1 and KIR6.2 with125I-iodoazidoglibenclamide and co-immunoprecipitation of the two subunits indicates they can assemble, which suggests the C terminus of SUR is not required for subunit association. Analysis of the currents from SUR1F1574A/KIR6.2 channels indicates they retain normal sensitivity to ATP, but the density of channels is reduced. Expression of KIR6.2ΔC subunits with SUR1ΔC subunits does not lead to surface expression of channels, indicating that the C terminus of SUR does not mask the–RKR− signal in KIR, and our preliminary data indicate it does not mask the –RKR− signal in SUR1. Previous work indicates that SUR1 increases the surface expression of KIR6.2ΔC subunits approximately 8-fold, consistent with the involvement of the anterograde signal in a process that facilitates trafficking to the cell surface (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Substitution of alanines at positions Phe-1574 and Leu-1566 indicate the importance of these residues for anterograde transit of KATP channels. Dileucine motifs have been shown to be important in protein trafficking from the trans-Golgi to a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment (17Letourneur F. Klausner R.D.

Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of the first leucine of the vasopressin V2 receptor has a much larger inhibitory effect than substitution of the second, the same pattern as we observe for SUR1. However, mutation of Asp-1561, five residues upstream of the dileucine motif in SUR1 had no significant effect, whereas an E → Q substitution in the vasopressin V2 receptor largely eliminates surface expression. The vasopressin V2 receptor has no downstream phenylalanine corresponding to SUR1Phe-1574. The cellular receptors for these signaling motifs have not been identified, and it is unclear whether the C terminus of SUR interacts with COPI or COPII proteins or with COP-associated adaptor proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 27Bannykh S.I.

These observations give a molecular insight into the lack of KATP channel activity observed in pancreatic beta cells from patients with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. Mutations in both SUR1, HI-SUR1, and KIR6.2, HI-KIR6.2, are the cause of a recessive form of this disorder which is characterized by an inappropriate secretion of insulin despite hypoglycemia (5Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 6Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 336-346Google Scholar, 33Permutt M.A. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 347-355Google Scholar). Nonsense and splice site mutations in SUR1 produce C-terminal deletions (5Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) that have been shown to result in a complete loss of KATP channel activity (34Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A.

Although many of the truncated receptors may be incapable of producing functional channels for other reasons, our results indicate that even if channels do assemble they will not reach the cell surface and that the “primary” defect associated with mutations in SUR1 that truncate the receptor will be a failure to traffic correctly as a result of deleting the anterograde signal."

Because the mechanism underlying GM-CSF-dependent priming is not understood, we investigated the effects of GM-CSF on the phosphorylation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components p47 phox and p67 phox. Preincubation of neutrophils with GM-CSF alone increased the phosphorylation of p47 phox but not that of p67 phox. Addition of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) to GM-CSF-pretreated neutrophils resulted in more intense phosphorylation of p47 phox than with GM-CSF alone and fMLP alone. GM-CSF-induced p47 phox phosphorylation was time- and concentration-dependent and ran parallel to the priming effect of GM-CSF on superoxide production. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of p47 phox showed that GM-CSF induced phosphorylation of one major peptide. fMLP alone induced phosphorylation of several peptides, an effect enhanced by GM-CSF pretreatment. In contrast to fMLP and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of p47 phoxwas not inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the phosphorylation of p47 phox induced by GM-CSF and by fMLP but not that induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. GM-CSF alone did not induce p47 phox or p67 phox translocation to the membrane, but neutrophils treated consecutively with GM-CSF and fMLP showed an increase (compared with fMLP alone) in membrane translocation of p47 phox and p67 phox. Taken together, these results show that the priming action of GM-CSF on the neutrophil respiratory burst involves partial phosphorylation of p47 phox on specific serines and suggest the involvement of a priming pathway regulated by protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils play a key role in host defenses against invading microorganisms. In response to a variety of stimuli, neutrophils release large quantities of superoxide anion (O⨪2) in a phenomenon known as the respiratory burst. O⨪2 is the precursor of potent oxidants, which are essential for bacterial killing and also potentiate inflammatory reactions (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1984; 64: 959-966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophil production of O⨪2 is dependent on the respiratory burst oxidase, or NADPH oxidase, a multicomponent enzyme system that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of oxygen to O⨪2 (2Chanock S.J.

Different kinases have been shown to phosphorylate p47 phox in vitro, but the regulatory pathways involved in different conditions of stimulation in vivo are unknown.

Neutrophils were preincubated with GM-CSF (500 pm) for 20 min in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm NaN3, then stimulated with fMLP (10−7m).

Significant differences were detected using the Student's t test. Fig. 1(lower panel) shows that GM-CSF alone did not induce superoxide production; in contrast, it potentiated the respiratory burst induced by 10−7m fMLP, in accordance with the literature (7Elbim C.

To determine the effect of GM-CSF on p47 phox and p67 phoxphosphorylation, 32P-Loaded neutrophils were treated with GM-CSF (500 pm for 20 min) and then stimulated with 10−7m fMLP. p47 phoxand p67 phox were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel), p47 phox phosphorylation in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils was clearly higher than in untreated cells (202.7 ± 8.5% of control untreated cells (n = 4,p < 0.01) as determined by densitometry analysis); fMLP (10−7m) also stimulated the phosphorylation of p47 phox (210.5 ± 15% of control (n = 4, p < 0.01). Pretreatment of neutrophils with GM-CSF and subsequent stimulation with fMLP resulted in stronger phosphorylation than that induced by each agent alone (410.5 ± 17.7% of control (n = 4,p < 0.01). Western blot analysis (middle panel) showed that the same amount of p47 phox was immunoprecipitated from each sample. p47 phox was not detected when irrelevant control antibodies were used (data not shown). Because p67 phox is also phosphorylated during NADPH oxidase activation (18Dusi S. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19El Benna J. Dang P.M.C.

In addition, GM-CSF did not increase the p67 phox phosphorylation induced by fMLP (10−7m) (data not shown). To attempt to establish a relationship between p47 phox phosphorylation and the priming effect of GM-CSF on superoxide production, we performed parallel kinetics and concentration-effect studies on these two processes. As shown in Fig.2, p47 phoxphosphorylation increased with the GM-CSF incubation time. The time course of p47 phox phosphorylation ran closely parallel to the kinetics of GM-CSF-primed superoxide production in response to fMLP (10−7m). In addition, a concentration-dependent effect analysis showed a parallel increase in p47 phox phosphorylation and the priming effect on superoxide production, reaching a plateau at 500 pm (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effect of the concentration of GM-CSF on p47 phox phosphorylation and priming of the fMLP-induced respiratory burst. Neutrophils were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF for 20 min at 37 °C. p47 phox phosphorylation was analyzed (panel A), and the cells were stimulated with fMLP (10−7m); superoxide production was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ±S.E. of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) p47 phox is phosphorylated on several serines in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein (23El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic peptide mapping of p47 phox showed that these phosphorylated serines were located on several peptides on the map: six major peptides with strong phosphorylation were regularly present, and a few minor peptides were less strongly phosphorylated and more irregular. As shown in Fig. 4, GM-CSF (500 pm) induced the phosphorylation of only one major p47 phox peptide, whereas fMLP (10−7m) induced weak phosphorylation of all the peptides. Furthermore, pretreatment of neutrophils with GM-CSF followed by stimulation with fMLP (10−7m) resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of all the peptides. This suggested that GM-CSF induced partial phosphorylation of p47 phox on only certain serines that could potentiate the phosphorylation of the other serines on secondary fMLP stimulation. We then analyzed the pathways involved in p47 phoxphosphorylation by GM-CSF relative to fMLP and PMA (Fig.5). Preincubation of neutrophils for 15 min with the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X (5 μm) did not inhibit p47 phox phosphorylation induced by GM-CSF (Fig. 5 A) but inhibited that induced by fMLP (10−6m) and PMA (0.5 μg/ml) (Fig.5 B). Pretreatment of neutrophils with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the phosphorylation induced by GM-CSF and fMLP but not that induced by PMA (Fig. 5). These results were confirmed using other protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erbstatin (100 μm) and lavendustin (25 μm); wortmannin (50 nm) and LY294002 (100 μm) also inhibited this phosphorylation (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the pathway controlling p47 phox phosphorylation in response to GM-CSF is totally different from that underlying the action of PMA and might belong to the multiple pathways used by fMLP. Because p47 phox phosphorylation was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, we analyzed the phosphorylated amino acids of p47 phox isolated from GM-CSF-treated neutrophils. Fig. 6 shows that p47 phox was phosphorylated only on serines. In addition, no phosphorylated tyrosines were detected by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). This result suggests that a genistein-sensitive protein-tyrosine kinase is an upstream regulator of a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates p47 phox. NADPH oxidase assembly at the membrane site is dependent on complete phosphorylation of p47 phox (17Okamura N. Curnutte J.T. Roberts R.L Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the partial phosphorylation of p47 phox induced by GM-CSF was insufficient to induce p47 phox or p67 phox translocation (Fig.7). However, neutrophil priming by GM-CSF followed by stimulation with 10−7m fMLP resulted in stronger translocation than that observed with fMLP alone (163.8 ± 13.8% and 177.5 ± 10.6% control (fMLP alone) (n = 4, p < 0.01) for p47 phox and p67 phox, respectively, as determined by densitometry analysis). This suggested that prephosphorylation of p47 phox induced by GM-CSF may accelerate the completion of p47 phoxphosphorylation on other sites and the movement of the cytosolic subunits to membranes. GM-CSF alone induced partial phosphorylation of the cytosolic oxidase component p47 phox, suggesting a role of this process in the priming effect of GM-CSF on the respiratory burst. The kinetics and dose-effect studies of GM-CSF-induced p47 phox phosphorylation was parallel to GM-CSF-induced priming of superoxide production by neutrophils in response to fMLP 10−7m. This phosphorylation was distinct from that induced by PMA, which phosphorylates other peptides and the sensitivity of which to protein kinase inhibitors (GF109203X, genistein, and wortmannin) was totally different. In addition, the partial GM-CSF-induced p47 phoxphosphorylation differed from fMLP-induced phosphorylation, as it was insensitive to GF109203X, although it was also inhibited by genistein and wortmannin. These results suggest that the GM-CSF priming pathway might share one of the multiple pathways used by fMLP signaling. Furthermore, GM-CSF increased both the degree of phosphorylation of p47 phox peptides and the translocation of p47 phox and p67 phox when fMLP was subsequently added at a low concentration. These results suggest that GM-CSF triggers phosphorylation of only certain serines on p47 phox that represent the first cytosolic step in the phosphorylation cascade, as GM-CSF alone did not induce p47 phox or p67 phoxmembrane translocation. Stepwise phosphorylation of p47 phox has previously been suggested on the basis of two-dimensional gel analysis in cytochromeb-deficient neutrophils (17Okamura N. Curnutte J.T. Roberts R.L Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during translocation to the membranes (27Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol.

However, DeLeo et al. (11DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) recently reported that priming of the respiratory burst by lipopolysaccharide resulted in translocation of cytochrome b and p47 phox but not p67 phoxor rac2. The mechanisms underlying lipopolysaccharide priming could be different from those underlying GM-CSF and IL-8 priming. Our observation that GM-CSF induced partial p47 phox phosphorylation but not p67 phox phosphorylation supports the idea that p47 phox phosphorylation on critical sites plays a major role in the priming of NADPH oxidase in intact cells. The position of the phosphorylated peptides on the phosphopeptide map of p47 phox (24El Benna J. Faust L.P. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) suggests that candidate targets for GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation are serines 328, 345, 348, 359, and 370, contrary to serines 303, 304, 320, and 315. The GM-CSF receptor is not coupled to classical G proteins. Engagement of GM-CSF with its receptor activates a number of signal transduction pathways, including protein-tyrosine kinase (30Gaudry M.

Our inhibition experiments suggest that a genistein-sensitive protein-tyrosine kinase and PI3K are involved in GM-CSF-induced partial p47 phox phosphorylation and in NADPH oxidase priming. Genistein and wortmannin also inhibited GM-CSF priming of the respiratory burst in response to fMLP in parallel to p47 phox phosphorylation (data not shown). In addition, Kodama et al. (35Kodama T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Okada T. Ui M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recently described a close correlation between the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on PI3K activity, superoxide production, and p47 phoxphosphorylation in GM-CSF-primed and fMLP-treated neutrophils; their results support our hypothesis. The GM-CSF receptor interacts with lyn, a member of the src-family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family, and PI3K can be directly regulated by lyn (31Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K.

Because we only detected phosphorylated serines on p47 phox, these data suggest that GM-CSF activates Ser/Thr-protein kinase(s) that phosphorylate(s) p47 phox downstream of lyn and PI3K. In addition, GF109203X-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms are not involved in this process. In conclusion, the data presented here show that priming of the neutrophil respiratory burst by GM-CSF results in partial p47 phox phosphorylation, which increases the degree of p47 phox phosphorylation and NADPH oxidase assembly in response to a secondary applied stimulus such as fMLP. This GM-CSF priming pathway involves one or more protein-tyrosine kinases and PI3K. Identification of the Ser/Thr kinase involved in p47 phox phosphorylation will require further investigations.

To investigate mechanisms of localization, we used biolistic techniques to express GFP-tagged PSD-95 (PSD-95:GFP) and the K(+)-selective channel Kv1.4 in slices of rat cortex. In pyramidal cells, PSD-95:GFP required a single PDZ domain and a region including the SH3 domain for localization to postsynaptic sites. When transfected alone, PSD-95:GFP was present in dendrites but absent from axons. When cotransfected with Kv1.4, PSD-95:GFP appeared in both axons and dendrites, while Kv1.4 was restricted to axons. When domains that mediate the interaction of Kv1.4 and PSD-95 were disrupted, Kv1.4 localized nonspecifically. Our results provide evidence that Kv1.4 itself may determine its subcellular location, while an associated MAGUK protein is a necessary but not sufficient cofactor."

Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the secretion of soluble amyloid Aβ peptide, the mechanisms for the accumulation of insoluble amyloid deposits and their role in AD pathogenesis remains a matter of speculation. It is clear that at least two pathways for APP processing give rise to fragments bearing Aβ sequences at their amino termini: processing by α-secretase, which cleaves within the Aβ sequence, thereby precluding amyloid accumulation, and β-secretase processing, which generates carboxyl-terminal APP fragments containing the Aβ sequence. Amyloidogenic, β-secretase processing events may take place within several intracellular organelles, including the rough endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and lysosomes (1Wild-Bode C.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The pH optimum for β-sheet formation and aggregation is between pH 4.0 and 5.5 (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M.

Perhaps because of the fact that it aggregates much more rapidly, Aβ1–42 is resistant to degradation once it has been internalized by endocytosis. It accumulates as an insoluble residue in late endosomes or secondary lysosomes, whereas Aβ1–40 and shorter peptides are degraded and eliminated (15Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J.

Brain Res. 1997; 746: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The amyloid that accumulates in AD is structurally heterogeneous with ragged amino termini, but most of the Aβ peptides end at residue 42 (17Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 18Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The amyloid that accumulates in AD brain has the hallmarks of a long-lived protein, such as d-amino acids and isopeptide bonds (19Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3072-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selective resistance of aggregated Aβ1–42 to degradation provides a simple and direct mechanism for why Aβ1–42 preferentially accumulates in the brain (17Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 18Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The accumulation of insoluble Aβ1–42 in lysosomes also alters the catabolism of APP and causes the accumulation of APP and a series of potentially APP amyloidogenic fragments (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Davis-Salinas J. Saporito-Irwin S.M. Cotman C.W. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Like the internalized Aβ1–42, these fragments accumulate in the insoluble fraction of the cell and display very long half-lives (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Several features of this accumulation are analogous to prion replication (22Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 349-363PubMed Google Scholar). The prion model postulates a conformation change in the precursor protein preceding their proteolytic conversion to more prions. The APP amyloidogenic fragments appear to undergo such a conformation change, since they display an epitope that is specifically associated with Aβ aggregates (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that they may have the same shape as aggregated Aβ and are therefore capable of adding on to the fibril lattice established by the internalized exogenous Aβ1–42. The fact that they co-purify in the insoluble fraction of the cell is consistent with the suggestion that they co-aggregate (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The accumulation of amyloid is autocatalytic as predicted for prion replication, and once amyloid core is seeded, the continued presence of exogenous Aβ1–42 is not required for further accumulation of APP and amyloidogenic fragments (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To complete the prion-like cycle, the APP amyloidogenic fragments would need to be further proteolytically processed to Aβ. In this report, we examined whether the addition of exogenous Aβ1–42 causes the accumulation of newly synthesized intracellular Aβ. Here we describe that 4-kDa Aβ, especially Aβn-42, is produced from metabolically labeled APP molecules and accumulates in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells that have been incubated with synthetic Aβ1–42. Most of the newly synthesized Aβ peptides that accumulate have ragged amino termini and end at residue 42. The structure of these peptides is remarkably similar to the structure described for amyloid Aβ isolated from Alzheimer's brain tissue (17Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar,18Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), suggesting that much of the brain amyloid may be derived from this solid-phase, intracellular pathway. Transfected cell cultures (1 × 107 cells in a 10-cm plate) were incubated with methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h before labeling. The cells were then incubated in 2 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 μm amyloid peptide and 1% bovine serum albumin and labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol, Tran35S-label, ICN) for 16 h. At the end of incubation time, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 unit/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/ml aprotinin). The insoluble cell lysate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, solubilized in 88% formic acid (v/w), and lyophilized. After lyophilization, the dried sample was resolubilized with 2× radioimmune precipitation buffer, sonicated until clarified, diluted to 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant of sample was then subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with various antibodies and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. APP751-overexpressing cells were preincubated with methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h before labeling. The cells were then incubated in 2 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 μm Aβ1–42 and 1% bovine serum albumin and labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol; Tran35S-label, ICN) for 16 h. At the end of labeling period, the cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The insoluble cell pellet was then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and solublized in 88% formic acid. The formic acid-solublized cell fraction was then injected over a Superdex 75 gel filtration column that had been previously equilibrated in 60% formic acid. The sample was eluted from the gel filtration column in 60% formic acid at 1 ml/min. The fractions containing Aβ were then pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized material was then redissolved in 60% formic acid and subjected to a second round of reverse-phase HPLC chromatography in a Vydac C-4 column. The sample was eluted in a 5–95% ACN gradient, and fractions coeluted with synthetic Aβ1–42 were collected for further analysis. APP751-transfected cells were metabolically labeled with either [35S]Met or [3H]Phe, and the secreted or intracellular Aβ were then purified as described above. The amyloid peptides were then subjected to automated Edman degradation amino acid sequencing analysis, and the amount of [3H]Phe radioactivity eluted from each sequencing cycle was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. In the case of [35S]Met-labeled amyloid peptide sequencing reaction, 4,000 cpm of purified labeled Aβ was mixed with 10 μg of synthetic Aβ1–42 in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) and digested with 0.1 μg of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 16 h. The [35S]Met-containing tryptic fragments (Aβ29–42) were then collected by centrifugation on a tabletop centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was then washed two times with water and dissolved in 40% ACN, 60% formic acid right before the radiochemical sequence analysis. Our previous work indicates that Aβ1–42 preferentially accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes of both cultured human fibroblast and PC12 cells and is resistant to degradation. We examined whether the presence of intracellular Aβ affects the catabolism of APP and Aβ in APP-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells since both nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic APP-processing pathways have been demonstrated in this cell line. Previous studies on the uptake of125I-labeled Aβ1–42 demonstrated that most of the internalized 125I-labeled Aβ is sedimentable at 10,000 × g (15Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Knauer M.F. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1997; 746: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because the amyloidogenic fragments of APP also accumulate in the nonionic detergent-insoluble fraction of cells treated with Aβ1–42 (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we investigated whether some of these fragments are ultimately converted to 4-kDa Aβ. APP-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells were treated with Aβ1–42, metabolically labeled with [35S]Met for 16 h, and then lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described under “Materials and Methods.” The Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction was then dissolved in 88% formic acid, lyophilized, and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the 100,000 ×g-soluble supernatant was immunoprecipitated with antibodies raised against Aβ1–42, Aβ1–28, or the carboxyl terminus of APP (13G8). All three antibodies immunoprecipitate a broad size range of labeled products from Aβ1–42-treated cells that are absent in untreated cells (Fig. 1 A). Because of the low efficiency of immunoprecipitation with anti-Aβ antibodies due to the presence of the exogenously supplied, unlabeled Aβ1–42, we devised a more specific method of immunoprecipitating Aβ using cells that were treated with synthetic Aβ4–42 instead of Aβ1–42. We verified that Aβ4–42 is not recognized by an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, 3D6, that recognizes the first 5 residues of Aβ (Fig. 1 B). When the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells treated with Aβ4–42 is immunoprecipitated with this antibody, a small amount of 4-kDa Aβ is detected (lane 5, Fig.1 A indicated by arrow). To further demonstrate that the accumulation of intracellular newly synthesized Aβ is because of the Aβ treatment, a time course analysis was performed. APP-overexpressing cells were treated with 25 μm Aβ, and the amount of 35S-labeled Aβ was then detected by immunoprecipitation at indicated times. Our previously published data (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the results from this study (Fig. 1 A) indicate that there is a large amount of APP carboxyl-terminal fragments in this insoluble fraction after Aβ treatment. To improve the sensitivity of Aβ detection by eliminating the cross-reactivity between the APP carboxyl-terminal fragments and the anti-Aβ antibody, cell extracts were preabsorbed with anti-APP carboxyl-terminal antibodies (13G8) before immunoprecipitation with the anti-Aβ antibody, 3D6. As shown in Fig. 1 C, there is no detectable newly synthesized [35S]Met-labeled Aβ in the first 4 h of Aβ incubation. Newly synthesized Aβ is first observed after 6 h of Aβ treatment, suggesting that the 35S-labeled Aβ is derived from the amyloidogenic APP fragments that accumulate in the insoluble fraction of cells that have internalized Aβ1–42. This observation is consistent with the recent findings that Aβ1–42 can be produced intracellularly in the detergent-insoluble fraction of both cultured human NT2 neurons and APP-overexpressing human embryonic kidney cells (1Wild-Bode C.

Med. 1997; 3: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), suggesting that a common amyloidogenic pathway exists in these cells. To further characterize the newly synthesized 4-kDa Aβ generated by cells treated with Aβ, we size-selected the 4-kDa fraction using gel filtration methods that were developed to isolate and characterize 4-kDa Aβ from insoluble brain amyloid deposits (19Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3072-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APP-overexpressing cells were treated with Aβ1–42 and metabolically labeled with [35S]Met for 6–12 h and then lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described under “Materials and Methods.” The Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction was then dissolved in 60% formic acid and then loaded onto a Superdex 75HR size exclusion column and eluted in 60% formic acid as described (19Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A peak elutes between fractions 27 and 30 that co-migrates with authentic Aβ1–42 and is absent from control cells that were not treated with Aβ1–42. (Fig.2 A). The Aβ42-containing fractions (fractions 27–30, as indicated on Fig. 2 A) were pooled and further purified by a semi-preparative reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the majority of the35S-labeled material in the 4-kDa peak from the gel filtration column elutes as a broad peak from fractions 31–51, and the peak is coincident with the elution profile of synthetic Aβ1–42. Therefore, most of the newly synthesized, [35S]Met-labeled Aβ elutes with a profile that is identical to authentic Aβ1–42. As we reported earlier and shown in Fig. 2 B (inset), Aβ1–40 elutes as a sharp peak on an analytical reverse-phase HPLC that precedes the broad elution profile of Aβ1–42 (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sharp peak of [35S]Met-labeled material elutes at fraction 31, and this elution position is identical to synthetic Aβ1–40. This suggests that the [35S]Met-labeled insoluble fraction contains a mixture of Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40, and this question is addressed in greater detail below. We radiochemically sequenced the purified 4-kDa newly synthesized Aβ from Aβ1–42-treated cells to determine the amino terminus of newly synthesized intracellular Aβ. APP-overexpressing cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]Phe overnight in the presence of 25 μmAβ1–42, and the [3H]Phe-labeled peptides were then purified as described above and subjected to automated Edman degradation amino acid sequence analysis. Phenylalanine residues occur in the Aβ sequence at positions 4, 19, and 20. As indicated on Fig.3 A, the [3H]Phe radioactivity from peptide isolated from the insoluble fraction of cell lysate is detected in two major peak fractions (fractions 2–10 and fractions 18–22). This result indicates that the [3H]Phe-labeled Aβ is “ragged” at its amino terminus, containing both longer and shorter peptides than those beginning at residue 1. To confirm that the radiochemical sequence is derived from amyloid Aβ peptides, we radiochemically sequenced [35S]Met-labeled peptides after cleaving them with trypsin to create homogeneous ends. The Aβ sequence contains one methionine residue at position 35 that would occur at cycle 7 after trypsin cleavage at lysine 28. The purified intracellular [35S]Met-labeled Aβ was subjected to tryptic fragmentation, and the hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal fragment from residues 28–42 was purified as described previously (19Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3072-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to radiochemical Edman sequence analysis. Sixty percent of the total starting 35S label was recovered in the purified carboxyl-terminal fragment. As indicated in Fig. 3 B, the [35S]Met radioactivity begins in cycle 7, which is consistent with the predicted Aβ sequence. The lag in [35S]Met radioactivity eluting at cycles 8 and 9 was also observed in the Met yield obtained chemically in the same cycles. The [35S]Met is quantitatively released during sequencing, and no labeled material remained associated with the filter. These results provide independent confirmation that the radiochemical sequence obtained is derived from Aβ rather than from contaminating peptides. The presence of ragged amino termini suggests that the ends of the Aβ peptides accumulating in the insoluble fraction of the cell may be generated by relatively nonspecific proteolysis. The proteolytic trimming of exogenously supplied synthetic Aβ1–42 has been previously observed for exogenously added peptide after internalization in human fibroblasts (15Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, the radiochemical sequence of Aβ isolated from cultured media is much more homogeneous, and [3H]Phe radioactivity can only be detected in fractions 4, 19, and 20, suggesting the amino terminus of soluble Aβ is generated by a more specific mechanism (25Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Aβ isolated from the plaques of the brains of Alzheimer's patients also contained such amino-terminal truncation as we describe here (18Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S.

Lett. 1996; 215: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our early study from the biochemical properties of synthetic Aβ indicated that Aβ1–42 rather than Aβ1–40 is able to form SDS-resistant aggregates and migrates as a 16-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at high concentrations (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of SDS-resistant Aβ aggregates is demonstrated in Fig.4 A, where trace amounts of14C-labeled Aβ1–42 are mixed with increasing amounts of unlabeled Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 individually. A 16-kDa SDS-resistant aggregate is only observed at higher concentrations of radiolabeled Aβ1–42 with unlabeled Aβ1–42, whereas the radiolabeled Aβ1–42 does not co-assemble into 16-kDa SDS-resistant aggregates with unlabeled Aβ1–40. Therefore, this property can be used to distinguish between the metabolically labeled Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 and shorter Aβ peptides. The HPLC-purified, [35S]Met-labeled intracellular Aβ was mixed with synthetic Aβ1–28, Aβ1–42, and Aβ1–40 at a concentration of 500 μg/ml at pH 5.0 for 24 h. The labeled peptide forms 16-kDa SDS-resistant aggregates only with synthetic Aβ1–42 but not Aβ1–40 (indicated by the arrowhead, Fig. 4 B), suggesting that a fraction of the newly synthesized [35S]Met Aβ from the insoluble fraction of cell lysate is Aβ1–42 or closely related products that are capable of co-assembling with synthetic Aβ1–42 into SDS-resistant aggregates. Recently, an analytical, chromatographic method for separating Aβ1–42 from Aβ1–40 was described that employed reverse-phase separation at high temperature (29Chloupek R.C. Hancock W.S. Marchylo B.A. Kirkland J.J. Boyes B.E. Snyder L.R. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 686: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.5 A, Aβ1–42 can be resolved as a single peak on a Zorbax C-18 reverse-phase column at 65 °C and is well separated from Aβ1–40 by almost 2 min. The purified 4-kDa radiolabeled peptides were dissolved in 1 ml of 70% formic acid and injected onto a Zorbax C-18 reverse-phase column. The radioactive sample was then eluted by a 20–45% ACN gradient at 65 °C, and the fractions that coeluted with synthetic Aβ1–42 peptides were collected for further analysis (Fig. 5 B). The radiolabeled peptides elute as two major peaks at the positions of both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, even though the amino termini of the peptides were determined to be ragged by radiochemical sequencing. Our experience is that the carboxyl terminus of Aβ has a dominant influence on their chromatographic behavior (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and synthetic amino-terminal deletions of Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 tend to co-migrate with the peptides beginning at position 1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that a mixture of Aβn-42 and Aβn-40 are produced from APP and accumulate in cells treated with Aβ1–42. Our results suggest that a solid-phase pathway for the simultaneous production and accumulation of amyloid Aβ exists within late endosomes or secondary lysosomes of cells that contain degradation-resistant Aβ1–42 aggregates. We have previously shown that the presence of intracellular Aβ1–42 aggregates alters the normal catabolism of APP to cause the accumulation of APP and potentially amyloidogenic APP fragments in lysosomes of cultured cells. In this report, we have demonstrated that newly synthesized 4-kDa Aβ also accumulates in the same insoluble fraction as the amyloidogenic APP fragments. Because of the requirement for exogenously added synthetic Aβ1–42 to initiate the accumulation of insoluble fragments of APP, we must rely on radiochemical methods to unambiguously distinguish the newly synthesized Aβ that is derived from the transfected APP gene from the synthetic Aβ1–42 added to the cell cultures. A [35S]Met-labeled 4-kDa band is immunoprecipitated from the formic acid-soluble fraction with a variety of anti-Aβ antibodies. The efficiency of immunoprecipitation of 4-kDa Aβ is enhanced by using Aβ4–42 instead of Aβ1–42 to prime the cells and immunoprecipitating with 3D6, a monoclonal antibody specific for the first 5 residues of Aβ. Similarly, the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of 4-kDa Aβ is improved by immunodepletion of cross-reacting carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP. Like the amyloid deposits from AD brain, the detergent-insoluble fraction of Aβ1–42-treated cells is largely solubilized in formic acid; therefore, we have used the purification methods employed for purifying Aβ from AD brain to purify and characterize the 4-kDa peptides in the insoluble fraction of Aβ1–42-treated cells. The fractions that elute in formic acid from a Superdex HR75 column at the position of denatured 4-kDa Aβ1–42 were pooled and further purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Most of the radiolabeled material elutes from the reverse-phase HPLC at the same position as Aβ1–42. Radiochemical sequencing of this purified material indicates that the amino termini of these peptides is heterogeneous, with peptide ends both longer and shorter than those beginning at residue 1. The heterogeneity may also be because of non-Aβ contaminants, but after trypsin cleavage to create homogeneous cleavage sites, most of the [35-S]Met label is observed at cycle 7 as expected for Aβ. The carboxyl terminus of the newly synthesized 4-kDa product was characterized by analytical reverse-phase HPLC under conditions that resolve Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40. Although labeled material is recovered in both peaks, most of the radioactivity is associated with Aβ1–42. Perhaps the most convincing evidence that the newly synthesized 4-kDa peptides are Aβ1–42 and closely related structures is the ability to co-assemble into SDS-resistant aggregates with authentic Aβ1–42 at concentrations above the critical concentration for aggregation. This property is specific to Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–43, since no SDS-resistant aggregates are observed for Aβ1–40 even in the presence of a vast excess of Aβ1–42. Thus, the intracellular Aβ displays a number of similarities to the amyloid that accumulates in AD brain tissue. The intracellular amyloid is insoluble in nonionic detergents, but like amyloid isolated from brain, a substantial fraction of the amyloid is soluble in formic acid (17Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 18Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S.

Both the intracellular amyloid and brain amyloid display considerable amino-terminal heterogeneity, and the majority of the amyloid peptides end at residue 42 (17Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 18Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The finding that Aβn-42 accumulates inside cells treated with amyloid Aβ1–42 provides further support for the hypothesis that amyloid accumulation is an autocatalytic process mechanistically related to prion replication. Like PrPsc, the core structure of aggregated Aβn-42 is resistant to proteolysis, both inside cells andin vitro (15Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Knauer M.F. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1997; 746: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Nordstedt C. Naslund J. Tjernberg L.O. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30773-30776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that metabolically labeled, newly synthesized Aβ accumulates indicates that at least a fraction of the APP molecules are converted to more Aβ as the prion replication model predicts. Because the amyloid core is resistant to degradation, this conversion may be carried out by nonspecific proteolysis and exo-peptidase activities. This may explain why the Aβ that accumulates in the insoluble fraction displays ragged amino and carboxyl termini. Misfolded APP molecules and amyloidogenic fragments appear to be intermediates in amyloid accumulation because they also accumulate in the nonionic detergent-insoluble fraction of the cell where they turn over very slowly (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). At least a subset of these amyloidogenic fragments appear to have adopted the same conformation as aggregated Aβ because they display an unique conformation-dependent epitope that is only detected in aggregated Aβ (20Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that the misfolded amyloidogenic APP fragments may be capable of binding to aggregated Aβn-42 and extending the amyloid lattice. Because both amyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal APP fragment precursors and the 4-kDa Aβ product accumulate in the insoluble fraction, the simplest hypothesis is that this conversion takes place in the solid phase. Co-aggregation of poorly metabolized Aβ and amyloidogenic fragments of Aβ may explain why the intracellular Aβ immunoreactivity is not morphologically recognizable as amyloid fibrils. Because the insoluble aggregates are a heterogeneous collection of fragments, perhaps their underlying fibrillar lattice is not revealed until the fragments have been digested to their protease-resistant amyloid core. The fact that the intracellular amyloidogenic fragments themselves are poorly degraded suggests that this conversion process may be quite slow and may even occur extracellularly, after the insoluble residue has been externalized, either by exocytosis or the death of the cell. This accumulation appears to mimic the “granulovacuolar” pathophysiology of degenerating neurons and dystrophic neurites, where Aβ and APP immunoreactivity have been localized to granular or globular deposits (31Cummings B.J.

This may represent the site at which the intracellular Aβ and APP-insoluble residue may be externalized, perhaps by breaking off of vesicles from neurite termini. How this insoluble residue is ultimately converted to Aβ is unknown, but the microglia surrounding the plaque may phagocytose the residue and digest it to the protease-resistant amyloid core. It has been proposed that microglia may play a role in depositing amyloid fibrils in senile plaques (36Frackowiak J. Wisniewski H.M. Wegiel J. Merz G.S. Iqbal K. Wang K.C. Acta Neuropathol. 1992; 84: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because the center of neuritic plaques and mature or cored plaques are not positive for the non-Aβ epitopes (31Cummings B.J. Su J.H. Geddes J.W. Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Cunningham D.D. Cotman C.W. Neuroscience. 1992; 48: 763-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Joachim C. Games D. Morris J. Ward P. Frenkel D. Selkoe D. Am. J.

Although the significance of intracellular Aβ immunoreactivity and the origin of extracellular Aβ deposits is still controversial, a recent report by Cataldo et al. (37Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Mann D.M. Nixon R.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 704-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) indicates that lysosomal hydrolases can be detected in extracellular amyloid deposits of AD and Down syndrome brains. This is consistent with the lysosomal origin of these deposits under pathological conditions (37Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Mann D.M. Nixon R.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Brain Res. 1990; 513: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Aβ immunoreactivity has been detected in the vacuole of chloroquine-induced rat soleus muscle cells, and immunohistochemical studies indicate that most of Aβ in the vacuoles reacts with anti-Aβ1–42, and only a few react with Aβ1–40-specific antibodies (40Tsuzuki K. Fukatsu R. Takamaru Y. Kimura K. Abe M. Shima K. Fujii N. Takahata N. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 182: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our results are also consistent with several recent findings that there is an intraneuronal amyloid pool that accumulates with time in culture (1Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U.

Overexpression of an inhibitory mutant of Shc completely blocked gastrin-stimulated Shc·Grb2 complex formation but partially inhibited ERK-1 activation by this peptide. Expression of Csk, which inactivates Src-family kinases, totally inhibited gastrin-induced Src-like activity detected in anti-Src and anti-Shc precipitates but diminished by 50% Shc phosphorylation and ERK-1 activation. We observed a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and an increase in Src-like kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-stimulated cells, suggesting that IRS-1 may be a direct substrate of Src. This hypothesis was supported by the inhibition of gastrin-induced Src·IRS-1 complex formation and IRS-1 phosphorylation in Csk-transfected cells. In addition, the increase in PI 3-kinase activity measured in anti-p85 or anti-IRS-1 precipitates following gastrin stimulation was abolished by Csk. Our results demonstrate the existence of two mechanisms in gastrin-mediated ERKs activation. One requires Shc phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, and the other one is independent of these two proteins.

They have been shown to be activated by a variety of receptors including receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Their activation by growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity has been well documented. The best understood mechanism involves the recruitment of the Grb2·Sos or Shc·Grb2·Sos complexes to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors. These complexes subsequently activate the following cascade: Ras/Raf/ERK kinases/ERKs (7Serger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). Src-family tyrosine kinases have been proposed to serve as intermediates between GPCR and ERK activation. However, their involvement in this transduction pathway seems to be highly receptor- and cell type-specific. In some cells, lysophosphatidic acid and angiotensin receptors can activate ERKs via a mechanism that involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins by Src-family kinases (8Luttrell L.M.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) are lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) at the D-3 position of the inositol ring. Several PI 3-kinase isoforms have been described in the literature. The first cloned PI 3-kinase was a heterodimer composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit, which has been implicated in the regulation of mitogenesis and cell transformation (20Escobedo J.A.

Activation of the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase by tyrosine kinase receptors such as platelet-derived growth factor or colony-stimulating factor-1 receptors involves the binding of the SH2 domain (for Src-Homology 2) of p85 to specific phosphotyrosine-containing sequences of the receptors (27Kashishian A.

In contrast, the interaction of p85 with a tyrosine-phosphorylated intermediate protein, the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), represents a mechanism for p85/p110-PI 3-kinase activation by insulin or insulin growth factor-1 (29White M.F.

Several laboratories including ours have reported that some GPCRs such as the G/CCKB are capable of activating the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase (34Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol.

In this study, we have analyzed the contribution of Src-family tyrosine kinases to the activation of ERK-1 or p85/p110-PI 3-kinase pathways by gastrin. We report here that Shc tyrosine phosphorylation by Src-family tyrosine kinases and Shc·Grb2 complex formation are early events in ERKs activation via the GPCR, G/CCKB. Similarly, Src-family tyrosine kinases, by phosphorylating IRS-1, play an essential role in the gastrin-mediated p85/p110-PI 3-kinase-signaling cascade. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the human G/CCKB receptor and designated as control cells, were grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 200 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2atmosphere. The dominant-negative Shc construct, consisting of the isolated SH2 domain of Shc, or the cDNA encoding Csk were cotransfected with pTK-Hyg selection vector in CHO cells expressing the human G/CCKB receptor using the FugeneTM 6 reagent. Transfected cell lines obtained after 3 weeks of hygromycin selection were characterized and compared with control cells. The pL-SH2-Shc-SN vector was a gift from Drs I. Baldari and P. G. Pelicci (Siena, Italia). The cDNA encoding Csk was from Dr. S. Roche (Montpellier, France). Control-, Shc-SH2-, or Csk-transfected CHO cells were serum-starved for 18 h before peptide addition. After stimulation, the cells were lysed, and the soluble fractions, containing identical levels of proteins, were immunoprecipitated as described previously (36Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26356-26361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the indicated antibodies. Proteins from immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blotted as described previously (36Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol.

Proteins were visualized by using125I-protein-A followed by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and 3 times with TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm vanadate). Kinase assays were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.75 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μm acid-denatured enolase as an exogenous substrate. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The gels were then treated with 1 nKOH at 50 °C for 1 h after electrophoresis and autoradiographed. As described in Superti-Furga et al. (37Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G.

The reaction was stopped by depositing the samples on P81 Whatman chromatography paper immersed in 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. After 3 washes in 1% orthophosphoric acid, the radioactivity was counted. As described previously (18Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.S. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), lysates immunoprecipitated with specific anti-ERK-1 antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in reaction buffer containing myelin basic protein (0.2 mg/ml) and [γ-33P]ATP. The reaction was stopped as described above under “Csk Kinase Assays.” As described previously (36Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26356-26361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in reaction buffer. The kinase assay was started by addition of 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP and PtdIns at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4m HCl, and the phosphoinositol lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1). The phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography and analyzed by autoradiography. DNA synthesis was estimated by measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. The [3H]thymidine (0.6 μCi/ml) was added during the last 3 h of the 24-h treatment period. The cells are washed with serum-free medium to remove unincorporated [3H]thymidine. DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 15 min. Precipitates were washed twice with 95% ethanol, dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter. 125I-Na (100 mCi/ml) and [3H]thymidine (18 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Isotopchim. Anti-Shc (for immunoprecipitation (IP)), anti-IRS-1 (for immunoblot (IB)), and anti-phosphotyrosine (for IB) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Shc (for IB) and anti-phosphotyrosine (for IP) were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Grb2, anti-ERK-1, and anti-Csk antibodies were from Santa-Cruz. Anti-Src antibodies were obtained from Oncogene Science. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to p85 were kindly provided by Drs. Y. Le Marchand-Brustel and J. F. Tanti (Nice, France). Anti-IRS-1 antibodies (for IP) were generous gifts from Drs. E. Van Obberghen and I. Mothe (Nice, France). To determine whether Shc proteins are necessary for gastrin-mediated ERK activation, we stably transfected in CHO cells expressing the G/CCKB receptor, a dominant inhibitory mutant of Shc consisting of the isolated SH2 domain of Shc. Expression of the Shc mutant completely blocked the maximal increase of gastrin-stimulated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (2.6-fold ± 0.2) (Fig.1 A, left upper panel) and Shc·Grb2 complex formation (2.3-fold ± 0.4) (Fig. 1 A, right upper panel). Reprobing of the blots with the same antibodies used for immunoprecipitation revealed equal amounts of protein in precipitates from control- and Shc-SH2-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). As shown in Fig. 1 D, transfection of the deficient Shc mutant resulted in 49% ± 3% inhibition of ERK-1 stimulation, suggesting that both Shc-dependent and -independent pathways mediate gastrin effect on ERK activation. Src tyrosine kinase activity has been previously shown to be highly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal noncatalytic tail maintained the enzyme in an inactive state, whereas the active conformation corresponded to the phosphorylation of the kinase domain (38Courtneidge S.A. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Super-Furga G. Twamley-Stein G.M. Development (suppl.). 1993; : 57-64PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies reported the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src-like proteins in response to gastrin (39Singh P. Narayan S. Adiga R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G235-G244PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yassin R.R. Abrams J.T. Peptides (New York). 1998; 19: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, whether this phosphorylation is inhibitory or stimulatory remains to be determined. We first examined the ability of gastrin to regulate the kinase activity of Src in CHO cells transfected with the G/CCKB receptor. After treatment of the cells with 10 nm gastrin, the ability of Src to phosphorylate the exogenous substrate, enolase, was measured in anti-Src immunoprecipitates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kinetics of Src activation by gastrin was rapid, reached a peak value at 1 min (3.8-fold ± 0.4), and decreased subsequently (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). To analyze the role of Src-family tyrosine kinases in the intracellular mechanisms activated by gastrin, we used a negative regulatory protein of Src, Csk, which inactivates Src-family kinases by phosphorylation (38Courtneidge S.A. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Super-Furga G. Twamley-Stein G.M. Development (suppl.). 1993; : 57-64PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Csk in CHO cells (Fig. 1 C) completely blocked gastrin-induced Src kinase activity (Fig. 1 B,upper panel). Half of the lysate used for the kinase assay was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Src antibody and immunoblotted with the same antibody to verify that similar amounts of Src were recovered in control- and Csk-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B, lower panels). To determine the contribution of Src-family kinases to gastrin-induced ERKs stimulation, we measured ERK-1 activity in CHO cells overexpressing Csk. Blockage of gastrin-induced Src kinase activity by Csk also resulted in a significant but partial inhibition (52% ± 11%) of ERK-1 activation by gastrin (Fig. 1 D). Fig.2 A depicts the effects of Csk overexpression on Shc·Grb2 complex activation induced by gastrin. In control cells, the maximal effects of gastrin on tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (Fig. 2 A, left) and the association between Shc and Grb2 (Fig. 2 A, right) were, respectively, 2.5-fold ± 0.2 and 2.8-fold ± 0.3 of the basal level. In Csk-transfected cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (Fig. 2 A, left) and the association between Shc and Grb2 (Fig. 2 A, right) in response to gastrin were reduced by, respectively, 49% ± 4% and 56% ± 5% compared with control cells, indicating the involvement of Src-family tyrosine kinases for maximal gastrin effect on Shc·Grb2 complex formation. Reprobing of the blots with the same antibodies used for immunoprecipitation revealed equal amounts of protein in precipitates from control- and Csk-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A,lower panels). We then examined whether Src-like tyrosine kinase activity was detected in association with Shc proteins following gastrin stimulation. Tyrosine kinase activity in Shc immunoprecipitates was measured by using enolase as an exogenous substrate. A 4.65 ± 0.35-fold increase in the kinase activity was detected in anti-Shc precipitates after gastrin stimulation and was abolished in CHO cells expressing high levels of Csk proteins (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). Half of the lysate used for the kinase assay was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Shc antibody and immunoblotted with the same antibody to verify that similar amounts of Shc were recovered in control- and Csk-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). The mechanisms leading to the activation of the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase by GPCRs are still poorly understood. To determine whether activation of G/CCKBreceptors expressed in CHO cells stimulates the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase activity was measured in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates following gastrin treatment. We observed a rapid increase in PI 3-kinase activity in response to gastrin. The activation reached a maximum at 1 min (3.6-fold ± 0.3) and decreased thereafter (Fig.3, left panel). Gastrin-induced PI 3-kinase activation in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates was completely blocked in Csk-transfected cells (Fig. 3, right panel), suggesting the involvement of Src-like tyrosine kinases in the mechanism of PI 3-kinase activation by gastrin. We did not detect any increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in gastrin-treated cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies from immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-IRS-1 antibodies revealed an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 following gastrin stimulation (Fig. 4 A). In addition, PI 3-kinase activity was detected in association with IRS-1 after treatment of the cells with 10 nm of gastrin (Fig. 4 B, left panel). The kinetics of activation, maximal at 1 min (2.6 ± 0.3-fold), could be correlated to the rapid phosphorylation of IRS-1, suggesting that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase, might be responsible for PI 3-kinase activation by gastrin. Both the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the PI 3-kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 precipitates observed in response to gastrin were abolished by Csk overexpression (Fig.4 A and Fig. 4 B, right panel), suggesting that Src-family tyrosine kinases act upstream of the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase pathway activated by gastrin. We then analyzed whether Src-like tyrosine kinases could associate IRS-1 in response to gastrin. For this purpose, cells were stimulated with 10 nm gastrin for various times and lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IRS-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, and their association with Src kinases was analyzed by Western blot with anti-Src antibodies. An increase in the amount of Src proteins coprecipitated with IRS-1 was detected in response to gastrin (Fig. 4 C). In addition, we observed a 2.8 ± 0.3-fold increase of Src-like kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from cells treated with gastrin (Fig.4 D), suggesting that IRS-1 may be a direct substrate of Src. This hypothesis was supported by the inhibition of gastrin-induced Src·IRS-1 complex formation in Csk-transfected cells (Fig. 4,C and D). The same amounts of proteins in precipitates from control- or Csk-transfected cells were confirmed by Western blots in all these experiments with appropriate antibodies (lower panels). Gastrin has been previously shown to be mitogenic for CHO cells expressing the G/CCKBreceptors (41Ito M. Matsui T. Taniguchi T. Tsukamoto T. Murayama T. Arima N. Nakata H. Chiba T. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18300-18305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the importance of Shc proteins and Src-family tyrosine kinases in mitogenic signaling induced by this peptide. Overexpression of the deficient Shc mutant or Csk proteins resulted in a significant inhibition (respectively 63% ± 3 and 82% ± 6) of the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by gastrin (Fig. 5), indicating that Shc phosphorylation and Src-family kinase activation are two events involved in growth stimulation by this mitogen. The intracellular mechanisms activated by the G/CCKBreceptors are not completely elucidated; particularly the early events upstream of gastrin-activated signaling pathways remain to be characterized. The important role of Src-family tyrosine kinases in the transmission of mitogenic signals induced by growth factors whose receptors possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity is well documented (38Courtneidge S.A. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Super-Furga G. Twamley-Stein G.M. Development (suppl.). 1993; : 57-64PubMed Google Scholar). In quiescent NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, kinase-inactive Src prevents platelet-derived growth factor-induced DNA synthesis. In a similar fashion, cells expressing inactive forms of Src and Fyn are unable to respond to proliferative signals. Overexpression of Src enhances the mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor treatment, whereas expression of Src inhibitory mutants decreases the response. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin, acting through a GPCR, rapidly and transiently stimulates the enzymatic activity of Src. We also analyzed the downstream targets phosphorylated and activated by this tyrosine kinase following gastrin stimulation. The increase in Src-like kinase activity observed in anti-Shc immunoprecipitates from gastrin-stimulated cells suggested that Shc may be a direct substrate of Src, phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to gastrin. This hypothesis was supported by the inhibition of gastrin-induced Shc phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 complex formation in CHO cells transfected with Csk, known to inactivate Src-family tyrosine kinases. Our data also demonstrate that maximal activation of ERK-1 by gastrin requires Shc phosphorylation by Src-family tyrosine kinases. Indeed, we observed a decrease of gastrin-induced ERK-1 activation in CHO cells expressing Csk or a dominant inhibitory mutant of Shc. However, the partial inhibition obtained in these transfected cells suggests the existence of an additional pathway for gastrin-mediated ERK-1 stimulation independent of Shc and Src-family tyrosine kinases. The focal adhesion kinase-related protein tyrosine kinase (PYK2) as well as Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which belongs to a family of Pleckstrin homology domain-containing tyrosine kinases, have also been proposed to link GPCRs to the activation of the ERKs cascade (9Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 42Wan Y. Bence K. Hata A. Kurosaki T. Veillette A. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17209-17215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it seems that these nonreceptor tyrosine kinases interact with Src-family kinases to regulate their activity (9Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 43Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, they probably do not contribute to the Src-independent pathway, which relays the signal from G/CCKB receptors to the activation of ERK-1. Kranenburg et al. (12Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) also observe a regulation of the ERK pathway by GPCRs that do not involve Src and Shc proteins. Their findings suggest that a wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase, whose activity is independent on Src-family kinases, links Gi-coupled receptors to ERKs activation. In the present study, we demonstrate in CHO cells transfected with the G/CCKB receptor that gastrin-mediated PI 3-kinase activation is totally dependent on Src-family tyrosine kinases. Consequently, PI 3-kinase cannot play a role in the Src-independent pathway that leads to ERK-1 activation by gastrin. Various isoforms of protein kinase C are capable of directly activating Raf-1 by phosphorylation (45Cacace A.M. Ueffing M. Philipp A. Han E.K. Kolch W. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2517-2526PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Raf-1 subsequently phosphorylates the ERK kinases, which in turn activates the ERKs. This pathway, which requires neither the activation of tyrosine kinases nor the formation of the complex Shc·Grb2·Sos·Ras, may be involved in the Src-independent pathway that links G/CCKB receptors to ERK-1 activation. Recently, several studies have reported the activation of the p85/p110 isoform of PI 3-kinase by GPCRs including chemoattractant receptors, angiotensin receptors, and adrenergic receptors (34Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Saward L. Zahradka P. Circ.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25204-25207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the molecular basis of this activation. Activation of the enzyme in chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils seems to involve direct binding of the Src-related kinase, Lyn, to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. This interaction might occur via the SH3 domain (for Src-Homology 3) of Lyn and the proline-rich domain of the p85 subunit as described previously for the activation of the PI 3-kinase by B cell antigen receptor (47Ptasznik A.

Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe a different mechanism for the activation of the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase by Src-family kinases, which uses IRS-1 as a docking molecule. Indeed, we demonstrate by Western blot that gastrin induces a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as well as the association of this protein with Src. We also observed an increase in Src-like kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-stimulated cells, suggesting that IRS-1 may be a direct substrate of Src, phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to gastrin. This hypothesis was supported by the inhibition of gastrin-induced Src·IRS-1 association and IRS-1 phosphorylation in CHO cells transfected with Csk. In addition, the increase in PI 3-kinase activity measured in anti-p85 or anti-IRS-1 precipitates following gastrin stimulation were abolished by Csk overexpression. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to thrombin, which binds to GPCRs, has also been observed (50Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27871-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the role of this phosphorylation remains to be determined. Angiotensin-1 receptors also belong to the family of GPCRs. They have been shown to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 via JAK2 tyrosine kinase, which associates with AT1 receptor and IRS-1 after angiotensin stimulation. Surprisingly, in this study an inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity was observed after the association of the p85 regulatory subunit to IRS-1 (51Velloso L.A. Folli F. Sun X.J. White M.F. Saad M.J.A. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12490-12495Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In contrast, our observations suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by Src-family kinases could lead to the recruitment and the activation of the p85/p110-PI 3-kinase in response to gastrin.

This would be similar to the mode of inhibition of translation by the heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (2Chen J.J. Crosby J.S. London I.M.

The protein sequences of these family members are highly conserved in prokaryotes (including cyanobacteria), fungi, and eukaryotes, suggesting that the proteins may be involved in a basic cellular process. Indeed, mRNA of the translational inhibitor p14.5, the human homologue of L-PSP, becomes significantly up-regulated with the induction of differentiation to macrophages (3Schmiedeknecht G.

Oka T. Arao K. Suzuki I. Thakur M.K. Izumi K. Natori Y. Nephron. 1998; 79: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of PSP from rat kidney in renal tumor cells was down-regulated (6Asagi A. Oka T. Arao K. Suzuki I. Thakur M.K. Izumi K. Natori Y.

They reported a head-to-head orientation of p14.5 with the gene for the protein subunit hPOP1 of RNase P and with RNase MRP ribonucleoproteins; the promoter region between p14.5 and hPOP1 acts as a bidirectional promoter. Because bidirectional transcription units commonly encode proteins that are different in structure but have similar biological function (8Wright K.L. White L.C. Kelly A. Beck S. Trowsdale J.

Briefly, the 5% perchloric acid-soluble fraction of a rat liver lysate was loaded onto CM-Sephadex C-25, and pure L-PSP was recovered in the flow-through fraction. Recombinant PSP was expressed inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase using plasmid pGEX-PSP. The fusion protein was purified from the extract with glutathione-Sepharose 4B and then incubated with thrombin, and recombinant L-PSP was isolated using the same affinity column as described above. The recombinant protein was confirmed to be L-PSP by its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by direct sequencing of the eight N-terminal amino acids. Furthermore, the recombinant protein and authentic L-PSP were immunologically identical. The standard cell-free protein synthesis system derived from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (10Hase M. Endo Y. Natori Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 698: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) contained the following in a final volume of 30 μl: 15 μl of micrococcal nuclease-treated lysate (containing 25 μmhemin), 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm GTP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 1.2 μg of creatinine phosphokinase, 25 μm of each of the 20 amino acids, 0.1 μCi of l-[U-14C]leucine (13.3 mCi/mmol), 90 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.6 mm spermidine, and 2 μg of mRNA. Endogenous globin synthesis was done under the same conditions as described above using lysate that was not treated with micrococcal nuclease. mRNA having the cap structure was synthesized with [α-32P]UTP and the four nucleotide triphosphates using phage SP6 RNA polymerase and linearized plasmid pSP65 containing the gene coding for E. coli form 1 dihydrofolate reductase as template (14Endo Y. Otsuzuki S. Ito K. Miura K. J. Biotechnol. 1992; 25: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The transcript is 1079 nucleotides long and consists of a coding region of 477 nucleotides close to the 5′ end and a 3′ noncoding region of 565 nucleotides. L-PSP inhibits protein synthesis at the elongation step rather than the initiation step. We started with experiments to confirm that L-PSP inhibits protein synthesis with a similar mode of action as heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase, as reported previously (1Oka T. Tsuji H. Noda C. Sakai K. Hong Y. Suzuki I. Munoz S. Natori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30060-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Incubation of micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing exogenous capped mRNA encoding dihydrofolate reductase and all other components necessary for protein synthesis at 30 °C led to the incorporation of [14C]leucine into newly synthesized proteins. In agreement with the previous report (1Oka T. Tsuji H. Noda C. Sakai K. Hong Y. Suzuki I. Munoz S. Natori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30060-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the addition of L-PSP to the system resulted in inhibition of protein synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The estimated IC50 (51 nm) was in the same range as the previously reported value (1Oka T. Tsuji H. Noda C. Sakai K. Hong Y. Suzuki I. Munoz S. Natori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30060-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A L-PSP concentration of 1 μm almost completely abolished the capacity of the cell-free system to support protein synthesis. However, when similar experiments were done using endogenous globin mRNA, inhibition by L-PSP appeared to be about 10 times less efficient (IC50, 0.68 μm) (Fig. 1 B). The observed difference in the IC50 can be ascribed to the character of the two translation systems: in the latter system, a large population of ribosomes is already engaged with globin mRNA (as polysomes) at the start of incubation, whereas practically no mRNA is associated with ribosomes in the former system. Thus, the results suggested that the lysate containing a higher proportion of polysomes was less susceptible to L-PSP. An interesting and probably important observation here is that the kinetics of the inhibition is monophasic in both systems, rather than biphasic, as reported previously (1Oka T. Tsuji H. Noda C. Sakai K. Hong Y. Suzuki I. Munoz S. Natori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30060-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In fact, careful examination of the earlier data does not reveal an inhibition lag, and the discrepancy may stem from an incorrect explanation of the kinetic data. Inhibition of translation initiation by proteins such as heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase shows biphasic kinetics (2Chen J.J. Crosby J.S. London I.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, this typical biphasic shape, in which protein synthesis proceeds at the initial rate for several minutes before an abrupt decline occurs, can only be expected when the globin-synthesizing system is used because only this system has an initial rate (run-off of polysomes). Obviously, inhibitors of initiation show monophasic kinetics of translation inhibition in the exogenous mRNA programmed system, which has no initial rate because there is no initial protein synthesis. The inhibition of protein synthesis by L-PSP was not prevented by the ribonuclease inhibitor from human placenta that tightly binds and inhibits the activity of the ribonuclease A family (data not shown) (15Blackburn P. Wilson G. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments that used higher amounts of mRNA than the standard reaction, the inhibitory effect on protein synthesis tended to be less. For instance, when mRNA was 20 μg instead of 2 μg in a 30 μl system, 20 nm L-PSP did not show significant inhibition (data not shown). To gain more insight into the mode of action of this small protein, we examined the effect of preincubation of mRNA with L-PSP. For these experiments, mRNA was first incubated with a low amount of L-PSP for a prolonged time, and then the activity of the mRNA of a small portion of the preincubation reaction mixture was tested in the standard translation system. This strategy minimizes the effect of L-PSP on the translation system because the concentration of L-PSP in the translation reaction mixture is very low. As shown in Fig.1 C, preincubation of mRNA with L-PSP results in a significant decrease of protein synthesis. Recombinant L-PSP affected the template quality of mRNA in a similar manner, making it unlikely that the observed inactivation of mRNA was due to contaminants in the L-PSP preparation. However, the activity on mRNA of authentic L-PSP differed significantly from that of recombinant PSP, as had been found previously (13Oka T. Nishimoto Y. Sasagawa T. Kanouchi H. Kawasaki Y. Natori Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although we cannot be certain, the difference is likely to be due to a loss of activity because of the expression of recombinant PSP in a prokaryotic system. A similar but even larger discrepancy has been reported for the human homologue of PSP, p14.5: the authentic form is more active than the recombinant form by 3 orders of magnitude (3Schmiedeknecht G. Kerkhoff C. Orso E. Stohr J. Aslanidis C. Nagy G.M. Knuechel R. Schmitz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results indicate that the main target of the protein is mRNA rather than the translation system. There are at least two alternative mechanisms for mRNA inactivation: 1) L-PSP might specifically modify mRNA at its 5′-untranslated region, including the cap structure (m7GpppG) that is nearly essential for the initiation reaction, or 2) the protein might degrade mRNA nucleolytically. To test the alternative possibilities, we performed experiments using sucrose density gradient centrifugation to investigate polysome profiles in the presence of cycloheximide. Incubation of the globin synthesizing lysate system with L-PSP resulted in a disaggregation of polysomes into 80 S ribosomes (Fig.2 A), supporting the earlier result (1Oka T. Tsuji H. Noda C. Sakai K. Hong Y. Suzuki I. Munoz S. Natori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30060-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The addition of the ribonuclease inhibitor at the start of the incubation did not prevent polysome disaggregation. An important feature of this experiment was that both the incubation and the analysis were performed in the presence of a low concentration of cycloheximide at which the antibiotic freezes the elongation reaction but not initiation. Polysome disaggregation in the presence of L-PSP demonstrates that the protein does not affect the initiation process. Rather, the results strongly suggested that L-PSP disintegrates polysomes through fragmentation of polysomal mRNA because of ribonuclease activity. To obtain direct evidence, micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated as described above with 32P-labeled dihydrofolate reductase mRNA in the presence of both the ribonuclease inhibitor and L-PSP. After incubation for various periods of time (Fig. 2 B), RNA was extracted and separated on polyacrylamide gels. Consistent with our hypothesis, the radioautograph shows intensive digestion of mRNA into small fragments in the presence of L-PSP, whereas the mRNA was fairly stable in the control sample. A similar digestion pattern of the mRNA was observed when the incubation was carried out in the absence of the ribonuclease inhibitor (data not shown). The amount of the ribonuclease inhibitor (266 units) used in Fig. 2, A andB, inhibits the activity of 1.33 μg of ribonuclease A by 50%, whereas the amount of L-PSP was 0.89 μg in a 30-μl reaction mixture. The result excludes the possibility that the inhibition by L-PSP is due to a contamination with ribonuclease A or other A-like ribonuleases, RNases known to be abundant in both animal tissues andE. coli. All of these results show that L-PSP is a ribonuclease that hydrolyzes phosphodiester bonds of RNA in an endonucleolytic fashion. We next determined the substrate specificity of the enzyme, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 A. The [32P]mRNA was incubated with l-psp,and then the sample was separated by thin-layer chromatography. Subsequent autoradiography showed the production of the four 3′ nucleotide monophosphates as identified by comparison with standard nucleotides obtained from ribonuclease T2 digests. The results are conclusive: L-PSP cleaves the phosphodiester bonds of all four nucleotides, yielding 3′-AMP, 3′-GMP, 3′-UMP, and 3′-CMP. In addition to the four discrete spots, some streaks are also seen in Fig.3 A that may represent residual small oligomers accumulating under the digestion conditions. Practically the same digestion pattern of the RNA was obtained using recombinant L-PSP (data not shown). By measuring the radioactivity of the spots, we determined the relative catalytic activity of L-PSP for the various substrates: Np/A32p/U = Np/G32p/U = Np/U32p/U > Np/C32p/U (slashes indicate the sites of hydrolysis). The mechanism of cleavage probably involves 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate intermediates. Because there are nucleases that hydrolyze both RNA and DNA (16Barnard E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1969; 38: 677-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we determined whether L-PSP has any deoxyribonuclease activity. We chose pBR322 as the substrate for the test because a single nick in the circular supercoiled DNA of the plasmid produces a change in conformation that alters its mobility in agarose gels. Prolonged incubation of the plasmid with L-PSP (2.1 μm) under conditions similar to those used for the RNA substrate did not result in any significant effect on the integrity of the plasmid (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the protein does not have deoxyribonuclease activity. We next determined whether L-PSP is specific for single- or double-stranded regions of RNA. We chose rat liver 5 S rRNA as substrate for the test because 1) the secondary structure is known, and 2) the RNA has a highly ordered structure (17Toots J. Metspalu A. Willems R. Saarma S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5331-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 5 S rRNA was labeled at its 3′ end with ([5′-32P]pCp or at its 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP, and the sample was treated under nondenaturing conditions with either authentic PSP from rat liver or recombinant PSP. An alkaline digest and T1 digests were analyzed together with the products of the protein treatment on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (Fig. 4). Both L-PSP preparations cleaved only in single-stranded regions of the molecule. Once again, recombinant L-PSP was about four times less active than authentic L-PSP. The addition of the ribonuclease inhibitor to the reaction mixtures did not alter the digestion pattern (data not shown). The results clearly indicated that L-PSP itself is a ribonuclease with characteristics unique among liver RNases. Other ribonucleases with unique properties are known: the cytotoxin α-sarcin and related proteins (12Endo Y. Huber P.W. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2662-2667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), colicin E3 and related bacteriocins (18Bowman C.M. Dahlberg J.E. Ikemura T. Konisky J. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and angiogenin, which is important for angiogenesis (19St. Clair D.K. Rybak S.M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8330-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). α-Sarcin is a basic 17-kDa protein produced by the mold Aspergillus giganteus. The basis of the action of the protein is an inhibition of protein synthesis caused by the inactivation of ribosomes. Although there are 5000–7000 nucleotides in ribosomes, α-sarcin hydrolyzes only a single phosphodiester bond between G4325 and A4326 of 28 S (or 23 S) rRNA. This cleavage inactivates the ribosome and is entirely responsible for the toxicity of the protein (11Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9054-9060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Endo Y. Huber P.W. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2662-2667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wool I.G. Gluck A. Endo Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 266-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Having established that L-PSP acts on mRNA, we further examined whether the protein attacks other RNA molecules. A micrococcal nuclease-untreated cell-free system was incubated with L-PSP as described for Fig. 2 A, and total RNA was extracted. Samples were separated on agarose and polyacrylamide gels, and RNA bands were visualized with ethidium bromide (data not shown). Despite a careful examination of the bands, we did not observe any significant degradation of rRNA nor tRNA at 1.5 μm of the authentic protein (which has an IC50 of 0.68 μm). However, when similar experiments were done with higher concentrations (>2 μm) of the protein, significant fragmentation of rRNA could be observed, which supports the notion that L-PSP is a ribonuclease. These results eliminate the possibility that L-PSP inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving rRNA or tRNA. We thus conclude that L-PSP inhibits cell-free protein synthesis by cleaving mRNA. These results may have an important bearing on the physiological role of L-PSP and its related proteins. Finally, it may be worthwhile to mention here that besides the lack of significant sequence homology with other ribonucleases, L-PSP also lacks histidine residues (1Oka T. Tsuji H. Noda C. Sakai K. Hong Y. Suzuki I. Munoz S. Natori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30060-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Histidine is known to be the indispensable general acid in the catalytic activity of other ribonucleases (21Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zegers I. Haikal A.F. Palmers R. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, another ribonuclease that lacks histidine has been reported (23Ogawa T. Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Uozumi T. Masaki H. Science. 1999; 283: 2097-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar): the C-terminal domain of the bacteriocin colicin E5 inhibits bacterial protein synthesis in vitro by cleaving several tRNAs at a specific site, the 3′ side of the queosine nucleotide in the anticodon loop. The cytotoxin recognizes the same site even if unmodified tRNA is the substrate, in which case, cleavage occurs 5′ side of the guanosine nucleotide that is at the queosine position. The proposed mechanism of cleavage involves a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate intermediate, but the exact enzymatic mechanism is unknown. A computer-aided homology search between L-PSP and the colicin E5 peptide revealed a short sequence shared by both enzymes, NDFGTV (amino acids 87–92) in L-PSP and NDPATV (positions 84–89 of the 115-amino acid C-terminal domain) in E5, but the functional significance of these hexapeptides remains to be seen."
https://openalex.org/W2054804338,"Caspases are cell death cysteine proteases that are activated upon the induction of the apoptotic program and cleave target proteins in a sequence-specific manner to promote cell death. Recently, Barkett et al. (Barkett, M., Xue, D., Horvitz, H. R., and Gilmore, T. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 29419–29422) have shown that IκBα, the inhibitory subunit of the transcription factor NF-κB, can be cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro at a site that potentially produces a dominant inhibitory form of IκBα. The involvement of NF-κB in the inhibition of cell death led us to ask whether apoptotic stimuli would induce the caspase-mediated cleavage of IκBα in vivo. In this study, we show that apoptosis leads to the caspase-mediated amino-terminal truncation of IκBα (ΔN-IκBα). Our data show that ΔN-IκBα can bind NF-κB, suppress NF-κB activation, and sensitize cells to death. Since activated NF-κB plays a role in the inhibition of cell death, these data suggest that caspase-mediated cleavage of IκBα may be a mechanism to suppress NF-κB and its associated antiapoptotic activity.

The proper development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms requires a defined process of autonomous cell death known as apoptosis (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Apoptosis involves the activation of cysteine proteases, known as caspases (2Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar), that regulate the selective proteolysis of internal cellular proteins. Cleavage of these proteins promotes a cellular death process that is characterized by DNA condensation, blebbing of the plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic shrinkage that ultimately leads to the formation of apoptotic bodies that are destroyed by neighboring cells (3Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6724) Google Scholar). The mammalian caspases comprise a family of proteins that were first implicated in apoptosis based on their homology to the cell death proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans (4Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

The result is the activation of a caspase cascade that leads to the sequence-specific cleavage of additional caspases (9Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Cleavage of these proteins contributes to cell death by activating cell death-promoting proteins and inactivating proteins involved in cell survival or DNA repair. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in the inhibition of apoptosis and in the activation of immune and inflammatory responses (15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

The regulation of NF-κB family members is achieved through a post-translational mechanism that involves interactions with a family of inhibitory proteins known as IκB, which bind and sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm (15Ghosh S.

In addition, inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activity in B cells induces apoptosis (40Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). More recent evidence has revealed that NF-κB plays a role in apoptosis by controlling the expression of genes involved in the inhibition of cell death (41Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 42Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that IκBα can be cleaved in vitro within its amino terminus by caspase-3 (44Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This cleavage has been proposed to occur immediately 5′ of Ser-32, one of the inducible phosphorylation sites in human IκBα, and produces an amino-terminal truncation of IκBα. Due to the involvement of NF-κB in apoptosis, we reasoned that IκBα was a likely candidate for caspase cleavage in vivo. Since NF-κB regulates the induction of genes involved in cell survival, such ascIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP, andIEX-1L (41Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp.

Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that IκBα may be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis to produce an inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Therefore, we were interested in determining whether ΔN-IκBα is generated in vivo in response to apoptosis and whether ΔN-IκBα can bind NF-κB and suppress its activity. In this study, we found that IκBα is cleaved in cells undergoing TNFα-induced cell death as well as in cells induced to undergo apoptosis in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Caspase-3 or a related caspase leads to the amino-terminal truncation of IκBα (ΔN-IκBα) in vivo because a mutation in the caspase target sequence of IκBα as well as a caspase-3 inhibitor prevents the generation of ΔN-IκBα upon apoptosis. The generation of ΔN-IκBα during apoptosis is a potentially significant event, since ΔN-IκBα can bind the p65 subunit of NF-κB in vivo. Importantly, this interaction suppresses NF-κB activation because ΔN-IκBα is resistant to degradation in response to inducers of NF-κB. In addition, the expression of ΔN-IκBα sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that caspase-directed cleavage of IκBα generates a dominant inhibitory molecule that suppresses the activity of NF-κB during apoptosis. This could be a potential mechanism whereby genes involved in cell survival cannot be activated once the apoptotic machinery has been turned on. 32D cells stably expressing the IκBα-SR have been previously described (46Reuther J.Y.

To construct the pCDNA3-ΔN-IκBα vector, an ATG start site was introduced immediately 5′ of Ser-32 in IκBα through the use of the polymerase chain reaction. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCDNA3. pCMV-IκBα-D31A was generated through site-directed mutagenesis using pCMV-IκBα and the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Western blotting with the anti-phosphoserine-32 IκBα polyclonal antibody (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. 9 × 10632D/IκBα-SR cells were plated in 15 ml of fresh media 15 min prior to TNFα treatment. The cells were lysed in 800 μl of ELB buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 5 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin), and the lysate was collected by centrifugation at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysate was precleared with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by pulse centrifugation, and the lysate was separated in half and incubated with 1 μl of preimmune serum or 1 μl of anticarboxyl-terminal p65 polyclonal antibody (Rockland, Boyertown, PA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by pulse centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The immunoprecipitated proteins on the beads were washed three times with 500 μl of ELB buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 2.5 × 105 293T cells were plated per well of a six-well dish 48 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method by diluting 3 μg of pCDNA3 or pCDNA3-IκBα-SR and 1 μg of luciferase reporter (if applicable) into 250 μl of Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.05 (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNa2HPO4·7H20, 6 mmdextrose, and 20 mm Hepes). To the DNA/Hepes-buffered saline mix, 25 μl of 1.25 m CaCl2 was added and immediately vortexed for 10 s. The transfection mix was incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min, added dropwise to the cells, and incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 h. The media was removed and replaced with fresh, complete medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. For luciferase reporter assays, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5% FCS and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cell extracts were prepared as described above. EMSAs were performed as described previously (46Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The cells were collected 24 h post-transfection, and 50 μg of cell lysate were assayed as described previously (46Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that inhibition of NF-κB activity sensitizes cells to killing by TNFα (17Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 18Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Inhibition of NF-κB activity can be achieved through expression of an IκBα molecule with serine to alanine mutations at its sites of inducible phosphorylation (Ser-32 and Ser-36) (29Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). This modified IκBα molecule generates a “super-repressor” protein (IκBα-SR) that constitutively sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm. Treatment of cells stably expressing the IκBα-SR with TNFα causes the cells to undergo apoptosis (19VanAntwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Therefore, 32D myeloid cells were generated that stably express the IκBα-SR (46Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Expression of the IκBα-SR in these cells causes a marked down-regulation in the levels of endogenous IκBα, which is most likely due to a decrease in free IκBα (because uncomplexed IκBα has a short half-life) and to a decrease in IκBα gene expression, which is regulated by NF-κB (15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). Since the proteolytic activity of caspases plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis, we were interested in determining whether IκBα was cleaved under apoptotic conditions. Cell extracts were made from 32D or 32D/IκBα-SR cells treated with TNFα for various times and analyzed by Western blotting with a carboxyl-terminal IκBα-specific antibody. TNFα treatment of 32D/IκBα-SR cells led to apoptosis, and Western blot analysis revealed that an amino-terminal truncated IκBα-SR (ΔN-IκBα-SR) accumulates at 4 h and more impressively at 6 h post-treatment (Fig.1 A). In contrast, TNFα treatment of 32D cells did not lead to the accumulation of ΔN-IκBα (Fig. 1 A), because NF-κB is activated in these cells and the caspase cascade is subsequently suppressed (42Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). In addition, Western blot analysis with a carboxy-specific IκBβ antibody showed that IκBβ is not cleaved in response to apoptosis in these cells (data not shown). It has been reported that cells that lack expression of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB (p65−/−) have increased sensitivity toward apoptosis induced by TNFα than wild-type cells (17Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Therefore, immortalized p65−/− cells were treated with TNFα for 24 h. This treatment resulted in the production of two cell populations. The first population consists of cells that have begun the apoptotic process in response to TNFα and have rounded up and detached from the surface of the plate. The second population consists of cells that have not detached from the surface because they have not begun the process of apoptosis or are in the early stages of apoptosis. Western analysis revealed that untreated p65−/− cells express full-length IκBα (Fig.1 B). Western analysis of TNFα-treated p65−/−cells revealed that the adherent (A) cells express full-length IκBα, whereas the detached (D) cells exclusively contain ΔN-IκBα (Fig. 1 B). In order to determine if ΔN-IκBα is produced by apoptotic conditions other than that induced by TNFα treatment, we monitored the accumulation of ΔN-IκBα during IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death. 32D myeloid cells require IL-3 for growth and viability, and in its absence cells undergo apoptosis (4"

Binding site selection experiments identified the inverted repeat 5′-GTCTAGAC-3′ as an optimal site for GST-Smad3MH1 and GST-Smad4MH1 fusion proteins (28Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to this site showed that each GTCT is bound by a single MH1 domain (30Shi Y. Wang Y. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). This GTCT motif, termed the “Smad box,” resembles GnCn repeats present in functional Smad-binding sites of native response elements. The occurrence of GnCn sequences in abutting pairs or triplets within native response elements suggests that individual Smad complexes, which appear to exist either as trimers or hexamers (38Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 39Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), may bind adjacent Smad boxes by contact with two or more MH1 domains. Here we examine how Smad box number and arrangement affect the ability of Smad complexes to bind DNA and activate transcription. The results show that individual Smad complexes are capable of contacting up to three abutting Smad boxes. We also found that contact with three Smad boxes can stabilize binding and enhance transcriptional activation relative to contact with two Smad boxes. While Smads interact efficiently with only one orientation of two Smad boxes, there is surprising flexibility in the ability to interact with various orientations of three Smad boxes. Furthermore, a subset of triple Smad box arrangements that resemble sequences of some natural Dpp and TGF-β response elements exhibit a high degree of synergism in response to heteromeric Smad complexes. We also show that Smad1/4 complexes, although similar to Smad3/4 complexes in their ability to recognize Smad box sites, are more dependent on Smad4 for DNA contact. Together, these results show how Smad box number and orientation affects direct Smad-DNA contact and provides a framework for investigating the role of direct Smad contact with native response elements. Reporter elements were introduced into the hsplacCaSpeR plasmid (40Nelson H.B. Laughon A. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1993; 202: 341-354Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for expression of β-galactosidase. To build the reporter constructs, pairs of oligos (Operon) were annealed and ligated into the KpnI and NotI restriction sites as three-copy inserts. Each copy contained two arrays of Smad boxes separated by 11 nucleotide pairs. Each Smad box is comprised of the sequence GTCT. The single copy sequences of each insert are as follows: RL, ACTTGTCTAGACTTGAATTCTTAGTCTAGACTTGG; RL+1, ACTTGTCTTAGACTTGAATTCTTAGTCTTAGACTTGG; RR, ACTTGTCTGTCTTTGAATTCTTAGTCTGTCTTTGG; LR, ACTTAGACGTCTTTGAATTCTTAAGACGTCTTTGG; RLR, ACTTGTCTAGACGTCTTTGAATTCTTAGTCTAGACGTCTTTGG; RRR, ACTTGTCTGTCTGTCTTTGAATTCTTAGTCTGTCTGTCTTTGG; RLL, ACTTGTCTAGACAGACTTGAATTCTTAGTCTAGACAGACTTGG; LRR, ACTTAGACGTCTGTCTTTGAATTCTTAAGACGTCTGTCTTTGG; LRmR, ACTTAGACATCTGTCTTTGAATTCTTAAGACATCTGTCTTTGG; RLmR, ACTTGTCTAGATGTCTTTGAATTCTTAGTCTAGATGTCTTTGG; RLmL, ACTTGTCTAGATAGACTTGAATTCTTAGTCTAGATAGACTTGG. To constitutively express proteins in Drosophila S2 cells we used the Act5C promoter plasmid pPacPL. Smad cDNAs used to generate effector plasmids were generously provided by Y. Zhang, R. Derynck, and J. Massague. To generate Smad3NLC, the Smad3coding sequence, possessing a BamHI site immediately adjacent to the initiator ATG, was cloned into the BamHI andKpnI sites of pPac. The construct Smad3LC is identical to Smad3NLC except 142 amino acids were removed from the MH1 domain and a new BamHI site and ATG were introduced at theEagI site using a pair of oligos. The sequence between theBamHI and EagI sites is 5′-GGATCCATGTCGTCCCCGGCCG-3′. FLAG-Smad4NLC was built by 1) cloning FLAG-Smad4NLC from pCMV5 into the HindIII andBamHI sites of pBluescript KS+ and then 2) transfer of the resulting HindIII (blunt)-NotI fragment into theEcoRV and NotI sites of pPac. Removal of the Smad4 DNA-binding domain for construction of FLAG-Smad4LC was by an internal deletion of 573 nucleotides between two XcmI sites within FLAG-Smad4NLC. The 3′ overhangs generated by XcmI cleavage were removed with Klenow prior to re-ligation to preserve the reading frame. The Smad1 coding sequence was introduced into the BamHI and KpnI sites of pPac to generate Smad1NLC. For the construct Smad1LC, 147 amino acids were removed from the amino terminus and a new ATG was introduced by polymerase chain reaction. Primers for polymerase chain reaction were TTTTCTGCAGTATTCATGCCTCAGCACAGCCTC (5′ primer) and TCCAATATGCCGCCTGGTGTTTTC (3′ primer). Activated versions of the ActRIB, ActRIB(TD), and Thickveins, Tkv(QD) receptors were kindly provided by J. Massague and Y. Chen, respectively. Each was expressed using pPac. For each reporter assay 8 × 105 Drosophila S2 cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA (50 ng of hsplacCaSpeR reporter, 50 ng of ActRIB(TD) or Tkv(QD) expression plasmid, 100 ng each appropriate Smad expression plasmid and pPac to bring total DNA to 1 μg) using DOTAP (Sigma). After 36 h cells were lysed in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed from 10 μl of extract mixed with 90 μl of 85 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.3), 9 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 54 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CPRG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Activity was measured as the rate of color change over time at 595 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Smad3 and Smad4 were individually expressed in SF9 cells as His-tagged fusion proteins using a baculovirus expression system. Smad3 was coexpressed with the Alk5 receptor possessing the activating mutation. The Smads were purified to near homogeneity using Talon metal-affinity resin (CLONTECH). For gel shift assays, purified protein was mixed with ≥0.01 pmol of probe in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) or 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2% Ficoll, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Binding was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels cross-linked at a ratio of 60:1 (acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Dried gels were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics Storm Model 860. When S2 extracts were used for gel shifts bovine serum albumin was omitted from the buffer and 6.6 μg/ml dI-dC was included. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 1 × 107 S2 cells transfected with a total of 7.5 μg of DNA (2.5 μg each appropriate Smad expression plasmid, 2.5 μg of ActRIB(TD) or Tkv(QD), and pPac to bring total DNA to 7.5 μg). After 36 h cells were lysed in 300 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Each 30-μl binding reaction contained 5 μl of extract. Reactions were allowed to proceed on ice for 45 min. Electrophoresis was done at 4 °C for 135 min at 175 V. For supershifts, 1 μl of the antibodies (2–3 μg) was added to the reactions after 20 min. Smad3 was supershifted with monoclonal anti-Smad1/2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) while flag-Smad4 was supershifted with monoclonal anti-flag M2 (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein expression levels were examined by Western blot using an ECL chemiluminescent kit (Amersham). Probes for gel shift were prepared by end labeling of oligos with 32P and annealing to the complementary strand. The sequences of the labeled oligos are: RL, CACTTTGTCTAGACTTTCAC; RR, CACTTTGTCTGTCTTTTCAC; LR, CACTTTAGACGTCTTTTCAC; RLR, CACTTTAGACGTCTAGACTTTCAC; RRR, CACTTTGTCTGTCTGTCTTTTCAC; LRR, CACTTTAGACGTCTGTCTTTTCAC; RLL, CACTTTGTCTGTCTAGACTTTCAC. Fig.1 A shows that Smad-binding sites within native TGF-β/activin response elements of PAI-1, collagenase, COL7A1, Mix.2, goosecoid, and JunB contain abutting perfect (solid arrows) and degenerate (dotted arrows) Smad boxes arranged primarily as direct repeats. We refer to this direct repeat arrangement as right-right (RR), as shown in Fig.1 B. Among the characterized TGF-β/activin targets, the right-left (RL) arrangement corresponding to the GTCTACAG sequence identified by binding site selection occurs only once in thegoosecoid element, but occurs five times in the Dpp response element of tinman, including one example of a match to the consensus site. The goosecoid and JunB elements contain examples of three abutting Smad box/degenerate box sequences in an RRR direct repeat arrangement. COL7A1 contains an RR arrangement with an inverted third degenerate box, an arrangement we refer to as left-right-right (LRR). The LRR arrangement also occurs in Mad/Medea-binding sites of the vestigial, Ubx, andtinman Dpp response elements (LLR is LRR in reverse orientation), along with RL and LR pairs and one example of RLL (Fig.1A). The LRR sequences of vg and Ubx can also be modeled as RR arrangements in the opposite direction. These multiple arrangements of Smad boxes and Smad box-like sequences within functional response elements suggests that Smad complexes might interact flexibly with two or three abutting Smad boxes in various orientations. Such flexibility could perhaps derive from the linker that separates the DNA-contacting MH1 domains from the trimerizing MH2 domains. To determine how Smad box orientation affects recognition by Smads we constructed a series of lacZreporter genes in which a basal Drosophila hsp70 promoter was positioned adjacent to six pairs of Smad boxes arrayed in the RR, LR, or RL configurations (Fig. 1, B and C). These reporter plasmids were co-transfected into Drosophila S2 cells together with effector plasmids that expressed human Smad3, Smad4, and an activated form of the ActRIB receptor, ActRIB(TD) (Fig.2). ActRIB is specific for the activin/TGFβ pathway (41Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was co-expressed to promote phosphorylation of Smad3 in S2 cells. In the absence of ActRIB(TD) neither Smad3 nor Smad4 activated reporter transcription substantially above background, while co-transfection with both Smads resulted in 13-, 4-, and 80-fold activation of RR, LR, and RL, respectively, over no-Smad control transfections (Fig.2 A). For RL, this represents a 24-fold stimulation of reporter activity by coexpressed Smad3 and Smad4 over the combined levels of activation observed when Smad3 and Smad4 are expressed individually. Inclusion of ActRIB(TD) in transfections stimulated activation of all reporters by coexpressed Smad3 and Smad4 at least 5-fold (Fig.2 B, note difference in scales for β-galactosidase activity). In contrast to the results obtained without receptor, the RL reporter was strongly activated by individually transfected Smad3 or Smad4, while co-transfection with both Smads resulted in levels of induction comparable to levels observed for Smad3 alone. Activation of RL by Smad4 alone as a consequence of being coexpressed with ActRIB(TD) suggests an interaction with an endogenous r-Smad (42Henderson K.D. Andrews D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 43Brummel T. Abdollah S. Haerry T.E. Shimell M.J. Merriam J. Raftery L. Wrana J. O'Connor M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) since Smad4 is not phosphorylated by receptors. Increasing the spacing between the RL Smad boxes by a single base pair abolished activation (Fig. 2 B inset, compare RL to RL+1). In contrast to RL, the RR and LR reporters responded synergistically to coexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 in the presence of ActRIB(TD), although the overall levels of induction were 8- and 20-fold lower than for RL, respectively. The observed failure of RR and LR reporters to respond to Smad3 alone is consistent with previous reports that without Smad4, Smad3 has little effect on the PAI-1, collagenase I, or JunBpromoters (15Zhang Y. Feng X. Derynk R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 29Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten D.P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 34Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), each of which contains functional RR sites (Fig. 1). Together, these results indicate that the level of Smad-dependent transcriptional activation depends on both the orientation and spacing of Smad boxes. Furthermore, the RR and LR orientations of Smad boxes require both Smad3 and Smad4 for maximal transcriptional activation, while RL is able to respond to Smad3 alone. As discussed above, potentially tripartite Smad-binding sites exist in both TGF-β/activin and Dpp response elements. To determine whether interaction with a third Smad box would enhance activation, we constructed a set of reporters in which each binding site consisted of three Smad boxes. Each of the four possible arrangements of three Smad boxes was tested with ActRIB(TD) in the presence or absence of co-transfected Smads (Fig.3 A). Addition of a third Smad box to RR, either as RRR or LRR, elevated reporter expression in response to Smad3 plus Smad4 in comparison to the levels detected for RR and LR (e.g. compare Fig. 3 A, bar 4, LR, RR, and LRR). For RRR and LRR, coexpression of both proteins produced responses 2- and 5-fold greater than the additive response of Smad3 and Smad4 expressed separately (e.g.compare Fig. 3 A, LRR bar 4 to bars 2 and3). Reporter activation was also elevated by addition of a third Smad box to RL, either as RLR or RLL, although the effect was less dramatic than for RRR and LRR. Like RL, RLR and RLL had a less than additive (synergistic) response to the coexpression of both Smad3 and Smad4 (in Fig. 3 A compare bar 4 withbars 2 and 3 for RLR and RLL reporters). While these data suggest that Smad3/4 complexes are capable of recognizing triple-Smad box sites, it was also possible that in each case the observed levels of reporter activity resulted from interaction with only the two outside Smad boxes. To determine whether the middle Smad box was dispensable for activation we generated a set of reporter constructs in which the sequence of the middle Smad box was changed from GTCT to ATCT (Fig. 3 B). The Smad3 MH1 domain has been shown to make specific contacts to the guanine at the first position in the Smad box (30Shi Y. Wang Y. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and mutation to adenine has been shown to disrupt binding of GST-Smad3MH1 or GST-Smad4MH1 in the context of an RL pair (28Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). We found that the mutated reporter constructs were not induced by co-transfection with Smad3 and Smad4 regardless of the orientation of the outside Smad boxes (Fig. 3 B). To assess the effects of binding site organization on Smad DNA binding affinity, gel shift assays were performed using whole cell extracts from S2 cells co-transfected with Smad3, FLAG-Smad4, or both Smads. ActRIB(TD) was included in each transfection. Unlike the reporters, which had six Smad-binding sites, each gel shift probe contained only a single Smad-binding site consisting of two or three Smad boxes. The RR and LR probes were not bound by Smad3, Smad4, or both proteins in the same extract (Fig.4 A, lanes 2–4 and6–8). In contrast, the RRR and LRR probes gave rise to weak gel-shift bands with Smad3 or Smad4 alone (Fig. 4 A, lanes 16, 17, 20, and 21), and a stronger novel band when both proteins were coexpressed (asterisks in Fig. 4 A, lanes 18 and 22). This result provides direct evidence that native Smad Smad3/4 complexes can bind cooperatively to three tandem Smad boxes, and suggests that the correlated effects on reporter activation described above are due in part to differences in DNA binding affinity. Lighter exposure in the bottom half of Fig. 4 A shows that the novel gel-shift band is also specific to Smad3/4 extracts inlanes 12, 26, and 30 that contain RL, RLR, and RLL probes, respectively. This novel band was eliminated by incubation with antibody against Smad3 or against the Flag tag at the amino terminus of Smad4 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 13 and 14), evidence that both proteins were contained in this complex. Anti-Flag gave a stronger super-shifted band than anti-Smad3 (compare bands marked “S” in Fig. 4 A, lanes 13 and14), suggesting that anti-Smad3 might have acted primarily to disrupt formation of the Smad3/4 complex. Consistent with this, we failed to detect a super-supershift when both antibodies were included in the binding reaction (data not shown). Although the stoichiometry of the Smad3/4 gel shift complex is unknown, the ability of the complex to bind RRR and LRR probes but not RR or LR probes suggests it consists of at least three subunits (comparelanes 18 and 22 with lanes 4 and8). The slower mobility Smad4 band was weaker in the shift of the RRR probe (lane 18) suggesting that RRR has a higher affinity for the Smad3/4 complex than for Smad4 alone, consistent with the synergistic response to coexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 shown in Fig. 3 A. A faint band from the control extract migrated at the same position as the Smad3 band and may represent binding by endogenous Drosophila Smads (compare lanes 9 and10, for example). The binding activity of Smad3 in whole cell extracts was approximately 50-fold lower than what was observed for Smad4. Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B) showed that this reflected a difference in binding activity since Smad3 protein was only about 2-fold lower in concentration than the Smad4 protein in these extracts. Relative to Smad4, the low DNA binding activity of Smad3 in whole cell extracts might be explained by incomplete activation by co-transfected ActR1B(TD) since the DNA binding activity of the Smad3 MH1 domain has been shown to be inhibited in non-activated full-length Smad3 generated by bacterial expression (29Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten D.P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the high DNA binding affinity of baculovirus-derived Smad3 (see below) may have been an artifact of its modified sequence (i.e. it was tagged at the NH2 terminus with hexahistidine) or of abnormal post-translational modification resulting from overexpression. It is not clear why Smad3/4 complexes migrate at a faster rate than complexes with only Smad3 or Smad4 but this observatio"

Here, we report that LAT plays a central role in regulating Ca2(+)- and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Immunological localization of the LAT protein indicates it is present at synaptic connections of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and is enriched in presynaptic boutons. Basal synaptic transmission amplitude at the lat mutant NMJ is elevated 3- to 4-fold, and Ca2+ dependence of transmission is significantly reduced. Multiple forms of synaptic facilitation and posttetanic potentiation (PTP) are strongly depressed or absent at the mutant synapse. Our results suggest that LAT is a novel presynaptic protein with a role in the Ca2(+)-dependent synaptic modulation mechanisms necessary for behavioral plasticity."

In contrast, we demonstrate here that the α6β4 integrin induces apoptosis in carcinoma cells by stimulating p53 function. Specifically, we show that expression of α6β4 in carcinoma cells that lack this integrin stimulates an increase in the transactivating function of p53 as demonstrated by the ability of this integrin to up-regulate the expression of a p53-sensitive reporter gene as well as the endogenous p53 response gene, bax. In addition, we report that α6β4 triggers apoptosis in carcinoma cells that express wild-type but not mutant p53 and that these α6β4 functions are inhibited by a dominant negative p53 construct. Importantly, we provide a link between integrin signaling and p53 activation by demonstrating that the clustering of α6β4 with a β4integrin-specific antibody promotes p53-dependent apoptosis in cells that express both α6β4 and wild-type p53. These studies are the first to demonstrate that a specific integrin can promote apoptosis by activating p53. Moreover, given the ability of α6β4 to stimulate invasion (Shaw, L. M., Rabinovitz, I., Wang, H. F., Toker, A., and Mercurio, A. M. (1997) Cell 91, 949–960), these studies suggest that the ability of α6β4 to promote carcinoma progression will be enhanced in tumor cells that express mutant, inactive forms of p53.

Integrins are the primary receptors used by cells to interact with extracellular matrices. Although initial studies had emphasized the functional contribution of integrins to cell adhesion and migration, a significant finding was the observation that integrins are essential for cell survival (2Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Specifically, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts are prone to growth arrest and apoptosis when deprived of integrin-mediated contact with the extracellular matrix (4Meredith J.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 1191-1198PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in the promotion of cell growth and survival. Arguably, one of the most complex integrins in terms of both structure and function is α6β4. This integrin is distinguished structurally from other integrins on the basis of the unusually large cytoplasmic domain of its β4 subunit (12Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Sonnenberg A. J. Biol.

Specifically, we reported that α6β4 expression induces the growth arrest and apoptosis of the RKO colon carcinoma cell line (21Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22673-22676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a finding that has been substantiated in other carcinoma cell lines (22Kim S.Y. Bachman N.J.

Commun. 1997; 233: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings, however, conflict with considerable evidence that supports a role for α6β4 in promoting carcinoma invasion and progression (1Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.F. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 19Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In order to understand how α6β4 can deliver these apparently conflicting signals, we analyzed the mechanism by which α6β4 promotes apoptosis in more detail. Specifically, we examined the hypothesis that α6β4 activates the p53 tumor suppressor. The generation of stable transfectants of RKO colon carcinoma and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells that expressed either the α6β4 integrin (β4) or a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of β4(β4-Δcyt) has been described previously (1Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.F. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 21Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22673-22676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subclones expressing similar levels of α6β4or α6β4-Δcyt were chosen for analysis (MDA-MB-435/mock subclone 6D2; MDA-MB-435/β4 subclones 3A7 (clone 1) and 5B3 (clone 2), RKO/β4 subclones D4 (clone 1) and A7 (clone 2), RKO/β4-Δcyt subclone 3E1). HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center). To obtain expression of the dnp53 construct, RKO/mock and RKO/β4 subclones were co-transfected using calcium phosphate with plasmids expressing the puromycin resistance gene (25Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) and a dominant negative p53 (dnp53) construct (provided by M. Oren, Weizmann Institute for Science, Israel) encoding for a carboxyl-terminal domain of p53 that can heterodimerize with endogenous p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activity.

All assays were performed on early passage cells (less than 8 passages). fluorescence-activated cell sorter green fluorescence protein cytomegalovirus chloramphenicol acetyltransferase propidium iodide monoclonal antibody (R)-phycoerythrin fluorescein isothiocyanate For transient expression of α6β4 in bulk populations of RKO and dnp53-expressing RKO cells, the LipofectAMINE reagent was used to transfect these cells according to the manufacturer's instructions with the pRC-CMV full-length β4 cDNA or a control vector. After 48 h, the cells were double-stained with the β4-specific mAb 439–9B followed by a secondary (R)-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-rat serum and annexin V-FITC. The stained cells were analyzed by FACS, and the β4-positive population was gated and analyzed for annexin V reactivity. For transient expression of E1B in α6β4-expressing RKO subclones, RKO/β4 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation technique with 1 μg of plasmid expressing the puromycin resistance gene (25Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 20 μg of the pCMV-55K plasmid (kindly provided by A. Zantema, Leiden University, The Netherlands), encoding the adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein of type 5 adenovirus under the control of the CMV promoter. After 24 h, transfected cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h and then analyzed for E1B 55-kDa expression by indirect immunofluorescence and for annexin V FITC and PI reactivity by FACS. Cells were harvested and incubated in suspension with either the 439-9B (β4-specific) or SAM1 (α5-specific; Immunotech) monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1 h on ice. These cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before plating them in wells (2 × 105 cells per well) of a 12-well tissue culture plate (Costar) that had been coated overnight at 4 °C with either goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin. To assess annexin V reactivity, cells were stained with annexin V FITC (Bender MedSystems) or annexin V PE (PharMingen) using the manufacturers' recommended protocols. Forin situ analysis of apoptosis in cells transfected transiently with the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing vector pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) and dnp53, adherent and supernatant cells were combined, stained with annexin V-PE (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's directions, and plated on coverslips. The percentage of GFP-positive cells that were annexin V PE positive was determined by fluorescence microscopy. To assess ApopTag reactivity, cells were fixed and subjected to ApopTag reactions (Oncor) following the methods recommended by the manufacturer. Samples (104 cells) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples (200 μg of total protein) were boiled in reducing sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either a rabbit anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1 μg/ml) or a rabbit anti-human STAT-1 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Tg secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE Int.- 1:15,000 dilution). Relative Bax expression was assessed by densitometry using IP Lab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Cells were co-transfected using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase and 5 μg of either PG13CAT, a reporter gene plasmid consisting of a polyoma early promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of a p53-binding motif (PG13CAT), or MG15CAT, the control plasmid that contains mutant p53-binding sites. Both plasmids were provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein. The amount of CAT enzyme in equivalent amounts of total protein from whole cell extracts was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The data obtained were normalized for transfection efficiency by assaying β-galactosidase. We and others (21Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2224-2233PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the α6β4 integrin can induce apoptosis in carcinoma cells. A possible involvement of p53 in this α6β4 function was explored by comparing the effects of α6β4 expression on the apoptosis of β4-deficient carcinoma cells that differed in their p53 status. Stable transfectants of RKO colon carcinoma and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells were generated that expressed either the α6β4 integrin (β4) or a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of β4 (β4-Δcyt). RKO colon carcinoma cells express wild-type p53, and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells contain a homozygous point mutation in the p53 gene that inhibits the apoptotic functions of this tumor suppressor (26Lesoon-Wood L.A. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Weintraub B.D. Mixson A.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). α6β4 expression resulted in a significant induction of apoptosis in RKO but not in MDA-MB-435 cells, as determined by annexin V FITC staining (TableI), as well as ApopTag staining (TableI). The difference in the magnitude of α6β4-induced apoptosis of the two RKO/β4 subclones analyzed correlates with their level of α6β4 surface expression (Table I). Of note, we were only able to select RKO/β4 clones with relatively low levels of surface α6β4 because of the extensive cell death observed in cells expressing higher levels of this integrin, as we reported previously (21Clarke A.S.

To assess the relative surface expression of α6β4, these clones were incubated with either normal rat IgG or the β4-specific antibody, 439–9B, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG and analyzed by flow cytometry. The importance of p53 in α6β4-mediated apoptosis was examined further by inhibiting p53 function in the RKO/β4 cells. Expression of a dnp53 construct blocked their apoptosis, as determined by annexin V FITC staining (Fig.1 A) and ApopTag reactivity (Fig. 1 B). These data were corroborated by the finding that expression of the adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein, another inhibitor of p53 activity (27Sarnow P. Ho V.S. Williams J. Levine A.J. Cell. 1982; 28: 387-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), blocked α6β4-induced apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 1 C). To demonstrate that the results described were not limited to one subclone of RKO/β4 transfectants, mixed populations of mock-transfected RKO cells (RKO/mock) or dnp53-expressing RKO cells (RKO/dnp53) were transfected transiently with a full-length β4 cDNA (β4) or a control vector (Mock) and subsequently stained with annexin V FITC. α6β4 expression in RKO/mock, but not in RKO/dnp53 cells, induced a substantial increase in the percentage of annexin V FITC-positive cells (Fig. 1 D), demonstrating that the ability of α6β4 to induce p53-dependent apoptosis is not an artifact of clonal selection. We observed a higher level of apoptosis in RKO cells transfected transiently with β4 as compared with that observed in RKO/β4 subclones, most likely because higher surface α6β4 expression was achieved in the transient transfectants (data not shown). Based on the above findings that α6β4 expression in p53 wild-type but not in p53-mutant carcinoma cell lines can induce p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis, we investigated whether α6β4 could stimulate p53 function using a p53-sensitive reporter gene plasmid (PG13CAT) (28Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). RKO/β4/PG13CAT cells displayed a significant increase in CAT activity in comparison to both RKO/mock/PG13CAT (Table II) and RKO/β4-Δcyt/PG13CAT cells (Table II). This increase in CAT activity was seen in both of the RKO/β4 subclones analyzed (Table II). The relative level of p53 activity correlated with the magnitude of apoptosis observed in these clones, with a higher level of α6β4expression, p53 activity, and apoptosis observed in RKO/β4 clone 1 relative to RKO/β4 clone 2 (Tables I and II). As a negative control for these experiments, these cells were transfected with the same reporter plasmid mutated in the p53-binding sites (MG15CAT). No increase in CAT activity was observed in the RKO/β4/MG15CAT transfectants (Table II). We did not detect CAT activity in either MDA-MB-435 cells or MDA/β4 subclones transfected with PG13CAT (Table II), as expected for cells expressing mutant forms of p53 that are functionally inactive. To corroborate the CAT activity data, we analyzed the relative expression of bax, ap53 target gene (29Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.M. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar, 30Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Mitashita T. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hoffman B. Lieberman D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), in the RKO/β4 and MDA/β4 transfectants. A greater than 2-fold increase in Bax expression was evident in the two RKO/β4 subclones in comparison to the mock transfectant (Fig.2). In contrast, equivalent STAT-1 protein levels were detected in α6β4-expressing and mock-transfected RKO cells (data not shown). Importantly, the expression of α6β4 did not increase Bax expression in either MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 2) or in dnp53-expressing RKO cells (data not shown), confirming that the ability of the α6β4 integrin to up-regulate Bax expression is dependent on p53 activity. The decreased level of Bax in α6β4-expressing as compared with mock-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 2) may be attributable to the ability of α6β4 to activate a transcriptional repressor of Bax, as was recently identified in T cells (32Grimes H.L. Gilks C.B. Chan T.O. Porter S. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14569-14573Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also, we are currently investigating whether the α6β4-associated decrease in Bax expression in MDA-MB-435 cells is related to our preliminary observations that α6β4 can promote the survival of p53-deficient cells. 2R. E. Bachelder, unpublished data. These studies demonstrate that the expression of α6β4 in RKO cells is sufficient to induce p53 activity in the apparent absence of α6β4 ligation or clustering, an observation that is consistent with other ligand-independent functions of this integrin (1Shaw L.M.

The data are expressed as the mean number of pg (±S.D.) CAT enzyme/mg total protein. Similar results were observed in three separate experiments. An important question that arose from the above findings is whether α6β4 activates p53 and promotes p53-dependent apoptosis in carcinoma cells that naturally express this integrin. We investigated whether clustering of α6β4 with a β4-specific antibody could stimulate the apoptosis of HCT116 cells, a colon carcinoma cell line that expresses wild-type p53 (33Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar) and α6β4 (data not shown). To demonstrate the specificity of the effects observed with α6β4 clustering, we clustered the α5β1 integrin. Importantly, the surface expression level of the α5 and β4 subunits is similar in HCT116 cells (data not shown). The clustering of α6β4 resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of annexin V FITC+, PI− HCT116 cells in comparison to the clustering of α5β1 (TableIII). The apoptotic potential of HCT116 cells did not correlate with their degree of adherence or cell spreading following integrin clustering (Table III) (34Re F. Zanetti A. Sironi M. Polentarutti N. Lanfrancone L. Dejanea E. Collata F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). As evidence that α5β1 clustering did not augment the basal level of apoptosis in these cells, we observed that HCT116 cells bound the same amount of annexin V FITC following the clustering of α5β1 (Table III) or HLA antigens (data not shown), which have not been implicated in the promotion of apoptosis. The possibility that the increased level of apoptosis observed in HCT116 cells following α6β4 clustering could be attributed to the inability of α5β1 to deliver survival signals to these cells was discounted by the finding that either the simultaneous clustering of α5β1 and α6β4 integrins or the clustering of α6β4 alone resulted in the same increase in the percentage of annexin V FITC+, PI− HCT116 cells (data not shown).Table IIIInhibition of α6β4-dependent HCT116 cell apoptosis by dnp53TransfectantStimulationAnnexin V-FITC+cellsMean area (μm2 ± S.D.)%ControlAnti-α519.6366.4 ± 21.2Anti-β462.9379.7 ± 21.7dnp53Anti-α526.3NDAnti-β429.0NDHCT116 cells were transfected with pGFP in addition to either the dnp53-expressing or appropriate control vector.

The percentage of GFP-positive cells that were also stained by annexin V-PE was determined by collecting data for at least 70 GFP-positive cells. Similar results were observed in three separate trials.

The cell spreading data are presented as the mean area (μm2 ± S.D.) of 30 cells.

The cell spreading data are presented as the mean area (μm2 ± S.D.) of 30 cells. Based on our observation that α6β4stimulated p53 activity in the RKO cells, we postulated that α6β4 clustering should also increase p53 activity in HCT116 cells. In fact, using the PG13CAT reporter gene construct, we observed that the clustering of α6β4, as compared with the clustering of α5β1, induced a 2.4-fold increase in p53 activity in HCT116 cells (β4 clustering: 47.8 ± 0.08 pg of CAT enzyme/mg of total protein versus α5 clustering: 19.6 ± 0.01 pg of CAT enzyme/mg of total protein). This increase in p53 activity correlated with the 3.2-fold increase in the level of apoptosis observed in HCT116 cells following α6β4 as compared with α5β1 clustering (Table III). The CAT activity we detected in α5β1 cross-linked, PG13CAT-transfected HCT116 cells represents the basal p53 activity in these cells based on our detection of similar levels of CAT activity in HLA cross-linked, PG13CAT-transfected HCT116 cells. Finally, to establish definitively the importance of p53 in α6β4-mediated HCT116 cell apoptosis, we investigated the effect of dnp53 expression in the cells. As shown in Table III, dnp53 inhibited the apoptosis observed in HCT116 cells upon antibody-mediated β4 integrin clustering. Our demonstration that the antibody-mediated clustering of α6β4 in HCT116 cells stimulates p53 activity, as well as p53-dependent apoptosis, provides direct evidence that p53 activity can be regulated by the signaling functions of this integrin. Although p53 can be activated by a number of “stress” signals (35Gottlieb T. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), few cell-surface receptors have been described that can activate p53 and trigger a p53-dependent apoptotic response (36Berger F. Gage F.H. Vijayaraghavan S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6871-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wu M. Bellas R.E. Shen J. Sonenshein G.E. J. Exp.

We demonstrate here that the α6β4integrin, a cell adhesion receptor, can stimulate p53-transactivating function and promote p53-dependent apoptosis. This finding is in contrast with most studies on integrins that have focused on their ability to promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptotic signaling pathways (6Varner J.A. Emerson D.A.

Our finding that α6β4-dependent apoptosis is p53-dependent explains why the expression of the α6β4 integrin has been reported to inhibit the growth of some carcinoma cell lines (21Clarke A.S.

Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Relating to our previous demonstration that α6β4 stimulates chemotactic migration and invasion (1Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.F. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 19Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a major ramification of the current study is that carcinoma cells that express α6β4 and inactive forms of p53 will have the propensity to progress more readily than those that express wild-type p53. Our demonstration that antibody-mediated clustering of α6β4 stimulates p53 activity and apoptosis in HCT116 cells provides direct evidence that p53 activity can be regulated by the signaling functions of this integrin. We also observed that the expression of α6β4 in β4-deficient carcinoma cells that express wild-type p53 is sufficient to induce p53 activity and p53-dependent apoptosis in the apparent absence of α6β4ligation or clustering. The ability of α6β4expression to induce apoptosis in a ligand-independent manner has also been observed in other cell types (22Kim S.Y. Bachman N.J. Nair T.S. Goldsmith S. Liebert M. Grossman H.B. Lomax M.I. Carey T.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sun H. Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2224-2233PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miao J. Araki S. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with recent reports that some functions of α6β4 can be mediated entirely by the β4 cytoplasmic domain and are independent of the extracellular domains of this integrin (41Homan S.M. Mercurio A.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2717-2728PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the β4 cytoplasmic domain to self-associate may account for this “ligand-independent” behavior (42Rezniczek G.A. de Pereda J.M. Relpert S. Aiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 2209-2225Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells that express this integrin endogenously may regulate its signaling as a means of stimulating the apoptotic function of this integrin only at the appropriate anatomical sites where ligand is available. An important issue that arises from these data is the mechanism by which α6β4 stimulates p53 activity. p53 can be modified by acetylation (43Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (44Fuchs B. O'Conner D. Fallis L. Scheidtmann K.H. Lu X. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 789-793PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hecker D. Page G. Lohrum M. Weiland L. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 953-961PubMed Google Scholar, 46Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), events that alter the stability and DNA binding activities of this tumor suppressor. It will be informative in future studies to determine whether the apoptotic function of α6β4 can be attributed to its induction of such posttranslational modifications in p53, as well as to identify the domains of the β4subunit important for this activity. Moreover, it will be important to determine whether the growth inhibition that has been reported to be mediated by β2, β1C, and β1D integrins is also dependent on tumor suppressor activity (47Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 48Fornaro M. Tallini G. Bofetiado C.J.M. Bosari S. Languino L.R. Am.

Based on our demonstration that α6β4delivers p53-dependent apoptotic signals to transformed cells, it will be informative in future studies to determine whether this integrin can also deliver these signals in non-transformed cells. Although α6β4 has been reported to promote T cell receptor-driven thymocyte proliferation (51Vivinus-Nebot M. Ticchioni M. Mary F. Hofman P. Quaranta V. Rousselle P. Bernard A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as well as primary keratinocyte proliferation (52Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumemberg M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3940-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and survival (54Dowling J. Yu Q. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), this integrin can also induce the apoptosis of primary endothelial cells (24Miao J. Araki S. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that α6β4 is expressed in most epithelia, which by definition are growth-arrested and differentiated, suggests that this integrin may contribute to epithelial renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, cells not only arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle during differentiation, but they also undergo events normally associated with apoptosis including DNA cleavage and chromosome condensation. In fact, p53 has been suggested to play an important role in cell differentiation in addition to its role in mediating growth arrest and apoptosis (55Soddu S. Blandido G. Scardigli R. Coen S. Marchetti A. Rizzo M.G. Bossi G. Cimino L. Crescenzi M. Sacchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 56Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The potential involvement of α6β4 in differentiation is also supported by a number of studies that have concluded that the laminins, which are the predominant ligands for α6β4, are potent inducers of epithelial differentiation (57Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 58Streuli C.H. Schmidhauser C. Bailey N. Yurchenco P. Skubitz A.P. Roskelley C. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Given these observations, further studies investigating the role of α6β4 in epithelial differentiation are warranted. In summary, these studies are the first to implicate an integrin in apoptosis by the activation of a tumor suppressor. The ability of the α6β4 integrin to activate this growth inhibitory pathway likely plays an important role in the selection of mutations in the apoptotic pathway of α6β4-expressing carcinomas.

The enzyme protein l-isoaspartate (d-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (E.C. 2.1.1.77) initiates the conversion of l-isoaspartyl andd-aspartyl residues to normal l-aspartyl residues. This “repair” reaction helps to maintain proper protein conformation by preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins containing abnormal amino acid residues. Pcmt1–/– mice manifest two key phenotypes: a fatal seizure disorder and retarded growth. In this study, we characterized both phenotypes and demonstrated that they are linked. Continuous electroencephalogram monitoring of Pcmt1–/– mice revealed that abnormal cortical activity for ∼50% of each 24-h period, even in mice that had no visible evidence of convulsions. The fatal seizure disorder inPcmt1–/– mice can be mitigated but not eliminated by antiepileptic drugs. Interestingly, antiepileptic therapy normalized the growth of Pcmt1–/– mice, suggesting that the growth retardation is due to seizures rather than a global disturbance in growth at the cellular level. Consistent with this concept, the growth rate of Pcmt1–/– fibroblasts was indistinguishable from that of wild-type fibroblasts."

Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in maintaining the normal function of cells. Such interactions are important in the transmission of signals within the cell. Scaffolding, anchoring, and adaptor proteins, which bring together the various signaling molecules through such interactions, are determinant in fine-tuning these pathways and often contain modular structural domains mediating protein-protein interactions (1Cohen G.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22320-22327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Maekawa K. Imagawa N. Nagamatsu M. Harada S.

A recent study revealed that the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) of hPTP1E interacts with a sequence within the last 15 amino acids at the COOH terminus of Fas, a cell-surface receptor involved in the apoptotic pathway (22Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In addition, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) with activity toward Rho (PTPLI-associated RhoGap 1; PARG-1) interacts with PDZ4 of hPTP1E (23Saras J. Franzen P. Aspenstrom P. Hellman U. Gonez L.J.

By using the yeast two-hybrid system and the PDZ2 of hPTP1E as bait, we have screened a HeLa cell cDNA library to identify other binding partners. We have cloned and characterized a novel protein (ZRP-1, zyxin-related protein-1) that interacts strongly with this domain. ZRP-1 is a 476-amino acid protein containing 3 LIM domains at its COOH terminus and a proline-rich NH2-terminal segment. The region of ZRP-1 involved in the interaction with the PDZ2 domain of hPTP1E has been characterized. The specificity as well as the in vitro and in vivointeractions of these proteins have also been demonstrated. protein tyrosine phosphatases polymerase chain reaction glutathioneS-transferase hemagglutinin base pair maltose-binding protein oligonucleotide kilobase pair GTPase-activating protein protein tyrosine phosphatases polymerase chain reaction glutathioneS-transferase hemagglutinin base pair maltose-binding protein oligonucleotide kilobase pair GTPase-activating protein The yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify novel proteins interacting with the PDZ domains of hPTP1E. The MATCHMAKER (CLONTECH Laboratories) HeLa cell cDNA library was screened essentially following the protocol outlined by the manufacturers. All yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method of Gietz et al. (24Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared by the method of Nasmyth and Reed (25Nasmyth K.A. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The inserts were amplified by PCR using the oligos GAD1F (5′-TACCACTACAATGGATGATG-3′) and M13 “Universal” primer flanking the insert in the plasmid pGADGH. The amplified PCR products were sequenced directly using an ABI377 “Prism” automated DNA sequencer. For β-galactosidase liquid assays, the assays were done essentially as outlined (26). In brief, colonies of SFY526 containing the various constructs of ZRP-1 in pGADGH along with PDZ2 in pGBT-9 were grown overnight in Leu−, Trp− medium at 30 °C. The cells were pelleted and the cell wall disrupted with liquid nitrogen. The released β-galactosidase was assayed usingO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. The resultant color was measured at 420 nm and the β-galactosidase activity calculated. The PDZ domains of hPTP1E (PDZ1(amino acid 1092–1184), PDZ2 (amino acid 1361–1461), and PDZ4 + 5 (amino acid 1787–1968)) were amplified by PCR from a hPTP1E clone isolated previously and inserted into the BamHI site of pGBT9. ABglII site was introduced in the oligos to bring the sequence in frame with that of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Clones with the correct orientation were selected by colony PCR using a forward oligonucleotide (5′-TCATCGGAAGAGAGTAG-3′) specific to the plasmid and an internal oligonucleotide from the hPTP1E sequence. To confirm in vitrothe protein-protein interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, the carboxyl-terminal portion of ZRP-1 containing the 3 LIM domains was expressed as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein (MBP). The carboxyl-terminal portion (amino acids 278–476) was amplified from the cDNA clone isolated from the two-hybrid system using specific oligos containing an EcoRI and anXbaI site in the forward and reverse oligos, respectively, for cloning purposes. The fragment was inserted in frame into anEcoRI/XbaI-digested plasmid pMal-C2 (New England Biolabs). The DNA fragments encoding the PDZ domains of hPTP1E as amplified for the two-hybrid constructs were fused in frame with the glutathione S-transferase protein in pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA sequences of all plasmid constructs was verified on an Applied Biosystems Inc. DNA sequencer. The GST-PDZ and the maltose-binding protein-LIM (MBP-LIM) fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α and used for in vitro interactions. The proteins in the bacterial pellet from 1.5 ml of culture were solubilized in 250 μl of Buffer 1: Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40 containing the protease inhibitors soybean trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μg/ml), and sonicated. 50 μl of each of the extracts was mixed with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose CL4B beads and the volume brought up to 250 μl with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitors (Buffer 2). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature on an end-on-end shaker. The glutathione beads were separated by a brief centrifugation, washed 5 times with Buffer 2, and suspended in 25 μl of SDS loading buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot. For these studies, the carboxyl-terminal portion of ZRP-1 containing all 3 LIM domains (and its own termination codon) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pAC-TAG2 (27Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in such a way as to produce a fusion gene controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter and encoding three hemagglutinin epitopes fused to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. As for the construct for in vitro interaction studies, the carboxyl-terminal portion (amino acids 278–476) was amplified by PCR using ZRP-1-specific oligos containing NheI and BglII sites in the forward and reverse oligos, respectively. This fragment was cloned in frame into pAC-TAG2 vector digested with XbaI and dephosphorylated. After a 3-h ligation, a fill-in reaction was carried out using the Klenow fragment of T4 DNA polymerase, and the ligation was continued overnight at 14 °C. Clones containing the insert in the correct orientation were identified by colony PCR, and positive constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To confirm the in vivo interaction of ZRP-1 with PDZ2 of hPTP1E, the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ZRP-1 protein was expressed in 293-T cells. The construct containing ZRP-1 sequences in the expression vector pAC-TAG2 was transfected into 293-T cells by the modified calcium phosphate method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.39-16.40Google Scholar). Transiently expressed HA-ZRP protein was used for immunoprecipitation studies. Two different approaches were assayed as follows: (i) co-precipitation of HA-ZRP protein using an antibody to PDZ2 of hPTP1E, and (ii) co-precipitation of hPTP1E using anti-HA antibody. The protocols used for both these studies were similar and are outlined below. Cells transfected with the HA-ZRP plasmid were harvested after 48 h. The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) per 10-cm dish. The plates were incubated on ice for 30 min, and the lysed cells were collected by scraping, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. 500 μl of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) were added to the cleared supernatant to reduce the concentration of Nonidet P-40. To 250 μl of diluted supernatant, anti-PDZ2 polyclonal antibody (5 μl of antiserum) or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (0.4 μg) (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added and the reaction continued to proceed on an end-on-end shaker overnight at 4 °C. To this mixture, 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and the reaction continued for an additional hour. The gel-bound immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times (20 min each wash) with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After the final wash the gel pellet was taken in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer, analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane according to standard protocols. The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-PDZ2 antibody were detected using anti-HA antibody (1:5000 dilution), and those precipitated by the anti-HA antibody were detected using anti-PDZ2 antibody (1:3,000 dilution). The bound first antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution) antibody. The bound secondary antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A human breast cDNA library in λgt-10 (CLONTECH Laboratories) (∼500,000 clones) was screened using a 367-bp PCR product containing the first and part of the second LIM domains of ZRP-1 as probe. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using the “Ready-To-Go” random labeling kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hybridization and washes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anchored PCR was performed using the 5′- rapid amplification of cDNA ends system from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA was prepared from total RNA using random hexamer DNA primers. The reverse transcribed single-stranded cDNA was tailed with deoxycytosine (dCTP) using deoxynucleotide terminal transferase. Anchored PCR was performed essentially as described by Loh et al. (29Loh E.Y. Elliot J.F. Cwirla S. Lanier L.L. Davis M.M. Science. 1989; 243: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) with a forward primer consisting of a unique sequence (the anchor sequence) followed by a series of 14 d(G) (the anchor poly(G) primer) and a second forward primer containing only the anchor sequence. The reverse primer was a nested primer specific for ZRP-1. The fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T vector and sequenced. Subsequently the entire sequence was rechecked by sequencing directly both strands of PCR-generated products amplified from cDNA without subcloning the DNA fragments. The proteins bound to the glutathione beads were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols. The co-precipitation of the MBP-LIM fusion protein with GST-PDZ2 was detected using a polyclonal anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs) at a dilution of 1:10,000. The bound antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) (dilution 1:5000) and the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The expression of ZRP-1 mRNA was studied with a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH Laboratories). The probe used was a 367-bp PCR fragment containing the first and part of the second LIM domains of ZRP-1 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using the “Ready-To-Go” random labeling kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hybridization and washes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The upstream and downstream regions of the humanZRP-1 gene were amplified from total genomic DNA using the Genomic Walking Kit from CLONTECH. To obtain the 5′-flanking sequence of the gene, the following gene-specific oligonucleotides were used: primer 1, (ZRP-R9) 5′-GCCCCGACATGGCCTGGAAAGG, and primer 2, (ZRP-R10) 5′-CCCGAGCCTCTGGCCTTCACC. The 3′ portion of the gene was obtained using the following primers: 1, (ZRP-F2) 5′-CTGAGCCAGCCTCCAGAGGAT, and 2, (ZRP-F1) 5′-GACCGGATCCTGCGGGCTATG. The entire coding region of the gene was amplified by long PCR using the Expand DNA polymerase mix from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, with the following oligonucleotides: ZRP-F3, 5′-TCAAGACCGCTGTCTGGAGTCC, and ZRP-R8, 5′-CTGGAACTGAGAACCCAGCAGGTA. With the exception of two gaps within intron 4 and intron 7, respectively, the sequence of the entireZRP-1 gene has been determined and deposited in GenBankTM with the following accession numbers: AF093834,AF093835, and AF093836. The PDZ2 domain of hPTP1E was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain containing plasmid pGBT9 and used as bait to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system (30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Analysis of a total of 1.7 × 107 clones resulted in the identification of approximately 400 candidates as determined by the His+ screen. Most of these were, however, eliminated upon testing for their ability to activate the β-galactosidase gene. Among the 20 positive clones, two overlapping sequences derived from the same gene were found to interact strongly with the PDZ2 domain of hPTP1E as determined by the intensity of the blue color indicator. The longest clone, C90, possessed an open reading frame of 261 amino acids and interacted more strongly than its shorter counterpart (194 amino acids open reading frame). By using the C90 cDNA sequence, a human breast cDNA library was screened, yielding 7 clones, the longest of which was 1.5 kb and contained the sequence encoding the last 432 amino acid residues. The remainder of the sequence was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR performed on total RNA from HeLa cells. The composite nucleotide sequence of the ZRP-1 cDNA was established and deposited with GenBankTM (accession number AF000974). The human ZRP-1 cDNA sequence is 1755 base pairs long and displays an open reading frame of 1428 bp with a translational initiation codon at nucleotide positions 160–162 and a stop codon at positions 1588–1590. The sequence around the ATG matches the Kozak consensus initiation sequence (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), and two stop codons are present in this reading frame within the upstream 5′-noncoding region. The open reading frame predicts a 476-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated mass of 50.3 kDa (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal sequence of the predicted protein is enriched in proline residues that account for nearly 20% of all amino acid residues. The second half of the protein contains three cysteine-rich zinc binding domains referred to as LIM domains. These domains are protein motifs of approximately 55 amino acid residues containing the consensus peptide sequence CX 2CX 16–23HX 2CX 2CX 2CX 16–21CX 2–3(C,H,D), where X represents any amino acid (32Gill G.N.

The cysteine and histidine residues characteristic of LIM domains are in bold letters, and the conserved amino acids are shaded. A conserved alanine at position −6 with respect to the conserved histidine is underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite the fact that all four proteins possess a proline-rich amino-terminal region, their actual amino acid sequences differ significantly in this region. The region of highest homology is that comprising the three LIM domains. Indeed, within this region, ZRP-1 displays 71.9 and 57.5% identity with LPP and Zyxin, respectively. Of the three LIM domain, LIM3 is the most conserved, showing 77% identity between ZRP-1 and the corresponding region of LPP. The similarity between LPP and ZRP-1 is also evident when the genomic organization of the two genes is compared. As shown in Fig.3, the ZRP-1 gene coding region consists of 9 exons distributed over approximately 5 kilobases of DNA. As for the LPP protein, the amino-terminal proline-rich region of ZRP-1 is encoded by 5 exons, and the first two LIM domains are encoded by separate exons, whereas the third LIM domain is coded for by the last two exons. Table I summarizes the nucleotide sequences of the splice sites. Sequence comparisons of the ZPR-1 and the LPP genes revealed that the locations of the splice sites are identical suggesting that the two genes result from a recent gene duplication event.Table IIntron-exon slice junction sites of the human ZRP-1 geneExonSizeSplice donorSplice acceptorIntron Sizebpbp1∼240CC CAC GGA GCA G gtaaggcagcccttgtgctcttccctcaacccag CA CTC CAG CCC2542128CAG CAC ACG CAG gtgagacccgggatcgtcctggctccatcctcag GGG CTC CCT GCA1193126CCA GAC CGA CAG gtgactctgcccctcctcctgcgtttctcctcag GCA TAT GAG CCC2614372CAC GGG CCC CAG gtgagccctggggaacttgattcccaccttccag GTG CCC CTG AGC∼1300594GG GAG TAC TTT G gtgagctgaggctgtggtgctcccctgtcctcag GC CAG TGT GGT G1136170GGC TGC TAC GTG gtgagtggctggggctggcattccttcccaacag GCC ACC CTG GAG8847179G GAC TTT CAC AG gtcaggcctggcctccagtttttttcccctgcag G AAG TTT GCC CC∼7008121TAC AAG TGC GAG gtcaggggcccccagcatgcttctttttcaacag GAG TGT GGG CTG4259278 Open table in a new tab The tissue distribution of the ZRP-1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). A strong signal was observed in most tissues including heart, placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. A weaker signal was obtained in brain and skeletal muscle. The observed size of the message is approximately 2 kb suggesting that the full-length sequence has been cloned. To confirm the specificity of the interaction between ZRP-1 and the PDZ2 of hPTP1E, its interaction was tested with other PDZ domains of hPTP1E. The PDZ domains 1 (amino acids 1092–1184), 4, and 5 (amino acids 1787–1968) of hPTP1E were cloned into pGBT9 in frame with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and co-transformed with ZRP-1 (in pGADGH) into SFY526. Neither of the domains activated the β-galactosidase gene, suggesting a lack of interaction (data not shown). Additionally, no interaction was observed when the PDZ domains of two related PTPases, PTPH1 (17Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and PTPMEG (18Gu M.X York J.D. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5867-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), were assayed under the same conditions (results not shown), thus substantiating the specificity of the interaction of ZRP-1 with the PDZ2 of hPTP1E. To determine the contribution of the various domains of ZRP-1 and that of its carboxyl-terminal residues to its interaction with the PDZ2 domain of hPTP1E, several constructs containing various combinations of LIM domains were prepared in the plasmid pGADGH (Fig.5 A). The yeast strain SFY526 was co-transformed with these LIM constructs and the PDZ2-containing plasmid. The yeast colonies obtained after transformation were plated, and the intensity of interaction was assessed by both filter-lift and liquid β-galactosidase assays. The results obtained from filter-lift assays are presented in Fig. 5 A. An interaction was observed only in constructs containing the carboxyl-terminal fragment of ZRP-1 (constructs 1–4). No interaction was observed with the other constructs suggesting that an intact carboxyl terminus is required for this interaction. The intensity of the interaction was dependent on the number of LIM domains present, being strongest in the presence of all three LIM domains and weakest when only one LIM domain was present (compare constructs 1 and 4). Clone C90 (the longest clone obtained from the two-hybrid screen), which contains 63 extra amino acids in addition to the three LIM domains and the carboxyl-terminal tail, gave the strongest signal. The variation in the intensity of interactions was not due to variations in the level of expression of the different constructs as demonstrated by a Western blot of the Gal4-activating domain fusion proteins using a Gal4AD monoclonal antibody (Fig.5 B) showing that all constructs were expressed at comparable levels. Liquid assays for β-galactosidase activity were carried out using the various LIM domain constructs, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 C. The results obtained parallel those obtained with filter-lift assays and show that the β-galactosidase activity decreases with a reduction in the number of LIM domains, and the activity is close to background in the constructs containing the three LIM domains but lacking the last 11 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues. The data suggest that in addition to the carboxyl-terminal sequence, the rest of the protein molecule may be important in stabilizing the interaction. The interaction of the PDZ2 of hPTP1E with ZRP-1 was confirmed by both"
https://openalex.org/W1978408261,"We have examined the ability of the CD3-gamma delta epsilon and CD3-zeta signaling modules of the T cell receptor (TCR) to couple CD38 to intracellular signaling pathways. The results demonstrated that in TCR+ T cells that express the whole set of CD3 subunits CD38 ligation led to complete tyrosine phosphorylation of both CD3-zeta and CD3-epsilon polypeptide chains. In contrast, in TCR+ cells with a defective CD3-zeta association CD38 engagement caused tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3-epsilon but not of CD3-zeta. Despite these differences, in both cell types CD38 ligation resulted in protein-tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. However, in cells expressing chimerical CD25-zeta or CD25-epsilon receptors or in a TCR-beta- Jurkat T cell line, CD38 ligation did not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeric receptors, or CD3 subunits, or protein-tyrosine kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In summary, these results support a model in which CD38 transduces activating signals inside the cell by means of CD3-epsilon and CD3-zeta tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, these data identify the CD3-gamma delta epsilon signaling module as a necessary and sufficient component of the TCR/CD3 complex involved in T cell activation through CD38."

The developing mammalian dentition provides a valuable model system for investigating tissue-specific gene regulation, morphogenesis, and biomineralization. Tooth development is dependent on the coordinated expression of many genes, some of which are unique to the developing tooth (1Maas R. Bei M. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1997; 8: 4-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Thesleff I. Sharpe P. Mech. Dev. 1997; 67: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Ameloblastin is one of this group of tooth-specific genes that displays a unique and specific developmental expression pattern. Ameloblastin is principally expressed in the enamel-producing ameloblasts and is present in the developing enamel matrix (3Lee S.K. Krebsbach P.H. Matsuki Y. Nanci A. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. Int. J.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 911-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The initial cloning, immunolocalization, and chromosomal mapping studies revealed that the rat ameloblastin gene encodes an open reading frame of 422 amino acids corresponding to a putative protein of 45 kDa (5Krebsbach P.H.

In humans, ameloblastin maps to chromosome 4q21 in a locus that is linked to an autosomal dominant form of amelogenesis imperfecta, a disease that adversely affects enamel formation and function (6MacDougall M.

Thus, ameloblastin is considered a candidate gene for this inherited defect in humans. High resolution electron microscopy provides evidence that ameloblastin accumulates near the crystal growth sites in developing enamel (4Nanci A. Zalzal S. Lavoie P. Kunikata M. Chen W. Krebsbach P.H. Yamada Y. Hammarstrom L. Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. Smith C.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 911-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The nascent ameloblastin protein is hypothesized to play a role in enamel crystal formation at these sites by a poorly understood mechanism that involves the rapid processing of ameloblastin to lower molecular weight fragments deeper within the tissue (4Nanci A. Zalzal S. Lavoie P. Kunikata M. Chen W. Krebsbach P.H. Yamada Y. Hammarstrom L. Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. Smith C.E. J. Histochem.

Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ameloblastin is also transiently expressed in pre-odontoblasts prior to the initiation of amelogenesis (8Begue-Kirn C. Krebsbach P.H. Bartlett J.D. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Fong C.D. Cerny R. Hammarstrom L. Slaby I. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106 Suppl. 1: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, once amelogenesis is initiated, ameloblastin expression is terminated in the dentin-producing odontoblasts and continues to be strongly expressed in ameloblasts. A converse phenomenon is observed with the odontoblast-enriched gene dentin sialophosphoprotein. Dentin sialophosphoprotein, once considered to be expressed exclusively by odontoblasts, has recently been determined to be also transiently expressed by ameloblasts prior to odontoblast differentiation (10Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that tooth-specific matrix genes including ameloblastin and dentin sialophosphoprotein may function as signaling molecules between ameloblasts and odontoblasts in initiating enamel and dentin development in addition to their primary role in biomineralization. Isolation and functional characterization of transcriptional regulatory elements are prerequisites for understanding cell type-specific gene expression. The focus of this paper is upon the ability of the ameloblastin promoter to respond to developmental signals that regulate the expression of ameloblastin, a protein believed to be essential to the formation and function of the enamel extracellular matrix. Here we describe the cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of the murine ameloblastin promoter in several odontogenic cell lines. Transfection analyses suggest that ameloblast-like cells express thetrans-acting factors necessary to direct transcription of ameloblastin. In contrast, gingival fibroblasts and pulp fibroblasts lack the necessary transcriptional machinery needed for ameloblastin expression, suggesting that regulatory regions of the murine ameloblastin promoter may function in a cell-specific manner. The murine 129-strain genomic library cloned in the Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a 1.9-kb 1The abbreviations kbkilobase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay ameloblastin cDNA probe to obtain genomic clones of murine ameloblastin. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) to a specific activity of >1 × 109 dpm/μg using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Stratagene). Plaque lifting, prehybridization, hybridization, washings of the filters, and autoradiography were performed either according to the manufacturer or by standard methods (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Putative positive clones were purified by secondary and tertiary rounds of screenings, and genomic DNA inserts were subcloned into pCRTMII plasmid vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for restriction mapping and sequencing. To identify 5′-flanking regions containing clones, the positive clones were PCR-amplified using a vector-specific (T7) probe and a gene-specific (L18) probe that is complementary to the minus DNA strand of the ameloblastin cDNA (5′-CTT AGA TGC TGA CAT TCA CTG TGC TCC C-3′) (see Fig. 1). PCR reactions were performed using 200 μm dNTPs, 0.8 μm of each primer, and 30 cycles each of 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 58 °C, and 3-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR reaction product of the λ clone SD99 (2.5 kb) was confirmed by separation on a 1% agarose gel. The DNA sequence of the 5′-flanking genomic clones was confirmed by sequencing using the thermosequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and automated sequencing (model 373A, Applied Biosystems). kilobase(s) polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay The transcriptional start site was mapped by primer extension using oligodeoxynucleotide primer L18. The primer was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled primer (100 ng) was annealed to 15 μg of total RNA from mouse incisors or from bone marrow stromal cells in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at 65 °C and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed primer was extended using 10 units of avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a solution containing 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 15 mmMgCl2, 8.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.22 mm dNTPs, 225 ng of actinomycin D, and 20 units of RNasin (Promega). Following incubation at 42 °C for 1 h, the template was digested with 20 units of RNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 15 min. The extended reverse transcribed product was extracted in phenol:chloroform (v/v, 1:1), ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The size of the primer extension product was determined by comparison with a DNA sequencing reaction generated from the same primer (L18) and a subcloned genomic DNA fragment (p2544) (see below). Total RNA was extracted from LS8 and primary human gingival fibroblasts by a modified guanidinium thiocyanate method (TriZOLTM, Life Technologies, Inc.). For reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, DNase I-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) (SuperScript, Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs were amplified using primers that spanned intron/exon boundaries 5′-GAGGCTCGAGATGTCAGCATCTAAGATTCCACTT-3′ and 5′-GAGGAATTGGTTTGCTCCATAAGACATG-3′. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and were made visible after ethidium bromide staining. A 2.5-kb genomic fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of ameloblastin was subcloned (pCRTMII vector, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and designated p2544. Sequencing of both strands of plasmid p2544 using vector-specific M13 reverse and M13 forward primers revealed that it contained about 100 bp of the 5′-untranslated region of exon 1 as well as the translation start codon (see Fig. 1). A 1.6-kb fragment 10 bp upstream of the translation start site was generated byStuI digestion. This fragment was subcloned into theSmaI site of the promoterless firefly luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-Basic (Promega) in both the sense and antisense orientations to obtain plasmids pSD069 and pSD070, respectively. Sequencing was performed on both DNA strands of the reporter plasmids using Luc+ vector primers RV3 and GL2, followed by nested primers on both strands. Sequencing data were analyzed and assembled using MacVectorTM 6.0 and AssemblyLIGN software (Oxford Molecular Limited). Progressive 5′-nested deletions were made using exonuclease III and S1 nuclease (Erase-a-Base, Promega). Briefly, plasmid pSD070 was digested with SacI and NheI, generating 3′ and 5′ extensions, respectively. DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform and was digested with exonuclease III. Samples of exonuclease III digestion were removed at timed intervals and added to S1 nuclease-containing tubes to digest single-stranded tails. Blunt-ended deletion fragments were circularized by T4 ligase, and the deletion mutant constructs were transformed in a competent JM109Escherichia coli strain. The DNA sequence of each of the promoter segments was confirmed by sequencing prior to transfections. The mouse enamel organ epithelial cell line, LS8, is an immortalized ameloblast-like cell line that expresses enamel-specific genes such as amelogenin and ameloblastin (12Chen L.S. Couwenhoven R.I. Hsu D. Luo W. Snead M.L. Arch. Oral Biol. 1992; 37: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Primary human gingival fibroblasts and pulp fibroblasts were provided by Dr. R. Bruce Rutherford, University of Michigan. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were co-transfected with the reporter construct that uses Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase as a reporter of transcriptional activity and the pRL-TK vector (Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. pRL-TK uses Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase as a reporter, allowing discrimination between the bioluminescence of the two constructs in a single-tube assay (Dual-LuciferaseTMreporter assay system, Promega). For each transfection, cells (3 × 105 cells/35-mm plate) were incubated with 1 μg of each promoter-reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pRLTK, and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h. Transfection medium was removed and replaced with growth medium, and cells were incubated for 48 h. Cells were harvested in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments for each construct was determined in triplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells by the method of Dignam et al. (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm each of leupeptin and pepstatin). Protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by bicinchoninic protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Complementary, single-stranded oligonucleotide probes were synthesized by the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core facility. The probes were designed from nucleotide positions −214 to −188, −192 to −127, and −162 to −127 and designated A27, A65, and A35, respectively. The oligonucleotide probes used for EMSA are designated by the dashed underline in Fig.2. Oligonucleotides were annealed, end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and gel purified prior to EMSA. For EMSA, up to 10 μg of nuclear extract were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in mobility shift buffer (12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) with 30,000 cpm of 32P end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe in a 30-μl volume). For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was incubated with the indicated concentrations of double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors at room temperature for 5 min prior to incubation with the probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 4.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. A murine 129-strain genomic library was screened with a full-length rat ameloblastin cDNA. Several overlapping clones were identified that collectively spanned the ameloblastin coding region and included a 5′-flanking sequence. In this study, a λ genomic DNA clone (SD99) that contains 2.5 kb of immediate 5′-flanking ameloblastin sequence was analyzed. Clone SD99 was verified by PCR analysis using two nested minus DNA strand primers and a T7 primer complementary to sequence in the λ vector arm (Fig. 1). A 2.5-kb fragment was subcloned into the pCRTMII vector, and the orientation was verified by sequencing both DNA strands (Fig.2). The murine ameloblastin promoter contains several putativecis-acting regulatory elements including AP-1, TCF-1, CACCC binding sites, and sites for two zinc finger proteins, CF2-II and Krueppel (14Shea M.J. King D.L. Conboy M.J. Mariani B.D. Kafatos F.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1991; 353: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The promoter contains two potential osteoblast specific element 2 sites known to be functional in other mineralized tissues such as bone and mesenchymal condensation regions involved in early chondrogenesis (16Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). One AP-1 site and two osteoblast specific element 2 sites were identified in a reverse and complementary orientation. A canonical TATA box was not identified, although a TAAATAAA motif is located 29 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2). The transcription start site was determined to facilitate the construction of ameloblastin promoter constructs. Mapping of the transcription start site of the ameloblastin gene was accomplished by primer extension analysis (Fig. 3). For the primer extension assay we used primer L18, which is located 116 bp downstream of, and complementary to, the minus DNA strand of the ameloblastin cDNA (5Krebsbach P.H. Lee S.K. Matsuki Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4431-4435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The primer extension reaction yielded a single 135-bp product with RNA from murine incisor. A genomic clone (p2544) served as the sequencing ladder to determine the size and nucleotide position of the start site (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). These experiments determined that a single ameloblastin transcription start site is located 19 bp upstream of the most 5′ end of the reported cDNA sequence (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, lane 6). Murine bone marrow stromal cells that do not express ameloblastin were used as a convenient source of control RNA. No primer-extended product was detected in RNA from these cells (Fig. 3, lane 7). Ameloblastin transgene constructs were generated to define the DNA regulatory elements that direct the tissue-specific expression of ameloblastin. Because ameloblastin is most strongly expressed in secretory ameloblasts but is also weakly and transiently expressed in other odontogenic tissue, the ameloblastin constructs were transiently transfected into three different cell lines derived from oral tissues. Endogenous ameloblastin expression is detected at low levels in ameloblast-like LS8 cells but is not detected in either human gingival fibroblasts (Fig.4) or dental pulp cells (data not shown). All three cell lines were co-transfected with the ameloblastin plasmid DNA constructs and the pRL-TK vector as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The promoterless construct pGL3-Basic and the full-length ameloblastin promoter construct engineered in the reverse orientation produced similar results and were used as controls. The full-length promoter construct (−1616/+57) was consistently highly expressed in LS8 cells. Progressive 5′-deletion mutations of the full-length promoter revealed a bimodal pattern of functional activity in transfected LS8 cells (Fig. 5). A progressive reduction in promoter activity was detected as the 5′-deletion mutations approached −477 bp, relative to the transcription start site. Further deletions from −477 to −217 bp lead to an increase in promoter activity approaching that of the full-length promoter. Deletions to −50 bp lead to near complete ablation of promoter activity in LS8 cells. In striking contrast, no significant or differential expression between ameloblastin constructs was observed in ameloblastin transfections into either human gingival fibroblasts or human pulp fibroblasts (Fig. 5). Transfections of the ameloblastin promoter constructs into gingival fibroblasts and pulp fibroblasts showed minimal promoter activity that was between 8 and 30% of the activity in LS8 cells. Furthermore, no notable differences were observed between deletion mutant constructs in gingival or pulp fibroblasts that do not express ameloblastin. The transient transfection data indicated that both positive and negative regulatory elements exist within the murine ameloblastin promoter. Additionally, the differential expression of ameloblastin promoter constructs between cells derived from three different oral tissues suggested that the gingival and pulp fibroblasts lacked the necessary trans-acting factors to activate the ameloblastin promoter constructs. To explore whether DNA-protein complexes differed between ameloblastin-expressing and non-expressing cells, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using oligonucleotide probes generated from functionally important regions of the ameloblastin promoter and nuclear extracts derived from LS8 and pulp fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 5, the single largest decrease in promoter activity was observed when promoter sequences between −217 and −100 were deleted. EMSA experiments using double-stranded oligonucleotide probes spanning a portion of this region illustrate clear differences in putative transcription factor binding in this region (Fig. 6, A–C). Distinct DNA-protein complexes were identified with extracts from LS8 cells and pulp fibroblasts, suggesting that differences intrans-acting factors between the two cell types dictate the cell-specific promoter activity observed in ameloblast-like cells. Further evidence for the specificity of putative transcription factor binding is shown in Fig. 7 where DNA-protein complexes are diminished by the presence of low level excess unlabeled probe.Figure 7Competitive inhibition of DNA-protein complexes in LS8 cells. Nuclear extracts from LS8 cells were incubated with 32P-labeled probes, A65 (−192/−127) or A35 (−162/−127) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, the DNA-protein complex formation (open arrowhead) with probe A65 (−192/−127) is inhibited in the presence of 20-fold molar excess unlabeled competitor (A65). Another DNA-protein complex (closed arrowhead) is less specific, as shown by the less effective competition with probe A65.B, the DNA-protein complex formation (open arrowhead) with probe A35 (−162/−127) is inhibited in the presence of 20-fold molar excess unlabeled competitor (A35).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To initiate studies directed at identifying signaling pathways involved in the complex development of the mammalian dentition, we have isolated, sequenced, and characterized the functional activity of the murine ameloblastin promoter in cells derived from three different oral tissues. A single transcription start site was mapped, and promoter constructs containing up to 1600 bp of 5′-flanking sequence were active in ameloblast-like LS8 cells but were inactive in non-ameloblastin-expressing gingival and pulp cells. Promoter activity was altered in LS8 cells by progressive 5′-deletion mutations and was characterized by a bimodal pattern of activity. We found that deletions from −1616 to −477 bp produced a gradual decrease in promoter activity. However, further deletion to −217 bp restored full promoter activity. These data suggest that transcriptional repressive element(s) exist between −477 and −217 bp of the ameloblastin promoter. However, significant promoter activity was detected between −217 and −100, suggesting that this region contains information necessary for cell type-specific transcription in cultured cells. Despite the recent identification of specific transcription factor and growth factor function in early tooth morphogenesis, the targets of many of these factors and their ability to influence the expression of specific extracellular matrix proteins of the tooth are unknown (17Aberg T. Wozney J. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 18Kettunen P. Thesleff I. Dev.

Ferguson C.A. Hardcastle Z. Rubenstein J.L. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1997; 124: 4811-4818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the enamel and dentin are formed by the elaboration of a tissue-specific extracellular matrix that directs the orientation of the inorganic hydroxyapatite crystallites that, in turn, affect their biomechanical properties (21Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is critical, therefore, to control when and where enamel-specific proteins are expressed and secreted into the matrix and where they regulate interactions during the process of biomineralization (22Paine M.L. Krebsbach P.H. Chen L.S. Paine C.T. Yamada Y. Deutsch D. Snead M.L. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The biomechanical properties of enamel are a summation of the regulated expression of structural genes required for enamel formation. Thus, identifying the molecular events surrounding the control of ameloblastin gene expression during tooth formation is an essential element in elucidating the composition of proteins in the enamel extracellular matrix that regulate crystallite initiation, orientation, growth, and termination. Our isolation and characterization of a functional ameloblastin promoter will facilitate new investigations into the mechanisms by which cell-signaling factors influence transcriptional events of this tooth-specific gene. The presence of common DNA sequences within promoter and enhancer elements of different genes makes interpretation of developmental and tissue-specific gene expression quite complex. Because only a limited number of cis- andtrans-acting factors are defined, diversity in gene expression is likely because of differences in promoter context. Variations in promoter context may be the result of temporal or tissue-specific expression of transcription factors. Although several common regulatory motifs were identified in the ameloblastin promoter, it is possible that new factors or unique combinations of known factors direct the highly restricted expression of ameloblastin to the developing tooth. The observation that the ameloblastin promoter constructs displayed a bimodal pattern of activity indicates that both positive and negative transcriptional events participate in the regulation of the murine ameloblastin promoter. These elements likely function exclusively within the context of this specialized cell type. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we compared the DNA binding ability of nuclear extracts from LS8 and pulp fibroblasts. In these EMSA experiments, different DNA-protein complexes formed between functionally important promoter regions and putative transcription factors from both the LS8 and pulp fibroblasts. The distinct complexes formed with LS8 extracts may be because of the presence of more abundant positive transactivating proteins in the LS8 cells. Alternatively, negative transactivating factors or more general factors in the absence of positive factors may be contributing to the complexes formed in pulp fibroblasts. The murine and bovine amelogenin promoters have also been characterized (24Chen E. Yuan Z.A. Collier P.M. Greene S.R. Abrams W.R. Gibson C.W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Snead M.L. Paine M.L. Chen L.S. Luo B.Y. Zhou D.H. Lei Y.P. Liu Y.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Connect.

However, because our current knowledge of possible cooperative or synergistic interactions between transcription factors in the developing tooth is incomplete, it is conceivable that additional regulatory elements may be identified in the regulation of ameloblastin. Likewise, because the function of transgenes in transfected cells does not always mimic the expression in the complex milieu of a developing organ (26Dente L. Ruther U. Tripodi M. Wagner E.F.

For example, GSL function has been investigated by coupling the free amine of dGSLs to various molecular units: fatty acids (25Kiarash A. Boyd B. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol.

Also, the oxidized GSLs can be coupled to proteins or tailor-made polymers to yield neoglycoproteins or multivalent, high affinity glycopolymers. Although several synthetic schemes have been contrived for the generation of such multivalent glycoforms, they inevitably require the synthesis of oligosaccharide monomers containing suitable functional groups for polymerization and/or coupling (35Roy R. Romanowska A. Anderson F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 242: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 36Roy R. Trends Glycosci.

The availability of a facile method to cleavage the sphingosine double bond of a GSL or dGSL should circumvent the necessity of synthesizing such a glycan precursor. The availability of such carboxylate/amino containing derivatives provides a robust route to transform natural GSLs into various neoglycoconjugates. Synthesis of ceramide acids from natural GSLs was investigated by Hakomori and co-workers using systems such as ozone in dichloromethane (30Laine R. Yogeeswaren G. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Our investigations suggested that the heterogeneity of the reaction mixture, due to solids like KMnO4 and manganese oxide (MnO2), affected the yield of the desired product. Considering our particular need to oxidize dGSLs and the limited availability of natural GSLs, we required a microscale (<0.5 mg) procedure that gave the ceramide acid or ceramide oligosaccharide as the major (single) product. This study elaborates an oxidation method that fulfills these criteria. To illustrate the biological potential of the method, we took advantage of the binding specificity of gp120 of HIV for GSLs (39Harouse J.M. Bhat S. Spitalnik S.L. Laughlin M. Stefano K.

(Brampton, Ontario, Canada). Reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: trifluoroacetic anhydride, K2CO3, sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), and triethylamine (Et3N) were from Caledon; 37% aqueous formalin solution, 0.5 nH2SO4 solution, trichloroacetic anhydride, acetic anhydride, and N-hydroxysuccinimide were from Aldrich; ANALAR KMnO4, ANALAR NaHSO3, and 30% H2O2 were from BDH (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), oleic anhydride (C36H66O3), erucic anhydride (C44H82O3), 4-chloro-1-naphthol, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were from Sigma;meta-NaIO4 was from Fisher Scientific (Unionville, Ontario, Canada); and goat anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Bio-Rad. Chromatographic materials (silica gel, TLC, HPTLC, and aluminum-backed nanosilica plates (Alugram NanoSIL GI UV254, Macherey & Nagel) were supplied by Caledon, and hydroxyapatite was from Bio-Rad. Reverse phase C-18 cartridges were obtained from Waters (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and molecular sieves (4 Å) from Fisher. Centricon-30 centrifugal concentrators were purchased from Amicon®. Solvents were dried by storing over activated (∼120 °C for 16 h) molecular sieves. Crown ether (10 g) was recrystallized from a hexane (4–5 ml) solution at −20 °C, washed with cold (−20 °C) hexanes (1 ml) and dried at 40 °C under a stream of N2. BSA (99%, essentially fatty acid-free) was purchased from Sigma and further purified on a hydroxyapatite column (42Stanker L.H. Vanderlaan M. Juarez-Salinas H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 76: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recombinant gp120 (rgp120, 1 mg/ml in TBS; strain: LAV, baculovirus expression system) was purchased from Protein Sciences Corp. (Meriden, CT), and rabbit anti-gp120 polyclonal antibody (IgG, 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) from Immuno Diagnostics, Inc. (Bedford, MA). Human sera from HIV patients containing anti-gp120 antibodies was a gift from Dr. S. Read, Division of Infectious Disease, HSC. LC, Gb3C, and Gb4C were purified from human kidney (43Boyd B. Lingwood C.A. Nephron. 1989; 51: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), Gb5C was purified from sheep blood (44Head S. Ramotar K. Lingwood C.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GM1C was purified from bovine brain (45Yamakawa T. Irie R. Iwanaga M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 48: 490-497Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as detailed previously. GalC, GlcC, and SGC were purchased from Sigma. Gg4C was prepared by acid hydrolysis of GM1C with 1 m acetic acid at 80 °C for 1 h (46Lingwood C.A. Nutikka A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Deacylated derivatives Gb3S and GalS (phychosine) were prepared by saponification of Gb3C and GalC at 102 °C with 1 m methanolic NaOH for 3 h (44Head S. Ramotar K. Lingwood C.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formaldehyde (40 μl of 37% H2CO solution, 500 μmol) and a methanolic solution of NaCNBH3 (100 μl, 0.3 m stock) were added to a solution of dGSL (1 mg, 2 μmol for GalS or 1.25 μmol for Gb3S) in methanol (0.5 ml) (47Borch R.F. Bernstein M.D. Durst H.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 93: 2897-2904Crossref Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). After stirring the reaction mixture for 16 h at room temperature (25 °C), methanol was removed under N2 and the remaining solid was then dissolved, by sonication, in 5 ml of distilled water. The resulting suspension was passed through a C-18 reverse phase cartridge, washed with 20 ml of water, and eluted with 20 ml of methanol. The estimated yield was >90% by TLC. Methylated compounds have reduced mobility on TLC; the RFfor GalS and GalS·NNMe2 are 0.80 and 0.75 (in C:M:H2OS; 60:35:8), respectively. Positive ion mass spectroscopy data (m/z) were as follows: GalS·NNMe2, FAB, 489, (M+H); Gb3S·NNMe2, ES, 814 (M+H), 836 (M+Na). Acylating reagents, imidazole-Tfa (Tfa (trifluoroacetate) = CF3CO) imidazole-Tca (Tca (trichloroacetate)= CCl3CO), were prepared by adding (divided in three portions and added at 15-min intervals) a DCM (2 ml) solution of the anhydride (e.g. a 2-ml solution of (Cl3CO)2O, 0.85 g, 2.7 mmol) to an imidazole (0.41 g, 6.0 mmol) suspension in DCM (3 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h and was assumed to be approximately 0.5 m imidazole-trihaloacetyl derivative. The imidazole derivative (e.g. imidazole-Tca, 20 μl, 10 μmol) was added to a suspension of GalS (3 mg, 6 μmol) in DCM (3 ml), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. Monitoring the reaction by TLC (C:M:H2OS; 70:30:2) showed many orcinol-positive products, suggesting some acylation of OH groups. Once all the GalS was consumed, DCM was removed under N2 and a solution of Et3N:M:H2O; 2:6:10 (0.5 ml/mg of GSL) was added and analyzed by TLC (C:M:H2OS; 70:30:2) after stirring at room temperature for 3 h. Once all the orcinol-positive species collapsed to a single band, the reaction mixture was dried under N2, redissolved in DCE, loaded onto a silica column (0.5 × 6 cm, in DCE) and eluted with C:M; 98:2 (batch elution, 15 ml) and then with C:M:H2O; 80:20:2 (10, 3-ml fractions). The estimated yield by TLC was >90%. To a solution of GalS (2 mg, 4 μmol) in dry pyridine (2 ml), an excess of the anhydride (approximately 5 mg, 9 or 8 μmol for oleic or erucic anhydrides, respectively) was added and stirred at 37 °C for 18 h. Pyridine was removed under N2, and the residue was treated with 1 m methanolic NaOH (2 ml) for 5 h at 25 °C, neutralized with 1 m HCl (2 ml), diluted with water (5 ml), extracted with Et2O (three times, 5 ml each), and the combined extracts were dried. Dried crude material was dissolved in DCM (1 ml) and loaded onto a silica column (0.5 × 10 cm in C:M; 98:2). The free fatty acids were eluted with DCE:isoPrOH; 85:15 (20 ml), and the product was eluted with C:M:H2O; 80:20:2 (six 4-ml fractions). The estimated yield by TLC was >95%. Method A was suitable for natural, NAc, and NNMe2 derivatives. A mixture of 1:2 acetic anhydride:pyridine was added to a dried sample of GSL or dGSL (final concentration of 1 mg/ml) and stirred at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were monitored by TLC (DCE:isoPrOH, 80:15) and, upon completion, dried under N2. Method B was suitable for the preparation of NTca and NTfa derivatives. A mixture of 2:1 trifluoroacetic anhydride:glacial acetic acid was added to a dried sample ofN-trihaloacetyl GSL derivative (final concentration of 1 mg/ml) and stirred at 25 °C. The reactions were monitored every 30 min by TLC (DCE:isoPrOH, 80:15) and, upon completion, dried under N2. The peracetylated crude material was dissolved in DCE (1 ml) and loaded on a silica column (for 3 mg, 0.5 × 5 cm in DCE) and eluted with DCM:M (25:Y), where Y was varied from 100 μl, in 100-μl increments (for each solvent composition, six 4-ml fractions were collected). The mobility of the peracetylated derivatives during column chromatography varies significantly with small changes in the activity of silica gel. Concomitant changes to the polarity of the eluent may be necessary. Purity (important for the oxidation to proceed smoothly) of the product was checked by TLC, where the plates were developed with I2 vapor. Reagents consisted of a 2:1 mixture oft-BuOH:H2O and solutions of NaIO4(0.4 m) and KMnO4 (0.05 m). Quenching solution was a 5:1 mixture of 0.25 m NaHSO3 solution and 0.5 nH2SO4 solution. Peracetylated neutral glycolipids (GSL(OAc)n, 0.5 mg or dGSL(OAc)n, 0.3 mg, depending on GSL; amounts correspond to 1–0.3 μmol) were dissolved int-BuOH/H2O (500 μl), and NaIO4 (30 μl, 10 μmol) and KMnO4 (15 μl, 0.75 μmol) solutions were added in the given sequence. The resulting purple mixture was stirred at room temperature and monitored by TLC every 4 h (for (GSL(OAc)n, 90:15:1, C:M:H2OS and for dGSL(OAc)n, 80:20:2, C:M:H2OS). When clean precursors were used, catalytic regeneration of KMnO4 proceeded smoothly until the reaction was terminated. Otherwise, the purple color diminished with concomitant formation of MnO2. In such cases, additional aliquots (5 μl) of KMnO4 solution was added. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1.5 ml of quenching solution and 1 ml of water, and the resulting colorless solution was extracted with Et2O (three times, 5 ml each). Occasionally (due to insufficient quenching) the ether extract turned yellow, and in such cases, the combined extracts were washed with 1 ml of quenching solution. The ether extract was washed with water (two times, 1 ml each) and dried under N2 at 25 °C. Residual water in the crude product was removed by adding absolute EtOH (1 to 2 ml) and evaporating under N2(Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 2TLC (nanosil plates, visualized with orcinol) showing the relative migration of peracetylated ceramide oligosaccharides ( dGSL (OAc) n ·CCOOH). In each case, 300 μg of dGSL(OAc)n was oxidized for 4 h and the dried organic extract (see “Experimental Procedures”) was dissolved (0.3 ml DCM:M; 2:1) and 10-μl aliquots analyzed.

Much is known about the role of (1,4,5)IP3 in mobilizing intracellular Ca2+, and a working model for the Ca2+ entry process is described by the capacitative model (5Putney Jr., J.W.

Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, two studies performed in Xenopus oocytes (8DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggested a site of action for adenophostin A in addition to that on intracellular Ca2+ stores. In both studies, low concentrations of adenophostin A (<10 nm) appeared to preferentially activate the Ca2+ entry process, although Hartzell et al. (9Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), unlike DeLisle et al. (8DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), could not find a clear dissociation between Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry. In a subsequent report, Machaca and Hartzell (10Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4824-4831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) found that the diffusion of adenophostin A throughout the oocyte was considerably slower than that of IP3 and concluded that this might explain the apparently diminished Ca2+ release signal. In this study, we have used confocal microscopy to monitor directly spatial as well as temporal aspects of the effects of adenophostin A on intracellular Ca2+ in Xenopus oocytes using the calcium-sensitive dye Calcium Green. Our results confirm that diffusion of adenophostin A throughout the oocytes is slower than that of IP3 and additionally indicate that low concentrations of adenophostin A cause a confined mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ that is capable of supporting spatially restricted Ca2+ oscillations and spatially restricted Ca2+entry. This unique action of adenophostin A provides new insights into the role of IP3 receptor binding in [Ca2+]i oscillations and also into the spatial relationships between intracellular Ca2+ release and activation of capacitative calcium entry. Adult albino female X. laevis (XenopusOne, Ann Arbor, MI) were anesthetized by hypothermia and decapitated. The ovaries were then removed and stored in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6)). Stage V and VI oocytes were manually dissected free from the ovaries and follicles and maintained in ND96 buffer at 18 °C until used. Various solutions (described below) were injected into oocytes via an oil-filled glass micropipette attached to a nanoliter injector (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). The injection volume could be varied from 4.6 to 50.6 nl, and final concentrations were calculated on the basis of an oocyte volume of 1 μl. Prior to the experiment, defolliculated oocytes were microinjected with the Ca2+indicator Calcium Green (∼12.5 μm final concentration; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR). The oocytes were then incubated for at least 30–40 min at room temperature to allow equilibration of the dye throughout the cytoplasm. Oocytes were placed in a glass-bottomed microscope chamber (Bionique Testing Laboratories, Inc.) containing 1 ml of ND96 buffer and placed on the stage of an inverted Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Oocytes were held in position by a microinjection pipette, and modifications of the bathing solution were made by dilution into the bath. Measurements of intracellular calcium were performed with the inverted Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with a 10× objective (0.5 numerical aperture). The calcium-sensitive dye Calcium Green was excited by the 488-nm line from a krypton-argon laser (Omnichrome Model 643, Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA), and the emission fluorescence monitored at 515 nm was selected by a band-pass filter. The pinhole aperture of the confocal microscope was set such that the fluorescence image represented an optical slice of ∼10 μm (if not otherwise specified) at the bottom of the oocyte,i.e. just above the coverslip and just under the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). All fluorescence images (256 intensity levels, 256 × 256 pixels) were detected with an analog photomultiplier tube, and the resulting images were recorded directly onto videotape. Simultaneously, up to 10 regions of interest (ROIs) distributed across the image provided an intensityversus time graphic output. Subsequently, these fluorescence values were expressed as a fraction of the initial fluorescence intensity (F/F 0). During fluorescence data collection, each scan of a 256 × 256 image took 0.35 s, and the interval between each image scan was ∼1.3 s. In some experiments, oocytes were co-injected with caged (1,4,5)IP3 (∼50 μm final concentration; Calbiochem) along with the calcium dye. Photocleavage of caged (1,4,5)IP3 was achieved using the 351/364-nm lines of an argon ion laser (Coherent Enterprise Model 652, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA), liberating (1,4,5)IP3 into the cytoplasm. The area in which photolysis occurred was defined by use of a fast gated Uniblitz shutter (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY) placed between the argon ion laser and the confocal microscope. By varying the duration the shutter was open (typically 5–10 ms), the area of photolysis could be varied in thexy plane. In earlier studies (8DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4824-4831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the actions of adenophostin A were compared with those of the physiological agonist for the IP3 receptor, (1,4,5)IP3. However, adenophostin A differs from (1,4,5)IP3 in being resistant to inactivation by the 5-phosphatase and 3-kinase (7Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for the majority of our studies, we chose to utilize a metabolism-resistant analog of (1,4,5)IP3, (2,4,5)IP3 (11Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), for comparison with adenophostin A. Fig. 2shows the pattern of [Ca2+]i signaling seen following injection of (2,4,5)IP3 at a concentration of 1 μm (final estimated cytoplasmic concentration). This somewhat intermediate concentration of (2,4,5)IP3 caused a spreading [Ca2+]i signal that filled the field of view generally within 5 min. At this concentration, the [Ca2+]i signal was usually associated with regenerative waves and spirals, as originally described by Lechleiteret al. (1Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D. Science. 1991; 252: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Also shown in Fig. 2 is a typical arrangement of ROIs used for assessing the time course of [Ca2+]i changes in the central and peripheral regions of the field of view. Fig.3 illustrates examples of the time course of [Ca2+]i changes in the peripheral and central regions of oocytes following the injection of four different concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3. In these experiments, the oocytes were initially incubated in a Ca2+-deficient medium, and extracellular Ca2+ was subsequently restored to 10 mm to assess [Ca2+]i signals due to influx. At the highest concentration (5 μm), diffusion throughout the oocyte was very rapid such that a rapid release occurred in the peripheral regions of the field of view seconds after appearing in the center. With 1 μm (2,4,5)IP3, a somewhat greater delay was observed before the peripheral regions were activated, and as shown in Fig. 2, regenerative [Ca2+]i oscillations were seen. With both 5 and 1 μm (2,4,5)IP3, re-addition of Ca2+ externally resulted in a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i indicative of Ca2+ entry, presumably due to the depletion of intracellular stores. With lower concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 (250 and 100 nm), release was seen only near the center of the field of view, and with these concentrations, the signal was seen only when the injection pipette was brought deep into the oocyte, close to the coverslip and the field of view. These smaller signals did not propagate to the periphery, and restoration of extracellular Ca2+ did not result in the activation of significant entry. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the lower concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 are insufficient to activate significant Ca2+ mobilization when finally diluted by diffusion throughout the cytoplasm. This is as not unexpected since theK d for (2,4,5)IP3 action on the IP3 receptor is >1 μm (12Spät A. Bradford P.G. McKinney J.S. Rubin R.P. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1986; 319: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A noticeable different picture was seen with adenophostin A. Fig.4 illustrates a series of images depicting the spread of the [Ca2+]i signal in an oocyte injected with adenophostin A to give a final concentration of 10 nm. This concentration of adenophostin A should, if anything, be somewhat more potent than 1 μm(2,4,5)IP3, yet between 30 and 60 min was required for the [Ca2+]i signal to fill the field of view. The full time courses of four peripheral and four central ROIs from this experiment and the experiment shown in Fig. 2 are given in Fig.5.Figure 5Comparison of the time course of the effects of (2,4,5) IP 3 (1 μm) and adenophostin A (10 nm) on intracellular calcium in oocytes. The time course of calcium-dependent fluorescence changes measured in Figs. 2 and 4 for (2,4,5)IP3 (1 μm final concentration) or adenophostin A (10 nm final concentration), respectively, are graphically depicted here. Each line represents a single ROI, each being positioned centrally (solid lines) or peripherally (dashed lines) as shown in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although somewhat larger than (2,4,5)IP3, adenophostin A would not be expected to diffuse at such a relatively slow rate unless some structure specifically impedes its rate of diffusion. It seems likely that this structure is the IP3 receptor itself. Thus, the concentrations of adenophostin A injected into the oocytes may be lower than the concentration of IP3 receptors, and when adenophostin A molecules bind to these receptors with high affinity, their rate of diffusion through the cell is dependent to a large extent on the rather slow rate of receptor dissociation. 2Machaca and Hartzell (10Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4824-4831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) came to a somewhat similar conclusion based on a reduction of the effective concentration of adenophostin A as a result of its binding to IP3receptors. A prediction then is that higher concentrations of adenophostin A would diffuse much faster throughout the cell. Fig. 6 shows that with concentrations of 250 and 100 nm adenophostin A, the [Ca2+]i signal reached the peripheral regions of the field of view much faster than with 10 nm (within 1 min or so). As for (2,4,5)IP3, once the signal had filled the field of view, restoration of extracellular Ca2+resulted in rapid influx of Ca2+. Fig.7 summarizes the data on the influx of Ca2+ in oocytes activated by relatively high concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 (10 μm) and adenophostin A (250 nm). Under these conditions, the magnitude of the influx and its sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ were indistinguishable with these two IP3 receptor ligands.Figure 7Concentration effect curves for the effect of extracellular calcium on the sustained calcium entry elicited by either 10 μm (2,4,5) IP 3 or 250 nm adenophostin A. Oocytes were injected with either (2,4,5)IP3 (10 μm) or adenophostin A (250 nm) in the absence of extracellular calcium. Oocytes were then exposed to a range of extracellular calcium conditions, and the subsequent rise in intracellular calcium (measured asF/F 0) was monitored until a new, elevated steady state was achieved. This figure compares the dependence of the sustained calcium signal on extracellular calcium in oocytes injected with either (2,4,5)IP3 (10 μm; ●) or adenophostin A (250 nm; ▴). Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. for four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated the effects of injecting very low concentrations of adenophostin A into oocytes. When injections were carried out with quantities of adenophostin A that would give cytoplasmic concentrations of ∼10 pm, we saw no changes in [Ca2+]i. However, when the pipette was brought very close to the coverslip and the field of view, a localized area of elevated [Ca2+]i was observed. In contrast to the findings with low concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3, this elevated region was relatively stable; the size of the region did not grow appreciably, and the elevated [Ca2+]i level was maintained for up to 30 min. In some oocytes, [Ca2+]i waves and spirals developed within this region (Fig. 8). These waves were similar in appearance to those seen in oocytes injected with 1 μm(2,4,5)IP3, but the waves always extinguished when reaching the limiting periphery of the region of activation. The average wave velocities were 27.3 ± 2.5 μm/s (n = 3) for (2,4,5)IP3 and 8.5 ± 0.6 μm/s (n = 7) for adenophostin A. The value for (2,4,5)IP3 is within and that for adenophostin A is just below the range reported for agonist-dependent waves first described by Lechleiteret al. (1Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D. Science. 1991; 252: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Since wave velocity is dependent on the diffusional distance between release sites, the lower value for adenophostin A may indicate that the concentration of adenophostin A-bound receptors is lower than for (2,4,5)IP3. We presume that the limited size of this activated region is determined by the limits of diffusion and action of adenophostin A. Thus, the restricted area of [Ca2+]i waves underscores the absolute requirement for activated IP3 receptors for propagation to continue. The presence of such waves under conditions whereby adenophostin appears essentially irreversibly affixed to the IP3 receptor indicates that the affinity of the ligand for the IP3 receptor, and specifically the rate of dissociation of the ligand from the IP3 receptor, is not a determinant of wave generation or propagation. We examined the activation of Ca2+ entry in oocytes injected with low concentrations of adenophostin A. Fig.9 illustrates a result with an oocyte injected with 10 nm adenophostin A. With this concentration, spread of [Ca2+]i was slow, but eventually filled the entire cell. Addition of external Ca2+ at a time when [Ca2+]i was elevated in the central regions, but not yet in the peripheral regions, of the cell resulted in a further rise in [Ca2+]iin the central regions, but no increase in the periphery. Thus, these localized responses to adenophostin A are apparently capable of activating Ca2+ entry. There is considerable evidence that the endoplasmic reticulum of cells is at least somewhat continuous throughout the cell (13Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered the possibility that despite the restricted localization of the sites of Ca2+ release within the oocyte, Ca2+ may become depleted from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in the cellular periphery and that this depleted endoplasmic reticulum may contribute to the signaling of Ca2+ entry. To investigate this possibility, we injected an oocyte with caged (1,4,5)IP3 along with Calcium Green. In the experiment shown in Fig. 10, after insertion of the microinjection pipette, the oocyte was briefly (5 ms) exposed to the UV laser, liberating (1,4,5)IP3 in a small area of the cytoplasm (in the xy plane). This resulted in a rapid and transient release of intracellular Ca2+. Subsequently, the same oocyte was injected with adenophostin A to give a final concentration (if fully diluted) of ∼10 pm. This quantity of adenophostin A gave a relatively stable localized region of elevated [Ca2+]i. Exposure to the UV laser revealed that the release of Ca2+ in the peripheral regions appeared similar to that seen prior to adenophostin A injection. Following the discharge of Ca2+ by the photolytic release of (1,4,5)IP3, the liberated Ca2+ was re-accumulated presumably following the time course of diffusion and metabolism of (1,4,5)IP3. This indicates that when the action of adenophostin A is restricted to specific cellular regions, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores outside of that region remain fully charged and functional. Fig. 11 illustrates an experiment in which Ca2+ entry was assessed in an oocyte injected with the lowest concentration of adenophostin A used (10 pm). In this particular cell, an initial central release of Ca2+was followed by the appearance of [Ca2+]ioscillations. Addition of 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i restricted to the region of the cell influenced by the adenophostin A injection. Elevation in [Ca2+]i was seen in the cell periphery only in response to liberation of (1,4,5)IP3 from its caged precursor. The results of this study demonstrate that adenophostin A has the unique ability to activate and regulate [Ca2+]isignaling in precise, spatially restricted regions of the cell. The reason for this behavior is likely due to the high affinity of adenophostin A for the IP3 receptor and its presumed slow rate of dissociation from the receptor. In a previous report on the binding of IP3 to its receptor, Spät et al. (12Spät A. Bradford P.G. McKinney J.S. Rubin R.P. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1986; 319: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) pointed out that the (1,4,5)IP3 signaling system worked efficiently because the concentration of cellular receptors was less than the K d of (1,4,5)IP3 for its receptor. When the concentration of receptor is higher than the K d of its ligand, nonlinear behavior can result, and the receptor becomes a reservoir for ligand, reducing its free concentration (14Chang K.-J. Jacobs S. Cuatrecasas P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This is likely the situation with low concentrations of adenophostin A, although adenophostin A at higher concentrations functions as a full and potent activator of the (1,4,5)IP3 pathway (15Hirota J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) observed activation of Ca2+ entry with low concentrations of adenophostin A (∼100 pm (8DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C.

Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). DeLisle et al. saw no evidence of Ca2+ release with these concentrations, whereas Hartzellet al. observed small chloride currents attributable to intracellular release. Both groups of investigators concluded that an IP3 receptor was involved in the action of adenophostin A, possibly through releasing from a small subset of the intracellular stores. In a more recent publication, Machaca and Hartzell (10Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4824-4831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) also observed that the spread of adenophostin A-induced [Ca2+]i signals was somewhat slower than for (1,4,5)IP3 and concluded that the slow release might diminish the magnitude of the associated chloride current. Our findings suggest an alternative explanation for the inability of adenophostin A to efficiently activate chloride currents associated with release. When chloride current is used as a measure of [Ca2+]i, only changes in [Ca2+]i immediately under the plasma membrane can be observed. Clearly, any influx of Ca2+ must occur across the plasma membrane, and thus, the use of a plasma membrane-associated marker, such as Ca2+-dependent chloride channels, will be a sensitive indicator of this mode of Ca2+ signaling. From the current results, it is clear that injections of small quantities of adenophostin A can induce a substantial degree of intracellular release of Ca2+, but that this release can occur at some distance from the plasma membrane and thus would not be seen by plasma membrane chloride channels. The opacity of the ooplasm, due to high concentrations of yolk proteins, makes it difficult to image deeply into the oocyte. Thus, to observe this spatially restricted action of adenophostin A, we injected close to the plasma membrane just above the coverslip. These regions of release presumably make contact with the plasma membrane where it sits on the coverslip. The Ca2+influx observed in this situation may be derived from Ca2+in the limited aqueous space between the oocyte and coverslip. Presumably with injections in more central regions of the cell, such as in the previous electrophysiological experiments, it would be possible to activate regions of Ca2+ release that make minimal contact with the plasma membrane of the oocyte. Such spatially restricted regions of Ca2+ depletion might signal to the plasma membrane to activate entry that would be detected as chloride current. In any event, it is obvious from the unusual behavior of adenophostin A that assessment of [Ca2+]i changes near the plasma membrane may severely underestimate the extent of cellular Ca2+ discharge by this agent, and this may result in the apparent dissociation between release and entry observed in earlier studies. In a recent report, the activity of a putative diffusible calcium influx factor, CIF, was described (17Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This material was capable of diffusing through and activating calcium influx in regions associated with intact endoplasmic reticulum stores. In the current studies, if such a factor had been released from the regions of adenophostin A action, it would be expected to diffuse into and activate entry in the peripheral regions of the oocyte; however, no such signal was observed. Thus, the coupling of intracellular calcium release to calcium entry in the oocyte appears to depend more intimately on the proximity of IP3-depleted calcium stores, perhaps because of the involvement of IP3 receptors in conveying the signal to the plasma membrane (18Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Although adenophostin A may not have unique actions on the calcium entry pathway, its unusual kinetic behavior affords an opportunity to control experimentally the extent of Ca2+ signaling spatially within a single cell. For example, the spatially restricted calcium waves, such as those shown in Fig. 8, make it clear that wave propagation cannot extend beyond the region of action of an IP3 receptor agonist. Since regenerative waves were frequently observed within this restricted region, it is clear that agonist affinity, and specifically the dissociation rate from the receptor, is not a factor in the propagation mechanism. This is somewhat surprising given the well documented inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on IP3 receptor affinity and specifically the dissociation rate (19Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S.

This unusual ability of adenophostin A to produce spatially restricted regions of activated calcium signaling may prove useful in other ways in future studies of the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca2+ signaling. We are indebted to Dr. James Lechleiter for advice on the techniques for injection of oocytes with inositol phosphates and confocal calcium imaging and to Jeff Reece for excellent technical support of the confocal facility. Useful critiques of this work were given by Drs. Lisa Broad and David Miller."

In mouse fibroblasts adhered to substrates, PTP36 was phosphorylated on serine residues. PTP36 was found to make complexes with serine/threonine kinase(s), which phosphorylated PTP36 in vitro. PTP36 was dephosphorylated rapidly when the cell-substrate adhesion was disrupted and it was phosphorylated again along with the reattachment of the cells to fibronectin. Rephosphorylation of PTP36 seemed to depend on actin polymerization since it was inhibited by cytochalasin D. The cell detachment also induced the translocation of PTP36 into the membrane-associated cytoskeletal fraction. Staurosporine and ML-9, which inhibited the phosphorylation of PTP36 in vivo, induced the translocation of PTP36 too. On the contrary, when the dephosphorylation of PTP36 was inhibited by okadaic acid, no translocation of PTP36 was induced by the cell detachment. These results demonstrate that the cell-substrate adhesion and cell spreading regulates the intracellular localization of PTP36 most likely through its phosphorylation and therefore, PTP36 may play important roles in the signal transduction pathway of cell-adhesion.

Among the diverse functions of PTP, lines of evidence are now emerging which suggest roles of PTP in the regulation and/or signal transduction of cell adhesion (2Tonks N.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For example, reduction of the cell-substrate adhesion activates PTPs in the chicken embryo fibroblast (4Maher P.A. Proc. Natl.

PTP36 is expressed in various tissues and cell lines including fibroblasts. PTP36 possesses a domain homologous to the N-terminal half of band 4.1 protein. Several cytoskeletal proteins and PTPs have this band 4.1 homology domain and constitute the band 4.1 superfamily (11Takeuchi K. Kawashima A. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1921-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, five mammalian PTPs belong to the band 4.1 superfamily and they fall into three subgroups based on their structure. The first subgroup is composed of PTPH1 (12Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and PTPMEG (13Gu M.X. York J.D.

PTPs of the first and the second subgroup have one N-terminal band 4.1 homology domain and one C-terminal PTP domain separated by an intervening sequence. The intervening sequence of the first subgroup has a PDZ domain and a potential SH3-binding site. Although there is poor homology, the intervening sequence of the second subgroup also has a potential SH3 or WW binding motif. Unlike these PTPs, PTP-BAS/hPTP1E/PTPL1/FAP-1, a PTP of the third subgroup, has a band 4.1 homology domain in the middle of the molecule. It has five PDZ domains and interacts with a GTPase-activating protein for Rho (PARG1) (19Saras J. Franzen P. Aspenstrom P. Hellman U. Gonez L.J. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

Conservation of the band 4.1 superfamily PTP in Caenorhabditis elegans but not in yeast might suggest its fundamental roles in the multicellular organism. However, the biological roles of the band 4.1 superfamily PTP are largely unknown. Recently we have found that the overexpression of PTP36 in the HeLa cells induces changes in cytoskeletons, focal adhesions, cell-substrate adhesions, and cell growth (22Ogata M. Takada T. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Uchida Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12905-12909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is also reported that COS-7 cells overexpressing PTPMEG grow slower, reach confluence at a lower cell density, and make much fewer colonies in soft agar (23Gu M. Meng K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12980-12985Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the band 4.1 superfamily PTP might have a close relationship to the signal transduction of cell adhesion. However, it was not known if cell adhesion had any effect on the band 4.1 superfamily PTP. Here we report the regulation of PTP36 by cell-substrate adhesion. Cell-substrate adhesion regulates the intracellular localization of PTP36 most likely through its phosphorylation. Therefore, PTP36 could play an important role in the signal transduction pathways of cell-substrate adhesion. Female Lewis rats (6–7 weeks of age) were obtained from Shizuoka Experimental Animal Laboratory (Hamamatsu, Japan). Enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Promega (Madison, WI), and Stratagene (La Lolla, CA). Staurosporine, calphostin C, cytochalasin D, and colchicine were purchased from Sigma, and KN-62, H-89, W-7, ML-9, and ML-7 were purchased from Seikagaku Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Purified myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), calmodulin, and a substrate peptide were kind gifts from Dr. Nakanishi, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd. Anti-actin (AC-40; mouse IgG2a) and anti-vimentin (V9; mouse IgG1) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-α-tubulin (DM1A; mouse IgG1), anti-c-Src (SRC2; rabbit), and anti-caveolin (C13630; rabbit) were from Cedar Lane (Westbury, NY), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Radionucleotides were purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The immunizing antigen was a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids (aa) 399–738 of PTP36 polypeptide (GST-P36/399–738). The fusion protein was expressed and purified as described (25Ogata M. Sawada M. Fujino Y. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2337-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To detect anti-PTP36 antibody, a fusion protein of maltose-binding protein and aa 399–738 of PTP36 (MBP-P36/399–738) was used. Female adult Lewis rats were immunized with GST-P36/399–738 for several times. Three days after the last immunization, spleen cells were fused with SP2/O mouse myeloma cells. The supernatant from each well was tested for the reactivity with both GST-P36/399–738 and MAL-P36/399–738 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. pEFP36FC, an expression construct of PTP36, was created as follows. A ClaI site was created 5′ to nucleotide 73 of PTP36 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using a primer, P36-A6 (5′-AATCGATAAGGCCATCTCAGGGGTGCC-3′). At the 3′ end of the PTP36 cDNA, there was a NotI site, which was derived from the adapter sequence. The ClaI (partial)/NotI fragment was subcloned into ClaI/NotI site of the mFas-Fc plasmid (26Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). pEFP36FC and pNYpgk-pc, a plasmid possessing a puromycin resistance gene, were linearized with ScaI and co-transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblast by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. After 2 days, cells were selected in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (P-7255, Sigma). The cell lysate was prepared from each colony and the expression level of PTP36 was determined by immunoblotting. A stable transfectant, 3T3/P36-8, was obtained. 3T3/P36-8, a stable transfectant of 3T3 fibroblast overexpressing PTP36, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. To test the effects of various inhibitors, cells (1 × 105 in 1 ml) were seeded in the 24-well tissue culture plate. The next day, cells were incubated with various inhibitors in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum and lysed directly on the wells by 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For the cell-detachment experiments, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm EDTA and detached from the tissue culture dish by scraping. Alternatively, cells were detached by the incubation with trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) in PBS for no longer than 10 min. For the reattachment experiments, the trypsinized cells were washed by PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and resuspended in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Then the cells were incubated in the precoated 24-well tissue culture plate at 37 °C for 20 min. Floating cells were recovered by centrifugation, lysed, and mixed with the lysate from the attached cells. Each well of the plate was coated by incubation with 150 μl of fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or heat-treated (80 °C for 20 min) BSA (5 mg/ml) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. 3T3/P36-8 cells (4 × 105) were cultured overnight in a 6-cm dish. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated in 1.5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 1.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (NEX-053H, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) for 3 h. The cells were washed with DMEM (with phosphate) and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was used for the immunoprecipitation as described (22Ogata M. Takada T. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Uchida Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12905-12909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide analysis were performed as described (27Siegel J.N. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 11.2.1-11.2.17Google Scholar). The hydrolyzed phosphoamino acid or the phosphopeptides digested by TPCK-trypsin (Worthington, NJ) was resolved in two dimensions on the TLC plates (catalog number 5716, Merck, Darmstadt) using the Multiphor II horizontal electrophoresis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylated PTP36 was immunoprecipitated with 21-4 mAb from 3T3/P36-8 cells. The dephosphorylation of PTP36 in vitro was done as described (28Baniyash M. Garcia-Morales P. Luong E. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18225-18230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the precipitate was treated with or without 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 16 h. Then PTP36 was detected by immunoblotting using 21-4 mAb. 3T3/P36-8 cells on a 10-cm tissue culture dish were detached by scraping and lysed in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate. After PTP36 was immunoprecipitated with 21-4 followed by MAR 18.5, the sample was washed once with the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2). For the kinase reaction, kinase buffer was added to 12.5 μl and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 62.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi). One-fifth of the precipitated sample was used for a reaction. The reaction was terminated after incubation at 25 °C for 30 min. In the preliminary experiment, the phosphorylation level of PTP36 increased linearly up to 30 min. For the reprecipitation of 32P-labeled PTP36, the phosphorylated samples were incubated in 50 μl of 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 95 °C for 3 min, diluted with 350 μl of RIPA buffer and used for the immunoprecipitation with 21-4 mAb. To test the possibility that MLCK could phosphorylate PTP36 directly, PTP36 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate prepared with RIPA buffer and used as a substrate. The immunoprecipitated PTP36 was incubated in 25 μl of the kinase buffer containing 2.8 nmMLCK, 10 nm calmodulin, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C for 30 min. A weak phosphorylation of PTP36 was detectable without MLCK probably because a small amount of kinase(s) was coprecipitated even in the RIPA buffer. However, there was no increase in the phosphorylation level of PTP36 whereas 22% (145060 cpm) of the total count was incorporated into the MLC peptide (KKRPQRTSNVFS, Peninsula Laboratories, used at 24 mm) in the same assay condition. Protein kinases were detected in SDS-PAGE gels by a modification of the method of Ferrell and Martin (37Ferrell J.E. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 3020-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates containing kinases were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, SDS was removed by soaking the gels in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 3 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature. For the denaturation, gels were soaked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 7 m guanidine-HCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were then allowed to renature by soaking the gel in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 overnight at 4 °C. In situphosphorylation was performed by soaking the gel in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 400 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 3 h at room temperature. Unincorporated ATP was removed by washing overnight at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 g of Dowex 2 × 8–50 anion exchange resin, changing the buffer three to four times. 3T3/P36-8 cells were fractionated as described (29Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Zimolo Z.A. Stern A.M. Waxman L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were suspended in the hypotonic buffer A containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF, and homogenized using Dounce tissue homogenizer until over 90% cells were disrupted, then sucrose was added to 250 mm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C yielding the crude nuclear pellet (P1) and the supernatant 1 (S1). S1 was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C yielding the crude mitochondrial pellet (P2) and the supernatant 2 (S2). S2 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C yielding the crude microsomal pellet (P3) and the cytosolic fraction (S3). P2 and P3 were lysed in buffer A containing 250 mm sucrose and 1% Triton X-100, and separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C yielding the pellet (P) and the supernatant (S). Cytoskeletal fractionation was performed as described (30Arai M. Cohen J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; : 38PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer (CSK-buffer: 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) containing 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate for 5 min at 4 °C (total lysate). The total lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C yielding the pellet and the supernatant. Triton X-100-insoluble microdomains of cellular membranes fraction were separated as described (31Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We established a stable transfectant of mouse 3T3 fibroblast, 3T3/P36-8, which expressed the PTP36 protein about 5-fold above the endogenous level. 3T3/P36-8 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, lysed in the RIPA buffer, and then, PTP36 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-PTP36 mAb, 21-4. After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, PTP36 was found to be a 130-kDa phosphoprotein (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The phosphoamino acid analysis showed that phosphorylation occurred almost exclusively on serine residues (Fig.1 B). PTP36 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate, dephosphorylated with the alkaline phosphatase in vitro, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The dephosphorylated PTP36 migrated faster (Fig. 1,C, lane 4 and D, lane 2) than the untreated (phosphorylated) PTP36 (Fig. 1, C, lanes 2 and 3and D, lane 1). The change in migration was not observed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 1 D, lanes 3 and4). When the cell-substrate adhesion of 3T3/P36-8 cells was disrupted by scraping, the less phosphorylated and faster migrating form of PTP36 was detectable within 5 min (Fig.2 A). This dephosphorylation was completely blocked by preincubating the cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases (Fig. 2 E, lane 4). Similar results were obtained using wild type 3T3 cells (Fig.2 F). Cell detachment by trypsinization also induced dephosphorylation (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The dephosphorylation was reversible since PTP36 was phosphorylated again along with the reattachment of the cells to the fibronectin-coated wells (Fig.2 C, lanes 3 and 5). The rephosphorylation was induced by the cell spreading on the poly-l-lysine-coated wells but was much slower (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4 and6). Neither cell spreading nor rephosphorylation was induced when cells were incubated in the BSA-coated wells (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). The phosphorylation was inhibited by cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization (Fig. 2 D, lane 5), but not by colchicine, a microtubule-disrupting agent (Fig. 2 D, lane 6). To study the kinases involved in phosphorylation of PTP36, we first examined whether PTP36 makes complexes with serine/threonine kinases. 3T3/P36-8 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Then, PTP36 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PTP36 mAb (21-4). The immune complex kinase assay was performed and as shown in Fig.3 A, PTP36 was phosphorylatedin vitro by the coprecipitated kinase(s). To confirm that the major 32P-labeled 130-kDa band contained PTP36, PTP36 in the sample was reprecipitated after removing associated molecules by denaturation with SDS (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). To visualize the coprecipitated kinases, in gel kinase assay was performed. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, renatured in gel, and then kinases were detected by 32P incorporation. Two kinase bands, 160 and 88 kDa in size, were observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) and the phosphoamino acid analysis showed that serine residues were phosphorylated in these bands (data not shown). Phosphorylation sites of PTP36 in vivo and in vitro were compared by the phosphotryptic peptide mapping. Although several spots in vitro were phosphorylated weakly (Fig. 4 B, arrowheads), almost all the spots in vivo (Fig. 4 A) were detectablein vitro after a prolonged exposure (Fig.4 D). To characterize the kinase(s) further, various inhibitors were added to immune complex kinase reactions. Staurosporine, a broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, was found to inhibit phosphorylation of PTP36 in vitro (Fig.5, A, lane 2, andC). Other inhibitors, including ML-9 (MLCK inhibitor), calphostin C (protein kinase C inhibitor), KN-62 (calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II inhibitor), H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and W-7 (calmodulin inhibitor), revealed little effect (Fig.5 A). In vivo, staurosporine also suppressed phosphorylation of PTP36 when it was added to 3T3/P36-8 cells (Fig. 5, B, lane 2, and C). Unexpectedly, ML-9, which did not inhibit the phosphorylation in vitro, suppressed phosphorylationin vivo (Fig. 5 B, lanes 8). ML-7 (50 μm), another inhibitor of MLCK, also inhibited the phosphorylation (data not shown). Furthermore, W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor, revealed the inhibitory effect (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). This makes sense since MLCK is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase. However, no direct phosphorylation of PTP36 in vitro was detectable when purified MLCK and calmodulin were added to immunoprecipitated PTP36 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thus, MLCK might regulate the phosphorylation level of PTP36 indirectly. It should be noted that a relatively high amount of ML-9 (100 μm) is required to completely inhibit the phosphorylation of PTP36. Further study is necessary to determine if the target of ML-9 is MLCK. To study the effects of the phosphorylation of PTP36, we compared the subcellular distribution of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated PTP36 in attached and detached 3T3/P36-8 cells. We first performed the subcellular fractionation experiments. 3T3/P36-8 cells grown on the tissue culture dish were either left untreated or detached by scraping and incubated in suspension (Fig.6 A). The membrane fractionation was done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g and separated in the pellet (P1; crude nuclear fraction) and the post-nuclear supernatant (S1). S1 was further separated by the centrifugation at 12,500 × g followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g yielding the pellets (P2 and P3) and the final supernatant (S3). The phosphorylated PTP36 in the attached cells was found almost exclusively in the S3 cytosolic fraction (Fig. 6 A, lane 5) while the dephosphorylated PTP36 in the detached cells was relatively enriched in the P3 membrane fraction (Fig. 6 A, lane 9). The dephosphorylated PTP36 in the P2 and P3 fractions was resistant to solubilization by Triton X-100 (Fig. 6 A, lanes 11 and13). This suggested the association of the dephosphorylated PTP36 with cytoskeletons. To confirm the association, the cytoskeletal fractionation was performed. Cells were lysed in the cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer (CSK buffer) containing Triton X-100 and separated at 4 °C by centrifugation. In this separation condition, the actin-based microfilaments and the intermediate filaments were stabilized and recovered in the 14,000 × g pellet, whereas the microtubules were destabilized and recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 6 B). Actin monomers were recovered in the supernatant fraction too. As expected, the phosphorylated PTP36 was found in the cytosolic supernatant fraction (Fig. 6 B, lane 3) whereas the dephosphorylated PTP36 was enriched in the pellet fraction containing the polymerized actin and vimentin (Fig. 6 B, lane 5). Collectively, we conclude that cell detachment induces dephosphorylation and translocation of PTP36 from cytosol to the membrane-associated cytoskeletons. The translocation of the endogenous PTP36 was confirmed in the wild type (untransfected) 3T3 cells (Fig.6 F). The translocation of PTP36 was further confirmed by the immunofluorescence microscopy experiments. Unfortunately, 21-4 mAb failed to detect PTP36, probably because the epitope was masked in the cells. Thus, the localization of the HA-epitope-tagged PTP36 (PTP36-HA) and the PTP36 fused to green fluorescent protein (PTP36-GFP) (22Ogata M. Takada T. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Uchida Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12905-12909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was studied. As expected, PTP36-HA and PTP36-GFP distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm in the attached cells (Fig.7, b and d), while they were enriched in the region near the cytoplasmic membrane in the detached cells (Fig. 7, a and c). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g, a substantial amount of dephosphorylated PTP36 was found in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 6 B, lane 6). However, most of PTP36 in the supernatant fraction was insoluble in Triton X-100 and was precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (data not shown). This might suggest that some of the dephosphorylated PTP36 translocated to the microdomains of cellular membranes that are insoluble in Triton X-100 (32Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar). However, PTP36 was not copurified with caveolin, a marker protein for the microdomain (Fig. 6 C). The results described above suggest that cell detachment induces the translocation of PTP36 through its dephosphorylation. In good accordance with this notion, the reduction of the phosphorylation level of PTP36 by staurosporine and ML-9 resulted in the translocation of PTP36 without cell detachment (Fig. 6 D, lanes 7 and9). Moreover, preincubation of the cells with okadaic acid completely blocked not only the dephosphorylation but also the translocation of PTP36 induced by cell detachment (Fig. 6 E, lane 8). Cell detachment and okadaic acid revealed little effect on the distribution of Src kinase (Fig. 6 E, lower panel). The translocation was observed following the dephosphorylation of PTP36in vitro. When the cell lysates were prepared from the attached cells in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, PTP36 was dephosphorylated in vitro. The dephosphorylated PTP36 was recovered in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction (Fig. 6 G, lane 2). Taken collectively, it is most likely that the phosphorylation level of PTP36 regulates its subcellular localization. The phosphorylation of band 4.1 superfamily PTPs, PTPH1 and PTPMEG, by serine/threonine kinase(s) has been reported (24Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Zhang S.H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, no physiological regulation of the phosphorylation level of the PTPs was known. Here we report the phosphorylation of PTP36 and its complex formation with serine/threonine kinases. What is more important, cell adhesion has a profound regulatory effect on the phosphorylation level and subcellular localization of PTP36. The kinase that phosphorylates PTP36 in vivo remains to be identified. We found kinase activities coprecipitated with PTP36. Several lines of evidence suggest that the coprecipitated kinase(s) phosphorylate PTP36 in vivo too. For example, coprecipitated kinase(s) were inhibited by staurosporine, which inhibited the in vivo phosphorylation in similar dose-response relationships. Moreover, comparing the phosphopeptide maps, almost all the spots phosphorylated in vivo were also detectable in vitro. It should be noted, however, several spots were phosphorylated weakly in vitro. The PTP36 used as a substrate in the immune complex kinase assay was a mixture of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated PTP36. Thus, it is possible that some sites have been already phosphorylated in vivo and there is less room left for the incorporation of 32Pin vitro. Another explanation is that there are several kinases that phosphorylate PTP36 on different sites and some of the kinases are coprecipitated less well. The kinases which phosphorylate PTPH1 and PTPMEG in vivohave not been identified either. It was reported that protein kinase A, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and C-TAK1 phosphorylate PTPH1 in vitro (33Zhang S.H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Zhang S.H. Kobayashi R. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, these kinases may not be responsible for the in vivophosphorylation of PTP36 in view of their size and sensitivity to various kinase inhibitors. The mechanism that regulates the phosphorylation level of PTP36 is largely unknown. The phosphorylation of PTP36 is induced by the cell attachment to fibronectin more efficiently than the cell spreading on the poly-l-lysine-coated wells. Thus, the cell adhesion through integrins might not be essential but an important regulation mechanism. We found that ML-9, an inhibitor of MLCK, reduced the phosphorylation level of PTP36 in vivo. It was reported that the inhibitors of MLCK promoted disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (35Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Conti M.A. Adelstein R. Glass D.B. Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, reduced the rephosphorylation of PTP36. Collectively, we speculate that actin-cytoskeleton might be involved in the regulation. Based on the subcellular fractionation and the immunofluorescence microscopy experiments, we conclude that the dephosphorylated PTP36 is enriched in the membrane-associated cytoskeletal fraction. This distribution pattern is similar to that of PTPMEG, which is localized primarily to the membrane and the cytoskeletal fractions (24Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Not all the localizations of PTP36 are clarified completely. For example, while the dephosphorylated PTP36 is not copurified with Triton X-100-insoluble membrane microdomains, it is still possible that PTP36 may dissociate from the microdomain during the purification process. Further study is necessary to answer such a question. The role of the phosphorylation in the regulation of PTPH1 and PTPMEG is largely unknown. Little change in the enzymatic activity was observed after the phosphorylation of PTPH1 (33Zhang S.H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it was reported that PTPH1 made a complex with 14-3-3β in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (34Zhang S.H. Kobayashi R. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This might suggest that the phosphorylation of PTPH1 regulates its association with 14-3-3β. However, no physiological stimulation that affects the phosphorylation level of PTPH1 has been reported. We demonstrated in this study that cell-substrate adhesion regulates the phosphorylation and the localization of PTP36. The localization seems to be regulated through the phosphorylation level of PTP36 since: 1) okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatase, completely blocks the translocation induced by cell detachment and 2) the reduction of the phosphorylation level by staurosporine and ML-9 is sufficient to induce translocation. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of PTP36 in vitro is accompanied by the translocation. Taken collectively, it is most likely that the phosphorylation level of PTP36 regulates its subcellular localization. For more definitive demonstration, identification and specific inactivation of the kinase and/or identification and mutagenesis of the phosphorylation sites on PTP36 might be necessary. The physiological functions of PTP36 remain to be determined. Recently, we established a HeLa cell line in which PTP36 overexpression was inducible (22Ogata M. Takada T. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Uchida Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12905-12909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There was little endogenous PTP36 detectable in the parental HeLa cells. When the overexpression of PTP36 was induced, we observed: 1) morphological changes, 2) a decrease in the actin stress fibers, 3) a decrease in the focal adhesions, 4) a reduction in the cell adhesion to collagen, and 5) a decrease in cell growth (22Ogata M. Takada T. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Uchida Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12905-12909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike in the HeLa transfectants, we failed to detect any convincing effect of the overexpression in the 3T3/P36-8 cells. 2M. Ogata and T. Hamaoka, unpublished observation. One fascinating explanation for the apparent discrepancy is that PTP36 overexpressed in 3T3 cells is attenuated by sequestration from its targets. In 3T3 cells adhered to the substrates, PTP36 is phosphorylated and localized to the cytosol. In contrast, PTP36 in the HeLa transfectant is largely in the dephosphorylated form2 and, as expected, PTP36 is localized near the plasma membrane (22Ogata M. Takada T. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Uchida Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12905-12909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Collectively, our current working hypothesis is as follows. Detachment from substrates in part of the cell induces the dephosphorylation and translocation of PTP36 from cytosol to cytoskeleton, where it plays roles in the regulation of cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and cell growth.
