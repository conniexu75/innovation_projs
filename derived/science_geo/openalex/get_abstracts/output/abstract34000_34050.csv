https://openalex.org/W1965735992,"We present evidence that the human thyroid hormone receptor forms a heterodimer with the human retinoic acid receptor. This interaction results in a cooperative increase in binding of the α retinoic acid receptor to a subset of thyroid hormone response elements. Mutations within the DNA binding domain or near the C-terminus abolish either receptor's ability to interact cooperatively on these elements. The thyroid hormone-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer exhibits novel transcriptional properties in that coexpression of both receptors at low levels in Green monkey kidney (CV1) cells results in a positive transcriptional effect on promoters containing a palindromic thyroid hormone response element, but has a surprisingly negative effect on a thyroid hormone response element derived from the α myosin heavy chain gene. These results suggest that by forming heterodimers, more elab-orate control of transcription can be achieved by creating receptor combinations with differing activities."
https://openalex.org/W1592741796,"The phosphotriesterase produced from the opd cistron of Pseudomonas diminuta was purified 1500-fold to homogeneity using a combination of gel filtration, ion exchange, hydrophobic, and dye matrix chromatographic steps. This is the first organophosphate triesterase or organophosphofluoridate hydrolyzing enzyme to be purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is a monomeric, spherical protein having a molecular weight of 39,000. A single zinc atom is bound to the enzyme and is required for catalytic activity. Incubation with metal chelating compounds, o-phenanthroline, EDTA, or 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylate inactivate the enzyme. The kinetic rate constants, kcat and kcat/Km, for the hydrolysis of paraoxon are 2100 s-1 and 4 x 10(7) M-1 s-1, respectively. The enzyme is inhibited competitively by dithiothreitol, dithioerithritol, and beta-mercaptoethanol. In addition to paraoxon the phosphotriesterase was found to hydrolyze the commonly used organophosphorus insecticides, dursban, parathion, coumaphos, diazinon, fensulfothion, methyl parathion, and cyanophos."

A defined peptide encoded by Ad5 E1A is the target structure for H-2Db-restricted CTLs. Upon intravenous injection into B6 nude mice bearing Ad5 E1-induced tumors, these CTLs, if combined with recombinant IL-2, destroy subcutaneous tumor masses up to 10 cm3. The in vivo action of CTLs is highly specific, and long-term ""memory"" persists in treated nude mice months after tumor regression. Our data show an important role for CTLs directed against a viral nuclear oncogene product in tumor eradication."
https://openalex.org/W1530641856,"Inorganic pyrophosphatase was purified from the vacuolar membrane of mung bean hypocotyl tissue by solubilization with lysophosphatidylcholine and QAE-Toyopearl chromatography. The molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 73,000 daltons. Among the amino-terminal first 30 amino acids are 25 nonpolar hydrophobic residues. For maximum activity, the purified pyrophosphatase required 1 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM K+. The enzyme reaction was stimulated by exogenous phospholipid in the presence of detergent. Excess pyrophosphate as well as excess magnesium inhibited the pyrophosphatase. The enzyme reaction was strongly inhibited by ATP, GTP, and CTP at 2 mM, and the inhibition was reversed by increasing the Mg2+ concentration. An antibody preparation raised in a rabbit against the purified enzyme inhibited both the reactions of pyrophosphate hydrolysis of the purified preparation and the pyrophosphate-dependent H+ translocation in the tonoplast vesicles. N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide became bound to the purified pyrophosphatase and inhibited the reaction of pyrophosphate hydrolysis. It is concluded that the 73-kDa protein in vacuolar membrane functions as an H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1533239781,"β-Adrenergic receptor expression and receptor mRNA levels are down-regulated by β-adrenergic agonists and up-regulated by glucocorticoids. The interaction between these two opposing regulatory pathways was investigated at the levels of receptor and receptor mRNA in DDT1 MF-2 hamster vas deferens cells. Dexamethasone blunted a marked decrease in receptor expression induced by isoproterenol alone, as made visible by indirect immunofluorescence using antireceptor antibodies. Receptor mRNA levels were quantified by DNA-excess solution hybridization. Dexamethasone stimulated a sharp increase in receptor mRNA at 4 h following the addition of steroid in either the absence or the presence of isoproterenol. By 12 h, dexamethasone treatment resulted in a new steady-state level of receptor mRNA double that observed in untreated cells. Isoproterenol blunted the dexamethasone effect observed at 12 h. Cells treated with isoproterenol and dexamethasone in combination displayed a new steady-state level only 30% greater than untreated cells. Measured by nuclear run-on assays, transcription rates of the receptor gene were unaffected in cells challenged with isoproterenol alone. Dexamethasone, in contrast, stimulated a 4-fold increase in β2-adrenergic receptor gene transcription. Isoproterenol and dexamethasone in combination promoted a transcription rate comparable to dexamethasone alone. The half-life of receptor mRNA in untreated and dexamethasone-treated cells was 12 h. In contrast, β-adrenergic receptor mRNA half-life declined to 5 h in cells that were treated with isoproterenol in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Agonist-promoted destabilization and steroid-induced transcription provide mechanisms for the interplay of two opposing pathways controlling receptor mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1493889956,"The procoagulant response of endothelium to many stimuli alters the expression of tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI) PAI-1 and PAI-2. The regulation of these proteins was examined in cultured human endothelial cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Unstimulated cells contained approximately 670 PAI-1 and approximately 100 thrombomodulin mRNA molecules/cell, whereas tissue factor and PAI-2 mRNAs were not detectable. By 3-5 h, PMA or TNF induced both tissue factor and PAI-2 to approximately 150-420 mRNA molecules/cell and both mRNAs declined to basal levels within several hours; however, PAI-1 and thrombomodulin mRNA levels did not change. Nuclear runoff assays showed that PMA, TNF, or cycloheximide induced transcription of the tissue factor gene, whereas the genes for thrombomodulin, PAI-1, and PAI-2 apparently were transcribed at the same relative rate in the presence or absence of these agents. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide stabilized tissue factor and PAI-2 mRNAs and increased their induction by PMA or TNF. The synthesis of tissue factor, PAI-1, and PAI-2 proteins paralleled their mRNA levels. The effects of TNF were similar to those of PMA with one exception. In contrast to PMA, TNF reduced thrombomodulin activity approximately 80% with no change in thrombomodulin mRNA levels. Thus, PAI-2 may be induced by inhibiting mRNA degradation. Tissue factor can be induced by stimulating transcription and potentially by inhibiting mRNA degradation. Thrombomodulin can be repressed by a translational or posttranslational mechanism. PAI-1 was not regulated under the conditions studied. The different effects of PMA and TNF on thrombomodulin expression indicate that some effects of TNF are not mediated solely by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1482554720,"Abstract This report describes the cloning of a full length cDNA encoding PKBS, a protein of approximately 17 kDa associated with peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. Cyanogen bromide digestion of purified PKBS yielded several peptide fragments which were subjected to gas-phase sequencing. Based on these partial amino acid sequences, oligonucleotide probes were used to screen a rat adrenal cDNA library. Several hybridizing clones were isolated which were found to contain overlapping sequences. The longest cDNA spanned 781 base pairs and specified an open reading frame of 169 amino acids which matched all of the peptide sequences. Northern analysis with this PKBS cDNA probe in different rat tissues revealed one RNA species of approximately 850 nucleotides exhibiting relative abundances qualitatively comparable with the densities of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in each tissue. The PKBS cDNA was cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector placing it under transcriptional control of the beta-globin promoter and SV40 enhancer. Transfection of the transformed human kidney 293 cell line with this recombinant vector resulted in stoichiometric increases of about 900 fmol/mg of protein in binding capacities for Ro5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) and PK 11195, two peripheral-type benzodiazepine ligands. These increases were accounted for by the expression of binding sites with approximate dissociation constants of 5 nM for PK 11195 and 8 nM for Ro5-4864, thereby distinguishing the expressed binding sites as being characteristic of the receptor from rat origin rather than of the host human-derived cell line. The rank order of potency of different ligands to compete against [3H]Ro5-4864 binding in the transfected cells was PK 11195 greater than Ro5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than protoporphyrin IX greater than clonazepam, consistent with the specificity characteristic of rat peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. These studies suggest that PKBS comprises binding domains for benzodiazepines and isoquinoline carboxamides and hence is apparently responsible for the manifestation of peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites."
https://openalex.org/W1523663652,"We have deleted the chromosomal ant gene from Escherichia coli by substitution with the kan gene, which encodes kanamycin resistance. The delta ant strains obtained cannot adapt to high sodium concentrations (700 mM, pH 6.8), which do not affect the wild type. The Na+ sensitivity of delta ant is pH dependent, increasing at alkaline pH. Thus at pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl retard growth of delta ant with no effect on the wild type. The delta ant strains also cannot challenge the toxic effects of Li+ ions, a substrate of the Na+/H+ antiporter system. However, growth of these strains is normal on carbon sources which require Na+ ions for transport and growth. Moreover, antiporter activity, as measured in everted membrane vesicles, is not significantly impaired. A detailed analysis of the remaining antiporter activity in a delta ant strain reveals kinetic properties which differ from those displayed by the ant protein: (a) Km for transport of Li+ ions is about 15 times higher and (b) the activity is practically independent of intracellular pH. Our results demonstrate the presence of an alternative Na+/H+ antiporter(s) in E. coli, additional to ant system."
https://openalex.org/W1568600151,"A pool of oligonucleotides encoding a start methionine and nine random amino acids was inserted at the 5′-end of the gene for the yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV lacking its own mitochondrial targeting sequence. Approximately one-quarter of the randomly generated sequences targeted subunit IV to its correct intramitochondrial location in vivo. Sequence analysis of 89 randomly generated sequences showed that their efficiencies as mitochondrial targeting signals correlated with the potential to fold into an amphiphilic α-helix. Functional targeting sequences were enriched in arginine and isoleucine residues but contained few aspartate, glutamate, and proline residues. Nonfunctional sequences predicted to have significant helical amphiphilicity often had at least one acidic or multiple helix-breaking residues that would be expected to interfere with targeting functioning. These results support the hypothesis that the signal for targeting a protein into the mitochondrial matrix is usually a positively charged amphiphilic helix."
https://openalex.org/W1544840202,"Treatment of the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase A protein with trypsin generates two large fragments which are stable to further digestion. The molecular masses of these fragments are 64 and 33 kDa, and they are shown to be derived from the N terminus and the C terminus of the A protein, respectively. These fragments could represent structural and/or functional domains within the A subunit of DNA gyrase. The trypsin-cleaved A protein (A'), in combination with the B subunit of gyrase, can support ATP-dependent supercoiling of relaxed DNA and other reactions of DNA gyrase. The isolated 64-kDa fragment will also catalyse DNA supercoiling in the presence of the B protein, but the 33-kDa fragment shows no enzymic activities. We conclude that the N-terminal 64-kDa fragment represents the DNA breakage/reunion domain of the A protein, while the 33-kDa fragment may contribute to the stability of the gyrase-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1928783644,"The m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene was transfected into and stably expressed in A9 L cells. The muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, stimulated inositol phosphate generation, arachidonic acid release, and cAMP accumulation in these cells. Carbachol stimulated arachidonic acid and inositol phosphate release with similar potencies, while cAMP generation required a higher concentration. Studies were performed to determine if the carbachol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was due to direct coupling of the m1 muscarinic receptor to adenylate cyclase via a GTP binding protein or mediated by other second messengers. Carbachol failed to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in A9 L cell membranes, whereas prostaglandin E2 did, suggesting indirect stimulation. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), stimulated arachidonic acid release yet inhibited cAMP accumulation in response to carbachol. PMA also inhibited inositol phosphate release in response to carbachol, suggesting that activation of phospholipase C might be involved in cAMP accumulation. PMA did not inhibit prostaglandin E2-, cholera toxin-, or forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor eicosatetraenoic acid and the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin and naproxen had no effect on carbachol-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Carbachol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was inhibited with TMB-8, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium release, and W7, a calmodulin antagonist. These observations suggest that carbachol-stimulated cAMP accumulation does not occur through direct m1 muscarinic receptor coupling or through the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, but is mediated through the activation of phospholipase C. The generation of cytosolic calcium via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and subsequent activation of calmodulin by m1 muscarinic receptor stimulation of phospholipase C appears to generate the accumulation of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1537090264,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2-D3) (0.1 pM to 2 nM) induces a concomitant very rapid (within 5 s) and transient release of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in enterocytes from 3-month-old rats. This high level is not maintained but declines to a lower level 60 s after stimulation. The stimulating effect is dose-dependent and biphasic with a maximum effect at 10 pM. 1,25-(OH)2-D3 induces a rapid (within 10 s) accumulation of inositol bisphosphate and its effect on inositol monophosphate is delayed (120 s). The primary action of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 is to initiate hydrolysis of phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. In contrast, 1,25-(OH)2-D3, for any of the concentrations and the incubation time periods tested, has no effect on inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol formation in enterocytes from 16-day-old rats at a time when specific binding sites for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 cannot be detected. In conclusion, the early (within 5-60 s) effects of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 on small intestinal epithelium may be mediated via the phosphoinositide transduction system and require the presence of functioning cell membrane-type receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1527514147,"Abstract The metabolism of polyphosphoinositides has been shown to be an important factor in controlling the proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The monophosphate form of phosphatidylinositol has been assumed to be phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4-P). Recent evidence from our laboratory has established that a phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase, which phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring (PI 3-kinase), is associated with many activated protein-tyrosine kinases and may play an important role in the signaling of cell proliferation (Auger, K. R., Serunian, L. A., Soltoff, S. P., Libby, P., and Cantley, L. C. (1989) Cell 57, 167-175). To determine the evolutionary conservation of this enzymatic activity, we investigated its presence in yeast. In vitro PI kinase assays of yeast cell homogenates demonstrated that PI 3-kinase activity was present. Preliminary biochemical characterization of the activity suggested that it was quite different from the mammalian enzyme yet catalyzed the same reaction, i.e. phosphorylating the D-3 hydroxyl position of the inositol ring of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol. [3H]Inositol labeling of intact yeast cells with the subsequent extraction, deacylation, and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the lipids demonstrated that PI-3-P was as abundant as the PI-4-P isomer. The conservation of the enzymatic activity from yeast to man suggests that it has an important functional role in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1569078259,"Abstract We have used a renaturation method to search for previously unidentified protein kinases in human platelets. The method involves subjecting lysates to denaturing gel electrophoresis, transferring the proteins to blotting membranes, and treating the blotted proteins with guanidine. The guanidine is then removed to allow the proteins to renature, and the blots are overlaid with [gamma-32P]ATP. We have identified 14 electrophoretically distinct, serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. Eleven of the kinases clearly differ in molecular weight from all previously described platelet serine/threonine kinases. Ten of these novel kinases (PK220, PK200, PK170, PK150, PK64, PK60, PK56, PK52, PK48, and PK40) were found to possess markedly increased in vitro activity when isolated from thrombin-stimulated platelets, presumably as a result of thrombin-stimulated covalent modification. Treatment of intact platelets with the calcium ionophore ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also increased the in vitro activity of these kinases. The agonist-stimulated kinases could be divided into three classes: 1) one kinase whose activity was increased by in vivo phorbol ester treatment but not by ionomycin (PK150); 2) two kinases whose activity was increased by ionomycin but not phorbol ester (PK48 and PK40); 3) seven kinases whose activity was markedly increased by combinations of phorbol ester and ionomycin, but not by either agent alone (PK220, PK200, PK170, PK64, PK60, PK56, and PK52). This third mode of regulation is what would be expected of enzymes that mediate the biological effects of inositide-mobilizing stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1519672169,"Deferoxamine accelerates the autooxidation of iron as measured by the rapid disappearance of Fe2+, the associated appearance of Fe3+, and the uptake of oxygen. Protons are released in the reaction. The formation of H2O2 was detected by the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of scopoletin, and the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH·) was suggested by the formation of the OH· spin trap adduct (DMPO/OH)· with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and the generation of the methyl radical adduct on the further addition of dimethyl sulfoxide. (DMPO/OH)· adduct formation was inhibited by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase. The oxidant formed converted iodide to a trichloroacetic acid-precipitable form (iodination) and was bactericidal to logarithmic phase Escherichia coli. Both iodination and bactericidal activity was inhibited by catalase and by OH· scavengers, but not by superoxide dismutase. Iodination was optimal in 5 × 10-4 M acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and when the Fe2+ and deferoxamine concentrations were equimolar at 10-4 M. Fe2+ could not be replaced by Fe3+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, or deferoxamine by EDTA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, or bathophenanthroline. These findings indicate that Fe2+ and deferoxamine can act as an oxygen radical generating system, which may contribute to its biological effects in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1499309587,"Abstract The interaction of the Epstein-Barr virus/45-kDa proteolytic fragment of C3 (C3dg) receptor (CR2) with its viral ligand, the Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein gp350/220, initiates the sequence of events leading to virus internalization and B lymphocyte transformation. Soluble recombinant receptor (rCR2) and gp350/220 as well as the natural ligand, C3dg, were subjected to a number of analytical techniques including gel permeation chromatography, density gradient ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, and electron microscopy in order to determine their hydrodynamic, structural, and binding properties. Both rCR2 and gp350/220 were found to be highly extended proteins (f/fo = 2.1 and 2.4/2.2, respectively). C3dg, in contrast to the viral ligand, is only somewhat elongated (f/fo = 1.5). Soluble rCR2, visualized by high resolution electron microscopy, was shown to be an extended, highly flexible molecule comprised of ringlet domains, each approximately 24.1 A in length, which likely correspond to the short consensus repeat motif deduced from the CR2 cDNA nucleotide sequence. Ligand-binding studies carried out under physiological conditions indicated that gp350/220 binding to rCR2 was saturable and univalent, with a dissociation constant of 3.2 nM. In contrast, monomeric C3dg did not bind to rCR2 under physiological conditions; however, at reduced ionic strength, monomeric C3dg binding could be measured. These studies indicate that the affinity of the C3dg monomer for rCR2 under physiologic conditions is approximately 10(4)-fold less than that of the viral ligand. The molecular properties of rCR2 revealed in these studies provide essential information for future studies of the biologic functions of the Epstein-Barr virus/C3dg receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1574123999,"Abstract A series of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) analogs and positional isomers was examined to explore the structure-activity relationships among IP3 5-phosphatase, IP3 3-kinase, and the release of Ca2+. All analogs with additional groups on the 2nd position of IP3 inhibited the hydrolysis of [5-32P]IP3 catalyzed by erythrocyte ghosts, with a lower Ki value than seen with IP3. IP3 dehydroxylated at the 2nd position also had a lower Ki, while 2,4,5-IP3 or cyclic(1:2), 4,5-IP3 had higher Ki values. Among these compounds 2-deoxy-IP3 was as potent as IP3 in inhibiting the phosphorylation by [3H] IP3-3-kinase in rat brain cytosol. The other compounds, except for 2,4,5-IP3 inhibited the phosphorylation, however, 2-30 times higher concentrations were required. By lowering free Ca2+, the concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition were low, while those of IP3, 2-deoxy-IP3, and positional isomers remained unchanged. These compounds acted as full agonists in releasing Ca2+ from permeabilized macrophages, although 1.6-50-fold higher concentrations than IP3 were required. These compounds also inhibited the binding of [3H]IP3 to rat cerebellum and bovine adrenal cortex microsomes, but the potencies were 2.9-33 times less than that of IP3. Thus, the 2nd position of IP3 can be modified with only a slight loss of biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1660261394,"Abstract The chemistry of oxidative deposition of iron(III) in ferritin and apoferritin is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to look for radicals formed as the hydrous ferric oxide core is developed from Fe(II) and O2. Radicals were observed indirectly by using the spin-trapping reagent N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) at room temperature and directly by measuring ESR spectra of frozen solutions at 77 K. In both instances, radical production was inhibited by the hydroxyl radical scavenging agents dimethyl sulfoxide, thiourea, and mannitol and enhanced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. These findings strongly suggest that hydroxyl radical, produced from the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction, is a by-product of core formation in ferritin and is a precursor to the observed radicals. The yield of ESR-observable and spin-trapped radicals is quite low, being at the micromolar level when millimolar concentrations of ferrous ion are employed. Furthermore, radical production appears to be confined to the interior of the ferritin molecule, where cellular components would be protected from the oxygen-derived toxic effects of iron. It is postulated that hydroxyl radical-medicated oxidative damage to the protein, a process that may contribute to the formation of hemosiderin from ferritin, leads to the observed radicals. By serving as a sink for hydroxyl radical, the protein shell may therefore efficiently minimize damage to other biomolecules in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1489597608,"The influx of Ca2+ and its subsequent intracellular increase are required for the acrosome reaction of sea urchin sperm to occur. Spermatozoa must undergo this reaction, which is triggered by the egg jelly, in order to fertilize the egg. Here, the egg jelly-induced Ca2+ influx mechanisms have been studied in sperm loaded with FURA-2 using Mn2+ under the assumption that this divalent ion is an indicator of Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels. Egg jelly induced the immediate entry of Ca2+ (mixing time 1 s), however; we found that the influx of Mn2+ increased after a lag time of 5 s. Nisol-dipine (a Ca2+ channel blocker) did not block the Mn2+ influx which was inhibited by 40 mM of external [K+], low Na+, and 5 mM of tetraethylammonium (a K+ channel blocker). These conditions also inhibited the alkalinization and the acrosome reaction. The inhibition of the Mn2+ influx could be overcome by increasing internal pH (pHi) with ammonium (10 mM). On the contrary the influx of Ca2+ during the first 5 s was not inhibited by any of the conditions indicated before, except by nisoldipine. These data could be explained by the activation of two different Ca2+ channels by egg jelly. The first one being a receptor-operator Ca2+ channel that opens when the receptor for egg jelly is occupied independently of the ionic conditions. The other one could be considered as a second messenger-operated Ca2+ channel that requires at least an increase in pHi to open."
https://openalex.org/W1490317605,"Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-resistant rickets is a human syndrome that arises as a result of heterogeneous molecular defects in the vitamin D3 receptor. Recent studies have identified single unique point mutations within the second or third exons that encode the DNA-binding domain of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in two families with this syndrome. In the experiments reported here, these mutations were introduced into the normal VDR cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutant products evaluated for hormone, nuclear, and DNA-binding characteristics. Each mutant VDR was expressed in COS-1 cells at equivalent levels, and saturation analysis of cell cytosol revealed normal affinity for the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 hormone. Incubation of transfected cells with radiolabeled hormone followed by lysis and extraction suggests a lowered salt dependence for solubilization of the mutant VDR. Concomitantly, mutant receptors exhibited reduced affinity for immobilized calf thymus DNA. While cotransfection of the wild type receptor together with a vitamin D-inducible (osteocalcin) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construction in CV-1 cells resulted in strong induction by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, neither mutant receptor was capable of directing significant activity either as a function of receptor or hormone concentration. These data suggest that the unique point mutations identified in each of these two families are responsible not only for the phenotype originally ascribed to the abnormal receptor but also severely compromise each protein's ability to activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1602636945,"Abstract The transient increase in human neutrophil cAMP levels induced by the chemoattractant N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP) is shown to be caused by amplification of adenylate cyclase response to endogenously produced adenosine. The FMLP-stimulated increase in neutrophil cAMP was potentiated markedly by a nonmethylxanthine cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Ro 20-1724). By inhibiting the degradation of newly formed cAMP, Ro 20-1724 rendered the FMLP-induced cAMP elevation persistent rather than transient. The role of endogenously produced adenosine in this phenomenon is demonstrated by the ability of either adenosine deaminase or theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, to prevent FMLP-stimulated cAMP elevation. The general nature of the FMLP-potentiated cAMP response is indicated by the finding that FMLP-treated neutrophils, in the presence of exogenously supplied adenosine deaminase, exhibited augmented cAMP generation in response to three different types of receptor agonists: 2-chloroadenosine, prostaglandin E1, and L-isoproterenol. Moreover, like the neutrophil cAMP increase caused by FMLP alone, the ability of FMLP to augment cAMP response to 2-chloroadenosine in adenosine deaminase-treated cells was short-lived and declined after 1.0 min of exposure to FMLP. Preincubation of neutrophil suspensions with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22,536 completely prevented FMLP-induced cAMP generation. Furthermore, when neutrophil suspensions were preincubated with concentrations of Ro 20-1724, which apparently maximally inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, a 30-s incubation with FMLP still resulted in substantially elevated cAMP levels. It therefore appears that FMLP raises cAMP by activating adenylate cyclase rather than inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1493171338,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine which induces cytotoxicity in some but not all tumor cells. Initial studies of five tumor cell lines demonstrated that TNF was able to rapidly (within 30 min) modulate tyrosine protein kinase activity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors on tumor cell lines which were sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TNF but not alter EGF receptor kinase activity in TNF-resistant tumor cells. Two tumor cell lines (ME-180 cervical carcinoma and T24 bladder carcinoma) which have been shown to express similar TNF-binding characteristics but differ in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic actions of TNF were chosen for further characterization. Treatment of TNF-sensitive ME-180 cells with 1 nM TNF resulted in a 3-fold stimulation of EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity within 10 min which correlated with increased phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein itself. In addition, dose-response studies indicate that similar concentrations of TNF modulate both ME-180 cell growth and EGF receptor kinase activity. Treatment of TNF-resistant T24 cells showed that TNF had no significant effect on their growth, EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity, or phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein although EGF receptor kinase activity was stimulated by EGF. Quantitation of receptors expressed on the surface of ME-180 and T24 cells demonstrated a 3-fold difference between the number of EGF-binding sites on T24 (100,000) versus ME-180 cells (300,000), suggesting the relative abundance of EGF receptor does not solely account for differential effects of TNF on EGF receptor activation in these two cell lines. Phosphoamino acid analysis of EGF receptor from 32P-equilibrated ME-180 cells demonstrated that TNF-induced phosphorylation of amino acids which was quantitatively similar to that of EGF but distinct from the effects of phorbol ester. However, unlike EGF, TNF was unable to stimulate EGF receptor kinase activity in ME-180 cell lysates. The kinetics of EGF receptor activation and the metabolic consequence of activation of EGF receptor activity by TNF appear to be distinct from those induced by EGF. These results suggest that TNF-induced modulation of EGF receptor occurs through a unique mechanism and may play a role in the cytotoxic actions of TNF."

The DNA helicase can unwind duplex regions as short as 11 base pairs in a partially duplex circular DNA substrate and does so by a strictly processive mechanism. On partially duplex linear substrates, the enzyme has a strict 5‵ → 3‵ polarity with respect to the single strand to which it binds. Nicked circular DNA is not utilized as a substrate, and the enzyme requires single-stranded gaps between 5 and 21 nucleotides long to unwind oligonucleotide fragments from partially duplex linear molecules.

Rad3 DNA helicase activity is inhibited by the presence of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts in duplex regions of partially duplex circular molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1620795530,"Abstract Neutrophils treated with 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8) are known to release large quantities of superoxide (O2-) and to exhibit an intense phosphorylation of two proteins with molecular masses of approximately 47 and 49 kDa. In this paper, we report that O2- release from guinea pig cells stimulated with a near optimal amount of DiC8 (2.0 microM) is markedly inhibited (greater than or equal to 70%) by antagonists of protein kinase C (i.e. 150 nM staurosporine; 200 microM 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (H-7], whereas that from cells stimulated with an optimal amount of DiC8 (7.8 microM) is not (approximately 25% inhibition). However, staurosporine (150 nM) effectively reduced the level of phosphorylation of the 47- and the 49-kDa proteins to that observed in unstimulated cells when either amount of DiC8 (i.e. 2.0 or 7.8 microM) was utilized. Thus, neutrophils stimulated with 7.8 microM DiC8 in the presence of staurosporine release large quantities of O2- without an enhanced phosphorylation of the 47- and the 49-kDa proteins. In contrast, these antagonists of protein kinase C effectively blocked O2- release from neutrophils stimulated with an optimal amount of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and the percentage of inhibition was not affected by increasing the concentration of PMA 160-fold. These data show that DiC8 and PMA, both activators of protein kinase C, can have distinct effects on O2- release by neutrophils. Moreover, they suggest that DiC8 (or a metabolite) under certain circumstances may function in a stimulatory pathway for O2- release that is independent of protein kinase C. Differences in the morphology of neutrophils stimulated with PMA and DiC8 are presented. Ancillary data on human neutrophils are also provided."
https://openalex.org/W1655319301,"PC12 cells are a nerve growth factor-responsive clone derived from a rat pheochromocytoma. Treatment with nerve growth factor causes the cells to differentiate. One of the hallmarks of this differentiation is the generation of neurites. PC12 cells contain both calpain I and calpain II; about 90% of the total calpain activity is due to calpain II. Treatment of the cells with nerve growth factor causes a time-dependent decrease in calpain activity, more than 50% being lost over a 5-day period. Both the decrease in calpain activity and the growth of neurites are reversible upon the removal of nerve growth factor from the cultures. Agents other than nerve growth factor that cause neurite outgrowth, such as fibroblast growth factor and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, also cause a decrease in calpain activity. Calpain levels, as detected with immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry, show no decrease. Removal of calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of the calpains, by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography increases the calpain activity of extracts from both control and nerve growth factor-treated cells and brings the activity in the extracts from treated cells up to the activity in those from controls. Calpastatin-containing fractions from extracts of nerve growth factor-treated cells inhibit more calpain activity than do comparable fractions from control cells. These studies suggest that nerve growth factor causes a decrease in the activity of calpain in morphologically differentiating PC12 cells by causing an increase in the activity of calpastatin."
https://openalex.org/W1576756117,"Abstract To investigate the activated platelet surface as a locus for factor X activation, the functional consequences of factor IXa binding to platelets were studied. The concentration of factor IXa required for half-maximal rates of factor X activation in the presence of factor VIIIa and thrombin-activated platelets was 0.53 nM, which is close to the Kd (0.56 nM) for factor IXa binding to platelets under identical conditions, determined from equilibrium binding studies. In direct comparative experiments, there was a close correspondence between equilibrium binding of factor IXa to thrombin-activated platelets in the presence of factor VIIIa and kinetic determinations of factor X activation rates. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that 125I-labeled factor IXa bound to platelets was structurally intact and did not form covalent complexes with platelet proteins. Factor IXa active site-inhibited by 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl glutamyl-glycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of factor IXa binding in the absence (Ki = 2.3 nM) and presence (Ki = 0.43 nM) of factor VIIIa and factor X and of factor X activation (Ki = 0.4 nM) by factor IXa in the presence of factor VIIIa, indicating that the generation of factor Xa is not required for factor IXa binding and that factor IXa bound to activated platelets in the presence of factor VIIIa is closely coupled with rates of factor X activation. We conclude that factor IXa bound tightly to a platelet receptor in the presence of factor VIIIa is the enzyme active in factor X activation."
https://openalex.org/W1571793897,"The purification of a Drosophila strand transfer protein is described, which involves Bio-Rex 70, Superose 6, Mono S, and single-stranded DNA-agarose chromatography. A 105,000-dalton polypeptide copurifies with the strand transfer activity on the last two column steps. The strand transferase carries out strand transfer at an unusually low protein:single-stranded DNA ratio and requires neither a nucleotide cofactor nor exogenous single-strand DNA binding protein to form heteroduplex DNA. Biochemical analysis of the reaction products has established that one strand of the DNA duplex is displaced during the reaction. Several properties, including the kinetics and stoichiometry of strand transfer, differentiate this activity from previously characterized strand transferases."
https://openalex.org/W132866068,"High performance liquid chromatography analysis of supernatants from acid-quenched [3H]inositol-labeled parotid acinar cells revealed an inositol pentakisphosphate and three inositol tetrakisphosphates. Two of the latter were identified as the 1,3,4,5 and 1,3,4,6 isomers, whereas the third was probably a mixture of unknown proportions of the 3,4,5,6/1,4,5,6 enantiomeric pair. Methacholine (100 microM) produced a 40-50-fold increase in the levels of inositol trisphosphate (mainly the 1,3,4 isomer) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, but inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate only increased 5-fold. Levels of inositol 3,4,5,6/1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate and inositol pentakisphosphate were unaffected by agonist stimulation. Thus, in parotid cells, an agonist-induced increase in both inositol trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate formation does not result in an increase in the rate of formation of inositol pentakisphosphate. Following the addition of 100 microM atropine to methacholine-stimulated parotid cells, the levels of [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate fell rapidly, returning to basal levels within 5 min. Inositol trisphosphate was metabolized more slowly and was still elevated 20-fold above basal 5 min after the addition of atropine. Inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate was metabolized much more slowly (t1/2 approximately 15 min). Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate metabolism was examined in parotid homogenates as well as in 100,000 x g cytosolic and particulate fractions. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated. Two inositol tetrakisphosphate products were formed, namely the 1,3,4,6 and 1,3,4,5 isomers. Over 90% of both kinase and phosphatase activities were found in the cytosolic fractions. The ratio of activities of kinase to phosphatase decreased as the levels of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate substrate were increased from 1 nM to 10 microM. These data led to the conclusion that the kinetic parameters of the inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate kinases and phosphatases are such that in stimulated cells, dephosphorylation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate is greatly favored. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate kinase activity was potently inhibited by inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (IC50 = 0.1-0.2 microM), which leads us to propose that inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate is an endogenous inhibitor of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1519499225,"Abstract The calcium dependence of growth factor-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization was determined in serum-deprived human fibroblasts (WS-1 cells). Intracellular pH (pHi) and intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) were measured using the fluorescent dyes 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and fura2, respectively. Thrombin (10 nM) induced an alkalinization (0.18 +/- 0.01 pH units, n = 23) that was Na+-dependent and amiloride-sensitive, suggesting that the alkalinization was mediated by the Na+/H+ exchanger. Thrombin treatment caused a transient increase in Ca2+i (325 +/- 39 nM, n = 12) that preceded the observed increase in pHi. The increases in Ca2+i and pHi were dependent on the concentration of thrombin. The thrombin-induced increase in Ca2+i occurred in the absence of external calcium indicating that thrombin released calcium from internal stores. Inhibition of the thrombin-induced increase in Ca2+i with 8-diethylaminooctyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride or bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'- tetraacetic acid also inhibited the thrombin-stimulated increase in pHi. The calcium ionophore ionomycin was used to increase Ca2+i independent of growth factor stimulation. When Ca2+i was elevated with ionomycin, a concomitant increase in pHi was observed. The increase in pHi due to ionomycin was dependent on Na+ and sensitive to amiloride. The removal of external Ca2+i inhibited the ionomycin-induced elevation of both Ca2+i and pHi. The ionomycin-induced increases in Ca2+i and pHi were not inhibited by 8-diethylaminooctyl 3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzoate hydrochloride. The results suggest that thrombin treatment can activate the Na+/H+ exchanger, and this activation is mediated by an increase in Ca2+i."
https://openalex.org/W1584439768,"Abstract Type IV collagenase (gelatinase) has a marked substrate specificity for denatured collagen (gelatin). Cleavage site specificity of type IV collagenase from human skin was determined using small collagenous peptides with varied sequences around Gly-Leu or Gly-Ile. Type IV collagenase showed essentially the same order of preference for the peptide substrates as did interstitial collagenase. Both required a peptide with a minimum of six amino acid residues to demonstrate significant gelatinolytic activity and were able to cleave uncharged molecules more rapidly than charged molecules. the repeating Gly-X-Y-Gly sequence of collagen is not an absolute requirement for either enzyme since both digested AcPro-Leu-Gly-Ile-Leu-Ala-Ala-OC2H5 at 70% of the rate of the best substrate peptide, AcPro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Leu-Gly-OC2H5. Km and kcat (Vmax) values were determined for several of the peptides and for the native substrate. Turnover numbers with type IV collagenase were similar to those with interstitial collagenase (Weingarten, H., Martin, R., and Feder, J. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 6730-6734). However, the Km for all peptides investigated was approximately 10-fold lower for type IV collagenase than for interstitial collagenase. Because type IV collagenase does not cleave helical interstitial collagens, the data support the conclusion that secondary structure determines whether the peptide bond can be hydrolyzed at any potential cleavage site."
https://openalex.org/W1554276067,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), a recently described phospholipid, has been linked to polyoma virus-induced cellular transformation and platelet-derived growth factor-mediated mitogenesis. PtdIns(3)P, in contrast to phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), is resistant to hydrolysis by bovine brain phospholipase C gamma. We present here the identification of a phosphomonoesterase activity from the soluble fraction of NIH 3T3 cells which removes the phosphate from the D-3 position of PtdIns(3)P. This enzyme is specific as it has little or no activity on the monoester phosphates of PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or inositol 1,3-bisphosphate and is tentatively designated phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase (PtdIns 3-phosphatase). The enzyme does not require added metal ions for activity and is maximally active in the presence of EDTA. It is inhibited by Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and the phosphatase inhibitor VO4(3-). In addition, there is no phospholipase C activity toward PtdIns(3)P in the soluble fraction of NIH 3T3 cells. In view of the absence of a phospholipase C activity that hydrolyzes PtdIns(3)P, we propose that PtdIns(3)P is not a precursor for a soluble inositol phosphate messenger but that it instead may act directly to control certain cellular processes or as a precursor for other phosphatidylinositols. PtdIns 3-phosphatase may thus terminate a metabolic signal or regulate precursor levels for other phosphatidylinositols that are phosphorylated in the D-3 position."
https://openalex.org/W1829571684,"Abstract Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is shown to be a partial agonist of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in differentiated U-937 cells. The data that support this conclusion are: 1) LTE4 completely displaced [3H]LTD4 from its receptors in U-937 cell membranes. 2) LTE4 induced only 30 +/- 4% of the maximal Ca2+ transient induced by LTD4 in the presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca2+ and 60 +/- 4% of the maximal LTD4 response in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. 3) LTE4 induced only a fraction of the inositol phosphates metabolized by LTD4. Moreover, LTE4 resulted in essentially no production of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate isomer, while LTD4 induced a rapid and substantial transient increase in this isomer. The generation of inositol phosphates by both agonists was unaffected by extracellular Ca2+. 4) The EC50 values for Ca2+ mobilization for LTD4 and LTE4 corresponded with their affinity (Kd values) for the LTD4 receptor. 5) A series of structurally diverse LTD4 receptor antagonists blocked the Ca2+ mobilization responses to LTD4 and LTE4 with identical rank orders of potency. 6) LTE4 acted as an antagonist of LTD4 of potency. 6) LTE4 acted as an antagonist of LTD4 effects when they were coadministered. 7) LTE4 and LTD4 acutely desensitized Ca2+ mobilization to each other. All of the effects of LTE4 are explained by its partial agonist activity at the LTD4 receptor as shown by the following data. 1) Neither LTD4 nor LTE4 had any effect on the agonist activity of fMet-Leu-Phe, LTB4, or platelet-activating factor. 2) None of the above agonists or antagonists to the above receptors affected any of the activities of LTD4 or LTE4. 3) Neither LTD4 nor LTE4 induced desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization to any of the non-LTD4 receptor agonists tested. 4) Under the conditions studied, we have not observed any evidence of multiple subclasses of LTD4 receptors in U-937 cells. LTE4 is a partial agonist of the LTD4 receptor, because it can only couple the LTD4 receptor to a portion of the signaling system available to the receptor when occupied by LTD4. Specifically, LTD4 caused the activation of receptor-operated calcium channels, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, the activation of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C, and the liberation of an additional, as yet undefined, intracellular mediator. To do this, LTD4 receptors couple to at least two and perhaps more guanine nucleotide binding proteins. LTE4 is unable to activate the phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C but can mimic the other effects of LTD4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1512955585,"Abstract Vascular endothelial cells previously have been shown to possess a prominent Na-K-Cl cotransport system which mediates a K+ influx of approximately 20 mumols/g of protein/min. Endothelial cell cotransport has also been shown to be regulated by a variety of vasoactive agents and their second messengers, suggesting that the transport system may have an important role in endothelial cell function. In the present study we investigated the possibility that the high level of cotransport in these cells is due to a large number of Na-K-Cl cotransporters in the plasma membrane. This was done by evaluating specific saturable binding of [3H]bumetanide to cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. We found a maximal [3H]bumetanide binding of 0.83 pmol/mg protein with a dissociation constant of 0.13 microM. From these data, the number of [3H]bumetanide binding sites/endothelial cell was determined to be approximately 230,000, and the turnover number for cotransport activity was calculated to be 300 K+ ions/site/s. These findings indicate that endothelial cells do indeed exhibit a large number of Na-K-Cl cotransporters/cell relative to other cell types. We also investigated the effects on [3H]bumetanide binding of agents known to modulate Na-K-Cl cotransport activity. Saturable binding of [3H]bumetanide was found to be reduced significantly by treatment of the cells with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, phorbol esters, norepinephrine, or rat atriopeptin III, all of which have been shown to inhibit Na-K-Cl cotransport-mediated K+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1597477702,"Abstract Type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'D-II) catalyzes the intracellular conversion of thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), producing greater than 90% of the bioactive thyroid hormone in the cerebral cortex. In cultured glial cells, expression of this enzyme is cAMP dependent. Exploiting the cAMP-dependent nature of this enzyme in these cells and utilizing N-bromoacetyl-L-3'- or 5'-[125I]thyroxine (BrAc[125I]T4) to affinity label cellular proteins, a 27-kDa protein with the properties of this enzyme was identified. Intact cells labeled with BrAc[125I]T4 showed three prominent radiolabeled bands of proteins of Mr 55,000, 27,000, and 18,000 (p55, p27, p18, respectively) which incorporated approximately 80% of the affinity label. All three affinity-labeled proteins were membrane associated. One protein (p27) increased 5-6-fold after treating the cells for 16 h with dibutyryl cAMP; maximal specific incorporation of affinity label into the stimulated p27 was approximately 2 pmol/mg of cell protein in intact cells. Alterations in the steady-state levels of 5'D-II resulted in parallel changes in the quantity of p27. In cell sonicates, the rate of enzyme inactivation by BrAcT4 equaled the rate of affinity label incorporation into stimulated p27, whereas p55 and p18 showed little or no specific dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated labeling. Enzyme substrates T4 and 3,3'5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) specifically blocked p27 labeling, whereas T3 and the competitive 5'D-II inhibitor EMD 21388 (a synthetic flavonoid) were much less effective. Iopanoate, an inhibitor of all deiodinase isozymes, was ineffective in blocking p27 labeling. Inhibition kinetics revealed that iopanoate was a noncompetitive inhibitor of dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated glial cell 5'D-II, suggesting that it interacts at a site distant from the substrate-binding site. These data identify a cAMP-inducible membrane-associated protein (p27) that has many of the properties of 5'D-II."
https://openalex.org/W2098128352,"Abstract A guanine nucleotide-dependent P2Y-purinergic receptor-regulated phospholipase C activity of turkey erythrocyte membranes has been characterized in detail previously (Boyer, J. L., Downes, C. P., and Harden, T. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 884-890). The occurrence of agonist-induced desensitization of this receptor-regulated phospholipase C is now described. Preincubation of turkey erythrocytes with the P2Y-purinergic receptor agonist ADP beta S resulted in a marked loss of capacity of ADP beta S plus GTP to stimulate phospholipase C in membranes derived from these cells. The half-time of occurrence of desensitization was 0.5-2.0 min, and within 10 min responsiveness had reached a new quasi-steady state level representing 40-55% of control. Transfer of agonist-preincubated erythrocytes to agonist-free medium resulted in recovery of agonist plus GTP responsiveness of the membrane phospholipase C activity to control levels with a half-time of 10-20 min. The change in ADP beta S plus GTP responsiveness occurred as a loss of maximal effect with little or no change in the apparent affinity of agonist for stimulation of inositol phosphate production. Induction of desensitization occurred with an agonist-specificity that followed that expected of a P2Y-purinergic receptor. Neither the rate of activation nor the final phospholipase C activity attained in the presence of GTP gamma S alone was altered in membranes from cells preincubated with ADP beta S for 15 min. AlF-4-stimulated inositol phosphate production was also not modified in membranes from agonist-preincubated erythrocytes. In contrast, the capacity of ADP beta S to increase the rate of activation of phospholipase C by GTP gamma S was markedly reduced in membranes from agonist-preincubated cells. The amount of 3H-radioactivity in phosphoinositides, as well as the ratio of labeling among the phosphoinositides, was not altered by incubation of erythrocytes with a P2Y-purinergic receptor agonist. Taken together these data suggest that P2Y-purinergic receptor agonist-induced desensitization occurs as a consequence of a modification at the level of the receptor or at the level of receptor-guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein) coupling with no change occurring in the capacity of the G-protein to activate phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W186488978,"The mechanism of N-dealkylation by peroxidases of the Ca2+ indicator quin2 and analogs was investigated and compared with the mechanism of N-dealkylation of some N-methyl-substituted aromatic amines. Nitrogen-centered cation radicals were detected by ESR spectroscopy for all the compounds studied. Further oxidation of the nitrogen-centered cation radicals, however, was dependent upon the structure of the radical formed. In the case of quin2 and analogs, a carbon-centered radical could be detected using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide. By using the spin trap 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (tert-nitrosobutane), it was determined that the carbon-centered radical was formed due to loss of a carboxylic acid group. This indicated that bond breakage most likely occurred through a rearrangement reaction. Furthermore, extensive oxygen consumption was detected, which was in agreement with the formation of carbon-centered radicals, as they avidly react with molecular oxygen. Thus, reaction of the carbon-centered radical with oxygen most likely led to the formation of a peroxyl radical. The peroxyl radical decomposed into superoxide that was spin trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and an unstable iminium cation. The iminium cation would subsequently hydrolyze to the monomethyl amine and formaldehyde. In the case of N-methyl-substituted aromatic amines, carbon-centered radicals were not detected during the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of these compounds. Thus, rearrangement of the nitrogen-centered radical did not occur. Furthermore, little or no oxygen consumption was detected, whereas formaldehyde was formed in all cases. These results indicated that the N-methyl-substituted amines were oxidized by a mechanism different from the mechanism found for quin2 and analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1511578136,"The formation and metabolism of inositol pentakis-and hexakisphosphates (InsP5 and InsP6) were investigated in Xenopus laevis oocytes. After [3H]inositol injection, [3H]InsP5 and subsequently [3H]Insp6 increased progressively over 72 h. In intact oocytes, [3H]InsP5 was progressively converted to [3H]InsP6 from 6 to 72 h of incubation and was not metabolized to lower inositol phosphates. In contrast, [3H]InsP6 remained unmetabolized for up to 72 h. These data are consistent with the kinetics of the increases in [3H]InsP5 and [3H]InsP6 in [3H]inositol-labeled oocytes. The highly phosphorylated inositols showed significant changes during oogenesis and maturation. In oocytes incubated for 48 h after [3H]inositol injection, the radioactive incorporation into polyphosphoinositols increased progressively from stage 3 to stage 6, with 5- and 6-fold rises (cpm/mg protein) for [3H]InsP5 and [3H]InsP6, respectively. These developmental changes were associated with 5-fold increases in [3H]inositol tetrakisphosphate between stages 3 and 6 of oogenesis. Induction of oocyte maturation by progesterone (1 microM) during the last 12 of a 36-h incubation with [3H]inositol doubled the levels of [3H]InsP6 relative to [3H]InsP5, suggesting that the activity of inositol pentakisphosphate kinase increases during maturation. These results provide direct evidence for metabolic conversion of InsP5 to InsP6 in animal cells and show that the higher inositol polyphosphates, unlike the lower phosphoinositols, are extraordinarily stable. These species increase markedly during ovum development and may play a regulatory role in oogenesis and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1567503172,"Previous studies have indicated that Factor IX/IXa interacts in a specific and high affinity manner with a binding site on the endothelial cell surface. In this study, the contributions of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing (GLA) and growth factor domains to the finding of Factor IX to the endothelium were assessed. While GLA-containing peptides from Factors IX, X, and prothrombin were inhibitors of 125I-Factor IX-endothelial cell binding, the GLA peptide from Factor IX was about 250-800-fold more effective than those from prothrombin and Factor X, respectively. In contrast to its relative efficacy as an inhibitor of Factor IX-cell surface interaction, the Factor IX-GLA peptide neither bound to lipid vesicles nor inhibited Factor IX-lipid interaction. A synthetic peptide comprising the entire first epidermal growth factor (EGF) exon was also an inhibitor of 125I-Factor IX-endothelial cell binding, although it did not interact with lipid vesicles. Experiments with synthetic peptides comprising each of the three loops of the first EGF domain or the entire first EGF region with specific substitutions indicated the importance of determinants in both the first and probably third loops for Factor IX-endothelial interaction. In contrast, the second loop of the first EGF domain and the first loop of the second EGF exon are probably not involved in Factor IX-endothelial interaction based on their inability to block 125I-Factor IX binding to cells. These results indicate that determinants in both the GLA and the first EGF domain contribute to the specific binding of Factor IX to the endothelial cell surface and that structural requirements for Factor IX-cell surface interaction are distinct from those for Factor IX binding to lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1576532373,"Abstract Bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase was examined spectroscopically for the presence of covalently bound pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). Pure dopamine beta-hydroxylase had a featureless UV-visible spectrum above 300 nm. An equimolar solution of dopamine beta-hydroxylase and exogenously added PQQ (1 PQQ/active site) had a strong absorption maximum at 333 nm. Dialysis removed the added PQQ, indicating that dopamine beta-hydroxylase does not bind PQQ irreversibly. Reaction of dopamine beta-hydroxylase with 6 mM phenylhydrazine in the presence of 15 mM ascorbate caused 96% inactivation within 20 min and did not produce any spectrally detectable amounts of the phenylhydrazone adduct of PQQ, as reported by van der Meer et al. (van der Meer, R.A., Jongejan, J.A., and Duine, J.A. (1988) FEBS Lett. 231, 303-307). The peptide profile of phenylhydrazine inactivated dopamine beta-hydroxylase was monitored at 316 nm and did not reveal any peptides that might contain a PQQ-phenylhydrazone adduct. Thus, the absence of any spectrally detectable PQQ-phenylhydrazone adducts under these conditions demonstrates that the mechanism of phenylhydrazine inactivation does not involve covalent modification of PQQ at the active site of dopamine beta-hydroxylase and provides strong evidence that the native enzyme does not contain PQQ."
https://openalex.org/W1578126317,"Abstract This study is a direct continuation of Jensen, J., and Norby, J. G., (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18063-18070. A new model in which we propose that the in situ organization of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit is an alpha 2-dimer and which describes the stepwise degradation by radiation inactivation of this assembly is presented on the basis of the following findings. Radiation inactivation size for alpha-peptide integrity, normal nucleotide, vanadate and ouabain binding, and K-pNPPase activity is close to m(alpha) = 112 kDa; for Na-ATPase activity it is 135 kDa and for Na,K-ATPase activity it increases from 140 to about 195 kDa with increasing assay ATP concentration (equal to increasing average turnover). Normal Tl+ occlusion had the same radiation inactivation size as Vmax for Na,K-ATPase, i.e. about 195 kDa. The binding experiments disclosed radiation-produced molecules with active binding sites but with a lower than normal affinity. Radiation inactivation size for the total binding capacity of ADP and ouabain was therefore smaller than the size of an alpha-peptide, namely about 70 kDa, and for total Tl+ occlusion it was down to 40 kDa. We can explain all these observations by using a new approach to target size analysis and by assuming a dimeric organization of the alpha-subunit. Each alpha-peptide is degraded stepwise by first destruction of either a 42- or a 70-kDa domain, and the partly damaged peptide may retain biochemical activity. We conclude that there is no role for the beta-subunit in catalysis and that the alpha-peptide is organized as an alpha 2-dimer in the membrane with each alpha-subunit being able to perform complete catalytic cycles (and probably also active transport), provided that it is stabilized by an adjacent alpha-peptide or a sufficiently large fragment thereof."
https://openalex.org/W1537251789,"Abstract Ligand binding studies indicate that 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (AGEPC) down-regulates its own receptors on the plasma membrane of isolated rat Kupffer cells but has no significant effect on the binding affinity of the receptor for AGEPC. Exposure of isolated rat Kupffer cells to 10(-8) and 10(-6) M AGEPC resulted in a rapid, time-dependent reduction in the number of cell surface AGEPC receptors to a new steady state concentration (54.1 +/- 5.0% and 38.6 +/- 5.4% of control, respectively). During the observation period (6 h), the half-time of surface AGEPC receptors was about 60 and 45 min in the presence of 10(-8) and 10(-6) M AGEPC, respectively. Both the rate of loss and the maximal loss of the receptors were dependent upon the AGEPC concentration. With receptor synthesis inhibited by cycloheximide in the absence of AGEPC, the half-time of the surface AGEPC receptor was about 4 h, suggesting that AGEPC receptors are not recycled and that the loss of AGEPC receptors from the plasma membrane is accelerated by AGEPC binding. When incubated with Kupffer cells at 37 degrees C for 3 h, 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1.0 microM), an inactive metabolite of AGEPC, did not cause the loss of AGEPC receptors. Under the same conditions, AGEPC antagonists such as BN52021 (2 x 10(-5) M) or U66985 (2 x 10(-5) M) alone had no effect (97.0 +/- 3.9% of control for BN52021) or only a relatively slight effect (78.4 +/- 1.8% for U66985) on the number of surface AGEPC receptors. However, AGEPC antagonists inhibited the AGEPC-induced down-regulation of AGEPC receptors in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the AGEPC-induced down-regulation of AGEPC receptors is a receptor-mediated process. The AGEPC-mediated decrease in receptor number on rat Kupffer cells is reversible. Upon removing AGEPC from the culture medium, about 67% of the lost receptors were replaced within 2 h. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, prevented the restoration of the AGEPC receptors. Similar results were obtained when Kupffer cells were incubated with Pronase followed by removing Pronase and reincubating the cells with or without cycloheximide. These observations suggest that the restored AGEPC receptor is newly synthesized rather than recycled. The present study demonstrates that under non-stimulatory (i.e. in the absence of AGEPC) conditions AGEPC receptors are lost from the plasma membrane and are reformed in the cells continuously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1593514411,"Abstract Selective seeding of bone marrow by intravenously transplanted hemopoietic cells depends on the homing receptors of these cells. The receptors are membrane lectins with galactosyl and mannosyl specificities. To purify these lectins, cell membrane was fractionated from two cloned multipotential (B6STU) and bipotential (FDCP-1) hemopoietic progenitor cells. The membrane was solubilized and its proteins were labeled with 125I. The proteins were subjected to affinity column chromatography using galactosyl and mannosyl groups linked to agarose beads. Elution with D-galactose or D-mannose led to specific elution of a single sharp radioactive peak which constituted a constant fraction of membrane proteins. This peak was studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linking technique and appeared to have a Mr of 110,000. Under reducing conditions, it consisted of two components with a Mr of 87,000 and 23,000. Treatment with endoglycosidase F indicated about 5% carbohydrate content. Purification of these homing receptors has opened an avenue for the development of immunologic and molecular biologic probes that may help further elucidate the mechanism of homing regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1601378049,"In eukaryotic cells ubiquitin is synthesized as a polyubiquitin protein or as a protein fused at the carboxyl terminus to other polypeptides. An enzyme activity, ubiquitin protein peptidase, has been proposed to process these precursors by cleaving the peptide bond between adjoining ubiquitin molecules or between ubiquitin and the fused peptides. Using the cleavage of a 35S-labeled yeast ubiquitin protein fused to a synthetic 38-residue peptide obtained by in vivo metabolic labeling in Escherichia coli in an expression system based on the interaction of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and its promoter, it is possible to detect a processing activity in soluble yeast extract. The specificity of the cleavage suggests this activity could be the in vivo processing activity for various ubiquitin precursor proteins in yeast cells. A similarly labeled ubiquitin protein fused to one cysteine residue was also utilized to detect an activity capable of removing a single cysteine residue from ubiquitin in a soluble extract. Employing assays based on the cleavage of labeled ubiquitin protein fusions, a ubiquitin protein peptidase activity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified about 15,000-fold to yield a protein mixture consisting of only a few protein species. The major protein band which comigrated with the activities in in vitro assays has an apparent molecular weight of 29,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two other protein species, about 20,000 and 10,000 in molecular weight, also comigrated with the in vitro activities throughout the purification procedure. Though our most purified protein fraction was shown to cleave various artificial ubiquitin protein fusions under our experimental conditions, it cannot cleave a ubiquitin dimer protein, suggesting the existence of functionally distinct ubiquitin protein peptidases. Our experimental protocol for preparing various labeled ubiquitin protein precursors provides a means to explore various processing enzymes existing in cells. The same protocol may also be adapted to prepare substrates for the study of other specific protein processing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1509416155,"Three rat L1 element integration (target) sites chosen at random can adopt non-B DNA structures in vitro at normal bacterial superhelical densities. These target sites contain, respectively, short, mixed (AT)n tracts that we show can form one or more cruciforms, short (GT)n tracts, or polypurine:polypyrimidine regions. These sites share no sequence homology, and a non-B DNA structure appears to be the only feature common to them all. When the right end of the L1Rn3 element which forms a complex series of non-B DNA structures including two triplexes, and its target site which undergoes cruciform extrusion, are present on the same supercoiled molecule, they compete for available supercoil energy. The amount of non-B DNA formed at each site varies with pH, the concentration of cations, and the size of the topological domain. The implication of our findings for recombination of L1 elements and for the effect of these elements on contiguous DNA sequences is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1603006522,"Abstract Secondary amine mono-oxygenase from Pseudomonas aminovorans catalyzes the NAD(P)H- and dioxygen-dependent N-dealkylation of secondary amines to yield a primary amine and an aldehyde. Heme iron, flavin, and non-heme iron prosthetic groups are known to be present in the oligomeric enzyme. The N-dealkylation reaction is also catalyzed by the only other heme-containing mono-oxygenase, cytochrome P-450. In order to identify the heme iron axial ligands of secondary amine mono-oxygenase so as to better define the structural requirements for oxygen activation by heme enzymes, we have investigated the spectroscopic properties of the enzyme. The application of three different spectroscopic techniques, UV-visible absorption, magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance, to study eight separate enzyme derivatives has provided extensive and convincing evidence for the presence of a proximal histidine ligand. This conclusion is based primarily on comparisons of the spectral properties of the enzyme with those of parallel derivatives of myoglobin (histidine proximal ligand) and P-450 (cysteinate proximal ligand). Spectral studies of ferric secondary amine mono-oxygenase as a function of pH have led to the proposal that the distal ligand is water. Deprotonation of the distal water ligand occurs upon either raising the pH to 9.0 or substrate (dimethylamine) binding. In contrast, the deoxyferrous enzyme appears to have a weakly bound nitrogen donor distal ligand. Initial spectroscopic studies of the iron-sulfur units in the enzyme are interpreted in terms of a pair of Fe2S2 clusters. Secondary amine mono-oxygenase is unique in its ability to function as cytochrome P-450 in activating molecular oxygen but to do so with a myoglobin-like active site. As such, it provides an important system with which to probe structure-function relations in heme-containing oxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W1481259039,Abstract The trans-acting transcriptional factor p40tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) can activate expression not only of its own viral genes but also of other viral and cellular genes. We examined the cis-acting sequences in the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer required for its activation by HTLV-I p40tax. Experiments with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs bearing the SV40 enhancer elements revealed that p40tax-dependent transactivation of the SV40 enhancer is mediated through the C element that contains the typical sequence for binding of a nuclear factor NF-kappa B. Activation of the C element by p40tax was seen in a limited set of cell lines as was also seen with the whole enhancer of SV40. Binding of NF-kappa B or NF-kappa B-like factor to the SV40 C element increased when p40tax was expressed. The fact that HTLV-I p40tax utilizes a cellular regulatory mechanism to transactivate the SV40 enhancer in a cell-dependent manner may have implications for the pathogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia.
https://openalex.org/W1538954313,"Abstract UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucose-1-phosphotransferase (Glc-phosphotransferase) catalyzes the transfer of alpha-Glc-1-P from UDP-Glc to mannose residues on acceptor glycoproteins. The predominant acceptor for this transfer in both mammalian cells and Paramecium is a cytoplasmic glycoprotein of 62-63 kDa. When cytoplasmic proteins from rat liver were fractionated by preparative isoelectric focusing following incubation of a liver homogenate with the 35S-labeled phosphorothioate analogue of UDP-Glc ([beta-35S]UDP-Glc), the acceptor was found to have a pI of about 6.0. This fraction, when not labeled prior to the focusing, became very heavily labeled when mixed with [beta-35S]. UDP-Glc and intact liver microsomes, a rich source of the Glc-phosphotransferase. In addition, it was observed that the isoelectric fractions of the cytosol having pI values of 2-3.2 contained a degradative activity, alpha-Glc-1-P phosphodiesterase, that was capable of removing alpha-Glc-1-P, monitored through radioactive labeling both in the sugar and the phosphate, as an intact unit from the 62-kDa acceptor. Identification of the product of this cleavage was substantiated by its partial transformation to UDP-Glc in the presence of UTP and UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase. The alpha-Glc-1-P phosphodiesterase had a pH optimum of 7.5 and was not effectively inhibited by any of the potential biochemical inhibitors that were tested. Specificity for the Glc-alpha-1-P-6-Man diester was suggested by the diesterase's inability to degrade UDP-Glc or glucosylphosphoryldolichol. This enzyme may be important in the regulation of secretion since the alpha-Glc-1-P present on the 62-kDa phosphoglycoprotein appears to be removed and then rapidly replaced in response to secretagogue."
https://openalex.org/W1510160475,"Activation of cardiac muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) on cultured chick heart cells results in a decrease in cellular cAMP levels and a stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown. A serum-free culture system has been used to investigate the regulation of mAChR number and function by purified serum high density lipoprotein (HDL). Administration of HDL purified from rooster serum to chick heart cells cultured in defined medium results in an attenuation of the ability of muscarinic agonist to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, with no change in its ability to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis or to mediate down-regulation of receptor number. The inclusion of HDL in the culture medium did not result in appreciable changes in mAChR number or affinity, nor were the levels of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) altered. However, the ability of guanine nucleotides to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was reduced by HDL treatment, suggesting that HDL interferes with the capacity of G-proteins to interact with adenylate cyclase. In order to determine which component of native HDL mediates the decreased effectiveness of carbachol, the ability of lipid and apoprotein fractions to mimic the effect of HDL was tested. HDL lipid fractions were able to mimic the effect of native HDL, while protein fractions were not. This result suggests that the ability of HDL to attenuate muscarinic receptor function is mediated by its lipid constituents. The effect of HDL and HDL lipid fractions were not correlated with changes in membrane cholesterol content."
https://openalex.org/W1539823336,"Abstract We present a quantitative kinetic model for the transient velocity (microM of cGMP hydrolyzed/s) response of retinal rod outer segment (ROS) cGMP phosphodiesterase (v(t) versus t) to a stimulating light pulse in the linear response range. The model gives an excellent fit to experimental v(t) versus t data for ROS suspensions at different concentrations of GTP and GDP and clarifies experimental results which are difficult to understand in the absence of such a model. It contains the minimum number of steps required to fit our experimental data and consists of one rate-limiting step with specific rate kL for the production of active phosphodiesterase (PDE), PDE*, by photoactivated rhodopsin, R*, and deactivation processes for R* and PDE* with lifetimes tau R and tau P, respectively. The experimental graphs of v(t) versus t at each concentration of GTP and GDP are characterized by a fast rise to a peak value, vpeak, followed by a slow decay to zero level. The minimal kinetic model allows us to characterized completely the effects of GTP and GDP, and any other pertinent species, in terms of their effects on the parameters kL, tau R, and tau P. Our kinetic model indicates that for washed ROS preparations (a) the risetime of v(t) is determined by tau P which has a value of about 2 s and is insensitive to [GTP]. (b) The decay of v(t) is determined by tau R which decreases with [GTP] and has a value greater than 300 s at low [GTP] and a limiting value of 50 s at high [GTP]. We attribute the greater than 300 s lifetime to the complex R*G (where G is ROS G protein) and the 50-s lifetime to free R*. (c) The rate kL increases hyperbolically with [GTP] with a half-maximal value of 56 microM and kL.max = 22-45 s-1. (d) Peak velocity is given by the expression vpeak alpha kL tau P which is consistent with the dependence of kL on [GTP] and the experimental finding that vpeak varies hyperbolically with [GTP]. The minimal model has also allowed us to (a) develop clear definitions of amplification for the light-triggered enzymatic cascade and (b) clarify experimental methods for measuring gain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1603724822,"Abstract In the accompanying article (Schmidt, J.A., and Yguerabide, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19790-19803), we presented a minimal quantitative kinetic model with one rate-limiting step for the transient response of rod outer segment (ROS) phosphodiesterase (PDE) to stimulating light pulses of low fractional bleach (linear response range) and showed that the model was in excellent quantitative agreement with experimental results. The model characterizes the PDE response in terms of the specific rate constant of the rate-limiting step, kL, the lifetime of photoactivated rhodopsin, tau R, and the lifetime of activated PDE, tau P, but makes no predictions on how these kinetic parameters should depend on the concentrations of the various reactive species involved in the PDE response to light and does not reveal the nature of the rate-limiting step. However, we established by curve fitting experimental data to theoretical expressions from the model that kL increases hyperbolically with [GTP], tau R decreases with [GTP], and tau P is independent of GTP. In this report we present three detailed kinetic models which make specific quantitative predictions on how the kinetic parameters of the minimal model should depend on nucleotide and G protein concentrations and test the models against experimental data. Each model consists of one rate-limiting step. The first detailed model postulates that the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of R*GT into R* and GT (T stands for GTP). The second model postulates that the rate-limiting step is the binding of GTP to R*G, and the third model postulates that the rate-limiting step is the encounter rate of R* and G on the ROS disc membrane. We find that only the first detailed model is consistent with the experimental results as characterized by the minimal model. Using this detailed model we (a) define kL and tau R in terms of more fundamental equilibrium and rate parameters, (b) develop a theory for the systematic evaluation of amplification or gain of the PDE light response from light-stimulated GTP-binding data as well as v(t) versus t graphs, and (c) clarify methods which have been used in the past to evaluate gain experimentally."
